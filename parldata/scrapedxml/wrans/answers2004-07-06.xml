	<p pid=".618W.0/1">In 1983, the Black advisory group was commissioned by the Government to investigate reports of a high incidence of leukaemia occurring in young people living in the village of Seascale, three kilometres from the Sellafield nuclear site and the suggestion that there might be an association between the leukaemia incidence and the radioactive discharges from Sellafield. The advisory group confirmed that there was a higher incidence of leukaemia in young people resident in the area but also concluded that the estimated radiation dose from the Sellafield discharges and other sources, received by the local population, could not account for the observed leukaemia incidence on the basis of knowledge available at that time. The uncertainties in the available data led the advisory group to make recommendations for further research.. The committee on medical aspects of radiation in the environment (COMARE) was established in November 1985 in response to the final recommendation of the report of the independent advisory group chaired by Sir Douglas Black (Black, 1984). Its terms of reference are to:</p>

	<p pid=".619W.0/1">Lack of clear and accurate information for young people about sexual health is one of the key factors contributing to the high rates of unintended teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. The teenage pregnancy strategy produces materials for young people through the &quot;RU Thinking&quot;? information campaign, to enable them to make informed, responsible choices. These materials are tested with young people and parents and are available for local teenage pregnancy strategies to disseminate in relevant community settings for young people. The choice of the most appropriate venues to reach young people is for local discretion, and no information is held centrally on this.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.0/2">In addition, the Department has funded the national &quot;Sex Lottery campaign&quot;, which aims to raise awareness of sexually transmitted infections and promote safer sex among the 18 to 30 age group. Campaign materials are carefully targeted at this older audience and are not directly promoted for use in schools. Evaluation indicates that the campaign is effective in changing behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.0/3">At local level it is the responsibility of primary care trusts to provide sexual health services, including sexual health promotion, to meet the needs of their local populations. The Department has published guidance on good practice in sexual health promotion, which includes guidance on working with young people, to support them in this role&mdash;Effective Sexual Health Promotion, June 2003, available at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">www.dh.gov.uk</a>. Information is not held centrally on local safer sex materials produced at local level or how these are distributed and evaluated.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.0/4">In respect of the suitability of materials used in schools, under the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) sex and relationships education (SRE) guidance, schools remain under a firm obligation to use materials that are in accordance with both the personal social and health education framework and the law. Teachers and schools, in consultation with parents, must use their professional judgment to ensure that pupils are protected from teaching and materials that are inappropriate, having regard to the age and cultural background of the pupils concerned. The Government does not promote or endorse specific classroom materials.</p>

	<p pid=".619W.3/2">Production of smokies, which are singed carcases of sheep and goats, mainly sheep, with skin attached, is not permitted by European Union food safety legislation, which requires all sheep and goat carcases to be completely flayed as part of the dressing process. Trade in such products is therefore illegal.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.3/3">The Food Standards Agency (FSA), which is responsible for food safety legislation in the United Kingdom, is aware of the existence of an illegal trade in smokies, particularly to certain ethnic communities, but does not hold data on the size of the trade.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.3/4">The FSA collects information about foodborne disease, but information about health problems arising from the consumption of smokies is not collected separately. No outbreaks associated with the consumption of smokies have been reported to the Health Protection Agency (HPA) communicable disease surveillance centre. In addition to this, case control studies conducted by the HPA and the former Public Health Laboratory Service have not identified smokies as a risk factor for sporadic infection.</p>
	<p pid=".619W.3/5">Because of the potential public health risks posed by illegally produced smokies, the FSA has commissioned research to determine whether smokies can be produced safely. The research aims to investigate whether a hygienic procedure and acceptable meat inspection is possible when producing sheep carcases with the &quot;skin-on&quot;. If such procedures could be identified, the FSA may consider seeking changes to European Union legislation to permit such production. Results of the research should be available by November 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".620W.2/23">1. In 2001, the National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) was introduced for all official statistics and surveys. It replaces Social Class based on occupation and Socio-Economic Group (SEG). There is no longer a manual/non-manual split in the NS-SEC, however, the old socio-economic groupings have been recreated in order to continue monitoring the Cancer Plan target.</p>
	<p pid=".620W.2/24">2. In 2000, the decision was made to weight the data to compensate for under representation of people in some groups. The table shows weighted and unweighted data for 1998 to give an indication of the effect of weighting. Caution should be exercised when comparing weighted data for 2000 onwards with unweighted data for previous years.</p>

	<p pid=".624W.11/1">The regulations to bring the selling of insurance into the scope of FSA regulation implement the European Union's Insurance Mediation Directive. The Directive requires the UK to regulate everyone who sells general insurance. This includes those firms where the selling of insurance is an &quot;incidental&quot; part of the firm's business. The Government have no discretion to exclude insurance in particular sectors, such as the property and construction sector from regulation. The only exclusions the Directive permits are limited to extended warranties costing less than &euro;500 per annum and travel insurance sold as part of a package with a holiday.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.11/2">The Government have consulted widely on the regulatory regime, publishing a public consultation document including draft regulations and a draft regulatory impact assessment in October 2002. Following analysis of the responses to the consultation, Parliament approved legislation on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-24">24 June 2003</phrase>. The activities to be regulated are: introducing, proposing or carrying out other work preparatory to the conclusion of contracts of insurance; assisting in the administration and performance of such contracts, in particular in the event of a claim; and concluding contracts of insurance. In drawing up its rules for insurance mediation, the FSA has carried out extensive public consultations and cost benefit analyses on its rules. Further information is available from the FSA's website, <a href="http://www.fsa.gov.uk">www.fsa.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.11/3">In implementing the Directive, the Government have sought to work closely with interested parties to develop an approach which is proportionate and which meets our obligations under European law. In drawing up its rules, the FSA has carried out public consultations and cost benefit analyses. Both the FSA and the Government have been careful to take account of the impact on small businesses. For example the FSA sets fees according to the volume of business that a firm undertakes, with application fees being lowest for the smallest firms.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.11/4">The Government have held detailed discussions with a range of organisations regarding implementation of the Directive. Bodies representing the property and construction sectors have been aware of the Directive for some time. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) had initial discussions with the FSA a year ago and recently approached the Treasury with more detailed concerns. My officials met with representatives from the RICS to discuss these concerns and we are carefully considering the issues raised.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.11/5">For operational purposes, the FSA estimates 20,000 new firms will apply for direct authorisation as a result of the introduction of the new regulatory regimes for mortgages and general insurance. Secondary intermediaries in the general insurance market represent about 40 per cent. of the forecast population.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.11/6">To date FSA has received 6,786 applications from firms applying to conduct insurance related activities, of which 2,693 are from secondary intermediaries. Of these around 80 per cent. are from the motor sector and the remainder from the retail and services sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.11/7">FSA consultation papers are publicly available on the FSA website and hard copies are available on request from the FSA. The FSA have ensured that all consultation publications on the regulation of mortgage firms and insurance intermediaries, including CP174, have been supported with an introductory 'newsletter'. Copies of the newsletters were mailed via relevant current voluntary regulators, trade associations and insurance product providers to approximately 28,500 intermediaries and potentially affected firms. The FSA also held several seminars, at no cost to attendees, around the UK which included an overview of our consultation and a questions and answer session.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.11/8">With respect to CP174, there is a list of non-confidential respondents to the CP at Annex 1 to Policy Statement 174, published in September. This is available on the FSA website. When firms participate in surveys such as the one carried out for the CP174 Cost Benefit Analysis the FSA gives the firms a guarantee of confidentiality.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.11/9">The diversity of interest and needs among the Mortgage and General Insurance population means that trade associations and other industry groups' role in developing the awareness of their members is critical, which is why the FSA have worked closely with such groups. The FSA has made contact with every group it has identified as affected by regulation. For more than a year, the FSA have been running an extensive communications strategy for firms incorporating press and media work, advertising, direct mail, a website, speaking programme, industry training, trade association liaison and production of a suite of guidance materials.</p>

Some children under 14 who are above average size will still not benefit from relief, but their measurements will be largely indistinguishable from those of many adults.</p>

	<p pid=".628W.5/1">There are four main reasons for testing cattle for bovine TB:</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/2" class="indent">1. Routine testing of cattle herds for surveillance purposes. This is done at intervals ranging from one to four years depending on the incidence of TB in cattle herds in each parish.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/3" class="indent">2. Testing of all animals in a herd at 60-day intervals, following the disclosure of TB and in order to regain the officially TB free status. This is followed by testing at six and 18 months after the withdrawal of TB restrictions, in order to check that the herd has remained free from TB.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/4" class="indent">3. Ad hoc testing can be instigated at any time by the DVM in order to check the status of entire herds following, for instance, confirmation of TB in contiguous cattle herds, culture positive RTA badger carcases, suspected cases of TB found during routine meat inspection or where TB is traced back from cattle movements into a herd where TB has been confirmed.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.5/5" class="indent">4. Testing of individual animals (inconclusive reactors, imported cattle and forward traced animals from infected herds).</p>

	<p pid=".628W.8/1">It has been a legal requirement in the UK since 1977 for labels giving fuel economy information to be fixed to all new cars on display in showrooms. More recently, requirements for the labelling of passenger cars were introduced into UK law in the form of regulations implementing EU Directive 1999/94/EC. These regulations require a label to be displayed on all new car models in showrooms, listing their CO <sub>2</sub> emissions performance and fuel consumption. Manufacturers must also include these same figure in all printed adverts, brochures and manuals.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.8/2">The European Commission is currently in the process of reviewing Directive 1000/94/EC. As part of this review, it has commissioned consultants to evaluate the effectiveness of the Directive's current provisions. This review may conclude that the Directive should be amended to require the labels to have an A-G style format, similar to that already used in labels on some electrical goods. The UK has made clear to the European Commission that it would favour such an approach.</p>
	<p pid=".628W.8/3">In parallel, the UK Government has asked the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership (LowCVP) to develop a proposal for a voluntary UK car labelling scheme, with an A-G style energy efficiency format. The Government hopes that the Partnership will reach agreement on the scope and format of such a label later this year. This would allow a new A-G style energy efficiency label for passenger cars to be introduced in the UK on a voluntary basis during 2005, as an interim measure in advance of any similar mandatory EU label.</p>

	<p pid=".629W.2/1">The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 protects all wild birds including the cormorant. This Act implements the EC Wild Birds Directive in Great Britain. There are no plans to review the protected status of the cormorant.</p>
	<p pid=".629W.2/2">However, we have accepted for some time that cormorants can and do cause damage to certain fisheries. For this reason the Department issues individual licences under Section 16 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to allow cormorants to be killed or taken as an aid to scaring. It is our firm intention, and the legislation requires, that licences will not be issued to applicants who have not tried all reasonable non-lethal methods (such as refuges) to resolve problems. However, despite seeking alternative solutions, problems do persist in certain areas which is why we are actively considering measures that could help fishery owners and angling clubs deal with the increasing problem of predation by cormorants.</p>
	<p pid=".629W.2/3">Deliberations are at an early stage but will include a basic review of the licensing system which may result in further limited and controlled killing of cormorants to aid scaring but without compromising the conservation status of the cormorant.</p>

Part of the package put forward by the UK and agreed by other member states is that the monitoring programme and the product stewardship emission reduction programme be regularly audited and monitored, with the programme lasting six years with a possible extension to 10 years if necessary. The published risk assessment would be reviewed in light of any relevant new data in this monitoring period. Any future risk reduction action resulting from this new data and associated restrictions would be discussed and agreed. The UK Government supports both these initiatives.</p>

	<p pid=".631W.8/1">The Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 (the PPC Regulations), which implement the 1996 EC Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC), apply to large intensive livestock installations with more than 40,000 places for poultry, 2000 places for production pigs, or 750 places for sows. IPPC will ensure that the environmental impacts of these farms are assessed and minimised. New farms must apply for a PPC permit before they can carry out their operations and existing farms must apply for a permit by <phrase class="date" code="">31 January 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".631W.8/2">Regulators are required by statute to recover their costs from the operators they regulate. In England and Wales, the Environment Agency has made a particular effort to lower the cost of regulation through the development of an 'off the shelf' permit for farmers, provided that they can comply with &quot;Standard Farming Installation Rules&quot;. In the period 2004&ndash;05, the standard fee for a PPC permit application is 3,024. Once a permit is issued, the Environment Agency will charge an annual subsistence fee to cover the costs incurred in assessing compliance and maintaining the permit. These fees are 2,095 for a standard permit holder or 2,626 for the largest farms (more than 400,000 poultry, 20,000 production pigs, or 7,500 sows). For the purposes of the permit application, some farmers may decide to employ consultants to help them to complete the necessary records, audits and plans. The Standard Farming Rules, which were developed in consultation with industry, are based on &quot;Best Available Techniques&quot; (BAT) that aims to balance the cost to the operator against the benefits to the environment. Some of these techniques may be expensive, particularly for those older farms that have suffered from lack of capital investment in recent years. The changes will be sought through improvement conditions established on a farm-by-farm basis, at timescales agreed between the Environment Agency and the farmer.</p>

	<p pid=".634W.2/1">The Department has not made any detailed estimates by year of the industry's needs for new HGV drivers. But it is recognised that the key change in the need for HGV drivers will result from the introduction of EU working time legislation for road transport. In our regulatory impact assessment published last October we estimated that this will require around 12,000 extra drivers.</p>
	<p pid=".634W.2/2">We have discussed the impact of the directive with representatives from the unions, the trade bodies and other key stakeholders in the road transport sector, and our plans for implementing the Directive were the subject of a full consultation exercise. Through the Road Haulage Forum we have been discussing with the industry the wider issues about recruitment and retention of HGV drivers, and the Government continues to fund projects to help the industry raise the profile of the profession and improve its image.</p>

	<p pid=".634W.5/1">The information is not readily available in precisely the form requested. Two tables have been placed in the Libraries of the House. The first table shows committed SRA funding for RPP schemes between 2002&ndash;03 and 2004&ndash;05, and the total value of funding committed for these schemes by other sponsors. SRA funding for some of these schemes will continue beyond 2004&ndash;05. 44 bids were deferred by the SRA due to the suspension of the RPP fund in January 2003. These were bids that were under consideration by the SRA but which had not yet been approved. The SRA has accepted no new bids for RPP funds since it suspended the scheme in January 2003. However, funding started for a number of schemes in 2003&ndash;04. These were schemes that had been approved by the SRA before January 2003 and which the SRA subsequently contractualised.</p>
	<p pid=".634W.5/2">The second table shows all schemes to date that were abandoned after having been approved by the SRA. In addition, the SRA has rejected 45 bids where funding was sought between 2002&ndash;03 and 2004&ndash;5. In some case bids can be rejected before they pre-qualify.</p>
	<p pid=".634W.5/3">Schemes might be abandoned or rejected for a number of reasons including withdrawal of the bid by the sponsor, failure to meet the SRA's value for money and affordability criteria or failure to secure adequate third party sponsorship.</p>

Much of this is domestic expenditure, although the provision of food and other goods through the public distribution system involves imports from outside Iraq.</p>

DFID does not have aggregated data on the nationality of firms that have won contracts for these projects, but some details of the recipients of contracts are available on the CPA website (<a href="http://www.cpa-iraq.org">www.cpa-iraq.org</a>).

With rising poverty and unemployment, the food security situation has considerably deteriorated over the past three years. Food insecurity is a reality for 40 per cent. of the population and a considerable worry for a further 30 per cent. who are under threat of becoming food insecure should current conditions persist. People's access to food and farmers ability to produce food have been severely affected by restrictions on the movement of people and goods and the damages to personal property.</p>

We have, however, given popular and successful schools a presumption that they can expand, whether there are surplus places in the area or not. Surplus places may represent a poor use of resources, particularly where schools perform poorly. One consideration for LEAs is whether the resources used to fund empty places would be better deployed to fund further places in popular and successful schools.</p>

Home Office figures show that over the 10 years, 1993&ndash;2002, the average annual number of prosecutions for all types of bribery under these Acts, whether in the public or private sector, was 21. We do not keep a record of the persons bribed. While there has been only one reported Appeal Court case concerning a prosecution for bribery of a foreign public official (Raud, 1989 Crim LR 809), in the period it is not necessarily the most recent case of its kind. Also, cases involving bribery may give rise to other charges. The prosecution of the bribery of foreign public officials has to be viewed in this context.</p>

The deployment of officers to this area, primarily covertly, is undertaken as part of the operational activities of these specialist units, and it is not an issue on which guidelines have been issued to forces by government.</p>
	<p pid=".658W.12/2">The International Virtual Global Task Force, launched in December 2003, is a partnership of law enforcement agencies from the UK, US, Australia, and Canada, which aims to target those who search for images of child abuse on the internet. In June it announced its intention to actively monitor chatrooms with a visible police presence where they consider paedophiles are likely to target children.</p>
	<p pid=".658W.12/3">From 2000&ndash;01 to 2004&ndash;05 the policing provision for England and Wales has increased by over &pound;2.3 billion. There are now record numbers of police officers. It is not government policy to fund the police service for individual activities they undertake, but rather for chief officers to take practical decisions on how they allocate the additional resources and manpower we have made available to them. We fully support effective intelligence led policing and welcome the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) proposals to make better use of intelligence and existing centres of expertise to help forces effectively investigate those who abuse children using the internet.</p>

	<p pid=".661W.3/1">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary does not believe that it would be appropriate to use the Royal Prerogative of Mercy in these cases. Given the passage of time there would be a number of practical difficulties and in any event free pardons are designed to redress injustice and in general their use relies on innocence being established.</p>
	<p pid=".661W.3/2">Although he does not feel able to recommend the use of the Royal Prerogative in these cases the Home Secretary believes that it would be appropriate for the Government to recognise and mark in some way the contribution that the women's suffrage movement made to bring about greater equality in political and public life and to the development of our democracy as we currently know it. He has therefore asked officials to look into and consider an appropriate way in which this might be achieved.</p>

	<p pid=".662W.0/1">Our support for people who want to start up their own business is targeted at long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged groups.

	<p pid=".662W.0/2">This support includes an awareness session, a period of supported business planning with a business expert, and up to 26 weeks of supported 'test trading' where participants can operate their business with expert support yet still have the safety net of receiving their benefits in the form of a training allowance. In 2003, over 11,000 people were supported to 'test trade' their business through the New Deals and Work Based Learning for Adults.</p>
	<p pid=".662W.0/3">We play an active role across government to ensure there is coherence in the support Government provides in promoting enterprise. We were key contributors to &quot;A Government Action Plan for Small Business&quot; published last year, which sets out our strategy for promoting enterprise.</p>
	<p pid=".662W.0/4">We have been working closely with the Small Business Service to ensure there is a nationally available minimum standard of provision to support potential entrepreneurs, including those not eligible for Jobcentre Plus programmes. In addition, we are working in partnership with the Prince's Trust Youth Business Programme and the Small Business Service on the production of a pre-start-up leaflet that signposts potential entrepreneurs to the range of government support available, as well as a national award scheme that recognises the significant barriers long term unemployed people have overcome to become successful entrepreneurs.</p>
	<p pid=".662W.0/5">Both products will be launched to coincide with Enterprise week in November. Jobcentre Plus Districts will all be involved in initiatives during Enterprise week to highlight their support for people who may be interested in exploring self employment as an option.</p>

	<p pid=".666W.6/1">A study was commissioned in 2003 on the potential cost and benefit of implementing EC Directive 2001/84/EC on the Resale Right for the Benefit of an Author of an Original work of Art (Droit de Suite). This was received just before Christmas 2003 and focuses on the number and value of sales of modern and contemporary art handled by the auction houses in the 2001&ndash;02 season (August 2001 to July 2002). The data will be used in the preparation of a draft Regulatory Impact Assessment, on which comment will be invited from interested parties and the public as part of the consultation process regarding implementation of the directive.</p>

	<p pid=".668W.2/1">Both the DTI and Ofgem have been involved in a number of initiatives aimed at improving the position of smaller generators.</p>
	<p pid=".668W.2/2">With regard to the Balancing and Settlement Code, Ofgem has considered and approved a number of modifications. For example, a revision of the definition of the System Buy and Sell Prices has significantly reduced the spread of imbalance prices and thus the risk to which smaller generators in particular are exposed. Modifications have also been made to National Grid Transco's charging methodology, which now allows &quot;embedded benefits&quot; to be paid directly to generators in certain circumstances, which again will particularly benefit smaller generators. In this area, it is primarily the role of the Balancing and Settlement Code Panel to assess the impact of measures, and for industry participants to bring forward modifications to the code if they are considered unsatisfactory.</p>
	<p pid=".668W.2/3">In the context of the future British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements, the DTI and Ofgem have recognised the special position of smaller generators through the provision of a discount for small transmission-connected generators in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".668W.2/4">More generally, the Distribution Commercial Forum, which is facilitated by Ofgem, is responsible for assisting industry participants in improving the governance framework of the existing distribution connection and use of system arrangements. The Distribution Generation Working Group&mdash;jointly chaired by Ofgem and DTI&mdash;is looking at ways in which the barriers to the connection of smaller-scale generation can be removed, and their contribution to the system in terms of losses, contribution to security and other embedded benefits can be fully recognised. Both of these forums therefore play assessment roles vis-&agrave;-vis the position of smaller generators.</p>

	<p pid=".669W.2/1">The Department does not make estimates of gas import needs for individual sectors such as power stations. The most recent assessment of gas import needs for the whole economy can be found in the fourth report of the DTI-Ofgem Joint Energy Security of Supply working group which can be accessed at: <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/jess/jessreport4.pdf">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/jess/jessreport4.pdf</a>. This report suggests that perhaps 40 per cent. of our gas needs will be imported by 2010 and 80 per cent. or more by 2020. But the actual extent of import dependency is inevitably uncertain. In its recently published 17th report (&quot;Gas: Liberalised Markets and Security of Supply&quot;, HL Paper 105), the House of Lords European Union Committee has asserted that the UK will be importing around 50 per cent. of its gas requirements by 2010 and around 70 per cent. in 2020.</p>

	<p pid=".672W.2/1">The Energy White Paper does not set specific targets for the more efficient use of heat. However, we can expect to see an increase in small-scale, distributed heat and electricity generation.</p>
	<p pid=".672W.2/2">Space heating and hot water account for 80 per cent. of energy use in households, and over half of energy use in the service sector. The Government's Energy Efficiency Action Plan, published in April 2003, sets out measures that the Government expects to deliver savings of over 12 million tonnes of carbon (MtC) by 2010, with a formal aim to achieve savings of 4.2 MtC in households by 2010. This represents savings of around 10 per cent. of total non-transport carbon emissions.</p>
	<p pid=".672W.2/3">Combined heat and power (CHP) is the simultaneous generation of usable heat and power (usually electricity) in a single process. The Government's CHP Strategy, also published in April 2003, sets out a framework to support the growth of CHP capacity in the UK. The Government's target is to achieve 10GWe of Good Quality CHP electrical capacity by 2010.</p>

Some &pound;11 million has been spent on actions which needed to be taken immediately, for example to support the automotive supply chain.

	<p pid=".673W.2/3">In addition, &pound;22 million has been agreed to create three High Tech corridors to attract and develop more high tech and high value added businesses. We also agreed an overall sum of &pound;2 million to kick-start initiatives in the North Staffordshire area. &pound;10 million was made available to Advantage West Midlands to buy a strategic site in Birmingham for future industrial development. &pound;42 million has been provided for good quality Regional Selective Assistance projects in the region and some &pound;5 million of the &pound;129 million total is not yet allocated to specific projects.</p>
	<p pid=".673W.2/4">From the total &pound;129 million, &pound;49 million has been spent as at the end of March 2004. &pound;4 million has been allocated to MG Rover as described as follows. MG Rover Group have been offered assistance in the following two areas:</p>
	<p pid=".673W.2/5" class="indent">A grant of up to &pound;9 million under the Learning and Skills Act 2000 towards the cost of employee training and development, of which &pound;4 million is from Rover Task Force funding and the balance from European funds.

	<p pid=".682W.0/1">The land referred to belongs to the Department of the Environment (DOE). It was purchased in 1987 to facilitate a Roads Scheme. On completion of the scheme a considerable area was undeveloped and surplus to requirements. The Belfast Regeneration Office (BRO) took the lands for a social development project, but their remit changed and the project did not proceed. At the time of devolution, it was agreed that DOE would retain the land and the Environment and Heritage Service was assigned responsibility for it while BRO continued to act for the Department in taking forward the disposal. In line with procedures for the disposal of surplus land, expressions of interest were sought. The application from Habinteg Housing Association, supported by the Department for Social Development, was accepted subject to planning permission being secured.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.0/2">The proposal, comprising two planning applications that were both accompanied by an Environmental Statement, is still under consideration by Planning Service. The land in question is not classified as a protected landscape. It is currently identified as open space in Belfast Urban Area Plan (2001) and the Lisburn Area Plan (2001). However, although Planning Policy Statement 8 affords protection to existing or proposed open space, the policy does also allow for the loss of open space in specific circumstances. Issues such as open space, biodiversity, wildlife and the Ulster Way will all be carefully considered as part of the planning process, which includes consultation with relevant bodies.</p>

	<p pid=".683W.0/1">Subject to the approval of both Houses of Parliament, it is expected that the Order will be considered by the Privy Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-27">27 July</phrase>. Certain enabling provisions will come into operation seven days after the Order is made.</p>
	<p pid=".683W.0/2">However, the substantive provisions, including those provisions making it an offence to keep a dangerous wild animal without a licence, will be brought into operation by way of a commencement order, to be made by the Department of the Environment. This is considered necessary, in the interests of public safety, to ensure that all operational arrangements required for the effective operation and enforcement of the legislation are in place and to allow for the preparation of guidance and standards for prospective licence holders. I expect it to take three months for this work to be completed and the licence provisions brought into operation. Thereafter, existing owners will have a further period of 90 days to apply for a licence, during which time they may continue to keep the animal.</p>
