The range of technologies included under the microgeneration umbrella; the different stages of their development; and the fact that the overall industry is in a formative stage makes it difficult to quantify the future costs and benefits of microgeneration.</p>

	<p pid="a.1928W.0/1">The Government have introduced a number of measures to help working parents and parents with disabled children participate within the labour force.</p>
	<p pid="a.1928W.0/2">The Employment Act 2002 gave parents more choice and flexibility in balancing work and family life; extending the period of maternity leave and pay, introducing paid paternity and adoption leave for the first time, and providing the right to request flexible working. The scope of the flexible working law is wider for parents of disabled children, enabling requests to be made up until the child's 18th birthday. This recognises the particular challenges these parents face in balancing work and caring responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1928W.0/3">The flexible working law has been a success. Almost a quarter (22 per cent.) of those employees eligible to make a request have done so in the last two years, and over this period the proportion of requests being refused has declined by half. Due to the small proportion of employees with disabled children it is difficult to assess the specific impact on this group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1928W.0/4">The Government have provided support and guidance to a number of organisations, including those who have an interest in parents of disabled children, such as Contact a Family. This is to ensure that these families are able to fully benefit from the opportunities that the measures provide, and help them find the right working patterns and employment to suit their needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1932W.3/1">Negotiations on the draft Directive on Services in the Internal Market are at an early stage. Until the text is finalised it is difficult to assess its precise effects. DTIs Partial Regulatory Impact Assessment for the proposal can be found at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/ccp/topics2/pdf2/servicesria.pdf">www.dti.gov.uk/ccp/topics2/pdf2/servicesria.pdf</a>. An independent consultancy, Copenhagen Economics, has assessed the economic impact of the Directive. They predicted that the Services Directive would add &pound;25 billion to the EU economy, create an extra 600,000 jobs, boost EU GDP by 0.6 per cent. and lead to an increase in real wages of 0.4 per cent. Copies of both documents are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1934W.11/1">The Department introduced the Telephone Preference Service scheme, under the Telecommunications (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 1999, which provides protection to subscribers from unsolicited direct marketing calls. Although the Telephone Preference Service was not designed to provide a solution to silent calls, consumers who register receive significantly fewer marketing calls, including silent calls that are made by commercial power diallers. Marketing calls are the only calls which are eliminated by registering for this service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1934W.11/2">The Communications Act 2003 confers powers on the Office of Communications (Ofcom) to regulate forms of behaviour, which fall within the Act's definition of persistent misuse of an electronic communications network or service. Silent calls made by commercial power diallers are an example of behaviour, which might represent persistent misuse. Ofcom took action against two companies on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-30">30 April 2004</phrase>, which were found to have generated unacceptably high levels of unsolicited silent calls. Ofcom initiated a second investigation into one of the companies to ascertain whether the company is complying with the undertakings that were given following their initial action. In addition, Ofcom has launched an investigation into a further seven companies, whom they suspect were making silent calls.</p>
	<p pid="a.1934W.11/3">The Department is in discussions with Ofcom about providing a solution to silent calls and in particular a policy of introducing recorded messages to inform recipients of silent calls of what has happened. We will carefully consider all aspects of this possible solution.</p>

	<p pid="a.1936W.5/1">Refurbishment and maintenance at 10 Downing street is part of a continuing programme of work. The Downing street complex is maintained to standards appropriate to its Grade 1/2 listed status in consultation with English Heritage. The building also fulfils an important representational role.</p>
	<p pid="a.1936W.5/2">For details of maintenance, decorating and otherwise improving 10 and 11 Downing street between May 1997 and 2000&ndash;01, I refer the hon.

	<p pid="a.1936W.5/15">The expenditure in 2001&ndash;02 was partly attributable to the installation of comfort cooling across the complex. It also covered maintenance, conversion of rooms into office accommodation, modernising of a meeting room, replacement of the water tank, replacement staircase carpeting and the continuing upkeep of the State Rooms. Only a small proportion relates to work on the Prime Minister's personal accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1939W.5/1">Competitive tendering is one of several policy initiatives that the Government are exploring in order to achieve greater value for money across the Criminal Defence Service as a whole. This will help to ensure that legal aid resources can be more effectively focused on the vulnerable individuals and groups supported by the Community Legal Service.</p>

	<p pid="a.1939W.8/1">Improving the quality of service for clients is a key objective of the Legal Services Commission (LSC). All firms wishing to bid for a contract under the price competitive tendering project will have to pass a quality assessment. Once a contract is awarded, the LSC will employ quality assurance mechanisms to monitor the quality of advice being provided throughout the term of the contract. Among those quality assurance mechanisms currently under consideration are peer review and file assessment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1943W.8/1">Manufacturing remains vital to the Welsh economy and we want to see a successful manufacturing sector producing high value-added products.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943W.8/2">We are working in partnership with industry, trade unions, regional development agencies, and other stakeholders to deliver the Government's Manufacturing Strategy launched in May 2002, and reviewed in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943W.8/3">It sets out the actions, such as the Manufacturing Advisory Service, up-skilling the workforce, and R and D tax credits, needed to create a high value, high skill manufacturing sector capable of introducing new products and processes into our economy and creating new markets to deliver a boost to our prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943W.8/4">This is complemented by a range of measures administered by the Assembly Government to assist the manufacturing sector. These include financial assistance, business advice, promoting innovation e.g. the Technium programme through to initiatives to improve skills and promote entrepreneurship.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943W.8/5">In respect of Sony, the job losses announced recently are regrettable. The Assembly Government with its Team Wales partners, including the Welsh Development Agency (WDA) Elwa and Jobcentre Plus are already working with the company to find alternative employment for those affected. I have also discussed with the Sony Group chairman and chief executive, Sir Howard Stringer, the possibility of further investment at the Pencoed plant and Sir Howard has assured me that he will look into this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943W.8/6">As regards Christie Tyler, specific assistance has already been offered to the receivers through the WDA, to identify prospective purchasers for the businesses through the Agency's extensive network, both in the UK and overseas. Any leads that are identified are being immediately passed to the receivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943W.8/7">Part of Christie Tyler group, Cambria Mobel in Pontypridd, has now been sold on a solvent basis to Sofa Brands International, safeguarding the jobs under threat. In addition to this, I understand Management Buyouts (MBO) are being looked at for other parts of the group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943W.8/8">Despite the recent losses, unemployment in Wales is now 4.5 per cent. compared to 8.3 per cent. in 1997, and I am encouraged by the progress that is being made.</p>

	<p pid="a.1944W.8/1">Better Governance for Wales (Cm 6582) describes the circumstances in which the Government would consider a referendum. Paragraph 3.24 says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1944W.8/2" class="indent">the decision to hold one would need to be approved in both Parliament and the Assembly. If one was proposed by the Assembly Government, the motion would need to be endorsed by two thirds of all Assembly Members voting in favour. If the Secretary of State was minded to table an Order in Parliament, he would first be obliged to undertake such consultation as he considered appropriate. The referendum would not take place unless the Order was approved by Parliament.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.1951W.2/1">Mortality rates of mammals can only be determined from long term, intensive studies. Only two such studies exist on badgers, both in southern England (Woodchester Park, Gloucestershire, and Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire). Mortality rates at these sites varies from year to year in relation to weather conditions and hence food availability. Cub mortality is thought to be relatively high, both pre-emergence from the sett, and also up to the end of the first year. At Woodchester Park, where TB status is also recorded for each animal trapped, the average mortality rates foruninfected adult animals were 30.4 per cent. for males and 23.6 per cent. for females. For the small proportion of animals which had a history of more than one positive test for TB, mortality was 66.7 per cent. and 48.0 per cent. for males and females respectively. Overall at Woodchester, the average mortality is thought to be about 50 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1951W.2/2">It is important to note that these studies are in high density populations, and therefore cannot be extrapolated to the country as a whole. Mortality rates will be different from these in lower density locations. In a study of suburban badgers in Bristol, mortality rates were 40.3 per cent. for adult females, and 28.1 per cent. for adult males.</p>
	<p pid="a.1951W.2/3">Other studies have estimated that approximately 50,000 badgers are killed on roads each year, making it the most important cause of death.</p>

When testing resumed In 2002, resources were concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had e longer period In which to contract the disease.

	<p pid="a.1955W.0/2">Obtaining population estimates for mobile species such as cetaceans is difficult. According to scientific advice recently published by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, dolphins <i>Delphinus delphis</i> present in south-west waters form part of a single genetic population in the North East Atlantic. Although no single abundance survey has been carried out for this area, scientific work base don surveys for various parts of the North East Atlantic suggests a population of the order of 380,000 animals. Similarly, the harbour porpoise <i>Phocoena phocoena</i> is widely distributed in all waters around the UK. The 2002 report of the Advisory Committee on Ecosystems of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ECES) estimated 36,280 harbour porpoise in south-west waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1955W.0/3">A consortium of international researchers, co-ordinated by the Sea Mammal Research Unit, is currently carrying out a second SCANS survey of the distribution and abundance of small cetaceans&mdash;particularly harbour porpoises, bottlenose dolphins <i>Tursiops truncates</i> and common dolphins. The survey area is intended to cover the shelf waters of the Atlantic margin, the North sea and adjacent waters. The UK contributed &pound;275,000 to this project. The results of the second SCANS survey should be available by the end of 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.1956W.8/1">The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) has developed the Rural Land Register (RLR) from paper based maps used to support subsidy claims. From 2002 to 2004 land was digitised from area aid applications received from farmers. All prospective subsidy applicants have to apply to RPA to have their land registered. Currently RPA has received 18,114 requests for new land registrations. To date there have been 94,801 land registrations or applications for land registration and of these 89,678 or 94 percent. of applicants and previous subsidy claimants have been sent digitised maps.</p>
	<p pid="a.1956W.8/2">It is a requirement of Environmental Stewardship (ES) for farmers to have their land registered on the RLR. RPA has been prioritising land registration and modifications to existing land registration requests associated with prospective ES applications. However, a proportion of potential applicants have encountered delays in entering the ES. The original deadline for the first application window was extended and monthly start dates have been introduced for the entry level strand of ES to minimise the impact.</p>

	<p pid="a.1957W.0/2">These vaccines are used in conjunction with a number of other measures relating to hygiene, biosecurity and management to help protect the hens against certain strains of salmonella of public health significance, In Great Britain a large proportion of the flocks producing eggs for human consumption are vaccinated against salmonella. Vaccination against salmonella of flocks producing eggs for human consumption is one of the requirements of the British Egg Industry Council operated Lion Code. The members operating to the Lion Code produce around 80 per cent. of the eggs in Great Britain. A number of producers who are not members also vaccinate their flocks against salmonella.</p>
	<p pid="a.1957W.0/3">There is no statutory requirement to vaccinate flocks producing eggs against salmonella. The producer will decide on vaccination of the flock depending on individual circumstances and veterinary advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1957W.0/4">In other countries flocks producing eggs for human consumption may or may not be vaccinated against salmonella. Some countries have a statutory requirement to vaccinate flocks against salmonella, and in others the vaccination of flocks producing eggs for human consumption is not permitted. In some countries the situation is similar to Great Britain, where vaccination may be carried out on a voluntary basis. Imported eggs may therefore come from flocks which have been vaccinated against salmonella in some cases and not vaccinated against salmonella in others.</p>

Funding has been provided to develop supply chains throughout the UK to supply energy crops to all types of energy end-users. A UK-wide grant scheme is developing dedicated biomass heat, combined heat and power, and electricity generation projects, particularly those fuelled by energy crops. Recent changes to the rules on co-firing of biomass with fossil fuel in conventional power stations give longer timescales for the use of biomass. This makes co-firing with energy crops a more attractive option for both farmers and power generators. The Biomass Study Task Force, led by Sir Ben Gill, which is to report later this year, is working with stakeholders to identify the barriers to developing biomass energy and will recommend ways to overcome the problems.</p>

The most significant problems for the adoption of higher mesh sizes is in mixed fisheries where fish of different sizes are caught together.

	<p pid="a.1961W.8/1">Defra has overall policy responsibility for flood and coastal erosion risk in England, funds most of the Environment Agency's activities in this area and provides grant aid on a project by project basis to the other flood and coastal defence operating authorities (local authorities primarily) to support their investment in improvement works.</p>
	<p pid="a.1961W.8/2">The Environment Agency is the principal authority responsible for management of flood risk. The agency allocates funding to stretches of river and areas at risk of flooding rather than to parliamentary constituencies. Since 1997 the agency has spent &pound;3.78 million in the Reading, East constituency mainly on the reconstruction of two weirs, namely Caversham on the River Thames and Blakes Lock on the River Kennet. An additional average of about &pound;25,000 a year has also been spent on general maintenance of watercourses in the Reading, East constituency. Much of this work has been keeping the channel clear of debris such as supermarket trolleys and vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.1961W.8/3">Defra has not provided grant aid for improvement projects to local authorities in the constituency during this period although they may have received some support for their own spend on flood risk management through the Office of the Deputy Prime Ministers local government finance mechanism.</p>
	<p pid="a.1961W.8/4">Total Government funding has increased from &pound;310 million per year in 1996&ndash;97 to &pound;570 million. We plan to maintain this level up to 2007&ndash;08 (the last year of the current spending review period with its real value being maintained by efficiency savings in the agency.</p>

The information requested has not been recorded centrally and I regret I am not able to answer the question without incurring disproportionate cost. However I did write to all Members in February to notify them of projects approved and/or completed since May 1997 in the counties in which their constituencies are located together with the cost of the projects.

	<p pid="a.1963W.0/2">The assessment of genetically modified (GM) materials for use in animal feed is conducted on a case by case basis and involves the scrutiny of a range of data relevant to the material for which approval is being sought, including results from animal feeding studies. There is no requirement for the data provided for assessment to be peer-reviewed and published in the scientific literature, although in many cases data has been through this process. Nevertheless, the evaluation of the application dossiers by expert panels involves detailed and independent scrutiny of the data. GM crops are only considered for approval if they are judged by the expert assessors to meet strict safety criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.1964W.6/1">The provision of an aggregated response across all business areas in Defra, covering all management consultancy engagements, would be a major administrative exercise which would give rise to disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1964W.6/2">Defra engages management consultants across its entire business, with the sole purpose of providing the Department with more effective delivery of the policy aims set by Ministers. The employment of private sector support is not, of itself, intended to provide savings on departmental expenditure, but rather enables progress to be made at a rate commensurate with meeting our strategic goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1964W.6/3">Consultancy recommendations implemented by the Department ensure that Defra has sufficient capability and capacity to deliver its outcomes. The rationale for reliance on consultancy support is largely based on the need to bring sufficient resources with the appropriate skills to bear on critical programmes. The longer-term question of providing a more skilled and professionalised work force, which may in turn lessen reliance on external support, is of course being addressed as part of wider civil service reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.1964W.6/4">Defra's major programmes have benefited from the experience and expertise of management consultants, and the true benefits cannot be measured by a simple assessment of the direct costs incurred, but must include an analysis of the financial savings over the life of the programme, and the wider impact on Defra's customers and society in general.</p>
	<p pid="a.1964W.6/5">Defra is committed to maximising the value of its expenditure on management consultants, and has begun a programme to review how all professional services, including consultancy, are managed, and how to work more effectively across Whitehall to deliver savings on the services procured. Defra's new strategic partnership with IBM also offers the potential to rationalise consultancy support, and reduce expenditure on ad hoc call-off contracts.</p>

	<p pid="a.1970W.5/1">Fishery scientists from the UK and the other exploiting nations compile fisheries data, biological data and survey data in order to assess the status of fish stocks. The Advisory Committee on Fishery Management (ACFM) of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), an independent scientific body, uses these data sources to provide information on the annual status of fish stocks.</p>

The Secretary of State's policy in relation to the exercise of these powers is set out in a guidance document available on the Defra website <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/localauth/lats/pdf/lats-s26guide.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/localauth/lats/pdf/lats-s26guide.pdf</a>.</p>

In general, these wastes would be classified as non-hazardous and their notification of export for reprocessing is not required unless specific countries of destination have made a request to the European Commission for additional controls.

The EQIA concluded that a charging system based on property capital values would result in Protestants being likely to bear a disproportionately greater burden of domestic water and sewerage charges, reflecting the fact that there is a markedly higher representation of Protestants in those areas of Northern Ireland with higher house prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.1991W.5/3" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 requires public bodies to give due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity across nine specific groups: age; gender; religious belief; political opinion; sexual orientation; marital status; dependants; disabled; and race. The draft EQIA does not therefore reach conclusions on the basis of class or socio-economic groupings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1991W.5/4">The conclusions of the draft EQIA are currently being reviewed in light of the comments made in the consultation and the evidence submitted of negative impacts on other Section 75 Groups, including pensioners, the disabled and other Section 75 Groups living in low-income households. The results of this review will be reflected in the final Equality Impact Assessment which will issue with the IIA Consultation Report later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1993W.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Terry Moran to Mr. Danny Alexander, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1993W.0/3" class="indent">In response to your recent Parliamentary Questions, the Minister for Disabled People, Anne McGuire, promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1993W.0/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State how much attendance allowance has been withheld from pensioners in self-funded care homes in Scotland since the introduction of free personal care in Scotland. You also asked how many people in Scotland have been paid attendance allowance for which they are ineligible as a result of being in receipt of free personal care and whether the Department intends to seek repayment of any such amounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1993W.0/5" class="indent">We do not routinely collect statistics that would answer your first question and there would be a disproportionate cost in obtaining the information.</p>
	<p pid="a.1993W.0/6" class="indent">From a recent sampling exercise it would appear that around 200 customers aged 65 or over receiving attendance allowance or disability living allowance care component have been overpaid. This is because they did not report that they are in receipt of free personal care and are residing in a care home in Scotland. We are currently making enquiries of those customers to establish whether an overpayment has arisen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1993W.0/7" class="indent">There may have been other cases in the past where an overpayment arose following a delayed notification that they were in receipt of free personal care. We do not routinely record this information. I am therefore unable to assess how many other cases may have arisen. These will have been dealt with as the information came to our attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1993W.0/8" class="indent">Where an overpayment has arisen we will look at each case to consider whether recovery of the overpayment is required. In order to ensure that all customers are treated consistently each case will be considered in accordance with the Department's normal business rules. In doing so, great care will be exercised given the likely age and frailty of the customers involved.</p>

	<p pid="a.1993W.3/1">Attendance allowance provides a contribution towards the extra costs faced by severely disabled people aged 65 or over as a result of long-term disability. The purpose of the six-month qualifying period is to establish that disability and the care needs arising from it are long-term, rather than the result of short-term or transient illness. However, the decision maker will always look at for how long care has been required when the disabled person claims the allowance or reports an increase in their care needs, and will consider whether some or all of the qualifying period had already been completed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1995W.2/1">No research into this area has been possible because entitlement to carer's allowance depends upon a number of factors, one of which is that the disabled person being cared for must be in receipt of attendance allowance or the equivalent rates of the disability living allowance care component. Entitlement to those benefits can only be reliably established after a claim has been made and the care and mobility needs of the disabled person fully assessed. As there is no means of reliably calculating the number of people receiving them as a proportion of the overall eligible population, it is not possible to make a realistic estimate of the number of people who, if they claimed, might be entitled to carer's allowance.</p>

This found that the partnering status of a non-resident parent is a factor. Non-resident parents who have re-partnered or remarried tend to be less likely to comply with maintenance assessments.</p>

However, I thought it might be helpful if I explain that the Child Support Agency plan staffing on an annual basis, setting out workforce plans by business unit/territory. These workforce plans are underpinned by recruitment plans based on anticipated wastage of staff calculated by looking at historical leaver data. The plans are monitored monthly and reviewed on a quarterly basis to take account of any business changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1999W.5/6" class="indent">As a result of the Departmental <i>Spending Review 2004</i> the Agency headcount target for March 2006 was increased by 1,561 from 8,000 to 9,561 (<i>Dataview</i> counting methodology).</p>
	<p pid="a.1999W.5/7" class="indent">From April 2005 the Agency began counting staffing in line with the agreed Cabinet Office <i>Mandate</i> counting methodology. This excludes staff on maternity pay from the staff in post count and accounts for an approximate 1 per cent. reduction in staffing totals.

	<p pid="a.1999W.5/8" class="indent">From the beginning of the 2005/6 operational year the Child Support Agency moved from a business unit structure to a new territorial&quot; structure.

	<p pid="a.2001W.5/5" class="indent">I have provided the number of complaints received in the Agency in the table below covering a 14 month period to May 2005.

	<p pid="a.2001W.5/6" class="indent">We consider that any complaint we receive to be a serious complaint&quot;, and we do not have a separate definition of serious&quot;. We operate a three-tier complaints process. A Stage 1 complaint is the first we receive from a client either in writing or over the telephone and is dealt with by a Complaints Resolution Team located within each of our Business Units. A Stage 2 complaint is one where the client complains to the Business Unit's Area Director following a response at Stage 1. Most complaints are settled at Stage 1 or 2 but if a client is unhappy with the Area Director's response they can write directly to the Chief Executive. This constitutes a Stage 3 complaint.</p>
	<p pid="a.2001W.5/7" class="indent">At each level of the complaints process clients are advised as to how they can escalate their complaint should they remain dissatisfied with the reply they receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.2001W.5/8" class="indent">Once the three-tiered process has been completed the client can contact the Independent Case Examiner [if they remain dissatisfied]. The Independent Case Examiner is external to the Agency and acts as an impartial adjudicator in respect of the complaints which are appropriate for her involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.2001W.5/9" class="indent">In addition to this process, a client can complain directly to their Member of Parliament who can refer the complaint on their behalf to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.</p>

	<p pid="a.2010W.2/6" class="indent">Entitlement to disability living allowance depends on the care and mobility needs arising from a person's illness or disability, not on the particular disability itself Therefore when designing claim forms we have to bear in mind that approx two thirds of our customers have more than one illness or disability present It would be impractical for both claimants and the business to design claim forms for individual impairments.</p>
	<p pid="a.2010W.2/7" class="indent">The revised claim form will be easier for the claimant to complete. It will be in a more suitable format than the current generic claim form for claimants with any single disability, whether physical, mental or sensory, or combinations of any of these. Testing of this claim form begins in September 2005 in two pilot areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.2010W.2/8" class="indent">Claim forms and leaflets can already be requested in large print or Braille.</p>

	<p pid="a.2012W.2/1">The Department for Work and Pensions does not intend to make an assessment of the merits of providing financial assistance to companies that incur additional insurance costs because they employ disabled people. The Government do not provide funding to employers to enable them to meet their obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. In fulfilling their duty to make reasonable adjustments, employers are required only to make adjustments that are reasonable for them to make given all the circumstances of the case. Factors such as the cost of the adjustment and the employer's available resources are taken into account in determining what is reasonable.</p>
	<p pid="a.2012W.2/2">No data is held on people who have been refused employment or dismissed because employers claim that insurance costs are prohibitive. Therefore the Department for Work and Pensions has not made any estimates of the numbers of disabled people who have been affected in these circumstances. If insurance costs are prohibitive&quot; it may be unreasonable for an employer to pay the higher premium. Furthermore, an unacceptably high premium, or a refusal by an insurance company to provide cover for the disabled individual, may provide grounds for the employer to justify discriminatory action against the insurance company.</p>
	<p pid="a.2012W.2/3">The Department has made no estimate of the accuracy of risk assessments undertaken by insurance companies that increase premiums when disabled people are employed. The Government are not in a position to intervene in the decisions of insurance companies when determining whether or not to offer insurance. An Insurer's Guide to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995&quot;, published by the Association of British Insurers includes guidance to the insurance industry on the use of relevant information and data in underwriting and we would expect insurance companies to follow this guide. The guide has been endorsed by the Disability Rights Commission which has undertaken to monitor its effects to help the industry improve its performance. The Disability Rights Commission proposes to begin research this summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.2018W.2/2">Between 1979 and 1997 the number of people receiving incapacity benefit rose from 700,000 to 2.5 million&mdash;the equivalent of an additional 2,000 inactive people every single week. However, between November 1997 and November 2004 inflows declined by around 30 per cent. This has resulted in the slowing down of the growth in the caseload since 1997. In fact in the year to February 2005 the caseload fell by 29,000&mdash;a small but significant change, reflecting the success of our management of the economy and the success of our welfare to work policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.2018W.2/3">Projections of the number of claimants ignore the progress we have made since 1997. At least a million claimants (the Shaw Trust estimate 1.5 million) receiving incapacity benefit say they expect to work in the future, given the right support. We are already providing this support in the Pathways to Work pilots, which are doubling their recorded job entries, but we want to do even more and that's why we will be publishing a Green Paper in the autumn outlining our proposals. Our ambition is to move a million people off incapacity benefit and into work.</p>

	<p pid="a.2022W.9/1">The new deal has been successful in helping more than 1.3 million people into work. 577,020 people have started the new deal more than once. There are several possible reasons for this. In a dynamic, shifting labour market, it is inevitable that some people entering the new deal will return to unemployment. Equally a person may cease their involvement on the new deal because they move from jobseekers' allowance on to another benefit or stop claiming at all. These people may subsequently reclaim and return to the new deal. However, the new deal is a long-term investment to make a real difference to the lives of its participants. Those who do return to benefits have still added to their skills, confidence and experience, making it easier for them to find a job in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.2023W.8/1">We have early signs that the Pathways to Work approach is having a positive impact, providing a framework of high-quality active support for people on incapacity benefits. To the end of March 2005 there have been around 13,400 Pathways job entries and there is increasingly clear evidence of a significant increase in the proportions of new claimants leaving benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.2023W.8/2">In our Pathways pilot areas we have achieved an increase of about 8 per cent. in the number of people who move off incapacity benefit within six months when compared to non pilot areas. The increase exceeds our initial expectations.</p>
	<p pid="a.2023W.8/3">Around 20 per cent. of all those attending work-focused interviews (WFIs) take up one of the forms of back-to-work help available in Pathways areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.2023W.8/4">The element of Pathways designed to provide help to disabled people to manage their condition is the NHS Condition Management Programme which has been particularly welcomed by both customers and personal advisers. There have been 4,900 starts to Condition Management Programmes since their introduction in October 2003. Some of those whose health condition improved cited the Condition Management Programme as a contributing factor.</p>

	<p pid="a.2032W.2/1">The G8 agreement for multilateral debt relief is for all HIPCs who have reached completion point. Currently 18 countries could be eligible for debt worth up to $40 billion (Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso,Ethiopia, Ghana, Guyana, Honduras, Mali, Mauritania, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia).

Government Departments, such as HMRC, therefore regularly need to be able to obtain full and comprehensive legal advice necessary for the effective conduct of public affairs without which the quality of decision-making will be greatly impaired. As with the advice in question, such advice is not routinely brought to the attention of Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="a.2039W.5/1">As data on bullying is not collected centrally we do not have statistics relating to the incidence of bullying at primary or post-primary level in Essex and London. Bullying cases appear to be reported more often now than previously but we have no hard evidence that bullying is increasing or that it is affecting more children. Indeed, as children and young people increasingly feel safe at school to report bullying, and confident that it will be tackled effectively and sensitively, it is likely reporting will rise. However, any level of bullying is too high and we are determined to help schools tackle the problem. Our guidance pack Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;, the anti-bullying Charter and the anti-bullying website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying">www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying</a> offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying. We also offer specific advice to schools on tackling homophobic bullying and are developing advice on racist bullying.</p>
	<p pid="a.2039W.5/2">We have raised awareness of the importance of children who are being bullied telling an adult about what is happening, through our public information film Tell Someone&quot; and our leaflets and postcards for children and their parents. Our recent Beat Bullying&quot; blue wristband campaign was launched in partnership with Radio One, during the first national anti-bullying week in November 2004. By the end of December, one million children and young people had answered our call to Make a Stand, Wear a Band&quot; and make a visible commitment that they are not prepared to tolerate bullying and will stand by their friends.</p>

	<p pid="a.2041W.3/1">We are aware of the importance of school children drinking water during their working day and the benefits that it brings. For the last three years both the Department of Health and Department for Education and Skills have been working on a food in schools programme that aims to help schools implement a whole school approach to food education and healthy eating. The interactive food in schools toolkit which can be viewed at <a href="http://www.foodinschools.org">www.foodinschools.org</a>, provides a wide range of guidance, resources and interactive tools to inspire and support schools in taking a whole school approach to healthy eating and drinking, including water provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.2041W.3/2">The water provision&quot; guidance supports schools in reviewing and improving current provision and in promoting water consumption. The guidance has been informed by the food in schools water provision project, which was piloted in 40 schools in the North East and East Midland region.</p>
	<p pid="a.2041W.3/3">Cross Government working between the DfES, Department of Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), Department of Health (DoH) and the Food Standards Agency (FSA), on ways to increase awareness of the importance of food and drink within the school environment resulted in the publication on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-06">6 September 2004</phrase> of the Healthy Living Blueprint for Schools&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.2041W.3/4">The blueprint, issued to all schools, brings together all Government advice and examples of best practice about healthy eating and drinking in schools. It provides schools with advice on what they can do to improve children's approach to food and drink and exercise, and shows how developing whole school approaches can help bring about significant improvements to the health of children.</p>
	<p pid="a.2041W.3/5">Healthy School Lunches Guidance&quot;, published by the DfES, contains the Secretary of State's expectation that drinking water should be available to all pupils every day, free of charge. This view is mirrored in the Healthy Living Blueprint for Schools&quot;, which states that,</p>
	<p pid="a.2041W.3/6" class="indent">all pupils should have access to drinking water at all times at a number of points around the school, preferably not from taps in the toilets. Pupils should be permitted to carry water with them and consumption encouraged both in class and during break and lunch time&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.2041W.3/7">However, it is the responsibility of head teachers and school's governing bodies to decide when water should be made available. We consider that they are best placed to make these decisions in their role of having responsibility of the day-to-day running of the school and with their knowledge of the individual circumstances of their pupils.</p>

	<p pid="a.2042W.5/1">We allocate capital funding directly to local authorities and schools and do not hold back reserves to respond to requests for individual projects. We expect local authorities to prioritise expenditure in their locally prepared asset management plans, which should be drawn up in consultation with their schools and local partners. In addition, schools are allocated their own Devolved Formula Capital which can be spent on upgrading water facilities, if that is their priority.</p>

	<p pid="a.2057W.3/1">Figures provided by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) show that as of July 2005, 31 per cent. of learners participating in employer training pilots have their learning delivered by colleges of further education and 69 per cent. delivered by independent providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.2057W.3/2">As we announced in our White Paper, Skills: Getting on in business, getting on at work&quot;, the national employer training programme (NETP) will offer employers informed choice between quality-assured training providers. This is an essential part of putting the employer in a position where, in effect, they are able to make the purchasing decision about what training they get. Brokers, acting on behalf of the employer, will be able to source training from any LSC-approved provider, whether colleges or other providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.2057W.3/3">We are continuing to work closely with the LSC on the details of NETP funding and how it will be allocated to providers in the context of agenda for change. We cannot give precise details about allocations to providers until this work is complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.2057W.3/4">The emphasis of employer training pilots (ETPs) has been to encourage employers to invest in skills and qualifications, particularly for low skilled trainees. They are testing out a package of public financial support measures to improve access to training and enable employees to attain Skills for Life and/or their first full NVQ level 2 qualification.</p>
	<p pid="a.2057W.3/5">At the end of June 2005, the pilots had signed up 23,101 employers and 184,198 employees, and 68,902 learners had successfully completed their learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.2057W.3/6">As with the pilots, the core of the national employer training programme will be free, high quality training for employees who lack basic skills in literacy, language and numeracy or a first full Level 2 qualification. Beyond that core of free training up to Level 2, employers will be able to access more comprehensive training packages to meet their wider needs, including at Level 3 and higher, and non-qualification based training. As part of the partnership between Government and the employer in raising investment in skills, we will look to employers to pay a fair contribution towards the cost of this wider training.</p>

However, research carried out for the DFES in 2002&ndash;03 showed that 44 per cent. of schools teaching pupils aged seven to 11 offered some form of language learning, 35 per cent. of which took place in curriculum time. This is up from 21 per cent. of schools offering some form of language learning in 2000, and we expect that number will have increased again significantly last year. Our research showed that French is the language most commonly taught, followed by Spanish, German and Italian. 28 LEAs reported other languages being taught. We know from our key stage 2 language Pathfinders that a wide range of languages are now being taught at primary schools, including community and other world languages.</p>

	<p pid="a.2069W.2/1">The Department has not assessed the impact of excessive television watching on children's learning progress. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, has not had any meetings on this issue. However, current international research evidence points to the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.2/2" class="indent">Watching good quality educational programming in the early years can benefit children's language development, in the right conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.2/3" class="indent">Conversely, extensive viewing of age-inappropriate or entertainment programming can hinder language development.</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.2/4" class="indent">In addition, television viewing before age 3 has been shown to have a modest adverse effect on cognitive outcomes at age 6 and 7.</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.2/5" class="indent">Increased television viewing by children has a long-lasting association with a higher chance of having no formal qualifications by the age of 26.</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.2/6" class="indent">Other learning activities such as reading may be displaced by television viewing.</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.2/7" class="indent">Having a television in the bedroom is negatively associated with test scores for children aged 8.</p>
	<p pid="a.2069W.2/8" class="indent">The American Academy of Paediatrics recommends that children watch a maximum of 2 hours of quality programming per day. The National Literacy Trust's Talk To Your Baby campaign recommends no more than half-an-hour for under 2s, and one hour for 3&ndash;5 year olds.</p>

	<p pid="a.2073W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is currently establishing an independent casino advisory panel to assist her in the exercise of her order making powers under section 175(4) of the Gambling Act 2005 to determine the geographical distribution of the new casino premises licences. The casino advisory panel will consider submissions from local authorities wishing to issue premises licences for regional, large or small casinos. Any local authority in the north east that wants to, will have the opportunity to put its case to the panel in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.2073W.5/1">The regional planning bodies, as part of their revision of regional spatial strategies, will need to identify a list of possible broad locations for regional casinos in their region. The primary requirement for the advisory panel is to ensure that the locations chosen are suitable for testing the social impact of the new style casinos. Subject to that, the Secretary of State will expect the casino advisory panel to ensure that its recommendations are compatible with the broad locations identified in the regional spatial strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.2073W.5/2">The panel is expected to complete its work towards the end of 2006. The current intention is that the Secretary of State will bring an order before Parliament determining the geographical distribution of casino premises licences during the first half of 2007. The order will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

	<p pid="a.2076W.0/1">We are working with the Home Office to identify areas where the Identity Cards Scheme could provide business benefits. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June 2005</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary placed in the Library a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the Identity Cards Scheme which shows that the benefits outweigh the costs once the scheme is fully operational.</p>
	<p pid="a.2076W.0/2">The hospitality industry has long considered that the prevention of sales of alcohol to and purchase by children under 18 would be greatly enhanced if a universal identity card showing evidence of age was introduced. At present, the large number of different proof of age cards with varying security features makes it difficult for retailers to identify those underage. The industry has recently confirmed that it fully supports the introduction of identity cards for these reasons.</p>

No distinction is made under the present licensing framework between public houses, for example, which serve food, and those which do not. This is also the case for the new regime introduced by the Licensing Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.2076W.3/2">There were 75,972 public houses across England in June 2004. The Department of Health estimated that between 10 per cent. and 30 per cent. of them do not serve food, in the November 2004 White Paper Choosing Health&quot;. My Department believes that this estimate remains a reasonable one, but that in many areas of England the proportion will be at the lower end of the range.</p>

	<p pid="a.2079W.2/1">This Government places great importance on ensuring that we enhance and develop practical media literacy skills in all citizens across the UK. Media literacy plays a key role in helping people to make informed choices about what they and their children see and hear, as well as to think critically about the media environment they live in.</p>
	<p pid="a.2079W.2/2">Furthermore, the development of a media literate society will provide an important driver for economic growth. The continued strength of our economy is dependent on the development of a skilled workforce. In an information-rich society, with goods and services increasingly offered online, the skill to exploit the benefits of new communication technologies have become ever more important.</p>
	<p pid="a.2079W.2/3">For these reasons, under the Communications Act 2003, we have placed a statutory duty on Ofcom to promote better media literacy. This includes developing a better public understanding and awareness of the available technological systems to regulate access to electronic media based material and control what is received.</p>
	<p pid="a.2079W.2/4">The importance of media literacy has also been identified in Europe as one of the major tools in the development of citizens' responsibilities. A number of initiatives have been launched at European level and endorsed by the European Commission with the aim of ensuring more Europeans, especially young people, have the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the multi-media environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.2079W.2/5">Our goal is to have a society of active and informed consumers of media&mdash;empowering individuals so we can all benefit from and contribute to the digital future.</p>

	<p pid="a.2086W.3/1">Some correspondence has been received from the organisers of wine tasting sessions. Their main concern is whether or not wine tasting requires a licence under the Licensing Act 2003. Generally this would not be the case. Normally a wine tasting club would buy wine collectively for each wine tasting session and at the session the wine would be provided free of charge. As such, in most cases, this would be similar to a private party where one or more people club together to purchase the refreshments to be consumed. This would not be licensable. However, if a club admits non-members for a charge which entitles them to consume a certain amount of alcohol, the event would be licensable. Furthermore, if the club sells or supplies alcohol to its members for a charge, it may be necessary for the club to take advice as to whether a club premises certificate is required.</p>

	<p pid="a.2087W.5/12">In-year capping makes no difference to the figures at a national level for 2004&ndash;05 when rounded to the nearest pound. Assuming that capped authorities reduce their budgets in 2005&ndash;06 to the maximum permitted budget requirement, the same would be true for this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.2087W.5/13">Capping remains an effective means of bringing down council tax increases as authorities would otherwise go on to set higher increases. In 2003&ndash;04, the last year in which capping powers were not exercised, the average council tax increase in England was 12.9 per cent. This reduced to 5.9 per cent. in 2004&ndash;05 and fell again to 4.1per cent. in 2005&ndash;06&mdash;in both these years, the Government made clear that they were prepared to use their powers to cap excessive council tax increases.</p>

In most fire and rescue services in England, appliances are currently assumed to be at the fire station when mobilised. The new arrangements will take into account the disposition of appliances under an authority's Integrated Risk Management Plan, and optimise the response. The information transmitted direct to the appliance will enable better, faster route planning, and will include water supply information and premises risk data to ensure crews are better-prepared to deal with the incident on arrival.</p>
	<p pid="a.2090W.5/72">The location of callers will be identified automatically, even if the caller is ringing from a mobile phone, and detailed information about the location of the caller will be available on screen to the operator. This will improve call-handling by enabling the control operator speedily to validate information given by the caller and focus on handling any distress. These two factors combined are expected to reduce response times from the point of call to the point of attendance at the incident.</p>

	<p pid="a.2094W.2/1">My right hon. Friend, the Deputy Prime Minister, within the framework of the Local Government Pension Scheme tri-partite committee, has invited all parties to develop, by the autumn, realistic and costed measures to fully meet actual cost pressures arising from the introduction of the Local Government Pension Scheme (Amendment) Regulations 2005. The 2005 regulations also allow actuaries to conduct interim valuations to produce fresh assessments of each fund's assets and liabilities to help manage that process. The intention is to secure the scheme's solvency and affordability, without any additional resource calls on employers, on Government or on council tax payers.</p>

	<p pid="a.2098W.5/1">The plans for the sustainable communities have had a long gestation and have included wide community participation. Regional Planning Guidance 9(2001) recommended an interregional study should be undertaken to consider the further development of the Milton Keynes sub-region. This was followed by the Milton Keynes and South Midlands study (2002) and subsequent growth area assessments, all of which were steered by a full range of stakeholders. Sustainable communities: building for the future&quot;, published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in 2003, announced three new growth areas, including Milton Keynes South Midlands (MKSM), and identified key steps for taking them forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.2098W.5/2">All interested bodies and members of the community in Milton Keynes and elsewhere had the opportunity to participate in the formulation of the MKSM Sub-Regional Strategy, which sets out the strategic plan for the area up to 2031. The first consultations on the MKSM Sub-Regional Strategy (July to October 2003) produced 1,600 responses. There then followed a public examination by an independent panel who produced their report in August 2004. In response to the panel's recommendations my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister the First Secretary of State, via his Government Offices, consulted on the proposed changes to the MKSM Sub-Regional Strategy. Over 3,000 copies of this document were distributed with 426 representations received. These were considered before publishing the final MKSM Sub-Regional Strategy in March 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.2098W.5/3">Further details can be found in Milton Keynes and South Midlands Sub-Regional Strategy&mdash;Summary of Public Consultation on the Secretary of State's Proposed Changes&quot; (available via <a href="http://www.gose.gov.uk">www.gose.gov.uk</a>). See also Sustainable Communities: An Urban Development Area for Milton Keynes: Consultation Summary and Decision Document&quot; (available via <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk">www.odpm.gov.uk</a>) for further information on the consultation process leading up to the establishment of Milton Keynes Partnerships Committee, the local delivery vehicle for Milton Keynes.</p>

	<p pid="a.2099W.2/2">The research on health effects from radiofrequency electromagnetic fields was comprehensively reviewed by the National Radiological Protection Board's (NRPB) independent advisory group on non-ionising radiation in 2003. The review concluded that</p>
	<p pid="a.2099W.2/3" class="indent">Exposure levels from living near to mobile phone base stations are extremely low and the overall evidence indicates that they are unlikely to pose a risk to health&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.2099W.2/4">The NRPB, now part of the Health Protection Agency (HPA), has posted the results of its base station exposure measurements on its website, with an explanation of the effect of other masts in the vicinity. This is available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.2099W.2/6">In addition, an audit of more than 450 measurements of exposure around base stations undertaken by Ofcom over the last four years demonstrate that none has exceeded the electromagnetic field exposure guidelines of the international commission on non-ionising radiation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2099W.2/7">Nevertheless, in view of the public concern and the precautionary approach to the use of these new technologies recommended by the Stewart Report (2000) and the NRPB's Mobile Phones and Health 2004&quot; report, the mobile telecommunications and health research programme is supporting studies on the possible effects from mobile phone radio waves.</p>

	<p pid="a.2102W.5/17">This expenditure has played an important role in helping to increase the capacity of the six countries concerned to combat the trade in drugs. It has improved the law enforcement capacity of the six countries e.g. to interdict drug shipments and to target, arrest and convict leading drug traffickers. The increase in the seizures of cocaine, heroin and other opiates in recent years suggest that, through training and other measures, this investment may be having some effect: worldwide cocaine and opiate seizures both increased by a third in 2003, the latest date for which figures are available.</p>

	<p pid="a.2107W.3/15">Data collection over this period has been complicated by the introduction of new Pay and Management Information systems. It is therefore possible that the figures given do not reflect consistent recording methods. FCO is currently working to improve both accuracy and detail in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.2107W.3/16">Per capita sickness absence in the FCO has been consistently below the public sector average. In 2003 it was recorded at 5.6 days per person. The date showed a slight rise in 2004 to six days per person. This is likely to be the result of better management control/reporting and the introduction of new IT systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.2107W.3/17">The FCO is fully committed to implementing the recommendations in the recently published Managing Sickness Absence in the Public Sector&quot;. A new FCO health care contract which started in April 2005 includes a comprehensive occupational health service aimed at better and more proactive management of long and short-term sickness absence.</p>

	<p pid="a.2108W.2/4">The International Criminal Court is currently conducting investigations into allegations of crimes in Darfur. Though Sudan is not a state party to the ICC statute, it was referred to the court by the UN Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005) which was made pursuant to Chapter VII of the United Nations charter. Sudan is therefore legally obliged to co-operate with the ICC including by surrendering any Sudanese nationals indicted by the ICC, irrespective of the individual's position under Sudanese domestic law.</p>

Because of the need to respect this independence, and to protect the integrity of the Court's operations, it would not be appropriate to comment on the operational aspects of specific ICC investigations, nor to reveal what support the UK is providing in that regard.

	<p pid="a.2111W.6/2">The United Kingdom has one of the strictest and most transparent arms export licensing systems in the world. All export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case by case basis against the consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. This assessment takes into account the prevailing circumstances and all other announced Government policies, including factors that are relevant if the goods are to be incorporated for re-export. The criteria demonstrate our commitment to take account of the risk that exports might be used for internal repression, prolonging conflict or external aggression. Where we judge that the proposed export might be used in contravention of the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria, those export licence applications are refused.</p>

	<p pid="a.2116W.2/1">The Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) is currently in the initial Assessment Phase, one of the purposes of which is to refine the requirement in the light of more detailed analysis of capabilities and technological reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.2/2">Since July 2004 there have been two significant changes to the FRES requirement. The first is our planning assumption for the number of FRES vehicles we expect to procure. To meet the Army's requirement to replace a wide range of vehicles this assumption has been increased to around 3,500 vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.2/3">The second change is the removal of the requirement for FRES vehicles to be deployable in C-130 aircraft. This was always recognised as being challenging, and further analysis has shown that to meet it we would have to make unacceptable compromises, particularly on protection. In addition, in the timeframe in which FRES will enter service the balance of our air transport fleet will shift towards the new, more capable A400M.</p>

	<p pid="a.2116W.5/1">The Ministry of Defence, like all UK employers, is subject to the Health and Safety Executive Noise at Work Regulations (NAWR) 1989&quot;. These require employers to take certain actions where any of their employees is likely to be exposed to noise at or above any of the three action levels set out in the Regulations. MOD procedures meet, and in many instances exceed, both these requirements and those of the Physical Agents (Noise) Directive (PA(N)D), which comes into force in February 2006. The instructions promulgated by the armed forces to their personnel are summarised as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/2" class="italic">Navy:</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/3">Under the new regulations set out in the PA(N)D, RN warships will have until 2011 to comply with the prescribed weekly and daily limits. In 2003 the RN introduced a hearing conservation programme to ensure compliance with NAWR 1989&quot;. This programme requires noise assessments to be carried out where personnel may be at risk from noise-induced hearing damage. Where such a risk is identified commanding officers are required to identify persons at risk, provide those potentially affected with information and awareness training, put in suitable control measures to mitigate this risk, which may include the provision of suitable hearing protection, and ensure that potentially affected personnel are provided with audiometry assessments at a frequency determined by the level of risk. Hearing protective equipment that is available to personnel complies with British Standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/4" class="italic">Army:</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/5">Hearing protection forms part of a serviceman's personal equipment that he will carry with him on operations. Additionally, hearing protection is included in the equipment schedule of the equipment that the serviceman may be operating. Whether or not the hearing protection will be worn by an individual at any one time will depend upon the role and duties of the particular individual and will, additionally, be dependant upon the hostile threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/6" class="italic">RAF:</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/7">Where RAF personnel work in an area that is deemed a noise hazard, hearing protection is issued on an individual basis. The wearing of such protection is made mandatory in the RAF at the First Action Level of NAWR 1989&quot;, which exceeds NAWR recommendations. In addition, noise assessments are conducted to determine the level and type of hearing protection required, and any member of staff working in such an area is managed via the Hearing Conservation Programme (HCP) which includes annual audiometry testing. This concurs, and in certain areas exceeds, the recommendations made by the NAWR 1989&quot;. Whether this protection is worn during times of hostile activity will depend not only on the hostile threat but also the role and duties of personnel involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/8">We are also working with HSE on the need for hearing protection for military band personnel.</p>

	<p pid="a.2122W.10/1">The purpose of project PRIME (thePortsmouth Regeneration and Investment in the Maritime Estate project) was to release part of the Portsmouth naval base estate for development. Work on PRIME has been halted after concerns emerged about the effect that proceeding with the project would have on the base's operational role. A key requirement, stated at the outset of the project, was to safeguard full operational capability of the base. After careful analysis it has been decided that the constraints that a development of this nature, in the heart of the historic dockyard, might place on operational capability outweigh the potential benefits of the scheme. Survey and technical work undertaken by the project will be fully utilised during the exploration of other options for the use of elements of the naval base estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.2122W.10/2">The Ministry of Defence's commitment to Portsmouth, as demonstrated by the move there of the fleet headquarters in 2002, will continue. It is to be the base for the next generation of warships and this represents a major investment that will preserve and enhance jobs in the area and safeguard Portsmouth's role as an operational naval base at the heart of the city's economic activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.2134W.4/2">Rail freight's ability to compete against road and other modes is dependent upon stable and affordable charging for access to the network. The Government supports this and believes it is best achieved through the principle of freight operators paying charges which reflect only the costs that they impose upon the network (in line with the charging principles set out in EU Directive 2001/14). We will therefore work with the rail industry and ORR so that this remains the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.2135W.8/25">The vast majority of Railtrack's income came from access charges levied on train operating companies rather than through direct payments from Government. However, a number of payments were made to the company between January 2000 and September 2001 by the SRA and the Shadow SRA. A number of these, including the payment of &pound;23 million in May 2001, relate to feasibility studies for infrastructure schemes. On <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-01">1 October 2001</phrase>, the SRA paid to Railtrack a Network Grant of &pound;337 million.

	<p pid="a.2138W.2/41"><sup>(49)</sup>Operators are part funded by PTEs. Where a PTE retains revenue risk, it pays the gross operating costs less the actual revenue. The subsidy figures in the table are based on the assumed revenue levels, either set out in the Franchise Agreement or based on actuals provided by the PTEs.

	<p pid="a.2138W.2/48">As the notes to this table explain, adjustments to the subsidy profile have been made to reflect the consequences of the ORR's December 2003 Access Charges Review. One of the effects of this review was to allow for some funds which would otherwise have been paid to TOCs from the SRA and then passed through to Network Rail (NR), to be paid by the SRA to NR directly. This had the effect of reducing the subsidy payments made to the TOCs (or increasing the premium payable by them).</p>
	<p pid="a.2138W.2/49">The amount paid direct to Network Rail in the financial year 2004&ndash;05 was around &pound;1.8 billion. Taking this direct funding into account the true subsidy per passenger kilometre for 2004&ndash;05 across the network is around 6.6 pence.</p>

	<p pid="a.2141W.3/16">The former Department for the Environment, Transport and Regions carried out research into heavy vehicle wheel loss in 1997 in conjunction with the Association of Chief Police Officers. This research led to advice being provided to owners and operators of such vehicles on the benefits of good maintenance and regular effective checking of wheel nuts. A copy of the research report was placed in the House Libraries at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.3/17">Products are available in the marketplace that can either indicate loose wheel nuts or possibly prevent the wheel nut from falling from the vehicle. The Department is seeking a better understanding of the potential of these devices for road safety and is in the final phase of placing a new contract to research these matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.2143W.0/1">Section 4 of the Abortion Act 1967, as amended, states that except where treatment is necessary to save the life of or prevent grave permanent injury to the pregnant woman:</p>
	<p pid="a.2143W.0/2" class="indent">no person shall be under any duty, whether by contract or by any statutory or other legal requirement, to participate in any treatment authorised by this Act to which he has a conscientious objection&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.2143W.0/3">The House of Lords ruled in 1988 that this exemption does not extend to giving advice, performing the preparatory steps to arrange an abortion where the request meets legal requirements and undertaking administration connected with abortion procedures. Doctors with a conscientious objection to abortion should make their views known to the patient and enable the patient to see another doctor without delay if that is the patient's wish. No recent discussion have taken place between the Secretary of State for Health and leaders of the medical profession on the interpretation of this ruling.</p>
	<p pid="a.2143W.0/4">The General Medical Council's (GMC) booklet, Good Medical Practice&quot;, states that general practitioners' views about a patient's lifestyle or beliefs must not prejudice the treatment they provide or arrange. If they feel their beliefs might affect the treatment, this must be explained to the patient, who should be told of their right to see another doctor. Breach of this guidance may expose a doctor to a charge of serious professional misconduct and disciplinary action by the GMC.</p>
	<p pid="a.2143W.0/5">The Department has issued guidance on best practice where there are ethical objections to abortion, through the Recommended Standards for Sexual Health Services&quot;, produced for the Department by the Medical Foundation for AIDS and Sexual Health.</p>
	<p pid="a.2143W.0/6">The National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) Regulations 2004 include details of additional services, including contraceptive services, which states that:</p>
	<p pid="a.2143W.0/7" class="indent">where the contractor has a conscientious objection to the termination of pregnancy, prompt referral to another provider of primary medical services who does not have such conscientious objections&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.2143W.0/8">It is accepted Parliamentary practice that proposals for changes in the law on abortion have come from back-bench members and that decisions are made on the basis of free votes. The Government has no plans to change the law on abortion.</p>

The Public Health White Paper announced a national audit of contraceptive services, backed by new investment of &pound;40 million to address gaps in services.

	<p pid="a.2145W.3/1">In 1985, the House of Lords ruled that young people aged under 16 are legally able to consent to medical advice and treatment, including abortion, if a doctor or other healthcare worker judges them competent to do so. For under 16s seeking an abortion, guidance from the Department emphasises that health professionals should discuss the benefits of the young women involving her parents. Where she cannot be persuaded to do so, every effort should be made to find another adult to provide support, for example another family member or specialist youth worker.</p>

This is in addition to money needed to meet the costs of the general pay uplift of around 10 per cent. over three years to 2005&ndash;06, agreed as part of the Agenda for Change&quot; package.

	<p pid="a.2147W.2/3">Under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 (the 1990 Act), the Secretary of State has the power to make regulations about the membership and procedure of NHS trusts. The Secretary of State exercised this power in making the NHS Trusts (Membership and Procedure) Regulations 1990. Under the 1990 Act, the Secretary of State appoints the chairman and the non-executive directors of the trust, although both these functions have been delegated to the NHS Appointments Commission. The Secretary of State also has powers, subject to provisions set out in the 1990 Regulations, to terminate the tenure of office of the chairman and non-executive directors of a trust in certain circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.2147W.2/6">The Secretary of State can make an intervention order under section 84A of the 1977 Act if she is of the opinion that the trust is not performing one or more of its functions adequately or at all, or that there are significant failings in the way the body is being run and she is satisfied that it is appropriate for her to intervene. An intervention order may provide for the removal or suspension from office of trust members and their replacement with other specified individuals, or for certain functions to be carried out by a specified individual, or for a function of the trust to be performed in a way that will achieve objectives specified in the directions.</p>
	<p pid="a.2147W.2/7">The Secretary of State can make a default order under section 85 of the 1977 Act where she is of the opinion that a NHS trust has failed to carry out functions conferred on them under the 1977 Act or the 1990 Act or have failed to comply with regulations or directions relating to those functions. The effect of the default order is to terminate the tenure of office of the members of the trust and provide for the appointment of new members and may make such supplementary provision as the Secretary of State deems necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.2149W.3/1">At a population level, the fluoridation of water supplies offers the most potential for reducing dental disease in children. By reforming the relevant legislation we have given strategic health authorities a realistic option of fluoridating their water, provided they can show they have the support of the local population. In addition, advice on oral health promotion is given in schools and we have piloted the Brushing for Life&quot; Scheme in areas with the highest levels of tooth decay including all Sure Start areas which do not receive fluoridated water. The scheme provides for health visitors to give packs containing a toothbrush, a tube of fluoridated toothpaste and a leaflet on oral hygiene to the parents and carers of young children when they attend child health clinics for development checks at eight months, 18 months and three years and above.</p>

This was the first time in 10 years that counterfeit products are known to have reached the legitimate UK supply chain. Over 600 million prescriptions are written annually in the UK. Therefore these two discoveries of counterfeit medicines in the small numbers that reached the legitimate UK supply chain, prior to recall, needs to be viewed in that context.</p>
	<p pid="a.2150W.6/2">There is no evidence to suggest that licensed parallel trade provides any more of an opportunity to introduce counterfeit medicines into the country over non-parallel traded products.

The book contains a very broad range of information, including what to do if you are worried about having a baby with an abnormality. The book encourages women to discuss any concerns that they may have during their pregnancy with an appropriate health professional, given that advice, support and counselling may be required by the woman.</p>

	<p pid="a.2162W.2/1">The Faculty of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care published guidance on emergency contraception. Updated in June 2003, this includes information and recommendations on the aftercare and follow up required for women receiving emergency contraception, including Levonorgestrel, and the clinical examination and investigation needed before emergency contraception is provided. In addition, guidance about the possible side effects associated with taking emergency contraception is provided in the patient information leaflet included in the medicine pack. The possible side effects of the emergency contraceptive, Levenorgestrel, are also included in the information that is provided to health professionals (the summary of product characteristics), who are encouraged to discuss these side effects with the individual before treatment is provided. Pharmacists are supplied with a protocol that contains a checklist of advice that should be given to each individual when she is given Levenorgestrel, which includes the side effects which may occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.2162W.2/2">I understand that the United States Senate Judiciary Committee on the Human Life Bill of the 97th Congress concerned the provision that human life shall be deemed to exist from conception. This issue was considered as part of the same High Court hearing which found that emergency hormonal contraception is not a method of abortion. This issue was considered in 2002 in the High Court, where it was found that the supply and use of emergency contraception is lawful and that the prevention of implantation, which is brought about by emergency contraception products, does not amount to procuring a miscarriage under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.2162W.2/3">We are not aware of any research that has been undertaken which assesses the impact of the wider availability of emergency contraception, also known as the morning after pill, on the abortion rate. Variations in the abortion rate are subject to a number of different factors, including the conception rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.2162W.2/4">Improving access to a wide variety of contraceptive methods is an important part of the Government's strategy to reduce the numbers of unintended pregnancies, including teenage pregnancies. However, the Government does not promote any one method of contraception in preference to others. The type of method used should be chosen by the women, in consultation with a health care professional. Emergency contraception is not designed to be used as a regular method of contraception.</p>

The Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC) underpins this policy throughout the European Union by introducing a statutory basis for international standards of good clinical practice for commencing, conducting and verifying the results of clinical trials, for good manufacturing practice that provides assurance of the quality of medicines being tested, inspection against these standards and enforcement for non-compliance. Many of the requirements of the Directive were already accepted standards for governance of research in the United Kingdom before it was implemented by the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004.</p>

Guidance from the British Association of Perinatal Medicine introduces the concept of a threshold of viability&quot; as being from 22 to 26 weeks gestation. Although the possibility of survival of extremely pre-term babies has improved, data suggests that, even with modern intensive care, chances of survival at 22 weeks gestation are only approximately 1 per cent., whereas this increases to 26 per cent. at 24 weeks. A recent briefing paper from the British Medical Association, Abortion time limits&quot;, highlighted that gestational age is not the only factor that affects the possibility of a foetus being considered viable.</p>

It was due to direct exposure within the UK to a species of bat which also occurs abroad. Both the cases of anthrax recovered following treatment and were due to exposure within the UK to infected animal skins, though the species of animal is not known.</p>

	<p pid="a.2171W.0/1">We believe that the implementation of the directive on traditional herbal medicinal products is fully consistent with the World Health Organisation's (WHO) policies on traditional and complementary medicine. The WHO has noted that unregulated or inappropriate use of such medicines can have dangerous effects and has said that it is important for governments to establish regulatory mechanisms to control the safety and quality of products. The directive is designed to give the consumer assurance as to standards of safety, quality and patient information in relation to traditional herbal medicines.</p>

	<p pid="a.2175W.5/1">In April 2003f the national health service security management service (NHS SMS) was created and assumed policy and operational responsibility for the management of security in the NHS, including work to tackle violence against NHS staff. In November 2003, the NHS SMS introduced a comprehensive range of measures to tackle incidences of violence against NHS staff, both proactively and reactively. The NHS SMS has begun a programme of work to identify the true nature, scale and extent of the problem. Once this work is completed, meaningful and achievable targets for delivering a secure environment for NHS staff will be set.</p>
	<p pid="a.2175W.5/2">The Department's fifteenth annual report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-21">21 June 2005</phrase>. This report includes details of progress in reducing the levels of absence due to sickness. The report is available in the Library and on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/AnnualReports">www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/AnnualReports</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.2175W.5/3">Figures for sickness absence are generally published for whole sectors. Figures for the NHS compare favourably with other public sector employers. Overall, the sickness absence figures for the NHS have changed little over the past five years. The Department's survey of sickness rates over the last four years show a steady state, with 4.7 per cent, in 2000 and 4.6 per cent, in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.2175W.5/4">The Improving Working Lives&quot; initiative is now well embedded in the NHS. This promotes more flexible working, helps staff manage a healthy balance between work and commitments outside work, and requires NHS employers to tackle issues such as safety, health and well being.</p>

	<p pid="a.2176W.11/3" class="indent">Women preparing for medical treatment that is likely to make them infertile should be offered oocyte or embryo cryostorage as appropriate if they are well enough to undergo ovarian stimulation and egg collection, provided that this will not worsen their condition and provided that sufficient time is available.

	<p pid="a.2177W.2/1">Article 13<i>(l)</i> <i>(c)</i> (iii) of the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001 gives the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) powers to ensure that individuals satisfy the prescribed requirements as to knowledge of English. Requiring all applicants from outside the European Economic Area to undertake the International English Language Test avoids discrimination on the basis of potentially misleading assumptions about country of origin and culture. It also provides a better safeguard than relying on the application form alone.</p>

	<p pid="a.2183W.3/2">The consultation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on the proposed reclassification of Simvastatin 10 milligrams as an over-the-counter medicine elicited 100 responses. About one third were supportive of the proposal, one third opposed and one third were not opposed but raised issues. This was the position put to the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), which also had access to the full responses when giving its advice. The consultation raised no issues not already considered by the CSM when its advice to consult was formulated.</p>
	<p pid="a.2183W.3/3">An error in the summary placed on the MHRA's website following the announcement of the decision to allow Simvastatin 10 milligrams to be sold in pharmacies had no bearing on the robustness of the deliberations of the CSM. The outcome of consultation was properly presented to the CSM and to Health Ministers. In light of this, no further assessment would be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.2183W.3/4">The error did not come to light until after the evidence sessions of the Health Select Committee's inquiry into the influence of the pharmaceutical industry were complete. The MHRA has written to the Clerk of the Health Select Committee to draw attention to the reference made in an annexe to a letter to the Committee, following the evidence session on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-03">3 February 2005</phrase>. The annexe referred to the report of the outcome of the consultation displayed on the MHRA website. A copy of the letter has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.2183W.3/5">To ensure complete transparency, the MHRA now publishes the responses to all consultations on wider availability of medicines&mdash;most recently for chloramphenicol eye drops&mdash;electronically or summarised on the MHRA's website.</p>

The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs has considered whether they should be controlled and concluded that they did not give rise to a social problem justifying their control. There are health risks attached to using poppers, particularly for those with chest or heart problems, anaemia or glaucoma. They should never be used.</p>

Such attacks can attract maximum sentences of between six months and life. The fact that a victim was serving the public is one factor already taken into account by the courts in sentencing and the Sentencing Guidelines Council have issued guidelines identifying this as a serious aggravating factor. The Sentencing Advisory Panel is due to issue a consultation in the summer on sentencing of violent crime, which we expect will also refer explicitly to an aggravating factor of a victim serving the public.</p>

The White Paper Building Communities, Beating Crime&mdash;A better police service for the 21st Century&quot; proposed changes to strengthen the calibre, representative nature and democratic legitimacy of police authority membership including a possible approach to two-tier areas, together with proposals for unitary areas. The Government are considering the way ahead in the light of the responses to the White Paper. Legislation would be needed to give effect to any changes to the membership of police authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.2203W.5/2">The number of hours that prisoners are permitted to spend out of their cells will vary across the estate. Some establishments may record in excess of 20 hours a day. This will reflect the prison's open category where the level of security is such that prisoners have the right to associate freely for most or all of the day and have broadfreedom of movement within the prison. Other establishments display considerably less time out of cell available due to the need for greater supervision and attention.</p>

At <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June 2005</phrase>, 24,180 officer grade staff (prison officers, senior officers and principal officers) were employed at public sector prison establishments (excluding Headquarters). A breakdown by each establishment is contained in the following table. Information on staffing levels within prisons managed by the private sector is not collected centrally in this form and is therefore not available.</p>

	<p pid="a.2221W.3/1">The total number of work permits issued in each of the last three years to employers based in the UK in respect of permit applications made to recruit overseas nationals for work related to the 'computer services' was:</p>

	<p pid="a.2221W.3/12">These figures relate to all jobs in the sector, not just for those in information technology. However, it may be the case that not all the overseas nationals issued with a work permit were successful in gaining entry clearance to take up their employment in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.2221W.3/13">Information is not available on the number of work permit holders who have failed to return to their country of origin. In addition we are not able to provide information on the notifications received by companies about permit holders who have either not taken up their employment or where their employment has ceased.</p>
	<p pid="a.2221W.3/14">The Five Year Strategy for Asylum and Immigration announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-07">7 February</phrase> set out the Government's intention to place obligations on the sponsors of migrants, including an intention to require employers to report if a migrant leaves the employment for which they were admitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.2221W.3/15">Moreover, the Government have announced their plans to introduce an e-Borders (electronic borders) programme. e-Borders is a medium to long-term multi-agency initiative to re-shape the United Kingdom's border protection structure. It is co-ordinated by the Home Office Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) in partnership with key border control, law enforcement and intelligence agencies: HM Customs and Revenue, the Intelligence Agencies, the Police Service and UK Visas. Other Departments and agencies such as the Department of Work and Pensions and the Passport Service are involved as major beneficiaries of the e-Borders concept.</p>
	<p pid="a.2221W.3/16">The concept is based upon identifying and checking passengers and their travel credentials well in advance of their commencing travel to, or from, the UK rather than making these checks at the end of their journey. The full e-Borders system is expected to process passenger information on flights arriving in and departing from the UK at all major ports by 2010. e-borders is initially being trialled as Project Semaphore.</p>
	<p pid="a.2221W.3/17">The information that is captured of every passenger passing into or out of the UK will, for the first time, give us specific information on who is in or out of the UK, and for how long and under what status or conditions. This information will be available to other parts of IND, the Home Office and other Government Departments.</p>
