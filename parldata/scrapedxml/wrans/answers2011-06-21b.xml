	<p pid="b.131W.6/1">The Treasury Solicitor's Department (TSol), Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Serious Fraud Office (SFO) each have their own accounting officer. The accounting officer for TSol also covers the Attorney-General's Office (AGO) and HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate.</p>
	<p pid="b.131W.6/2">TSol uses contract mechanisms to support the timely payment of their accounts in situations where sub-contractors are used to deliver services. The main expenditure using sub-contractors is for temporary administrative staff. These utilise the OGC Buying Solutions framework conditions, which include a clause requiring the contractor to pay all sums due to the sub-contractor within the period specified in their subcontract, and not to exceed 30 days.</p>
	<p pid="b.131W.6/3">Building maintenance services, which would be specifically covered by construction works mentioned in the Government's Fair Payment guidance, are provided as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.131W.6/4">(a) For TSol headquarters office at One Kemble Street such services are provided under a lease arrangement with a private sector landlord which does not include reference to guaranteeing timely payments to sub-contractors.</p>
	<p pid="b.131W.6/5">(b) For the AGO office at Victoria Street, such services are provided under a separate contract, which does not include any terms relating to the timeliness of payments to sub-contractors. However new contractual arrangements are envisaged which will include provision about the timeliness of such payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.131W.6/6">TSol's standard terms and conditions for services used for low value purchasing do not enable suppliers to sub-contract.</p>
	<p pid="b.131W.6/7">The SFO normally uses contracts provided through OGC frameworks. The SFO indicate that on occasions when they undertake to issue their own contracts they use the model terms and conditions available from the Office of Government Commerce' website, which includes clauses ensuring that contractors sub-contracting pass on Fair Payment practices.</p>
	<p pid="b.131W.6/8">The CPS has a limited requirement for construction services. When it does, it is their policy to use the Office of Government Commerce's model terms and conditions for construction wherever practicable. These provide for the prompt payment of contractors within specific periods and for lead contractors to adopt similar payment terms for any sub-contractors used.</p>

The figures in the tables below show the availability expressed as a percentage of the forward fleet that was categorised as fit for purpose, which I hope you will find helpful. I have also added figures for the first three months of 2011 in order to bring the information as up to date as possible. As there is always an expectation that some maintenance tasks will be carried out and the fleet numbers are small, the figures would never reach 100%. The Forward Fleet comprises aircraft which are serviceable and those which are short-term unserviceable, and could therefore be recalled if needed at short notice. Fit for purpose (FFP) aircraft include only serviceable aircraft available to the front-line commands for operational and training purposes.</p>

Our Embassy in Bogota has made numerous representations in respect of his case and the delay in bringing it to trial. There is still no date set for Mr Agamez's trial. While we cannot interfere directly in the Colombian judicial system we continue to express our concern about the delay, which is extreme.</p>
	<p pid="b.153W.3/2">Our increased engagement with Latin America and strategic partnership with Colombia provide a platform on which we can engage fully with the Colombian Government, including on human rights. I visited Colombia in May and took the opportunity to emphasise to President Santos the importance we continue to place on human rights. During my meeting with Vice President Garzon he reassured me of the determination of the Colombian Government to create a culture of zero tolerance for human rights violations'. I expressed our full support, but also stressed that much remained to be done. There are some signs of improvement; extrajudicial killings have reduced significantly over the past two years and a Victims and Land Restitution Bill which will return land to those from whom it was forcibly removed was recently signed into law. Despite these positive advances significant challenges remain. We will continue to raise our human rights concerns with the Colombian Government, including in relation to individuals who have been detained for long periods without trial.</p>

Not only is much of the channel's output inaccurate and biased, but it has filmed and broadcast the forced confessions obtained under duress of individuals detained in Iran without access to fair trial. One such broadcast led to a complaint which was recently investigated and upheld by Ofcom, the UK's independent communications industry regulator.

	<p pid="b.161W.9/1">No pubs have transferred under the Advancing Assets programme which was managed by the Asset Transfer Unit and funded by the DCLG between 2007 and 2011, and which has focussed on local authority assets. The DCLG continues to fund the unit to provide advice and guidance mainly to local authorities and community groups to assist the transfer of publicly owned assets to the community. The unit rarely advise groups seeking to take over pubs, and have done so only on three occasions since January.</p>
	<p pid="b.161W.9/2">Pubs are extremely important assets for this country, contributing to the economy and providing local jobs. They can also provide local hubs that strengthen community relationships and encourage wider social action.</p>
	<p pid="b.161W.9/3">The Government want to help to protect local pubs where they are important community assets, and to ensure that they are working in the best interests of the communities they serve. The Government have introduced provisions in the Localism Bill for a Community Right to Buy to give community groups a fairer chance to bid to buy assets of community value (which could include, for example, the last pub in a village) by being able to nominate such assets for listing, and having the time to prepare a bid for listed assets when they are put up for sale.</p>
	<p pid="b.161W.9/4">We are strongly supportive of the work of organisations which advise community groups seeking to acquire pubs, for example, the Pub is the Hub and the Plunkett Foundation, both of which offer advice and guidance and disseminate good practice to community groups wishing to take over and manage pubs.</p>
	<p pid="b.161W.9/5">We are currently considering the use of a number of social finance initiatives (such as the development of community shares and the big society bank) which will make it easier for community organisations to gain the necessary finance without reliance on central Government grants.</p>

	<p pid="b.168W.0/1">The London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG) is a private company independent of Government, but it has kept me informed of their ticketing strategy as it has developed. LOCOG's aims have been to raise the revenues it requires to stage the Games; to provide affordable and accessible tickets; and to deliver full venues. Of the 8.8 million tickets available for the Olympic Games, 75% are being made available through the UK application process to the public. Of these, 2.5 million will be &#163;20 or under.</p>

	<p pid="b.168W.3/1">Following the good work of the Olympic Delivery Authority during the build phase, all 2012 delivery partners are clear that they wish to continue to minimise inconvenience to local residents. However, given the scale of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, some disruption is inevitable.</p>
	<p pid="b.168W.3/2">It will be 'business as unusual' in the summer of 2012. Transport for London are currently engaging with businesses to explain the transport challenges that the capital will face with the increase of spectators next summer. There will be a public information campaign next year. There has been public consultation on the Olympic and Paralympic route networks which affect just 0.1% of London roads. Extensive consultation and engagement with people who may be affected by the Olympic Transport Plan has been under way since the first version was published in 2007, with the most recent version being published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-01">1 June</phrase>. Minimising the impact on business as usual is at the heart of the transport operations being delivered for the games.</p>
	<p pid="b.168W.3/3">Games venues that require planning consent have been put forward for pre-consultation setting out potential disruptions, and measures to mitigate them. Plans have then been adapted based on feedback from the local community.</p>

	<p pid="b.168W.6/1">There are no free tickets. As part of its contract with LOCOG, each commercial partner has the right to purchase at face-value a small number of tickets to attend the Games. 8% of tickets are available to sponsors and stakeholders, but these do not come from the 75% of tickets available through the UK application process to the public.</p>

	<p pid="b.169W.2/1">We are committed to ensuring that illegal touting of tickets does not spoil the Games. The London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (Amendment) Bill, currently before Parliament, proposes increasing the maximum penalty for illegal reselling of Games tickets from &#163;5,000 to &#163;20,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.2/2">In addition, the London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG) and the Metropolitan Police Service's dedicated unit to respond to serious and organised crime networks targeting the Games economy&#8212;Operation Podium&#8212;are working to deal with organised ticket crime, counterfeiting and Olympic-related fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.2/3">Through the UK application process, LOCOG's ticketing system will help to make sure that tickets get into the hands of fans who will want to attend. For a variety of reasons, some people will however want to sell their tickets. LOCOG's resale platform, the official London 2012 ticket exchange website, will be available early next year for anyone wishing to sell or exchange the tickets that they purchased. This will be the only legal selling mechanism and will provide a safe and secure gateway without resort to touting.</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.2/4">LOCOG is urging people to beware of unauthorised websites which claim to sell tickets to London 2012, and to use their website checker on:</p>

	<p pid="b.169W.5/1">Inclusive design has been incorporated from the start of the Olympic Delivery Authority's (ODA) design process, so that the Olympic Park, Olympic Village, and new transport services, will be accessible to people with a wide range of disabilities both during and after the games.</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.5/2">The ODA has adopted a Built Environment Access Panel (BEAP) and Access and Inclusion Forum (AIF), who have worked closely with designers to build accessible solutions into the designs. All planning applications have included &#8216;Access Statements&#8217;&#8212;bringing accessibility and inclusive design into the planning process.</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.5/3">In 2008 the ODA published its Inclusive Design Strategy and Standards setting out the framework for how the Olympic Park will be designed and constructed to be inclusive to all. This can be found at the following link:</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.5/4"><a href="http://www.london2012.com/documents/oda-publications/inclusive-design-standards.pdf">http://www.london2012.com/documents/oda-publications/inclusive-design-standards.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.169W.5/5">The London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG) is responsible for staging both the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and will ensure that they will be as accessible and inclusive as possible. LOCOG's approach has been to adopt accessible solutions throughout, which minimises the need for any transition in athletes' facilities from an 'Olympic' to a 'Paralympic' mode. LOCOG works closely with the International Paralympic Committee which visits London every six months to run through all the plans in detail, including venues, accommodation and transport. In addition, LOCOG has its own Athletes' Committee to ensure athletes' interests are represented.</p>
	<p pid="b.169W.5/6">LOCOG's ambition is for disabled spectators to have a great games experience equivalent to non-disabled people. They have involved communities of disabled people as it has developed tailored services and products, and appointed an Accessibility Manager to lead on this area. Accessibility initiatives can be found on the London 2012 website at the following link:</p>

However, under Ofcom's Broadcasting Code due care must be taken over the physical and emotional welfare and the dignity of people under 18 who take part or are otherwise involved in programmes. This is irrespective of any consent given by the participant or by a parent, guardian or other person over the age of 18 in loco parentis.

	<p pid="b.181W.3/1">There is no evidence to suggest that the proximity of Approved Premises to schools or other children's facilities increases the likelihood of further sexual offences being committed against the children in those schools and facilities. There are, therefore, no plans to extend the criteria by which child sex offenders are excluded from Approved Premises. The placement of individual offenders to a particular Approved Premises will continue to be decided on the individual circumstances of each case.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.3/2">Approved Premises provide the most effective means to manage certain high risk of harm offenders in the community, particularly during the critical period of release from custody. All are equipped to provide a range of controls and offender management measures not available in other community facilities; these include curfew, 24 hour staffing, CCTV, monitoring of residents' movements and behaviour, room searching and drug testing. Many of the offenders supervised in Approved Premises are managed within the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements. There are robust enforcement arrangements in place, including immediate recall to prison where residents are in breach of their licence conditions or the rules of residence.</p>

	<p pid="b.181W.6/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.6/2">(1) The Probation Instruction 07/2011 provides probation staff with guidance on what to include on a licence.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.6/3">The Instruction can be located on:</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.6/4"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/guidance/prison-probation-and-rehabilitation/psipso/pi_07-2011_licence_conditions_final.doc">www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/guidance/prison-probation-and-rehabilitation/psipso/pi_07-2011_licence_conditions_final.doc</a></p>
	<p pid="b.181W.6/5">The overriding aims of licence conditions are to protect the public, prevent re-offending and secure the successful re-integration of the offender into the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.6/6">There are standard conditions to which any offender on licence is subject. Any additional conditions placed on an offender's licence must be necessary to manage the level of risk in the community and proportionate in that there is no less intrusive method of addressing that particular risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.6/7">There is no specific guidance in respect of diversity issues, but offender managers and prison governors are expected to take into account all relevant issues, including any relevant diversity considerations. All prison and probation instructions are reviewed by the National Offender Management Service Race and Equality Action Group, prior to publication, which ensures that diversity issues are properly considered.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.6/8">(2) Many additional licence conditions, including those that require an offender to comply with a curfew, are worded in such a way that they can be amended or adapted at the discretion of an offender manager. The reasons for amending a condition locally can vary, for example, gradually reducing a curfew in response to appropriate compliance as an offender approaches the end of the sentence, or adjusting requirements to address offending behaviour according to the availability and suitability of offending behaviour programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.6/9">Information on the number of occasions on which offender managers have varied or amended an offender's licence condition is not held centrally; to obtain such information would involve a manual exercise of looking at individual records and as such, would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.6/10">In addition, offender managers may seek to have licence conditions varied by requesting that additional conditions are inserted or removed. Requests for seeking additional conditions or the removal of conditions are normally based on the fact that an offender's circumstances have changed since being released or new areas of risk have been identified and need to be appropriately managed.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.6/11">The variation of licence conditions is undertaken either by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) on behalf of the Secretary of State or, where the Parole Board is responsible for determining licence conditions, the request for licence variation is referred to the Parole Board.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.6/12">NOMS does not hold centrally data on the number of requests it receives for licence variation. To provide this information would involve a manual exercise looking at individual case records and this would incur disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.6/13">In January this year, the Parole Board introduced a report enabling it to extract data on the number of requests it receives to vary licence conditions. Between January and May it received 370 such requests. The Parole Board does not hold comprehensive data before this point.</p>
	<p pid="b.181W.6/14">(3) The number of offenders on licence and who have been recalled to prison for breaching their licence conditions for the period April 2007 until December 2010 is:</p>

	<p pid="b.195W.3/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.195W.3/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Darra Singh</p>
	<p pid="b.195W.3/3">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking: what estimate he has made of the savings to his Department of the closure of the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (IIDB) Office within Hartlepool Jobcentre Plus; and how many staff will be affected by the closure, how many live within Hartlepool constituency and what other locations such staff will be required to work in. This falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.195W.3/4">It is anticipated that the decision to close 22 Benefit and Contact Centres will save &#163;14 million by 2015. It is not always possible to be specific about the savings that will be realised through the closure of individual sites. Hartlepool IIDB centre is a prime example as it is co-located with a Jobcentre that is not set to close. Under such circumstances Jobcentre Plus will negotiate with estate provider Telereal Trillium to achieve savings by handing back whole floors of a building or it will explore the inward co-location potential.</p>
	<p pid="b.195W.3/5">There are currently 55 staff working in the Hartlepool Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Office. The information requested on staff addresses by constituency is not collated centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.195W.3/6">All of the staff in the Hartlepool Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Office will receive an offer of redeployment within Jobcentre Plus&#8212;either locally or further afield. There may also be additional opportunities for redeployment into other Civil Service posts, both within and outside our own Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.195W.3/7">Having examined the redeployment potential, we have identified that Stockton Benefit Centre, Middlesbrough Contact Centre and Sunderland Benefit Centre all offer some scope. However, the immediate priority of Jobcentre Plus is to understand the individual circumstances of the members of staff affected. Each member of staff will have an individual consultation meeting with their own manager to discuss the closure, their personal circumstances and preferences, and the options that are available to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.195W.3/8">It is worth emphasising that Hartlepool Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Office will close in 2012/2013 (the other closures that we announced on 13th May 2011 are set to close in the next 12 months). This grants us extra time to plan and arrange suitable redeployments for the staff at Hartlepool.</p>

	<p pid="b.198W.21/2">The UN currently categorises more than 40% of the country as high-risk for international humanitarian organisations due to a steady increase in security incidents since early 2008. Humanitarian access is particularly limited in the southern region of Afghanistan due to the escalation in insurgency and counter-insurgency activities.</p>

	<p pid="b.200W.6/2">To ensure UK aid continues to offer good value for money all programmes are rigorously monitored to ensure the expected results are achieved cost-effectively. We are currently strengthening the existing processes in place for review of our programmes annually during implementation and at completion, which will place greater emphasis on results and value for money. The new approach will be introduced early in 2012 for all projects currently subject to annual review and for all projects newly-approved from January 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.6/3">As part of the UK Aid Transparency Guarantee, all business cases and reviews are published on DFID's website. This way we are ensuring UK aid expenditure is open to public scrutiny. In addition, I have set up an independent body, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI), to evaluate the impact of UK aid. ICAI are able to review any part of the UK aid programme including aid spent in fragile contexts.</p>

We believe that the best way to avoid ill-treatment is to make sure that we do not return those who are at risk. We do this by ensuring that trained caseworkers make the right decisions based on the circumstances of each individual case, and by providing a right of appeal to the independent courts.</p>

	<p pid="b.217W.2/1">The UK Border Agency constantly strives to provide a high standard of customer service at the border and is committed to expediting the entry of legitimate passengers and trade that help build the UK economy while at the same time maintaining a secure border.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.2/2">As a demonstration of the importance we place on passenger clearance times, our targets and performance against them will be published this year (2011-12) as part of the Government transparency agenda. This will enable members of the public to be fully sighted on average passenger clearance times, based on samples taken across the UK's ports and airports. Our current target is to clear 95% of EEA passengers within 25 minutes of joining the queue and non-EEA passengers within 45 minutes. Current year to date performance sits at 98% and performance is closely monitored to ensure that deployment of resource is flexed to deal with increases in traffic and maintain overall passenger clearance times while ensuring the border remains secure.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.2/3">While we do not measure performance against average waiting times we do record them and the details requested are in the following tables:</p>

	<p pid="b.232W.5/1">The recent Government response to the fast-track review of Feed-in Tariffs confirmed the Government's intention to introduce new tariffs for solar photovoltaic (PV) installations of between 50 kilowatts (kW) and five megawatts (MW) and all stand-alone installations. We consider that, under the new tariffs, some schemes will continue to be viable, particularly under the new tariff for 50kW to 150kW projects. This, together with activity at the domestic scale, will contribute to the development of a viable PV industry in Great Britain.</p>

	<p pid="b.234W.2/1">The Government's first national child poverty strategy was set against the backdrop of a challenging spending review that placed a high priority on improving the life chances of children and protecting vulnerable families, while also making crucial progress in reducing the nation's deficit. To improve life chances, we will tackle head-on the causes of poverty which underpin low achievement, aspiration and opportunity across generations. To help achieve these goals, the Department has introduced a number of initiatives specifically targeted at the most vulnerable children and families in our society:</p>
	<p pid="b.234W.2/2">the Fairness Premium worth &#163;7.2 billion over the spending review period;</p>
	<p pid="b.234W.2/3">the Pupil Premium worth &#163;2.5 billion a year to 2014-15;</p>
	<p pid="b.234W.2/4">the Early Intervention Grant worth &#163;2,222 million in 2011-12 and &#163;2,307 million in 2012-13;</p>
	<p pid="b.234W.2/5">the 16-19 Bursary Fund which guarantees the most vulnerable 16-19-year-olds bursaries of &#163;1,200 a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.234W.2/6">The Government's localism agenda enables local areas to agree their own tailored and place-based approaches to tackling child poverty. The Child Poverty Act 2010 established a framework for local partners to co-operate to tackle child poverty in their areas, and the sector-led support package should build capability further. In addition, local areas have access to a Child Poverty Core Offer of sector-led support to help them tackle child poverty. As part of this Offer, we will be sharing the practice and learning from the Child Poverty pilots that have run in over 70 areas over the last three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.234W.2/7">The roll-out of Community Budgets, payment by results and social impact bonds, together with an increased focus on evidence-based early intervention, will further support local areas to establish innovative approaches to tackling child poverty.</p>

We have made no assessment of the materials used in primary and secondary schools for the teaching of sex education, and have no plans to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.235W.0/2">All schools must have regard to the Secretary of State for Education's statutory guidance, &#8220;Sex and Relationships Education (2000)&#8221;, when teaching sex education. This is designed to protect pupils from teaching and materials which are inappropriate having regard to the age and religious and cultural background of the pupils concerned. Inappropriate images should not be used nor should explicit material not directly related to explanation.</p>

We know however that concerns have been expressed about this guidance. The coalition Government are reviewing schools guidance as part of their commitment to reducing bureaucracy. In reviewing this set of guidance we will seek to improve the clarity. New guidance will help all schools understand their legal obligations to provide information to parents about their child's progress, including that separated parents should be treated equally wherever possible.</p>

We will work to enhance the competitiveness and resilience of the food chain, including farms and the fish industry, to help ensure a secure and environmentally sustainable supply of food. Currently the UK produces the equivalent of 74% of indigenous foods and 60% of our food overall.</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.2/3">The Fruit and Vegetable Taskforce on increasing consumption and production brought together the whole supply chain to identify and unblock barriers; they reported in summer 2010 and agreed an action plan in October 2010. The action plan was divided into production, supply chain and consumption. Most recommendations, which are fairly technical, have made significant progress and we are looking to produce an-updated progress report later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.2/4">We will also work to create an environment where consumers are able to make informed choice, including working with industry for better information provenance and quality of food e.g. encouraging the whole food supply chain to work together to provide clearer origin information and working with specialist producers to help them apply for registration under the protected food name schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.244W.5/1">The Government's clear commitment to tackle the deficit resulted in a tough spending review for all Departments. Although the Forestry Commission (FC) is a non-ministerial Government Department, it receives its budget from DEFRA's Resource Budget. The net costs for voluntary exit and redundancy schemes will be met by DEFRA where there is sound business rationale and value for money. DEFRA has to achieve a reduction of 30% in real terms over the spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.5/2">The FC worked closely with Ministers so they could take decisions on an appropriate spending review settlement to ensure the delivery of key outcomes such as biosecurity. The FC's settlement, which equates to a reduction of around 25% over the next four years, also took account of FC England's ability to generate income from operating the public forest estate e.g. through timber sales. The restructuring of FC England, FC Great Britain and Forest Research has been based on offering a combination of voluntary exit and voluntary redundancy schemes. The latest estimate of likely costs for these exits in each of the next four years is as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.246W.5/1">The Environment Agency has identified 15 barriers to fish migration on the River Trent. All can be passed at some flows by salmon with varying degrees of difficulty. Progress in tackling these barriers is at varying stages. In some cases, the design of fish passes has been completed and negotiations have started on implementation. In other cases, further work is needed to determine what fish passage measures are needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.246W.5/2">Some of these barriers are at weirs which are the subject of proposals for hydropower development. For its part, British Waterways is working with a number of hydro-electricity station developers to construct hydro plants at most of the River Trent weirs below Shardlow. All of these plants incorporate a fish and eel pass.</p>

	<p pid="b.248W.2/2">The quality of waters off the coast of England used for bathing and by shellfish has improved over the last 30 years as a result of significant investment. The National Environment Programme, which forms part of United Utilities' Asset Management Plan for 2010-15, includes schemes designed to improve the quality of shellfish and bathing waters.</p>
	<p pid="b.248W.2/3">The environmental improvements included in the North West and Solway Tweed River Basin Management Plans will help deliver improvements to the water quality of the Irish sea, as required by the water framework directive. The Environment Agency has also completed a review of all environmental permits that could impact on the European designated estuarine and coastal sites adjacent to the Irish sea under the habitats directive. Required improvements will be implemented through changes to environmental permits through the river basin planning cycle of the water framework directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.248W.2/4">Under DEFRA's Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Initiative there are four priority catchments to mitigate diffuse pollution from agriculture and help improve water quality in the areas. Phase 3 of the initiative (which runs from 2011-13) is likely to expand into four further catchments to improve estuarine and coastal waters.</p>
	<p pid="b.248W.2/5">We have implemented the Nitrates Directive (Council Directive EEC/676/1991) by introducing the Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations 2008. This legislation is intended to reduce the loss of nitrates from agricultural land (the major source of nitrate in our surface and ground waters) in areas where watercourses are polluted with these.</p>

	<p pid="b.248W.2/7">31 beaches on this section of the English coast are designated as bathing waters under the Bathing Water Directive (76/160/EEC) and there are 14 shellfish waters designated under the Shellfish Waters Directive (2006/113/EC). These directives set water quality standards and are therefore drivers for improvement to coastal water quality.</p>

	<p pid="b.256W.8/2">The Department's commitment to cut bureaucracy and burdens on the frontline has implications for how we communicate with key audiences. Sending blanket communications on issues such as medical conditions awareness is not an effective way to reach schools. Direct communications to schools are restricted to very high priority, or key operational, information. The DfE website is now our primary mode of communicating with schools&#8212;the relevant information on this issue can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.8/3"><a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/pupilsupport/pastoralcare/health/b0013771/managing-medicines-in-schools">http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/pupilsupport/pastoralcare/health/b0013771/managing-medicines-in-schools</a></p>
	<p pid="b.256W.8/4">However, schools are under a legal duty to promote the well-being of their pupils. They are key settings for improving the health of children and young people. Good schools will be active promoters of good health in childhood and adolescence, including focussing on healthy eating, increasing physical activity and the provision of personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education. Teachers may choose to explore awareness of medical conditions and their causes as part of PSHE education.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.8/5">We encourage other organisations, such as employer and staff associations and charities such as Diabetes UK, to play their part in supporting schools and parents and in sharing good practice, including raising awareness among schools of diabetes among South Asian children.</p>

The White Paper will build on the &#8220;Vision for adult social care: Capable communities and active citizens&#8221;, which was published in November 2010. It will also set out the Government's response to the recommendations of the Law Commission, published in May 2011, to modernise the social care statute and the recommendations of the independent Commission on the Funding of Care and Support on how to assure a fair, affordable and sustainable funding system for care and support, which will be published in July 2011.</p>

The Government's principal concern is for the safety and well-being of the residents of care homes that might be affected. We have undertaken to ensure they are protected; whatever happens, no resident will find themselves homeless or without care. The Government will not stand by and let that happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.266W.6/4">Departmental officials have been in frequent contact with Southern Cross's senior management over the last three months and that will continue. We are engaged with the company, the landlords and lenders and are monitoring the situation very closely.</p>
	<p pid="b.266W.6/5">The Government are acting to ensure that all parties involved are working towards a swift resolution with a comprehensive plan for the future, which must have at its heart the welfare of residents.</p>
	<p pid="b.266W.6/6">The Government are also working closely with the Association of Directors of Adult Social services, the Local Government Association, local authorities and the Care Quality Commission to ensure that robust local arrangements are in place to address the consequences in the event that the company's restructuring plan fails to put the business on a stable footing.</p>

	<p pid="b.267W.2/1">The Care Quality Commission (CQC) is the independent regulator for health and adult social care in England. Providers registered with the CQC must comply with 16 safety and quality requirements set out in regulations made under the Health and Social Care Act 2008. These 16 requirements include a requirement on staffing. This requires the registered provider to take appropriate steps to ensure that, at all times, there are sufficient numbers of suitably qualified, skilled and experienced persons employed to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of service users. The regulations apply to providers of a wide range of services and do not specify staffing ratios.</p>
	<p pid="b.267W.2/2">The CQC is responsible for assuring compliance with the regulations. The CQC undertakes reviews of compliance with the regulations and where it finds non-compliance, the CQC has powers to take enforcement action. The CQC may issue improvement or compliance actions and the provider is required to send a report to the CQC setting out the action it is taking to achieve or maintain compliance. The CQC may also take enforcement action. The CQC may carry out follow-up reviews to ensure that the actions have been undertaken to achieve compliance.</p>
	<p pid="b.267W.2/3">The CQC will take the necessary steps to assure itself that Southern Cross continues to comply with the requirement to ensure that adequate staffing is in place at all times and that its homes also continue to comply with the other 15 safety and quality requirements. The CQC is aware of Southern Cross's proposals to save money through staff cuts and the risk that these cuts may directly affect the safety and quality of services. The CQC's primary concern is always to ensure the health, safety and welfare of people who use services. Though the CQC's responsive system of compliance monitoring, where there is any indication of increased risk of non compliance with the registration requirements, the CQC is following up through additional planned or responsive reviews to check compliance. Where the CQC finds non compliance it will act swiftly requiring improvements to be made within a specified time period. The CQC has powers to take strong enforcement action should the provider fail to make the necessary improvements.</p>
	<p pid="b.267W.2/4">The Department is working closely with the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, the Local Government Association, local authorities and the CQC to ensure that contingency plans are in place which will allow for the continuation of care for residents in Southern Cross homes under any eventuality. There are frequent discussions between the parties involved.</p>

The 18 SIs include measures to simplify, update and modernise the regulatory frameworks within the Department's responsibility. For instance:</p>
	<p pid="b.272W.3/3">The Education (Student Loans) (Repayment) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 amends the Education (Student Loans) (Repayment) Regulations 2009 (SI 2009/470) to ensure that the student loan repayment system remains aligned with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) self assessment and pay as you earn (PAYE) processes which are used to collect student loans.</p>
	<p pid="b.272W.3/4">The Export Control (Libya) Order 2011 updated export controls in the light of developments in Libya</p>
	<p pid="b.272W.3/5">The Insolvency (Amendment) Rules 2011 modernise and simplify procedures to enable insolvency cases to be administered more efficiently and facilitate the use of electronic communications between those involved in the insolvency process, including within the Royal Courts of Justice. No costs are expected with this measure, but there will be a benefit of &#163;0.2 million per year as certain debtors previously unable to access Debt Relief Orders (DRO) will now be able to access debt relief.</p>
	<p pid="b.272W.3/6">The Insolvency Proceedings (Fees) (Amendment) Order 2011 increases the amount of the deposit payable on presenting a petition for bankruptcy or winding up. This is to ensure that those who benefit from the insolvency regime rather than the taxpayer should fund the cost. There is an economic transfer of &#163;4.7 million between debtors and taxpayers. This is the only one of the 18 measures to impose a significant cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.275W.6/1">I take the &#8220;environmental, social and human rights guidelines set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Common Approaches&#8221; to be the standards which should be used in an environmental review carried out pursuant to the Common Approaches. The guidelines apply, or do not apply, as the case may be, to individual projects. The Common Approaches contain within them a number of tests as to whether the guidelines should apply. Some are such that all transactions which the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) carries out within the terms of a particular scheme will fall outside the applicability of the guidelines. In other cases the individual terms of projects will have to be considered.</p>
	<p pid="b.275W.6/2">Examples of schemes under which all transactions would fall outside the scope of the Common Approaches are those projects which benefit from official supported export credit with a repayment term of less than two years. This would include ECGD's new export working capital and foreign exchange credit support products.</p>
	<p pid="b.275W.6/3">There is a lack of clarity in the Common Approaches as to whether support given pursuant to a bond support scheme such as ECGD's new scheme is capable of falling within the definition of &#8220;officially supported export credits with a repayment term of two years or more&#8221;. ECGD is treating applications for such support as within the definition quoted above if the bond for which support is sought has a tenor of two years or more. There will be further questions as to whether the incidents of any particular project for which bond support is requested mean that it is a project to which the guidelines should apply.</p>

	<p pid="b.282W.2/1">With respect to reducing the number of unprocessed patent applications at the European Patent Office and on a global level, I refer to my answer given on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-16">16 June 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-06-16.963"><i>Official Report</i>, column 963W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.282W.2/2">The Intellectual Property Office of the UK is itself working with offices from a number of other countries on work-sharing initiatives to reduce duplication of effort, and thereby to reduce patent application backlogs. Moreover, the Intellectual Property Office is pursuing a managed reduction in the stock of patent applications awaiting substantive examination. This is being achieved through matching resources to projected long-term demand, efficiency improvements, and selective use of overtime. The Office met its target of clearing all outstanding patent examinations older than 49 months by March 2011 and has been set a new target of reducing this figure to 42 months by March 2012.</p>

This timetable enables us to take into account the experience in Wales, where a charge will come into force in October 2011, and the results of the European Commission consultation that is currently being undertaken on a number of possible options for reducing the use of plastic carrier bags, including charging and a ban.</p>
