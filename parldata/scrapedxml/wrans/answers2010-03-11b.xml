The Minister also met with FARDC officers and UN Peacekeeping troop commanders in South Kivu, in eastern Congo, and was encouraged by their considered approach to the newly mandated operation, Amani Leo, where they have created a method for vetting FARDC commanders before collaborating with them, shifted emphasis to predominantly civilian protection and developed a robust message on zero tolerance and the need to maintain professional standards. We will continue to monitor the mission through our staff on the ground and UN, non-governmental organisations and independent reporting.</p>

	<p pid="b.430W.3/1">The Partnership Support Programme, run by the Alcohol Strategy Unit identified 50 CDRP areas where they expected to see action to tackle binge drinking and related antisocial behaviour. These areas are being encouraged to engage with their communities about the damaging effects of irresponsible drinking and the action they are taking to address problem areas. A total of &#163;1.5 million has been distributed between the 50 CDRPs for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.3/2">12 selected CDRPs on the partnership support programme have received specialist strategic consultancy to develop sustainable communications plans to engage local communities and tackle people's perceptions of the issues. The consultancy included research dissemination and feedback, the facilitation of communications workshops and the development of communications strategies. This is supported by ongoing liaison with regional Know Your Limits stakeholders; providing them with promotional materials to run their campaigns about irresponsible drinking and keeping them informed of Home Office activity and news.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.3/3">We provide support to CDRPs and other stakeholders who have questions and requests about the Know Your Limits campaign. This includes information about materials available to them, using logos and amplifying campaigns locally, advice on the type of communication programme that they could run in their area, as well as general communication guidance and best practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.3/4">The Know Your Limits advertising campaign targets 18 to 24-year-olds to prompt them to reconsider their behaviour around binge drinking. Throughout the summer adverts appeared on websites, radio, TV and in magazines. The cost of media for the financial year 2009-10, excluding production and fees was &#163;1,661,612.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.3/5">Additionally, we have funded a number of adult and young people's alcohol arrest referral projects. These seek to offer a brief intervention to individuals who have been arrested for an offence, and are under the influence of alcohol. A total of &#163;1.6 million has been spent on these arrest referral projects during the financial year 2009-10.</p>

It is based on economic modelling of the costs and support for renewable technologies in the electricity, heat and transport sectors. The data below is based on the lead scenario from the Renewable Energy Strategy for large-scale electricity, which reaches 29 per cent. large-scale renewable electricity in 2020, and includes estimates of onshore wind additionally brought on through feed in tariffs. However these numbers are just an illustrative mix on how we could reach 29 per cent. large scale renewable generation. The Government do not set targets for individual energy generation technologies but takes a market-based approach to generation.</p>

However we require all secondary schools to be in line with the Department's current area guidelines. For example, Building Bulletin 98 'Briefing Framework for Secondary School Projects', published in 2004 and Building Bulletin 82 'Area Guidelines for Schools', published in 1996. Prior to 1996 schools had to comply with statutory Minimum Teaching Area.</p>

It excludes 'quick win' projects (those in wave 1 of BSF that were accelerated for early completion) and 'one school pathfinders' (single projects for those local authorities in later BSF waves).</p>

	<p pid="b.462W.5/1">Two contenders, which could fill the Light Protected Patrol Vehicle (LPPV) requirement, are currently being assessed as part of a Concept Vehicle Evaluation. It is expected that this assessment phase will be complete in early April 2010. It is currently assessed that 200 LPPV will meet the need in Afghanistan. These 200 vehicles will form the first batch ordered under an Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) as soon as the design was ready, in order to get them into theatre as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.462W.5/2">Until the full military requirement has been refined we judge that it makes sense to order an initial batch of 200 vehicles with a view to further buys in future. Buying vehicles in tranches allows us to learn lessons, to modify the vehicle if necessary and helps speed up the delivery of future orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.462W.5/3">Due to commercial sensitivities, and while the full requirement is being refined, I am unable to comment on the likely cost of the full LPPV order, or the funding arrangements. I can, however, confirm that the initial batch of 200 vehicles will be funded from the Treasury reserve as a UOR. This will be over and above the &#163;280 million for additional equipment announced by the Secretary of State for Defence on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-15">15 December 2009</phrase>. A business case will be submitted for the initial 200 vehicles in the coming weeks, once the assessment is complete. As the contract for the LPPV requirement has yet to be let, delivery details cannot be confirmed at this stage as they are still subject to commercial negotiations, but we intend that they should be delivered in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="b.464W.5/1">Flight endurance and fuel consumption depend on a number of factors including payload, operating altitude, weather conditions (including ambient temperature) and speed. To achieve maximum endurance, the aircraft types requested would have to be flown with no operational weapons and would be fitted with the maximum number of additional external fuel tanks instead. Combat aircraft do not fly in this configuration when conducting operations, as this would negate their combat capability.</p>
	<p pid="b.464W.5/2">For academic purposes given the same atmospheric conditions, a single-engine turboprop aircraft such as the Super Tucano flying in this configuration would have greater endurance and lower fuel consumption rate than fast jet types but would have less endurance than turboprop unmanned aerial vehicles like Reaper.</p>
	<p pid="b.464W.5/3">Fast jet aircraft have significant advantages in terms of faster transit times, higher operating altitudes and greater weapons, avionics and defensive aids payloads. This provides greater operational flexibility and agility. Furthermore, unrefuelled flight endurance is a relatively minor factor for fast jets, as the Tornado, Harrier and Typhoon would benefit from air-to-air refuelling.</p>

	<p pid="b.474W.2/2">Complaints received by the ICO are recorded and logged in a casework management system. The complaints are then allocated to a caseworker for investigation. Of a total of 22,237 complaints received in the financial year 2008-09, the ICO took more than eight months to allocate 1,552 cases for investigation. The ICO allocated a total of 20,681 complaints for investigation within eight months of receipt in 2008-09, with four cases still awaiting allocation.</p>
	<p pid="b.474W.2/3">A complete picture for the current financial year is not yet available. However, in quarters one to three of 2009-10 the ICO received 18,463 complaints. To date, 318 of these complaints were more than eight months old when allocated for investigation. In the first three quarters of 2009-10, 16,561 complaints were allocated within eight months of receipt, notwithstanding a 21 per cent. increase in freedom of information complaints and a 42 per cent. increase in the number of data protection complaints in comparison to the same period in the previous financial year. The remaining 1584 requests had yet to be allocated for investigation at the end of the third quarter. This information has been provided by the ICO.</p>
	<p pid="b.474W.2/4">The Information Commissioner is committed to speeding up the complaint handling process in his Office. The ICO is changing its internal systems and processes to focus on closing less complex cases more quickly. Additional grant in aid over and above its baseline funding has also been made available by the Ministry of Justice to help the ICO reduce its backlog of freedom of information cases in this financial year and the previous four.</p>

	<p pid="b.475W.0/1">The MMR vaccine litigation involved allegations that, as a consequence of a national vaccination campaign, children were very seriously injured because the vaccine in question was defective. Legal aid funding, which covered litigation services, advocacy and disbursements for experts, was granted in the early stages of the case, and was supported by the opinions of leading counsel, which took into account the expert evidence available at the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.475W.0/2">The Legal Services Commission (LSC) is obliged to review continually the merits of funded litigation, and to withdraw funding where a case no longer meets the legal merits test. Funding for MMR claims was therefore discontinued when they no longer met this test. Since the MMR vaccine cases concluded, the civil legal aid Funding Code guidance has been revised, and there are now more stringent criteria for funding high-cost cases, and a presumption that legal aid will not be used to fund new scientific research.</p>
	<p pid="b.475W.0/3">We are not aware of any assessment of the ethical approval of procedures carried out as part of the expert evidence provided for this case. This would be a matter for the General Medical Council, not the Ministry of Justice or the LSC. The LSC has no plans to recover legal aid fees paid to Dr. Andrew Wakefield in connection with expert advice in the concluded MMR litigation.</p>
