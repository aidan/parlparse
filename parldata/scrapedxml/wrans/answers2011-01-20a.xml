These estimates may include DC pension wealth held in more than one pot. They exclude those individuals with zero pension wealth.<br/> 2. We provide figures for both mean and median DC occupational pension wealth. The median may provide a better measure compared to the mean since the distribution of private pension wealth can be skewed by a small number of very large amounts of wealth at the top of the distribution.<br/> 3.

A further 21,186 are awaiting transportation south from Khartoum, with a current average rate of return of 1,500 to 2,000 people per week.

	<p pid="a.890W.0/2"><i> </i>Network Rail is a private sector company. Decisions on the remuneration of its staff are matters for the company, in which the Government have no powers to intervene.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.0/3">Under a condition of its network licence Network Rail is required to maintain a management incentive plan, which is used to determine the remuneration of the company's senior executives. This must be submitted to the independent Office of Rail Regulation for approval or amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.0/4">The Government welcomed the announcement that Network Rail has suspended its management incentive plan pending a joint review with the Office of Rail Regulation. This review must be fundamental and far-reaching. Any future incentive system should be more transparent and based on the principle that bonuses are not an automatic right, but should focus on rewarding exceptional long-term performance.</p>

	<p pid="a.896W.2/1">In common with other Departments, this was a tough comprehensive spending review for the Department. However, as a result of the Government's changes to the national lottery, UK Sport had its funding confirmed for the remainder of the London 2012 cycle and a similar level of funding available for the start of the Rio cycle. Sport England, after a small fall in 2011-12, sees its funding rise by 14% over the spending review period.</p>

	<p pid="a.906W.3/1">Since April 2008 the Ministry of Defence (MOD) in common with all other central Government Departments has participated in the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) Property Benchmarking Service, which captures office space utilisation of occupied offices having a net internal area over 500 m<sup>(2)</sup>. For 2009-10 (the latest date for which figures are available) the position is:</p>

	<p pid="a.906W.3/10">The MOD policy on space provided per employee follows the guidelines set out by the OGC. The space provided per employee for new acquisitions and major refurbishments is eight square metres.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.3/11">The MOD has no central policy on hot desking. Individual areas of the Department are responsible for arrangements locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.3/12">The MOD provides a range of flexible working patterns, including home working which are promoted as part of its overall work/life balance package. Managers are required carefully to consider any requests from staff for home working, but it is not always possible to support a request due to business reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.3/13">Data on how many employees it has on average per desk are not held.</p>

	<p pid="a.906W.12/1" class="letterinlibrary">I will write to the hon. Member shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.12/2" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Peter Luff to Angus Robertson:</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.12/3" class="indent">I undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Questions on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-21">21 December 2010</phrase>, (Official Report, column 1203), about transport aircraft being leased by the MOD.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.12/4" class="indent">The Ministry of Defence does not currently lease transport aircraft. We did lease four C-17 aircraft from Boeing between 2001 to 2008 at a fixed price. Costs of operating those aircraft during the period of the lease broken down by flying hour could only be provided at a disproportionate cost. The four leased C-17 aircraft were bought-out on cessation of the seven year lease period in autumn 2008 and are now owned by the Government. We have subsequently purchased three further C-17 aircraft from Boeing.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.12/5" class="indent">As I explained in the answer I gave on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January 2011</phrase> (Official Report, column 235W), we do, however, currently charter aircraft (i.e. contract through an airline broker with private companies to fly Ministry of Defence (MOD) personnel and equipment). Such charters are largely to transport personnel and equipment in direct or indirect support to operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.12/6" class="indent">The number of aircraft chartered by MOD will vary significantly at any point in time. For example the deployment of new equipments or for unit change-overs may necessitate the charter of additional aircraft. Information is held covering the period from November 2007 until the end of February 2011 (including pre-allotted tasks). The information is held for one-way tasks (or journeys). The number of individual 'aircraft chartered', would be lower owing to the significant number of round-trips undertaken. The tasks have been undertaken by a variety of aircraft types depending on both the load size and whether passengers or freight was transported.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.12/7" class="indent">From November 2007 to end February 2011, the Department has chartered approximately 8250 journeys. For the month of January 2011, the Department has chartered 132 aircraft to support 206 tasks (or journeys).</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.12/8" class="indent">Details of the cost of chartering aircraft broken down by aircraft type and by flying hour over a six year period could only be provided at disproportionate cost, but I am able to advise that total cost of chartering transport aircraft by financial year (excluding military aviation fuel, but including civilian aviation fuel costs) is as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.906W.12/11"> <td><i> Financial year</i></td> <td><i> &#163; million</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.906W.12/12"> <td>2006-07</td> <td>70</td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.906W.12/19" class="indent">The steady increase in spend reflects the increasing size of the deployed force in Afghanistan and the increasing tempo of operations. This was partly offset in 2008-09 to 2009-10 by the withdrawal from Iraq but each tonne of cargo flown to Afghanistan travels considerably more distance than a tonne flown to Iraq, particularly given the requirement for flight routes to avoid Iran. It must also be borne in mind that the landlocked nature of Afghanistan coupled with security constraints demand that we fly much more cargo as a proportion of the total than we did into Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.906W.12/20" class="indent">We would not expect the Op HERRICK charter costs to rise in Financial Year 2011-12 as on current assumptions we do not see our force structure or the sustainment requirement increasing. Costs may however rise as a result of fuel price increases.</p>

	<p pid="a.910W.2/1">In the last 12 months, no RAF E-3D Sentry has been involved in search and rescue missions. E-3D Sentry is optimised for the air-to-air role and its radar has a limited maritime search mode. I am withholding details on the capability of the E-3D radar to detect, identify and track vessels under 300 gross tonnes as its disclosure would, or would be likely to prejudice the capability, effectiveness or security of the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.910W.2/2">There is no formal training requirement for E-3D Sentry crews on specific long range search and rescue techniques. However, an E-3D Sentry participated in a NATO-led SAR training exercise in May 2010. In addition, during normal routine training sorties in UK airspace, crews are trained on an opportunity basis in the operation of the radar's maritime search mode.</p>

	<p pid="a.923W.9/13">The FSA future areas for research are prioritised on an annual basis as part of its business planning process, against its strategic needs and to address identified gaps in the evidence base. These will take into account recent Machinery of Government changes, which altered the FSA remit, and the refresh of the FSA's Strategic Plan and Science and Evidence Strategy which is currently out to consultation, ending <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-11">11 February 2011</phrase>. It is therefore not possible to say at this time what levels of funding will be allocated to research and development in agriculture over the next four years, but it is likely to be a similar picture to the most recent reports cited above.</p>

I do not anticipate any significant change in the proportion of research and development/other evidence commissioned in the next four years. However, it is difficult to be definitive about this as the figures include a significant ring-fenced unallocated evidence provision retained for 2012-13 onwards. This will be allocated annually according to the DEFRA chief scientific adviser's advice on the evidence priorities at the time. The exact proportion of the evidence total spent on research and development may vary depending on this advice.</p>

	<p pid="a.925W.2/2">It is important to ensure that large retailers cannot abuse power by transferring excessive risks or unexpected costs onto their suppliers, as risks and costs should be shared appropriately throughout the supply chain. Benefits should also be shared appropriately, including with consumers. While the revised Groceries Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP) is a great improvement on the previous regime, the power that large grocery retailers can wield over their suppliers can still create pressures on small producers, which ultimately may impact on consumers.</p>

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's counter proliferation department and the UK arms control and disarmament mission in Geneva lead on the negotiation of an arms trade treaty and are supported by many other departments and posts across the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's extensive network, and expertise from across Whitehall.

	<p pid="a.929W.9/1">The Government have not yet made a decision on our participation in the meeting in September to commemorate the 10<sup>(th)</sup> anniversary of the World Conference Against Racism. We recognise that it is common practice for the UN to convene meetings at regular periodic intervals to commemorate the adoption of its various social and human rights-related agendas such as the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. But previous meetings on this issue, including the initial World Conference Against Racism as well as its 2009 review conference, were overshadowed by unacceptable and offensive anti-Semitic rhetoric and behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.929W.9/2">UK officials will work closely with colleagues in other countries to ensure that the September meeting does not become another platform for such behaviour and that the meeting addresses all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism. We will also work hard to ensure that any outcome from the meeting includes a clear statement on the need to further combat anti-Semitism as part of wider efforts to combat racism. Our position on participation and representation will remain under review as a result of these efforts.</p>

	<p pid="a.935W.7/1">These emissions are considered. Under internationally agreed guidelines, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of fossil fuel to dry the biomass prior to combustion for energy are estimated and reported by the country where the drying takes place.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.7/2">Greenhouse gas emissions associated with the combustion of biomass are counted as zero at the power plant under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. This is because the corresponding changes in terrestrial carbon stocks are estimated and reported in the land-use change and forestry sector of the country where the harvesting for biomass took place, and are therefore not counted again at the point of use. This does not prevent the UK from using a life cycle approach in its domestic policies. The UK Government are introducing sustainability criteria for the use of solid and gaseous biomass, other than waste or wholly derived from waste, to generate electricity under the renewables obligation (RO) from April this year. These sustainability criteria include a minimum greenhouse gas emissions saving of 60% compared to fossil fuel and general restrictions on the use of materials from land important on carbon or biodiversity grounds. The greenhouse gas emissions will be assessed across a lifecycle that includes the emissions associated with the processing of feedstocks such as drying.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.7/3">Following a transition phase, where solid and gaseous biomass plants over 50 kW will be required to report on their performance against the criteria, from April 2013, solid and gaseous biomass electricity plants of 1 MW and over will be required to meet these criteria in order to receive support under the RO.</p>

	<p pid="a.941W.5/1">The impact of unconventional gas production on the development of low-carbon energy in the UK will be principally driven by its impact on UK gas prices. The impact of further unconventional production on UK prices will depend on the extent and location of any production, whether production levels exceed or fall short of market expectations, and how it alters the costs of the marginal source of gas supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.941W.5/2">However, the prospects for unconventional gas are only one driver for gas prices. The future path of UK gas prices will also be driven by the global demand for gas, the price of other fuels, the tightness in different parts of the supply chain, the reliability of different supplies and the cost of producing conventional gas.</p>
	<p pid="a.941W.5/3">Under current market arrangements, if gas prices were to fall and if there were not an offsetting increase in carbon prices then this could result in less investment in low-carbon generation and greater investment in gas-fired generation. The opposite could result if gas prices were to rise.</p>

	<p pid="a.942W.8/1">It has not been necessary to seek independent scientific advice. There is a robust regulatory system in place to ensure any environmental implications are minimised. These would be assessed on a site-specific basis by the Environment Agency (EA), in England and Wales, via their role as a statutory consultee in the planning process or as part of their consideration of the need for, and subsequent response to, an application for an environmental permit (under the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010). The EA has its own in-house technical expertise which is used to support its role in protecting and managing water quality and resources and this expertise is available to Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.942W.8/2">In addition the British Geological Survey (BGS) has geological expertise and holds the nation's base data on geological conditions. On behalf of DECC, BGS recently carried out a study on the prospectivity of shale gas in the UK. The study has been placed on DECC's oil and gas website and can be found via the following weblink:</p>

In respect of the sustainability of wood as a feedstock, Government policy is that mechanisms beyond the planning system in the form of the renewables obligation are better placed to ensure the sustainability of fuel used in large-scale biomass electricity generating stations.</p>

Liquid HLW is stored at Sellafield in custom designed tanks before being immobilised in a passively safe, solid glass waste-form, through a process known as vitrification. The solid HLW is safely stored and monitored in a purpose built store at Sellafield pending return to overseas customers or final disposal in the proposed geological disposal facility. The UK has a strong and effective nuclear safety regulatory regime that ensures the safe storage and management of radioactive waste including HLW.</p>

Incapacity benefit appeals take on average 11.81 weeks and employment support allowance appeals 9.2 weeks from the date of the original DWP decision to arrive at the Tribunals Service. The Tribunals Service is currently clearing 62% of incapacity benefit appeals and 65% of employment support allowance appeals within 16 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.953W.9/18">Performance below target has resulted from an unexpectedly high level of appeals, particularly against employment support allowance decisions. In response, the Tribunals Service has significantly increased its capacity and, nationally, 47% more Social Security and Child Support appeals were cleared in September 2010 compared to September 2009. Further capacity increases are in hand.</p>

In buildings which are not suitable for flexible working, the MOJ is working towards providing a maximum of 10 square metres per person across its administrative estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.955W.14/2">There is currently 14.7m<sup>(2)</sup> and 1.2 desks per full-time employee across the estate and the MOJ is working to reduce this figure and ensure more efficient use of its property.</p>

	<p pid="a.957W.5/1">As has been the practice for a number of years Ministers do not directly receive draft Independent Monitoring Board reports when the IMBs submit them. The reports are firstly submitted to the IMB Secretariat. Then NOMS officials prepare a draft response to all the points on which the individual IMBs have requested a response both directed to Ministers and NOMS. I then consider the reply and, having also examined the issues raised directly for Ministers, write to the Chair. At the time of the disturbance the Board had submitted its report and the draft response was being prepared. The report was available in Gold Command directing the incident at Ford, where I first saw it. It was confirmed to me that the report would form part of the documentation of the investigation into the incident. I will respond to the Chair of the IMB in February after I have been informed of the findings of the NOMS investigation report.</p>

	<p pid="a.958W.11/1">The information requested is not held centrally and could only be obtained by contacting individual prison establishments at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.958W.11/2">Prison Service Order 4460 (Prisoners' Pay), a copy of which has been placed in the House Library, sets out minimum rates of pay and requires Governors (and Directors of contracted prisons) to devise local pay schemes that reflect regime priorities of their establishment. A snapshot survey of prisoner pay undertaken in 2007 indicated that the average weekly rate of pay for prisoners undertaking work and other activities was &#163;9.60.</p>
	<p pid="a.958W.11/3">There is no recognised definition of the term &quot;paid work schemes&quot; for prisoners. Prisoners have access to a range of work depending on the local regime. These include cleaning, catering and laundry work, workshops producing goods for internal and external markets, and workshops run by contractors. Around 450 low risk prisoners in open prisons work outside in individual work placements.</p>

The work done on a further six of these recommendations has revealed that further action is either unnecessary or impractical. The remaining recommendation is that enforced cell sharing should be eliminated. The National Offender Management Service remains committed to this as a high priority, and it has been considered as part of each new capacity building programme and project. There is no target for the implementation of this recommendation. We are not in a position to create enough places to be able to address the problem of overcrowding, but remain committed to providing safe, decent and secure places for those in custody.</p>

	<p pid="a.962W.2/1">It is for councils to decide how they support carers' centres in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/2">In addition, central Government recognise the importance of carers and are keen to ensure that we focus on the key activities that will make the greatest impact on improving carers' lives. 'Recognised, valued and supported: Next steps for the Carers Strategy', published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-25">25 November 2010</phrase>, sets out the priorities for action over the next four years. The four key priorities are:</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/3" class="indent">Supporting those with caring responsibilities to identify themselves as carers at an early stage, recognising the value of their contribution and involving them from the outset both in designing local care provision and in planning individual care packages;</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/4" class="indent">Enabling those with caring responsibilities to fulfil their educational and employment potential;</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/5" class="indent">Personalised support for carers and those they support, enabling them to have a family and community life;</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/6" class="indent">Supporting carers to remain mentally and physically well.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/7">The Department will provide additional funding of &#163;400 million to the national health service over the next four years to enable more carers to take breaks from their caring responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/8">The Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2011-12 says that:</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/9" class="indent">&quot;It has not always been apparent how funding to support carers has been used in each PCT. The Spending Review has made available additional funding in PCT baselines to support the provision of breaks for carers. PCTs should pool budgets with local authorities to provide carers' breaks, as far as possible, via direct payments or personal health budgets. For 2011/12, PCTs should agree policies, plans and budgets to support carers with local authorities and local carers' organisations, and make them available to local people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/10">The Department have also made up to &#163;6 million available for general practitioner (GP) training, to increase their awareness and understanding of carers' health needs so that they can receive appropriate support.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/11">The Department for Education announced earlier in December that they are providing &#163;800 million over the next four years for short breaks for parent carers of disabled children as part of the new Early Intervention Grant. The Government will be providing &#163;198 million, &#163;202 million, &#163;206 million and &#163;210 million for short breaks over the next four years. This figure includes the previously announced recycled Child Trust Fund money of at least &#163;20 million each year. The Early Intervention Grant is not ring-fenced and it will be for local authorities to determine how they use that resource to best effect, including what services would be funded for families with disabled children.</p>

Medical exemption certificates are valid for five years, after which they must be renewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.966W.6/3">When a prescription is dispensed, pharmacists are required to carry out a &quot;point of dispensing&quot; check of whether the patient has a valid exemption from prescription charges. If the patient does not present the required evidence, a prescription can still be dispensed free of charge, but the pharmacist is required to cross the &quot;evidence not seen&quot; box on the prescription form, in order that checks can be made at a later stage. If a patient does not provide evidence of exemption when the prescription is dispensed, he or she may subsequently be randomly selected for verification checks (by the primary care trust, local counter fraud section). At this point the patient would need to provide the relevant evidence or possibly face a penalty charge.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-01-20a.34940.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2011-01-20a.969W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40288" speakername="Anne Milton" colnum="969W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110120/text/110120w0003.htm#11012064000599">
	<p pid="a.969W.2/1">The Government's policy on influenza vaccination is informed by the expert advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The policy focuses on offering the vaccine to those at greatest risk from the effects of influenza. JCVI does not recommend that children under the age of five outside the at-risk groups should be vaccinated.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-30">30 December</phrase>, JCVI met to review its advice on seasonal influenza vaccination. It issued the following statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;JCVI was presented with data on the current seasonal influenza epidemiology, seroepidemological data collected during the 2009-10 pandemic, modelling of the impact of vaccination strategies during the pandemic, data on the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in the young and vaccine uptake and safety data.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.2/4" class="indent">JCVI noted that a large proportion of those individuals with severe disease are in recognised risk groups for influenza but were not vaccinated. JVCI re-iterated its previous advice that all individuals in risk groups should be vaccinated as soon as possible, particularly those aged less than 65 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.2/5" class="indent">The committee considered the issue of offering vaccination to healthy children either 0-4 years and/or 5-15 years of age. However, although there is a high incidence of influenza-like illness currently in these age groups, a significant proportion of this is due to other viruses such Respiratory Syncytial Virus. In addition, only a very small proportion of those with severe disease are in these age groups. Based on previous seasonal influenza epidemiology it would be hoped that influenza circulation will have subsided within a month. We do not believe that seasonal or pandemic vaccine should be used for these or other healthy person groups. The greatest gain will be achieved in increasing vaccine uptake in the clinical risk groups.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.2/6">No projections have been made of the number of deaths from swine influenza infection that may be prevented during the current influenza season by the current vaccination policy or an extension of that policy to include children under five years of age or other healthy age groups. Such projections, if conducted, would be highly uncertain as they would depend on a number of factors that are unknown or uncertain including, the existing immunity to swine influenza infection in different age groups of the population, the vaccination coverage in different groups of the population and how quickly immunity would accrue in these groups, and the effectiveness of vaccination.</p>
	<p pid="a.969W.2/7">As with all vaccination programmes, JCVI will keep this matter under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.974W.5/1">No fixed penalty notices (FPN) for motoring offences categories have replaced comparable offence categories in the last five years. There are around 200 fixed penalty traffic offences and for every one of these the police have the option of prosecuting rather than issuing a FPN.</p>
	<p pid="a.974W.5/2">Statistics on fixed penalty notices issued, broken down by offence category are published in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin &quot;Police Powers and Procedures, 2008/09&quot; and statistics on prosecutions for motoring offences are published in the supplementary volumes of Justice Publication &quot;Criminal Statistics-2008/09&quot;. Copies of both publications are available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.974W.5/3">The only offence that has been added to the penalty notice for disorder (PND) scheme for non-motoring offences in the last five years is the offence of cannabis possession which was added on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-28">28 January 2009</phrase>. Currently there are 25 other offences available under the scheme. A full list of PND offences can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.974W.5/5">All offences available under the scheme can still attract all existing disposals. PNDs are just one of a number of options available to the police which range from an informal warning, to a formal out-of-court disposal, to charging a suspect and prosecuting them at court. The nature and the seriousness of the offence, the harm caused and the offender's circumstances and previous criminal history will all be relevant to the police officer's decision on the most appropriate criminal justice response.</p>
