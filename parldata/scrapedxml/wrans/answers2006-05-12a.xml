This material is not shared with the public, as it contains operational policing information. The NCTT liaises with the Community Security Trust (CST) at the national level on behalf of the police service. Forces with significant Jewish communities liaise closely at the local level. The Home Office's assessment of community relations also draws upon advice from Government Offices who in turn are informed by a wide range of community sources.</p>

	<p pid="a.529W.9/2">Statistics on the location of asylum seekers in the UK are linked to the available information on the support that the asylum seeker receives. The number of asylum seekers supported by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) are published on a quarterly and annual basis, broken down by Local Authority. The next publication covering the first quarter of 2006 will be published on the 23rd May 2006, and will be available on the Home Office Research Development and Statistics website at <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html</a>. Data on asylum seekers supported by NASS broken down by parliamentary constituency are also available from the Library of the House. Separate arrangements exist for unaccompanied asylum seeking children who are supported by local authorities; the local authority receives funding from the Home Office for this purpose. As at the end of March 2006 NASS was reimbursing Kingston upon Hull for providing support to 13 unaccompanied asylum seeking children, this figure is based on management information.</p>

	<p pid="a.530W.8/1">The Government are committed to putting victims at the heart of the criminal justice system. In &quot;Rebuilding Lives: supporting victims of crime&quot; we set out our plans to improve support to victims of crime, by refocusing the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme to provide more financial help to those most seriously injured and immediate, practical help to other victims through delivering Victim Care Units.</p>
	<p pid="a.530W.8/2">The Code of Practice for Victims of Crime will help ensure victims get information about their case, and from April victims can enforce their rights through the parliamentary ombudsman. We are in the final stages of appointing a new Victim's Advisory Panel (the last panel has just completed their three-year tenure). The panel meets with CJS Ministers quarterly to advise on all aspects of services and support for victims of crime. We have increased the amount of money we spend on victims; Victim Support's funding has increased from under &pound;12 million to &pound;30 million .</p>
	<p pid="a.530W.8/3">We have set up 165 Witness Care Units across England and Wales, giving victims and witnesses a single point of contact to help them through the court process. We have allocated over &pound;3 million this year to improve accommodation facilities at court for witnesses. We have also consulted on proposals to pilot victims advocates in homicide cases. We have also established the Prosecutors' Pledge which sets out the level of service victims can expect to receive from prosecutors; reinforcing our commitment to victims.</p>

This IT system does not specify sexual offences against children as a separate category, so information is not available for those offences. The information requested on how many prisoners have been discharged from sentences from prisons in Hampshire is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.533W.0/3">The only way in which an offender would have been released before the half way point would have been on home detention curfew which, for prisoners sentenced under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, is statutory restricted to those sentenced to less than four years and not convicted of a grave offence. Those who are eligible are then subject to risk assessment. So few of these offenders will have been released before the halfway point.</p>

Comparison with the estimates that were made three and a half years ago is difficult because the changes introduced through the 2003 Criminal Justice Act are not the only ones to affect deployment of probation resources. We are monitoring the courts' use of the new sentences in the 2003 Act and, thus far, the sentences are being imposed broadly in line with the planning assumptions that informed the explanatory notes.</p>

	<p pid="a.536W.2/1">The Low Pay Commission reported that, in 2004, the pay gap for people with a work-limiting disability was 13 percentage points. This Department is not aware of any further data on the pay gap between disabled and non-disabled workers in Kingston upon Hull or the UK in the years 1997 to 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.536W.2/2">The Equal Opportunities Commission's Code of Practice on Equal Pay recommends that it is good practice for employers, when comparing the pay between men and women to also look at disability and seek advice from the Disability Rights Commission to ensure that the relevant provisions of the disability legislation are taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.536W.2/3">As a result of a strong economy and active labour market policies, the employment gap between disabled and non-disabled people is starting to close. The employment rate for disabled people was 38.1 per cent. in spring 1998, rising to 46.6 per cent. by spring 2005; over the same period, the employment gap fell from 35.1 per cent. to 28 per cent.</p>

This project arises from a visit made to Brazil by the UK Government's Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir David King, as part of the preparations for the UK G8 Summit in Gleneagles in July 2005. The final report on the study will be available for discussion at the Brazil:UK Science Days at the Royal Society on 22 and <phrase class="date" code="">23 May</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.541W.5/1">The Government have welcomed the work of an industry working group which is looking at options for greater use of paper free holding and transfer of shares. The responses to the &quot;Company Law Reform&quot; White Paper of March 2005 showed strong support for this initiative, but it is also clear that more information is needed on the costs and benefits of a paper free approach. The Government does not wish to rule out any option at this stage, and has therefore decided to extend the existing power relating to transfer of securities under section 207 of the Companies Act 1989 so that it could be used to require, as well as to permit, the paper free holding and transfer of company shares. In doing so, we wish to ensure that the new arrangements for paperless holding and transfer of securities do not deprive individual shareholders of existing rights which may be important to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.542W.10/1">The infection rate within a flock will depend on the stage at which the disease is detected. The rate of spread and local epidemiology within a poultry population will depend on many factors, but once the virus is introduced into a holding its rate of spread within the flock will be most strongly influenced by the virus strain, the host species and the production type.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.10/2">Recent incidents of low pathogenic H7 avian influenza in Italy have usually resulted in infection rates of 100 per cent., especially where the disease was not detected early and intervention strategies were not put in place. Early detection of low pathogenic viruses is particularly difficult since clinical signs are often very mild or not apparent. In the outbreaks of H7N7 highly pathogenic avian influenza in flocks in the Netherlands in 2003, 100 per cent. of birds became diseased when there was no early detection or intervention. The average infection rates for H7 or H5 avian influenza in flocks of poultry will depend on the influence of all of the factors mentioned above.</p>

Initially, samples are screened using a rapid, highly sensitive and specific real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR) that detects all influenza A viruses. Further tests of this type are used specifically for the detection of H5 and H7 subtypes, in addition to conventional PCR tests that provide information on the pathogenicity of the virus.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.5/3">In all cases involving suspicion of disease in poultry, or following positive detection in any host, virus isolation in embryonated fowls' eggs is carried out to provide further characterisation. In addition, especially for H5 or H7 viruses, blood samples are analysed for virus-specific antibodies using standard haemagglutination inhibition tests.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.5/4">As an international reference laboratory&mdash;and the EU community reference laboratory for avian influenza&mdash;the VLA takes a leading role in developing new technologies for diagnosis, together with the transfer and standardisation of such methodologies to other laboratories.

	<p pid="a.544W.8/1">The Department commissioned a report from Professor David Colman and Yaqin Zhaung, 'Changes in England and Wales Dairy Farming since 2002/03: A Resurvey', which was published last year. This showed that more farms had ceased production than had been previously indicated and there was a higher concentration of more profitable and larger herds among those that left. It reconfirmed previous findings which indicated that milk production is likely to fall.</p>
	<p pid="a.544W.8/2">Although the trend of farmers leaving the industry is not new, in terms of the sustainable future of the dairy industry, the apparent trend of some of the more efficient dairy farmers leaving the industry is worrying. We commissioned the report because we wanted some firm evidence of what was happening in the dairy sector. This is part of that evidence base. The Dairy Supply Chain Forum, chaired by my noble Friend, Lord Rooker, is working to understand why these farmers are leaving. While it is likely that profitability will be an important factor, there are also issues such as succession and possibilities for diversification which need to be considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.548W.11/1">Under both EU and international trade rules it would be illegal to ban the import of veal reared in crates. However, the UK opposes the use of veal crates, and banned them in this country in 1990. From <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2007</phrase>, veal crates will be banned throughout the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.554W.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-16">16 September 2005</phrase> Mark Haysom, the Learning and Skills Council's chief executive, announced proposals for a new structure for the organisation with the aim of making it more effective at identifying and responding to local learning and skills needs, and to achieve a less bureaucratic and more strategic relationship with partners and providers. It means that the LSC will spend less time on transactional processes and more time developing relationships with key partners and stakeholders. This requires fewer staff with a different set of skills. The calculation of savings of up to &pound;40 million, which could be released for the benefit of learners, was based on these priorities and a structure that will require some 1,100 fewer posts. The savings include staffing, property and related costs. Due to the complexities involved in the restructuring the level of savings may change.</p>

This research was conducted using a sample of addresses selected at random. It is not possible therefore to give figures by region.</p>

	<p pid="a.565W.2/1">The Department's radiation protection research programme supports a number of studies investigating the possible health effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF). A study by Dr. Draper and colleagues on childhood leukaemia and distance from power lines, funded under this programme and published in the British Medical Journal last year, has added to a large existing body of work in this area (BMJ, volume 330, <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-04">4 June 2005</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="a.565W.2/2">The Health Protection Agency's radiation protection division (HPA-RPD) keeps the world-wide research findings on EMF continually under review. In 2004, on the basis of a comprehensive review of the existing body of research to date, the HPA-RPD, previously the National Radiological Protection Board, recommended the adoption of new EMF exposure guidelines in this country. In addition, in view of the scientific uncertainties, the HPA recommended the Government ''consider the need for further precautionary measures&quot; in relation to power frequency electromagnetic fields. They have also noted that the majority of elevated magnetic fields are due to variations in the electricity supply and distribution system, the presence of substations and equipment in the home rather than proximity to power lines.</p>
	<p pid="a.565W.2/3">Practical precautionary measures are currently being considered in detail by a stakeholder advisory group (SAGE) that includes the Government Departments, agencies, electricity industry, specialists and public concern groups.

	<p pid="a.565W.5/1">The Health Protection Agency's radiation protection division (HPA-RPD) continually monitors the research relating to the potential health effects of electric and magnetic fields. Prior to April 2005, HPA-RPD was the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) and as such it undertook a comprehensive review of the scientific evidence relating to possible adverse health effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in 2004. This review is available on HPA's website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.565W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/publications/documents_of_nrpb/abstracts/absd15-3.htm">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/publications/documents_of_nrpb/abstracts/absd15&ndash;3.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.565W.5/3">It provides the basis of HPA advice on quantitative restrictions on exposure and other measures to avoid adverse effects. It explored evidence on the possibility of variations in sensitivity between different groups in the population including children.</p>
	<p pid="a.565W.5/4">The preparation of this review was carried out at the request of the Department and has particularly examined the issues of uncertainty in the science and aspects of precaution. In developing this review, NRPB took advice from individual United Kingdom and international scientific experts, and from published comprehensive reviews by expert groups. It sought advice from an ad hoc expert group on weak electric field effects in the body and gave careful consideration to the views expressed in response to a consultation document on its proposed guidelines issued in May 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.565W.5/5">Having considered the totality of the scientific evidence in the light of uncertainty and the need for a cautious approach, NRPB recommended that restrictions on exposure to EMFs in the UK should be based on the guidelines issued by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection in 1998.</p>

	<p pid="a.566W.2/1">Primary care trusts and predecessor organisations have responsibility for managing delivery of services provided by general practitioners (GPs); including the adequacy of their practice premises from which to provide services.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.2/2">Since 1997, there has been a 60 per cent. increase in investment in GP premises. Part of this was through the NHS Plan targets to refurbish or replace 3,000 GP premises and create 500 primary care centres housing services appropriate to meet the local need by December 2004. These targets were achieved through the replacement or refurbishment of 2,848 GP premises and 510 primary care centres. We expect to see an additional 125 of these primary care centres built by the end of this year and 2008 the total will stand at 750.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.2/3">In addition, there are many examples of new premises provided under the NHS Local Finance Investment Trust initiative (NHS LIFT) that fully satisfy minimum standards. The LIFT programme has contributed to this progress and has proven to be a tremendous success. Already some &pound;812 million in private sector and &pound;210 million in public sector funding has been injected into GP premises and community facilities across the country. There are 42 NHS LIFT schemes established with another eight in procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.2/4">This has, to date, delivered 68 new buildings open to patients with, on average, a building a week opening during 2006. In addition, we are injecting a further &pound;1 billion national health service capital this year specifically for new buildings and equipment. This money will further improve convenient access to health and social care.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.2/5">A subjective assessment by PCTs of the proportion of premises meeting the minimum standards as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> has been placed in the Library. This 2005 snapshot by PCTs shows that collectively they have judged some GP premises across the country as being below minimum standards. This needs to be set in context. Judgments for some of those standards are subjective which by their very nature may lead to some PCTs reporting higher levels of premises that do not meet minimum standards than other PCTs with similar premises. Being below minimum standards does not mean the buildings are in a dangerous state of repair. Rather, that the premises may not have for example, adequate access to and within premises and WC facilities for disabled patients and staff. Failure to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act requirements is a common reason for PCTs judging buildings as not meeting minimum requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.566W.2/6">This is not because of a lack of intent by GPs' practices and their PCTs to provide these facilities but because for example, the building is too small to incorporate them; with a general lack of suitable, alternative locations to develop. These are historic problems for inner city PCTs that predate this Government and arose from difficulty of investing in smaller buildings.</p>

	<p pid="a.567W.2/1">Approximately 150 primary care trusts are involved in the health trainer project with wide variations in the ways health trainers are trained for the role. However, most training starts with an initial classroom-based period of between 14 and 35 days, over several weeks, followed by supported learning and skill development in the workplace. This may then be followed by further classroom-based training to allow reflection upon what has worked and provide ongoing training tailored to the individual and local environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.567W.2/2">The mandatory competences, upon which the health trainer training is based, were signed off in March 2006. The training programmes are still being developed, evaluated and modified according to local requirements. Therefore, it is likely that the current programmes will be revised and the range of times to provide the training could change.</p>

The Healthcare Commission and the Commission for Social Care Inspection may undertake performance reviews to assess progress on local implementation of the NSF.</p>

	<p pid="a.575W.2/1">It is widely believe that net inward migration makes a positive contribution to growth of the UK labour force and employment. With respect to the labour market, since May 2004 employment levels in the UK have risen to record highs, in part due to the expansion of the work force from immigration.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.2/2">A paper entitled 'The Impact of Free Movement of Workers from Central and Eastern Europe on the UK Labour Market' (2006) published by the Department for Work and Pensions, suggests that the impact of migration from the new EU member states has been broadly positive, reflecting the flexibility and speed of adjustment of the UK labour market. The authors also found no discernible statistical evidence supporting the view that the inflow of A8 migrants is contributing to a rise in claimant unemployment in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.575W.5/1">Evidence from the most recent Home Office Accession Monitoring Report (February 2006) suggests that nationals from the Accession 8 countries continue to come to the UK to work, contributing to the success of the UK economy, while making very few demands of our welfare system or public services. Overall migrants make a net fiscal contribution to the UK. In many cases, Accession workers are supporting the provision of public services in communities across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.5/2">The Report finds that numbers applying for tax-funded income-related benefits, child benefit, tax credits and housing support remain very low. Only 3,270 applications for income support and jobseeker's allowance were received from Accession 8 migrants between May 2004 and December 2005, less than 1 per cent. of the total number of Workers Registration Scheme applicants in that period. Of these, only 195 were allowed to proceed for further consideration. The East Midlands region received 5.7 per cent. of these applications and the East of England received 7.9 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.578W.2/1">There is no facility available in the Ministry of Defence (MOD) for senior civil servants to use credit cards. However, the MOD does make use of the Government Procurement Card (GPC). The GPC is a VISA purchasing card where the account is settled in full by the MOD each month. As it is a charge card it does not attract any interest charges. The GPC is available to all staff having a business need, through specific delegations and controls to obtain goods and services on behalf of the MOD.</p>

	<p pid="a.580W.8/1">The Government, and many Members of the European Parliament, agree that the splitting of the European Parliament site is far from ideal. However, there is a legal and historical basis for the sitting. At the Edinburgh Council in 1992, member states adopted a decision that designated the European Parliament's seat as Strasbourg and committed the European Parliament to holding 12 plenary sessions a year there. Any change to the status quo would need the unanimous support of the 25 member states. Unfortunately, we do not think such unanimity is likely in the foreseeable future.</p>

	<p pid="a.583W.0/1">The responsibility for resolving Nepal's conflict ultimately lies with the people of Nepal, who need to take responsibility for, and ownership of, any peace settlement. But it is clear to us that a lasting solution to Nepal's problems will need the active support of the international community and the assistance of an independent and credible external partner.</p>
	<p pid="a.583W.0/2">We are exploring with the Government of Nepal, and with our international partners, whether and how such a third party role might be helpful, and what its mandate should be. One candidate might indeed be the UN and the UN Secretary-General has made several welcome offers of his good offices. The UN is seen as a credible partner in Nepal; the UN's Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights mission there has proved successful. If all the parties concerned, including our international partners, were to agree on a viable UN role, then the benefits could be significant. But it will still require political will on all sides to make this work and the UN is not the only organisation that could provide such assistance. If external facilitation is agreed there will most likely be financial implications in terms of arranging this. However it is too early to judge what these will be.</p>

	<p pid="a.584W.8/2">The UK has also committed &pound;1.25 million to the AU Inter-Sudanese Peace Talks on Darfur, of which over &pound;700,000 has been spent so far. This has been used to fund technical experts for the security arrangements, negotiations and financial assistance to support the running of talks in Abuja, Nigeria. We welcome the signature of the Darfur Peace Agreement by the Government of Sudan and the largest faction of the Sudanese Liberation Movement rebel group, Minni Minnawi, following efforts by the UK and others to agree a deal between the parties.</p>

	<p pid="a.586W.6/1">Most DCMS funding available to local authorities or voluntary sector bodies is distributed by the Department's public bodies.

However the Millennium Commission has recently invited applications from organisations willing to organise the UKSG in 2007&ndash;11 and which it is intended will receive funding from the Trust which the Commission, the Big Lottery Fund, Arts Council England and the Government plans to establish to support a diverse range of cultural and sporting initiatives associated with the London 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.

	<p pid="a.607W.2/1">The Department recently published a new leaflet aimed at all pregnant women as part of the THINK! campaign seatbelt strategy to engage with audiences that are more difficult to reach with a particular message through mainstream media channels.</p>
	<p pid="a.607W.2/2">The aim of the leaflet is to educate mothers-to-be on the importance of wearing a seatbelt correctly to protect themselves and their unborn baby and to promote messages on child car seats. The leaflet will be distributed to 4000 doctors' surgeries across the UK and will be displayed prominently on countertops and tables in waiting areas.

	<p pid="a.608W.5/2">The published values differ according to whether the transport user benefiting from the time savings is travelling in the course of work or in their leisure time. To reflect the empirical evidence, values for leisure time differ according to whether or not the travel time savings is for a commuting trip. The values for work differ by transport mode. The reason for this is that the work values are based on the cost savings to the employer and this average saving differs between modes.</p>
