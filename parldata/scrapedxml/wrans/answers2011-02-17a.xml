As part of this, we will consider how best to update Green Belt policy, currently set out in PPG2 (Planning Policy Guidance Note 2, Green Belts). Local planning authorities must have regard to PPG2 in writing development plans or deciding planning proposals affecting Green Belt. PPG2 establishes a presumption against inappropriate development on Green Belt land, and states the importance of keeping Green Belt land permanently open to prevent the sprawl of development.</p>

Abolition of regional strategies through the Localism Bill will also help protect the Green Belt by removing top down directives to review or weaken Green Belt protection in over 30 towns across England.</p>

The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has provided &#163;10 million additional homelessness grant funding. This will help local authorities in London to work with private landlords, for example, to encourage them to accept housing benefit tenants and offer &quot;rent bond&quot; schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.890W.9/2">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has increased discretionary housing payments by &#163;130 million, and provided a further &#163;50 million to support the transitional stages of change. DWP is temporarily extending local authority discretion to make direct payments of housing benefit to landlords when they agree to reduce rents to an affordable level. Detailed guidance on the application of this safeguard will be issued to local authorities shortly. More broadly, local authorities have continued to improve the time taken to decide new housing benefit claims. In the second quarter of 2010-11, new claims in Great Britain were decided in an average of 22 days, compared to 25 days in the same quarter of 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="a.892W.8/2">Spending decisions are, and will continue to be, a matter for local authorities. We have a rich diversity of voluntary organisations, charities, faith groups, cooperatives, social enterprises and local housing trusts-all of which already make a huge contribution to local life. I do not expect local authorities to pass on disproportionate cuts to other service providers, especially the voluntary sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.892W.8/4" class="indent">asking them to share examples of the positive approaches that they have taken to work with the sector, with a view to my Department drawing upon such approaches to highlight and promote best practice; and</p>
	<p pid="a.892W.8/5" class="indent">proposing to require all local authorities to publish details about their contractual grants and payments to the sector. This greater transparency would help local small businesses, community groups and social enterprises to become more competitive in bidding for and delivering local services to local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.892W.8/6">We are also, through the Localism Bill, taking forward our 'Rights' agenda. The Bill, which is presently at Committee stage, includes a community right to challenge. This will enable voluntary and community bodies, as well as parish councils and local authority employees wishing to deliver the service as mutual, to express an interest in running a local authority service, which may trigger a procurement exercise for that service.</p>
	<p pid="a.892W.8/7">The Bill also contains provisions for a community right to buy, which will enable communities to identify and nominate assets of community value in their local areas for listing by the local authority. When these assets come up for sale, voluntary and community groups will be given extra time to prepare a business case and be ready to bid for the asset when it goes on the open market.</p>
	<p pid="a.892W.8/8">We intend to develop a package of support to assist voluntary and community sector groups to take up both of these rights and we are consulting on what this support might look like.</p>

	<p pid="a.900W.5/1">The characteristic of best practice that the best practice tariff is intended to incentivise is a higher day case rate. The best practice tariff does not discriminate between Transurethral Resection of the Prostate and Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate treatments for prostate conditions, other than whether these procedures are undertaken as day cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.900W.5/2">The 2011-12 best practice tariffs for treatment of the enlarged prostate have been developed with the support of clinicians, including the President of the British Association of Urological Surgeons.</p>
	<p pid="a.900W.5/3">The draft 2011-12 tariffs were shared for 'sense check' in October 2010, and changes were subsequently made to the levels of the proposed tariff for resection of prostate by laser to reflect concerns that a day case rate target of 90% was overly ambitious for delivery in one year. A revised target of 30% was therefore agreed, and the draft 2011-12 tariff prices were increased accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.900W.5/4">The 2011-12 tariff prices were published for 'road test' on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-22">22 December</phrase>, since when it has been brought to the Department's attention that the published best practice tariff price for resection of prostate by laser contained a typographical error. The October 2010 'sense check' prices for this procedure had been inadvertently included, rather than the revised prices that were agreed for 'road test'.</p>
	<p pid="a.900W.5/5">The agreed prices for resection of prostate by laser will appear in the final tariff package for 2011-12 when it is published shortly.</p>

The level of fee, which will be set on the basis of full cost recovery, has yet to be determined. However, the fee is likely to be lower than current cremation certification fees, which it will replace. As cremation accounts for 73% of all disposals, the Government expect that most bereaved families will pay less under the new arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.913W.9/33">ISAF forces operating in Task Force Helmand's area of operations come from a number of different nations, which often operate closely alongside each other and alongside Afghan Army and police units. Without undertaking a detailed assessment of each engagement, it is not possible to define precisely in every case whether a contact involved UK forces, our ISAF partners, or Afghan units. Data are therefore collected on the number of incidents involving ISAF forces in Task Force Helmand's area of operations without attempting to identify the nationality of the forces involved in the contact.</p>

	<p pid="a.916W.14/1">The majority of waste recovered was inert and largely comprised of metal.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.14/2">Toxic or otherwise hazardous waste, including radioactive materials were transported back to the UK for disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.14/3">Lead, asbestos and 'exempt' radioactive radium wastes were consigned to landfill in Middlesbrough, at a facility suitably licensed to receive this material. Some 18.7 tonnes of uncontaminated lead was recycled at South Darley. Low level radioactive radium waste was sent via Winfrith, an organisation licensed to handle such material, to the UK low level waste repository in Drigg, Cumbria, which is licensed to accept such waste. The radioactive waste largely consisted of luminised dials from abandoned vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.14/4">The cost of the clean-up and remediation programme was &#163;9.1 million. The cost has risen from that previously given in answers to parliamentary questions due to the resolution of outstanding contractual issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.2/3" class="indent">Further to the holding response I provided to your question about serviceable aircraft, vessels and weapons systems that have been sold since 1997 (Official Report dated <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-19">19 January 2011</phrase>; column 826W), I am writing to provide a substantive response.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.2/4" class="indent">Serviceable equipment is characterised as that which has been sold to other governments for continued use as defence assets rather than those sold to commercial enterprises, either for use in another capacity or for recycling. Sales to other governments have the potential to strengthen international relationships; generate income that can be re-invested in defence; allows other governments to contribute to international security; and can also provide UK industry with opportunities to undertake some of the equipment regeneration work to meet the customer's requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.920W.14/1">At the time of the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) announcement there were approximately 242 RAF personnel directly involved in the MRA4 project. The number of Nimrod-related personnel to be made redundant under the Regular Armed Forces Redundancy Programme will not be known until the process has concluded. In line with normal practice, where a role comes to an end, the RAF will seek to reassign Nimrod-related personnel elsewhere within the service. However, in order to sustain the long-term balance and structure of the RAF, while implementing personnel reductions planned as part of SDSR, some personnel may be made redundant. We will seek to achieve this through voluntary applications, but it may be necessary to make some reductions through compulsory redundancies.</p>

	<p pid="a.923W.4/1">The Food Standards Agency's (FSA's) current interpretation of the EU Novel Foods Regulation is that approval should be sought before food from the offspring of cloned animals can be sold for human consumption.

	<p pid="a.923W.4/2">The Board of the FSA discussed animal cloning at its open meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-07">7 December</phrase> and subsequently advised Ministers that there were no food safety grounds for regulating foods from the descendants of cloned cattle and pigs and that it was minded to change its interpretation of the legislation.

Decisions on resource extraction in the region are also primarily a matter for the Arctic states concerned. We therefore support such extraction so long as robust environmental and safety standards are applied.</p>

	<p pid="a.924W.5/1">We have not commissioned a specific study to assess the effects of songbird population declines. Ecosystems and their constituent species provide human societies with 'ecosystem services', such as the regulation of pollution, provision of clean water, food, recreation and general well-being. Species interactions within ecosystems are complex and so declines in songbird populations may affect the services delivered. The UK's National Ecosystem Assessment is an independent assessment of the ecosystem services we get from nature, how they have changed over the last 50 years and how the choices we make may affect them in the future. The assessment is due to report in spring 2011 and will inform the development of the Natural Environment White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.5/2">The reasons for the long-term declines in songbirds vary from species to species but in farmland habitats are relatively well understood and relate largely to the intensification of agriculture, such as the loss of spring-sown crops, weedy stubbles and hedges and the increased use of pesticides and fertilizers. These changes have reduced the availability of nest sites and food resources such as insects and seeds.</p>
	<p pid="a.924W.5/3">Declines in other habitats are less well understood and we are funding ongoing research on woodland birds. Also through our conservation advisers, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, in partnership with bird conservation and research charities, we fund the majority of the monitoring that is summarised in the annual publication of the State of UK Birds which gives an overview of the recent patterns of change and the latest research to understand the underlying factors.</p>

	<p pid="a.925W.5/1">The UK is committed to reducing discards which are a clear waste of natural resources. This position is shared with Commissioner Damanaki (Maritime Affairs and Fisheries) who has publicly committed to tackling this unsustainable practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.925W.5/2">The UK is at the forefront of tackling discards, taking action domestically and by working to identify solutions at an EU level. We have undertaken a number of initiatives that have delivered excellent results. Project 50%, a collaborative project between fishermen and Government saw discards in the South West sole fishery reduced by over 50%. We are also pioneering an alternative &quot;catch quota&quot; management system which is based on managing and monitoring what is caught not just what is landed. Cod discards by those vessels in the trial have been reduced significantly as participants have been incentivised to fish much more selectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.925W.5/3">The common fisheries policy contributes significantly to the problem of discards and it is essential that it is fundamentally reformed. I have made this clear in my discussions with the Commissioner and am ensuring that crucial evidence gathered from the UK's discard reduction work is being used to influence and shape reform. I will be meeting the Commissioner and other European Ministers again on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-01">1 March</phrase> at a Discards summit; this will be another excellent opportunity for the UK to steer thinking and to pursue its aim of working to end this wasteful practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.930W.11/1">British Waterways has applied for a ministerial order under section 104(3) of the Transport Act 1968 (the Act) to be made in order to reclassify the 'remainder' parts of the Kennet and Avon canal to become a cruising waterway. Following public consultation as required under the Act, two objections to the order were received. A response from British Waterways to the issues raised in the objections was sought, and this was sent by DEFRA on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-20">20 January 2011</phrase> to the bodies who had objected, with a request for them to confirm whether they would be content to withdraw their objections or to make any further comments. Responses have only just been received confirming neither objection had been withdrawn. A decision by the Secretary of State on whether to allow the application for an order by British Waterways will be made in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.932W.8/1">The Government's policy on noise is set out in the Noise Policy Statement for England (NPSE) which was published in March 2010. It contains the high level vision of promoting good health and good quality of life (well being) through the effective management of noise. It is supported by three aims and together they provide the necessary clarity and direction to enable decisions to be made in any particular situation, both nationally and locally, regarding what is an acceptable noise burden to place on society.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.8/2">Implementation of the policy will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the management of noise and will reduce the circumstances where noise has a significant adverse impact on health and well being.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.8/3">To implement this, officials have been working closely with other Government Departments to ensure the NPSE is reflected in relevant policies. For example, the consultation documents for the Public Health White Paper, &quot;Proposals for a Public Health Outcomes Framework&quot; and the Local Transport White Paper all contain references to the NPSE.</p>
	<p pid="a.932W.8/4">Officials have also been working with other stakeholders to demonstrate how the NPSE can enable decisions to be made regarding what is an acceptable noise burden to place on society, at a local level.</p>

	<p pid="a.934W.16/1">There are serious humanitarian challenges in northern Sudan, particularly in the Darfur region, the three Eastern States (Red Sea, Kassala, and Gedaref) and in the Three Areas (Blue Nile, Southern Kordofan, and Abyei). The UK's biggest contribution to humanitarian assistance in Sudan is through the UN-managed Common Humanitarian Fund. In 2009 (which is the last year for which we have confirmed results), the UK's assistance to the Common Humanitarian Fund provided emergency shelter and essential household items for two million people, sustained a water supply to 725,000 people, delivered antenatal care for 100,000 pregnant women in Darfur, and rehabilitated eight primary health care centres serving more than 500,000 people. The UK delivers further humanitarian assistance in northern Sudan through our partnerships with NGOs such as MedAir International. For example, in the last six months of 2010, MedAir delivered 4,291 Safe Delivery Packs for pregnant women in West Darfur and Southern Kordofan.</p>

	<p pid="a.935W.2/1">The UK Government remain committed to supporting the further strengthening of the international humanitarian system. The Department for International Development (DFID) has commissioned two major reviews which will help establish the UK's future approach when responding to natural disasters. The Multilateral Aid Review (MAR) is assessing value for money of UK contributions to multilateral organisations, including UN agencies and others covering humanitarian and disaster risk reduction issues, while the Humanitarian Emergency Response Review (HERR), an independent review assessing the UK's own humanitarian emergency response capability, will offer some reflections on our partnership with UN agencies during emergency responses.

These include a stronger focus on results, improvements to the way in which the bank assists fragile and conflict-affected states, improving its approach to the needs of girls and women, and the establishment of a crisis response facility to help poor countries facing shocks.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.5/2">The Multilateral Aid Review (MAR) that is being carried out by my Department is assessing the effectiveness and value for money provided by multilateral organisations including the World Bank. It is identifying additional areas for reforms. We have worked closely with our international counterparts on this, and will continue to do so in supporting the bank to make further progress in these areas.

	<p pid="a.936W.6/2">Tarian has been responsible for a number of notable successes in recent years and for tackling increasing levels of criminality that exceed the capability and capacity of forces acting alone, making a substantial impact on the flow of drugs into South Wales and the finances of the organised crime groups operating within this area. Through its work there has been a substantial increase in understanding of the threat to South Wales from serious and organised crime. Tarian has reported that between 2005-06 and 2008-09, its Regional Task Force carried out over 100 operations/seizures, disrupted or dismantled over 70 organised crime groups and seized over 20 kg of heroin/cocaine. In 2010, Operation &quot;Texas&quot; tackled an organised crime group operating in South Wales, resulting in 11 defendants charged and 17.5 kg of heroin seized-the largest ever seizure of its kind in Welsh policing history.</p>
	<p pid="a.936W.6/3">Since the addition to Tarian of a Regional Asset Recovery Team, the value of confiscation and cash forfeiture orders made to date is in excess of &#163;22.5 million, of which &#163;13.4 million has been collected.</p>

	<p pid="a.937W.7/3" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated February 2011:</p>
	<p pid="a.937W.7/4" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what the average gap between the earnings per hour of a full-time (a) female and (b) male worker was in (i) 1980, (ii) 1990, (iii) 2000 and (iv) 2010. (40800).</p>
	<p pid="a.937W.7/5" class="indent">Average levels of earnings are estimated from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), and prior to 1997 from the New Earnings Survey (NES). They are carried out in April each year and are the most comprehensive source of earnings information. The coverage of the survey was extended in ASHE from Great Britain to United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.937W.7/6" class="indent">ONS's headline estimates of gender pay differences are based on median hourly earnings excluding overtime, but this measure is not available prior to 1997. Prior to 1997, estimates are only available for mean hourly earnings (excluding overtime) of full-time employees in Great Britain. Therefore, in order to achieve continuity of the earnings estimates used over the time period requested, mean hourly earnings (excluding overtime) in Great Britain has been used to answer this question.</p>
	<p pid="a.937W.7/7" class="indent">I therefore attach a table showing the gender pay gap in (i) 1980, (ii) 1990, (iii) 2000 and (iv) 2010 for mean hourly earnings excluding overtime for all full-time male and female employees on adult rates of pay, whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence, in Great Britain.</p>

Alongside this work, we are proactively working directly with businesses, and umbrella organisations such as Business in the Community, to identify specific actions businesses can take. For example, Sainsbury's is committed to paying for a number of senior managers to work full-time within their communities as business connectors, helping businesses and the voluntary sector work closer together, and bringing the knowledge, skills and expertise of the business community to good use locally. Fujitsu have committed to developing and running a new IT platform to support business connectors and link businesses to their local communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.949W.2/2">The Royal Bank of Scotland is required to execute the sale of a retail banking business with a 5% market share in the small and medium enterprise (SME) market as a condition of EU state aid approval for the aid they have received. The terms of this approval committed that the buyer of the divestment must, in combination with the divestment business, have a SME market share of no more than 14% in the UK. This condition on the maximum size of potential purchasers was set based on evidence from the UK competition authorities as to the size of banks that behave as challengers to the large incumbent banks. Santander UK currently have a small SME market share in the UK and in combination with the RBS divestment will have less than a 14% share of that market. As such, the sale will serve to increase competition in the UK banking sector as a whole, and especially in the SME market.</p>

	<p pid="a.951W.6/4">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (the Commission) is currently reviewing shared care as it makes plans to move to the new child maintenance system in 2012.

In keeping with the objective of simpler calculations, liabilities will continue to be based on the relevant income of the non-resident parent.</p>
	<p pid="a.951W.6/5">A disparity in income levels between the parent with care and non-resident parent does not alter parent's responsibility to support their child. This is a central principle of child support legislation and the majority of non-resident parents, including those on lower incomes or in receipt of benefits, are required to make some contribution to the support of their child.</p>

	<p pid="a.952W.8/14">It should be noted that in order for the DWP to provide the full scope of services, in line with its key objectives, a certain degree of business travel is required, for example, trainers will travel to multiple sites; fraud investigation staff will conduct surveillance exercises; Jobcentre Plus staff carry out outreach activity outside of the Government estate, all in the course of their duties.</p>

To qualify for incapacity benefit (IB), claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work called a personal capability assessment. Under the employment and support allowance regime, new claimants have to undergo the work capability assessment. From April 2011 incapacity benefit recipients will begin also to undertake this assessment. The medical condition recorded on the claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefit or employment and support allowance. So, for example, a decision on entitlement for a customer claiming incapacity benefit on the basis of &quot;heart disease&quot; would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities related to physical and mental function, assessed by the personal/work capability assessment. 3. Incapacity benefit was replaced by employment and support allowance (ESA) from October 2008.  4. Constituencies used for May 2010 are for the Westminster Parliament of 2010. Prior to this, the constituencies used are for May 2005.  5. Data by medical condition for ESA is only available from 2010.  <i> Source:</i>  DWP Information Directorate 100% WPLS.</td> </tr>

The estimates quoted include those individuals with zero pension wealth. The private pension wealth figures provided here were not immediately available from the Wealth and Assets Survey report, and were obtained by carrying out in-house analysis of the data.<br/> 2. The Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS) is a large scale nationally representative longitudinal survey of over 30,000 private households in Great Britain that provides comprehensive information on people's assets and net wealth. The first wave was conducted from July 2006 to June 2008. It collected detailed information on financial and non-financial assets, and wealth components such as savings, pensions, property, mortgages and debt as well as people's attitudes and savings behaviour over time.<br/> 3.

Private pensions are all pensions that are not state basic retirement or state earnings related. There are nine categories included in the estimates of private pension wealth: defined benefit (DB) pensions, defined contribution (DC) pensions and personal pensions to which the individual was contributing at the time of survey, additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) made to current pensions, retained rights in DB and DC schemes, pension funds from which the individual was drawing an income through income drawdown, pensions in payment and pensions expected in the future based on the contributions of a former spouse. The estimates quoted include those individuals with zero pension wealth. The private pension wealth figures provided here were not immediately available from the Wealth and Assets Survey report, and were obtained by carrying out in house analysis of the data.<br/> 2. We provide figures for both mean and median private pension wealth. The median may provide a better measure compared to the mean since the distribution of private pension wealth can be skewed by a small number of very large amounts of wealth at the top of the distribution.<br/> 3. The Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS) is a large scale nationally representative longitudinal survey of over 30,000 private households in Great Britain that provides comprehensive information on people's assets and net wealth. The first wave was conducted from July 2006 to June 2008. It collected detailed information on financial and non-financial assets, and wealth components such as savings, pensions, property, mortgages and debt as well as people's attitudes and savings behaviour over time.<br/> 4. Extensive analysis of pension wealth using the Wealth and Assets data is available in 'Wealth in Great Britain 2006/08' at the following web link:<br/> http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_economy/wealth-assets-2006-2008/Wealth_in_GB_2006_2008.pdf<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Wealth and Assets Survey 2006/08</td> </tr>

Under the employment and support allowance regime, new claimants have to undergo the work capability assessment. From April 2011 incapacity benefit recipients will begin also to undertake this assessment. The medical condition recorded on the claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefit or employment and support allowance. So, for example, a decision on entitlement for a customer claiming incapacity benefit on the basis of &quot;other hearing loss&quot; would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities related to physical and mental function, assessed by the personal/work capability assessment.<br/> 4. Incapacity benefit was replaced by employment and support allowance (ESA) from October 2008.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> DWP Information Directorate 100% WPLS</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.962W.2/2">Information for the other benefits requested at December 2010 is not available. Benefit statistics are normally published five and a half months in arrears.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/3">In some circumstances, claims for benefit can be backdated or there can be a lag between a claim being made and all of the necessary evidence being provided to assess if it is successful. In order to capture the vast majority of such claims, DWP wait for four months after the extract date before beginning the publication process. This provides an acceptable trade-off between quality and timeliness. The level of retrospection is different for housing benefit, council tax benefit and the employment programmes, and for the monthly jobseeker's allowance (claimant count) figures published by the Office for National Statistics. However, the same principle is applied. The published numbers capture the vast majority of these retrospective entries to the computer systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/4">The production of the statistical databases and tables takes about six weeks. Hence the quarterly Statistical Summary is published around five and a half months after the main reference date.</p>

	<p pid="a.964W.6/1">Employment and support allowance (ESA) was introduced in October 2008. A key factor in determining eligibility for ESA is the work capability assessment (WCA). The WCA is carried out by health care professionals employed by Atos Healthcare. A report of the WCA is then sent to Jobcentre Plus. Jobcentre Plus Decision Makers (JCP DMs) have to consider all the available information before making a decision on benefit entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.6/2">Figures on the assessment result for the first three WCA publications in October 2009, January 2010 and April 2010, were based on the Atos recommendation. At that time this was the only information the Department held centrally on the result of the WCA and we excluded assessments where the result was unknown. From July 2010, information on the JCP DM's decision became available. As this variable reflects the final decision rather than the Atos recommendation the publication was amended to use this variable. One effect of this change was to increase the number of known results which was reflected in the figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.6/3">The change was fully explained in the July 2010 publication. The relevant section is reproduced here:</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.6/4" class="italic"> Annex B: Technical Note</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.6/5" class="italic"> Changes to calculation methodology since April 2010 publication</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.6/6" class="indent">In this publication assessment outcomes are based on the DWP decision, rather than the ATOS recommendation, as used in previous publications. The DWP decision is made by the Decision Maker in Jobcentre Plus, taking into account the recommendation provided by the ATOS healthcare professional and the evidence provided by the applicant. Data on the final DWP decision has only recently become available centrally. The change has been made to provide more accurate figures on the WCA, as it is the Decision Maker's decision that determines whether ESA will be awarded. Using this variable also means we can include more complete information on people clerically assessed by ATOS as the result of assessment is recorded by the Decision Maker.</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.6/7" class="indent">By comparing the results calculated using the DWP decision variable-described above, with those calculated using the ATOS recommendation variable-as used in previous publications, we see the following small changes in the headline WCA outcomes:</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.6/8" class="indent">Support Group figure changes from 5% to 6%</p>

	<p pid="a.970W.0/1">In aggregate, highways authorities started the winter period with significantly higher salt stocks than last year. The recommendations of the winter resilience review related to the level of local authority pre-winter stocks; there is no recommended &quot;running minimum&quot; levels in-winter. It is the responsibility of each Highway Authority to make appropriate arrangements to ensure its winter resilience levels. The Government arranged for the Highways Agency to import 250,000 tonnes of salt as a strategic national reserve in accordance with the recommendations of the winter resilience review, to be available through the 2010-11 winter season.</p>
	<p pid="a.970W.0/2">Due to the unusually early onset of prolonged severe winter weather inevitably led to salt stocks being utilised at a faster rate in November and December than normal. The Department for Transport has been regularly monitoring stocks held by local authorities and has taken necessary action including releasing some of the national strategic stockpile to English local authorities with low resilience, making arrangements for the import of a further volume of salt of around 273,500 tonnes as a precautionary measure and, following an urgent audit by David Quarmby, providing new guidance to highway authorities on salt spread rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.970W.0/3">These steps taken have ensured that the country is in a better and more resilient position than we were during last winter. At the end of January 2011 and taking results from the most recent complete survey, total salt stocks held in Great Britain, including strategic stockpiles was 971,494 tonnes this is compared to around 270,493 tonnes held on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-01">1 February 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.970W.0/4">However, we are not complacent and it is important that local highway authorities take action to implement the recommendations of David Quarmby's report in October 2010 and the more recent audit in December 2010 to ensure that they are better prepared for future winters. The Department for Transport will continue to maintain a strategic stockpile where conditions warrant it, as recommended by the report, for future winters.</p>

We are determined to take real action to improve and expand the apprenticeships programme and create more apprenticeship opportunities than ever before.

	<p pid="a.976W.2/3">The National Apprenticeships Service (NAS) and the Skills Funding Agency (SFA) are working with training providers and encouraging employers to make these places available. Last week was Apprenticeship Week in England, which saw over 500 events taking place across the country to celebrate apprenticeships and promote the benefits of apprenticeships to both employers and learners. NAS is also running a marketing campaign, focussed on medium and large employers, contacting thousands of large private and public sector employers to promote the benefits of apprenticeships to their business.</p>
	<p pid="a.976W.2/4">We are also working to make it easier for businesses to take on apprentices and access the benefits they bring. We are working to reduce bureaucracy and making the system simpler for employers, colleges, and learners alike and we are considering how we might better support employers to access the benefits of the programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.982W.0/1">We have no plans to publish the contextual data used by universities. Universities are responsible for their own admissions policies and decisions. Whether to use such information is up to each university, as they will be best placed to decide on the information that will help to identify the candidates with the talent and potential to succeed at that institution or on a particular course. The Government believe that the use of such data is a valid and appropriate way for institutions to broaden access while maintaining excellence, so long as individuals are considered on their merits, and institutions' procedures are fair, transparent and evidence-based.</p>

	<p pid="a.982W.9/1">One of the access indicators published as part of the &quot;Performance Indicators in Higher Education&quot; by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) covers the proportion of students from low participation neighbourhoods (LPNs).</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.9/2">The LPN indicator has been produced using POLAR2 (Participation of Local AReas). This method is based on the HE participation rates of people who were aged 18 between 2000 and 2004 and entered a HE course in a UK higher education institution or GB further education college, aged 18 or 19, between academic years 2000/01 and 2005/06. It draws on data provided by the Higher Education Statistics Agency, the Learning and Skills Council, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, the other UK funding bodies and HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
	<p pid="a.982W.9/3">The POLAR2 classification is formed by ranking 2001 Census Area Statistics wards by their young participation rates for the combined 2000 to 2004 cohorts. This gives five young participation quintile groups of areas ordered from '1' (those wards with the lowest participation) to '5' (those wards with the highest participation), each representing 20% of UK young cohort. Students have been allocated to the neighbourhoods on the basis of their postcode. Those students whose postcode falls within wards with the lowest participation (quintile 1) are denoted as being from a low participation neighbourhood. The names of the wards and their corresponding local authority district in England and Wales classified as low participation neighbourhoods will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.991W.3/10">The increase in expenditure in 2009-10 reflects a re-prioritisation of projects and the increase of provisional governance programmes in Helmand Province. Expenditure has included support to Afghan human rights organisations and democracy programmes at national and sub-national level, including in relation to elections. Funding plans for 2011-12 are not yet final. The FCO will continue to provide support for human rights and democracy in Afghanistan as a key part of the Government's work to support and improve governance in Afghanistan. Expenditure for the period 2005 to 2008 was included in Global Conflict Prevention Pool funding and we are unable to disaggregate these figures or make comparisons without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.998W.5/1">As we have said previously, we welcomed Israel's move last July from a restricted list of around 120 items permitted to enter Gaza to a far more permissive list of only prohibited and dual use items. Since then the volume and variety of goods entering Gaza has increased significantly. We believe on average that around 250 truck loads of goods enter Gaza through Kerem Shalom on a daily basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.998W.5/2">However, as we continue to stress to the Israeli Government, including when the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Minister for the Middle East, Alastair Burt, visited the region on 16-<phrase class="date" code="2011-01-19">19 January</phrase>, more needs to be done to effect real changes on the ground. For ordinary Gazans, who cannot afford to buy many of the goods now entering Gaza, that means a revival of the economy and opportunities for employment. It also means getting the basics right in terms of reconstruction of Gaza's housing and infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.998W.5/3">We want to see the approvals process for dual use items for reconstruction projects accelerated and for the extension of the process to include raw materials for manufacturing. While we are encouraged by Israel's December announcement on exports, we need to see this translated into reality. Manufacturing exports destined for Gaza's traditional markets of Israel and the West Bank is the key to reviving the economy, countering radicalisation and bolstering Gaza's pragmatic business fraternity.</p>

	<p pid="a.999W.0/1">We have made no recent assessment of the number of non-governmental organisation (NGO) staff entering and leaving Gaza. However, we and the Department for International Development have a regular dialogue with the NGO community and we are well appraised of the difficulties they continue to face. We have lobbied the Israeli Government on the issue of access permits and residency visas for international NGO staff. More recently we have been aware of difficulties for some international staff members leaving Gaza through the Rafah crossing. We see little prospects for change in access through Rafah in the short term. British nationals intending to visit Gaza should be aware that we continue to advise against all travel to Gaza.</p>

This includes reaching pre-2007 levels of exports by the middle of this year, allowing the import of dual-use raw materials for manufacture, and ensuring Gaza has access to it's traditional markets of Israel and the West Bank. Reviving Gaza's economy is in Israel's interests; it will create jobs, counter radicalisation, provide an alternative to the Hamas-controlled tunnel smuggling economy and bolster Gaza's pragmatic business community.</p>

	<p pid="a.1001W.2/1">My officials have regular discussions with the US and the Palestinian Authority on Palestinian security sector development. It is important that we do so given our substantial political and financial commitment to developing the Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces. We do so in close co-ordination with the US through the UK's British support team, which provides training for the security sector, for example, in developing leaderships skills and standards of professionalism.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/2">Building the capacity of the PA security forces is vital in helping lay the ground work for a future Palestinian state and a lasting solution to the conflict in the region. It is specifically laid out as a Roadmap obligation and our work is in line with this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001W.2/3">It is on this latter point in particular that we engage the Israeli Government. We are alive to Israel's security concerns and believe that the Palestinian Authority has taken considerable steps to address its Roadmap obligations on security and developing the institutions of state. It is important that Israel now reciprocates, in particular by halting all settlement construction so that negotiations on a two state agreement can resume.</p>
