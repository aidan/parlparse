Where objections are received, the Commissioners consider whether there is a pastoral need for the church. On average, between 25 and 30 churches are closed each year; this is in the context of over 16,000 churches in use, including a number of new places of worship opening each year.</p>

We expect to reach the Initial Gate approval point for the programme to replace the Vanguard-class submarines in autumn 2009. This will signify the end of the concept phase. We are also participating in a programme to extend the life of the Trident II D5 missile until around 2042.</p>

The MOD has contractual control and oversight over all disposal contracts and disposal certificates are issued when each cluster munition has been destroyed. The MOD carries out checks on contractors to ensure compliance. There is no scope in the disposal contracts for a disposal contractor to do anything other than destroy the munitions. Furthermore, cluster munitions are recorded on the Department's inventory and explosives safety management IT systems, which means that they can be tracked and prevented from being inadvertently issued for either operational or training purposes.</p>

MOD is in the process of confirming full compliance with all its suppliers and expects to complete this task by end March. As an initial step those defence contractors who have declared to Defence Security and Safety Assurance (MOD's Accreditation Authority), a requirement to have a connection to MOD's restricted network (the RLI) or work electronically at confidential or above, have been asked to confirm their compliance with MOD's List-X Notice on laptop and media encryption policy, issued in response to the data handling review. Some 73.3 per cent. have confirmed compliance.

	<p pid="d.33W.5/1">Since the UK joined the development phase of the joint strike fighter programme in 2001 we have benefited significantly from the strength of the pound against the dollar and as a result forecasted costs are still expected to remain within the approved level. As the UK contributions to this phase of the programme are largely complete, I do not anticipate a significant impact.</p>

	<p pid="d.34W.3/1" class="letterinlibrary">I will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="d.34W.3/2" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Bob Ainsworth to <i> David </i> Lidington:</p>
	<p pid="d.34W.3/3" class="indent">I undertook to write to you in answer to your six Parliamentary Questions on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-19">19 January 2009</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-01-19.1051"><i> Official Report,</i> column 1051W</phrase>, requesting information about fuel consumption and engine rejection rates for the Harrier and Tornado fleets.</p>
	<p pid="d.34W.3/4" class="indent">You asked for a range of detailed and specific information about fuel consumption, much of which is not held centrally in the format requested and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. However, you have since indicated that your main interest in asking about fuel consumption was to establish whether there is an unjustified increase in RAF flying patterns towards the end of a financial year, designed to ensure that all available fuel is consumed and to justify future fuel budgets. Relevant data is readily available showing the volume of fuel transferred on the ground and during air-to-air refuelling (AAR) with UK tankers, for the Harrier, Tornado GR4 and Tornado F3 fleets for each financial year. This indicates fuel consumption trends by month across financial years since 2005-06. Data prior to 2005-06 is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.34W.3/5" class="indent">This data is set out in the following tables. To better show the trends it has also been presented in graphs for each financial year in an annex to this letter. It should be noted that the figures provided do not include fuel transferred from foreign tankers, for example during NATO exercises. They also do not include data for AAR consumption by 14 Squadron (Tornado GR4) based at RAF Lossiemouth, which is not available. Additionally, due to the relatively small level of consumption, figures for the Fast Jet Weapons Operational Evaluation Units are only recorded annually and so have not been included, as to do so would not assist in analysing any possible month on month trends. Because the figures which are missing are relatively small we do not consider them to be statistically significant.</p>

	<p pid="d.34W.3/56" class="indent">As you can see, the data do not indicate a general upturn in fuel consumption in the final months of a financial year. Although this does occur in some cases, there are also some decreases at the end of financial years and peaks occurring at other times of the year. There are a number of reasons why flying rates may increase from December to March, including the improving weather and the fact that there is normally less flying in December and January, owing to traditional periods of leave. Flying may also increase in March because aircrew need to renew certain qualifications before the end of the training year, which coincides with the end of the financial year.</p>
	<p pid="d.34W.3/57" class="indent">You also asked about the rejection from first line in the UK for the Pegasus and RB 199 engines in each week of the last five financial years. This data is available on a monthly basis for both engine types from 2005-06 only and is provided in the following table. It is to be expected that there will be a higher number of rejected RB 199 engines, due to the much larger size of the Tornado fleet (for example there are currently 210 Tornado F3 and GR4 and only 75 Harrier GR9 in the fleet) and the fact that that the Tornado is a dual-engine aircraft, whereas the Harrier only has one Pegasus engine. However, on average the rate of rejection for the three financial years works out at almost the same: 3.39 engines per 1000 flying hours for the Tornado RB 199 engine as opposed to 3.52 for the Harrier Pegasus engine.</p>
	<p pid="d.34W.3/58" class="indent">An 'engine rejection' occurs when it is deemed unserviceable and the necessary repair action cannot be carried out with the engine installed or is beyond the capability of the engineers on the squadron. Unserviceability may be caused by, among other things, physical damage to the engine, engine components becoming life expired, unsatisfactory vibration characteristics or poor performance.</p>

	<p pid="d.42W.10/1">The Department for Work and Pensions makes advice on benefits and a wide range of other entitlements easily accessible to everyone through a variety of channels including information leaflets, telephone helplines, websites, and through intermediary organisations working closely with us.</p>
	<p pid="d.42W.10/2">These sources of help and information are consistently promoted through the Department for Work and Pensions website, phone books, in Jobcentres and pension centres and by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.42W.10/3">In order to streamline public access to this and other Departments' information, it is now government policy that Departments should use Directgov:</p>

	<p pid="d.42W.10/5">an online, TV and mobile phone service, providing citizens with access to information and services from across Government. This will replace the large numbers of standalone websites that Government currently run. The change is taking place between now and 2011.</p>
	<p pid="d.42W.10/6">We also run many promotional campaigns to ensure that eligible and vulnerable people are aware of their entitlements.</p>
	<p pid="d.42W.10/7">We would always recommend that where people are seeking information on entitlements, they should turn to the relevant Department for Work and Pensions agency, or trusted sources of information like Age Concern and the Citizen's Advice Bureau.</p>
	<p pid="d.42W.10/8">We are aware that other organisations promote benefits advice services on a commercial basis and have received a small number of representations. However, these services are not in themselves illegal, and it is the responsibility of the service Regulator to monitor their operation and to take action where necessary to control them.</p>

Consolatory payments are considered in very exceptional circumstances, where maladministration has had a direct adverse impact on the life of the client or, much more exceptionally, on that of another person, for example the client's spouse. Each case is considered individually.</p>

	<p pid="d.57W.5/1">There is a range of procedures available to individuals who wish to pursue complaints where they consider that an organisation has failed to meet its duties under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA).

	<p pid="d.57W.5/2">An individual who wishes to bring a complaint that an organisation has failed in its duties under the DDA may do so by informal means, such as a direct approach to the organisation, the questions procedure, or conciliation.</p>
	<p pid="d.57W.5/3">The Act provides for formal enforcement through civil proceedings. Where the complainant wishes to bring legal proceedings against the organisation, different legal processes apply according to the nature of the complaint.</p>
	<p pid="d.57W.5/4">For complaints concerning employment and vocational training an application may be made to an employment tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="d.57W.5/5">For complaints concerning post-16 education, access to goods, services, facilities and premises, private clubs, and the functions of public bodies, the complainant may bring legal proceedings in a county court in England and Wales, or in a sheriff court in Scotland. In respect of post-16 education in Scotland the claim must be served on the education service provider.</p>
	<p pid="d.57W.5/6">For complaints involving education in schools in England, claims of unlawful discrimination may be made to the 1st Tier Tribunals (formerly Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal), and for Wales to the Special Education Needs Tribunal for Wales. The 1st Tier Tribunal in England will also hear appeals on grounds of disability discrimination in relation to fixed-period (temporary) exclusions from all schools and also, admissions to, and permanent exclusions from, all schools other than maintained schools and academies. Appeals on grounds of disability discrimination in respect of a refusal to admit to, and permanent exclusions from, maintained schools and academies are heard by admissions appeals panels or independent appeals panels. Appeals are dealt with in a similar way in Wales. In Scotland, complaints involving education in schools are dealt with in the sheriff court.</p>

	<p pid="d.57W.5/8">The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has powers of enforcement in respect of the provisions in the DDA that cover discriminatory job advertisements; instructions and pressure to discriminate in employment and vocational training; and the disability equality duty. An individual may raise their concerns about these issues with the EHRC, but it is for the Commission to determine whether enforcement action should be taken.</p>

	<p pid="d.58W.2/1">We are committed to ending disability discrimination, including on the grounds of mental health, and are targeting resources in a number of areas to ensure that disabled people have the opportunity to benefit from the positive impact on health and well-being that work can bring.</p>
	<p pid="d.58W.2/2">Through the &quot;Employ ability&quot; programme, we are engaging with employers to improve their understanding of disability and their attitudes towards employing disabled people. Employ ability activity is aimed at small to medium-sized employers and is being rolled out to Scotland, Wales and seven English regions between <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-24">24 March 2008</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-27">27 February 2009</phrase>. The Government have committed &pound;4,000,000 to the campaign.</p>
	<p pid="d.58W.2/3">Access to Work helps around 24,000 disabled people take up or stay in work annually by helping to fund specialist equipment, such as writing support software, reading rulers or a Job Coach who can work with the customer to help them develop strategies for organising their work. The Access to Work budget has been increased from &pound;15 million in 1994-95 to &pound;69 million in 2008-09. In the White Paper, &quot;Raising Expectations and Increasing Support&quot;, we made a commitment to double the budget for Access to Work. This will be a major expansion of the support we can offer to disabled people to help them get and sustain employment. We estimate that this could potentially double the number of people helped annually by 2013-14.</p>
	<p pid="d.58W.2/4">The Government's response to Dame Carol Black's review of the health of Britain's working age population set out our plans to launch a range of initiatives to improve working age health and well-being, including mental health. These include the development of the first ever cross-Government National Mental Health and Employment Strategy which will bring employment and health services closer together, support employers and health care professionals and tackle issues such as discrimination and stigma.</p>
	<p pid="d.58W.2/5">We have also improved and strengthened the Disability Discrimination Act to provide disabled people with a full and comprehensive set of enforceable rights in all areas of life, including in employment. The Disability Discrimination Act provides protection from disability discrimination for anyone who meets the Act's definition of a disabled person. A person with a mental health condition will therefore be covered by the provisions of the Act if the effect of their impairment meets the various elements of the definition.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-12">12 January</phrase>, for example, we hosted an Employment Summit, bringing together around 120 employers, representative groups and training providers to discuss how businesses can play their part in the response to rising unemployment. The total cost of the event was &pound;162,076.18.</p>
	<p pid="d.59W.2/2">Building on this, the Secretary of State jointly hosted the first meeting of the National Employment Partnership on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-11">11 February</phrase>. This event was attended by 22 key employers from across a number of sectors to discuss the implementation of the Government's new package of support for those who are still unemployed six months into a jobseeker's allowance claim, and to discuss the role and importance of Local Employment Partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="d.59W.2/3">In addition to these events, Ministers and senior officials continue to meet with outside organisations on a regular basis to discuss specific issues arising from the recession across the whole spectrum of the Department's work.</p>

	<p pid="d.59W.5/3">We are investing an extra &pound;1.3 billion to ensure that through Jobcentre Plus we can continue to provide personal help and advice to everyone who needs it&mdash;help in finding a job, filling in job applications and writing a CV plus advice on re-training and acquiring new skills.</p>
	<p pid="d.59W.5/4">From April 2009 we will also be investing a further &pound;0.5 billion to guarantee more support to every person still looking for work after six months by making a range of additional options available including providing up to &pound;2,500 for employers who recruit and train people unemployed for over six months; money and support to set up their own business; training to improve skills to get a job; and the opportunity to volunteer where this will help a person move towards work.</p>
	<p pid="d.59W.5/5">And we are pressing ahead with our welfare reforms from this year that will increase support for unemployed people as their claim to benefit continues. We are creating a new contract for jobseekers, promising help with skills and with employability.</p>

Coverage relates just to vacancies notified to Jobcentre Plus and as such represents a market share of vacancies throughout the whole economy. This proportion varies over time, according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer, and by local area.<br/> 2. These figures are of stocks of unfilled vacancies which reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br/> 3. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br/> 4. Interpretation of this data needs to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the nomis website.<br/> 5. Data labelled as &quot;Month X&quot; predominantly relates to the previous month. The release calendar gives details of the monthly release dates and the periods covered. For example, January 2009 relates to the period (6 December 2008- 2 January 2009).<br/> 6. Reporting months relate to either a four week or five week period depending on count dates. Users should be cautious about comparing monthly flows and may wish to standardise the figures. For example the January 2009 period is a four week period whereas February 2009 is a five week period.<br/> 7. Vacancy data is collected by month and quarterly data is not available. It is not possible to sum up each month in the quarter as this would lead to some job vacancies being counted twice.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Jobcentre Plus Labour Market System</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.63W.0/2">Information about surgery locations in the original pilot and expansion is in the following table. In addition, advisers provide services in approximately 70 GPs surgeries in Scotland. Information about the towns where the surgeries are located is also provided.</p>
	<p pid="d.63W.0/3">In the original five pilot sites the project was funded for one full time adviser. The current projection for expenditure is &pound;309,996 per year per district. This includes staff costs, training and set up costs for the surgery which will include a risk assessment. The number of advisers will remain at one full-time post per district. Occasionally a district will split the post to two part-time posts. The projected total is therefore 15 to 17 advisers. The original pilot had five to seven advisers.</p>
	<p pid="d.63W.0/4">The original five pilot sites were funded from Pathways to Work programme money with &pound;1.5 million for three years. However, individual sites added funding from a variety of sources to boost provision for the Pathways Advisory Service. For the expansion no significant spend has taken place as the districts are currently working to set up the project. It is expected each district will keep within the projected &pound;309,996 figure.</p>

	<p pid="d.69W.5/1">The cost of Health and Safety Executive's (HSE) 'Make the promise - Come home safe' farm safety campaign to date is &pound;692,000. This covers development work, advertising in the trade press and online publications; a direct marketing pack to nearly 68,000 farmers; a press and PR campaign.</p>
	<p pid="d.69W.5/2">Farming is one of the most dangerous ways to make a living in Britain. Agriculture comprises about 1.5 per cent. of the working population but accounts for 15 per cent. to 20 per cent. of fatal incidents each year. This new campaign is part of a wider HSE initiative targeted at reducing the number of work related deaths in farming. The 'Make the promise' campaign has very strong support from the National Farmers' Union and other stakeholders.</p>

The precise number of extra staff who will be placed in Sutton Jobcentre is not yet known.</p>
	<p pid="d.75W.5/7" class="indent">I can confirm that each Jobcentre Plus district has a named Rapid Response Manager. When redundancies in local businesses become known, this Manager co-ordinates the Jobcentre response and support.

			<tr pid="d.80W.2/18"> <td colspan="6"><i> Notes:</i>  1. The average cost has been calculated by dividing the total expenditure each year by the number of customers joining the programme within that year. This provides a good approximation, but since the costs for any one individual occur over a period of time (and are not possible to track) the figures will not be exact.  2. Expenditure figures exclude administration costs as they cannot be identified since 2002-03 when 'ring fences' were removed with agreement from HM Treasury.  3. In the case of New Deal for Young People and New Deal 25 Plus, the expenditure does include associated Annually Managed Expenditure (weekly training allowance).  4. New Deal for Young People and New Deal 25 Plus started in 1998, with phased introduction between January and July. Average expenditure per customer on New Deal for Young People and New Deal 25 Plus has reduced year on year since 2005-06 due to changes to New Deal from April 2004 (which included reducing the length of the options period to 13 weeks). The full impact of this change did not take effect until 2005-06.  5. New Deal 50 Plus started in 2000. Performance information is not available until 2003-04. New Deal 50 Plus costs reduce after 2002-03 as the employment credit element of ND50+ (funded by DWP) ceased and was replaced by the 50 plus element of the working tax credit (funded by HMRC). The small residual spend relates to the New Deal 50 Plus Training Grant.  6. New Deal for Disabled People (NDDP) started in 2001. Spend prior to this date is for pilots in selected areas. Performance information is not available until 2001-02. Both costs and participant numbers have risen significantly following re-tendering in 2004. As participants can stay on the programme for longer than a year, dividing spend by starts is not really a valid comparison of spend per person. Furthermore, NDDP is no longer a national programme (it only operates in 18 districts) so costings would be further affected since the programme was subsumed by provider led Pathways from December 2007.  7. New Deal for Lone Parents started in 1998. Average expenditure per customer on the New Deal for Lone Parents programme increased from 2006 due to the additional help available by way of in work credit, child care costs and the increased availability of training opportunities.  8. New Deal for Partners started in 1999 and was re-launched in 2004. Performance information is not available until 2004-05.  9. New Deal for Musicians started in 1999. Performance information is not available for the New Deal for Musicians Programme.  <i> Sources:</i>  1. DWP financial systems (numerator).  2. DWP Tabulation Tool (denominator).</td> </tr>

People who are entitled to carer's allowance&mdash;whether or not carer's allowance is in payment&mdash;may benefit from the additional amount for carers in pension credit. The pension credit standard minimum guarantee of &pound;124.05 for single pensioners (&pound;189.35 for couples) is increased by &pound;27.75 where the additional amount for carers is payable&mdash;if both members of a couple are entitled to carer's allowance the additional amount is doubled.</p>

	<p pid="d.86W.0/2">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.0/3" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.0/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking what qualifications would make a person over qualified and therefore not eligible for Government-funded re-training as part of the Rapid Response Service; what qualifications are available from Government-funded re-training offered by the Rapid Response Service; and what guidance is available to Jobcentre Plus District Managers to help them decide when a significant redundancy which warrants the use of the Rapid Response Service has taken place. These are issues that fall within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.0/5" class="indent">The Rapid Response Service is available to all employers Jobcentre Plus identify as being in the process of making redundancies. We will contact every employer who meets their statutory requirement to notify the Insolvency Service when making 20 or more people redundant. In addition we will offer support to any other employers we identify as making redundancies where, based on their knowledge of the local labour market, the District Manager determines that the cumulative impact of redundancies justifies using the Rapid Response Service.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.0/6" class="indent">If the employer accepts our offer of support, we give help and advice on claiming benefits and jobsearch to those people faced with redundancy. As part of the support package, where the type of work being lost is not readily available in the labour market, a Skills Transfer Analysis is offered to all those affected.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.0/7" class="indent">The Skills Transfer Analysis compares the skills the person has with those required to find work in the labour market in which they are looking for work. Where skill gaps are identified Job Focused Training is sourced to fill the gaps and help people quickly fill the skills gaps. A person cannot be over qualified for Job Focused Training, provided the Skills Transfer Analysis identifies that there is a need for the training.</p>
	<p pid="d.86W.0/8" class="indent">The prime purpose of the Job Focused Training is to help the person gain the necessary skills to find work quickly. There is no expectation that this training will lead directly to a qualification.</p>

This type of assistance has first call on the social fund loans budget and all crisis loan applicants who satisfy the eligibility conditions are given an award. Gross expenditure on crisis loans in Great Britain has increased by 31 per cent. between January and December 2007 and January to December 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.87W.3/2">From January to December 2008, around 45 per cent. of crisis loan awards in Great Britain were made to people representing hardship before their first benefit payment. The current legal provisions do not specify that an advance payment of benefit can be made in such circumstances. The current welfare reform bill contains powers that will address this point, allowing the consideration of advance payments for this group of people. This will reduce the need for such crisis loans.</p>

Research conducted so far has concluded that, although the sanction has been publicised and used in routine warning letters to tenants engaged in anti-social behaviour, the general view is that the impact of a warning of a sanction at an early stage is limited and the threat of eviction is taken more seriously. However, the pilots have 10 more months to run and we will continue to research the deterrent effect of the sanction and the impact of any sanctions administered during that period.</p>

	<p pid="d.95W.0/4">Voluntary New Deal programmes are available to customers across benefit groups. Access to New Deal 50 Plus is restricted to benefit recipients aged 50 or over.

	<p pid="d.95W.0/5">The work-based training courses currently available via the New Deal are decided by each Jobcentre Plus district to meet the needs of local labour markets and so provision will vary throughout Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="d.95W.0/6">The introduction of the Flexible New Deal later this year will establish a new, unified approach for all jobseekers, whatever their age, skills or barriers to work.

	<p pid="d.95W.0/8">An unemployed person's eligibility for re-training courses is not determined by postcode area. However, there is some specific provision that is targeted at deprived areas. The Working Neighbourhoods Fund, for example, tackles worklessness in specific deprived areas in England. The City Strategy Pathfinders align a range of funding, including the Working Neighbourhoods Fund and the Disadvantaged Areas Fund, to tackle worklessness and social exclusion in some of the country's most disadvantaged locations.</p>

	<p pid="d.100W.5/2">Of the 12 million winter fuel payments, the vast majority, over 95 per cent. are made automatically before Christmas based on information already held in DWP records. In these cases individuals do not need to make an application.</p>
	<p pid="d.100W.5/3">However there are a small group of people who may qualify for winter fuel payments who need to make an application. This is usually because they are not in receipt of a state pension or other benefit administered by the DWP. Applications for this year must be received by March 2009. Payments are made in stages between November 2008 and May 2009 depending on when the application and supporting information is received.</p>
	<p pid="d.100W.5/4">In winter 2006-07, the last year for which figures are available, 1,082,070 people in the London Government Office region received a winter fuel payment.</p>

	<p pid="d.104W.0/1">There are three ways in which staff in this Department might be entitled to a non-consolidated award in the financial year 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.0/2">The Government have accepted a recommendation by the Senior Salaries Review Body that for senior civil servants over the period 2008-11 there should be an indicative envelope, of 7 per cent. of paybill per head, available for normal base pay increases and increasing the non-consolidated performance pot. Under these arrangements, the Department has made non-consolidated payments in 2008-09 to 111 staff at a total cost of &pound;856,392.</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.0/3">The pay settlement for staff below the senior civil service for 2008-09 has yet to be determined and so we can not provide information in relation to the cost of non-consolidated payments at this time.</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.0/4">All non-consolidated payments above are funded within existing pay bill controls, have to be re-earned each year against pre-determined targets and, as such, do not add to future pay bill costs.</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.0/5">In Communities and Local Government, non-consolidated payments are made to those members of staff who are found to have made a significant contribution towards the achievement of the teams, and/or Departments objectives. Individuals are expected to show that they have exceeded the requirements set for the achievement of the objective and have demonstrated exemplary behaviour in doing so.</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.0/6">Our senior civil service staff members are also assessed against a range of factors, such as:</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.0/7" class="indent">The achievement of their Prime Objective which focuses on the way in which they lead, manage and develop their staff;</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.0/8" class="indent">Degree to which business objectives are met;</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.0/9" class="indent">Delivery for Ministers;</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.0/10" class="indent">Demonstration of skills such as judgment, leadership and the PSG skills;</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.0/11" class="indent">Effective resource management.</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.0/12">The Department also operates a scheme for all staff below the senior civil service under which individuals or teams may receive a small non-consolidated award in recognition of an outstanding contribution over a limited period. A formal allocation of funding is not made for this scheme but a limit of 0.2 per cent. of the paybill is placed on expenditure under these arrangements. The maximum payment under these arrangements is &pound;600 but records are not available to show the number of payments made under this scheme in 2008-09.</p>

Of these, developers were asked to build around 30 per cent. for the target construction cost of &pound;60,000 or less. However, the other 70 per cent. were expected to be larger and smaller homes built at an equivalent cost-efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="d.107W.2/3">Construction of all of the homes being built through the DFM competition is still under way, so it is not possible to predict how many homes will be completed for the target cost. However, the HCA last year commissioned a professional firm of chartered surveyors and cost consultants to analyse cost data received from the various developers building the homes.</p>
	<p pid="d.107W.2/4">It is not practical at this stage to compare the sites in this study and draw any firm conclusions, as the property designs and types are so varied. Also, the sites are located in different areas in the country and each site has reported different obstacles to overcome. However, early indications from this study show that out of a sample of 135 units surveyed and completed at the time of the study, and with appropriate cost adjustments to reflect price inflation since the competition was launched in April 2005, 79 were built for close to or less than &pound;60,000.</p>

	<p pid="d.111W.0/1">As no two premises are likely to be the same, a 'one size fits all' approach to fire safety is inappropriate. The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 is non-prescriptive. It is for the responsible person to assess what fire safety measures will best deliver an adequate level of protection in the light of the specific circumstances of their premises.</p>
	<p pid="d.111W.0/2">In carrying out their audit and enforcement responsibilities, individual fire safety officers will use their professional judgment and expertise to consider the extent to which the fire safety measures in place in a particular building deliver an adequate level of compliance with the provisions of the Order. Under the Regulators' Compliance Code local fire and rescue authorities are expected to implement the Hampton principles of better regulation when delivering these functions.</p>
	<p pid="d.111W.0/3">We have commissioned a qualitative evaluation into the initial impact of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 on representatives from the business community, the enforcing authorities and the fire safety industry and hope to be in a position to publish this shortly.</p>

	<p pid="d.112W.0/1">We have not considered providing free professional advice on complying with the requirements of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 to businesses in any sector.

	<p pid="d.115W.9/1">The White Paper &quot;Communities in control: real people, real power&quot;, which was published in July 2008, was the first major government policy statement on transferring power to citizens and communities, giving people more control and influence over decisions in their local areas and promoting vibrant local democracy. These ideas should be seen as essential for public agencies, the third sector and communities in responding to the challenges of the economic downturn.</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/2">Current work on implementing the White Paper and promoting community empowerment includes:</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/3"><i> Participatory budgeting (PB):</i> involves local people in making decisions on the spending from public budgets. We have rolled out a national strategy setting out how the Government will achieve their ambition for PB to be used in all local authority areas by 2012. There are currently 34 pilot areas, covering a wide variety of different areas. PB exercises have so far engaged local people on spending for activities such as local environmental issues, community facilities, parks and play areas, road safety measures, and anti-crime measures.</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/4"><i> The Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill:</i> currently being debated in Parliament includes:</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/5" class="indent">a new duty on local councils to promote democracy&mdash;putting local authorities at the forefront of the drive to reconnect people with public and political decision-making. The duty will ensure all sections of their community understands how the council works, who makes the decisions on their behalf in their neighbourhood, and how they can get involved if they wish to;</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/6" class="indent">new rights for the citizen to have more information and influence over the local decisions;</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/7" class="indent">new powers to hold politicians and officials to account;</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/8" class="indent">a new duty on local councils to respond to petitions.</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/9"><i> Asset Transfer Unit:</i> The White Paper set out the Government's aim to increase the number of people engaged in the running and ownership of local services and assets. The &quot;Asset Transfer Unit&quot; opened for business in January 2009, and over the course of the year, it will:</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/10" class="indent">create an interactive web-based resource detailing sources of support for organisations engaging in asset transfer;</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/11" class="indent">deliver an England-wide information, advice and referral service on asset transfer to both community organisations and local authorities and other statutory bodies;</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/12" class="indent">implement up to 38 local authority asset transfer projects, supported by a capital investment of &pound;30 million from the Office of the Third Sector;</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/13" class="indent">develop and introduce model asset transfer strategies in a number of local authority areas across England;</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/14" class="indent">promote and refine the use of community shares and bonds issues as methods of tapping new sources of community investment and involvement in local projects.</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/15"><i> Take Part:</i> In order for more people to be able to participate in local decision- making, they need to have a better understanding of how local services are managed and local democracy operates. We are launching the &quot;Take Part local pathfinder programme&quot; to support people and encourage them to have the confidence to speak up and get involved.</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/16">18 pathfinders will be announced during 2009. They will operate as partnerships between local authorities and other key organisations, such as third sector bodies and educational institutions. The first eight pathfinders will offer tailored support (through learning and community leadership programmes etc.) to at least 3,400 people during 2009. More general support will also be given to the wider community, through the use of Take Part websites and other communications methods (such as newsletters) produced by the pathfinder partners and disseminated throughout the local authority area.</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/17"><i> Communitybuilders:</i> is a &pound;70 million investment fund, run jointly with the Office of the Third Sector, to strengthen the sustainability of multi-purpose inclusive community-led organisations operating at the neighbourhood level. We are currently in the process of tendering for a national partner organisation to deliver the fund on the Government's behalf. The national partner will use their skills and expertise to identify and fund projects through an open and transparent process.</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/18">The national partner will be announced and the programme will become open to applications in spring 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/19"><i> Empowerment Fund:</i> The Government are seeking to create an ever stronger partnership with the third sector, both nationally and locally, in the design, development and delivery of policy making to help build cohesive, empowered and active communities. The &quot;Empowerment Fund&quot;, launched last year by Communities and Local Government, will strengthen national infrastructure and intermediary bodies, who can translate key proposals into practical action and support for frontline organisations.</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/20">The Empowerment Fund will provide &pound;7.5 million to support organisations operating across the country assist local communities to take forward key themes of the White Paper. It will:</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/21" class="indent">be open to partnership applications with an eligible lead;</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/22" class="indent">have a more flexible allowance on the Department's financial contribution;</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/23" class="indent">give added weight to those working with excluded groups across all themes.</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/24">The closing date for receiving applications was <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-06">6 January 2009</phrase>. We have received 157 applications and are currently working through the evaluation process, aiming to announce the successful organisations in March.</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/25">The Fund will begin in April 2009 and will last until March 2012.</p>
	<p pid="d.115W.9/26"><i> Youth Advis</i><i> e</i><i> rs:</i> Young people are being placed at the heart of government policy formulation. A panel of nine young people&mdash;recruited from the national pool of young advisors&mdash;act as youth advisors to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, giving a young person's perspective as policies are developed and implemented. These young advisors are the Secretary of State's eyes and ears on issues that affect them the most, from the housing offer for young people and the impact of the economic downturn, to their role in community cohesion and the Olympics legacy.</p>

As part of a much wider package of real help for home owners, the scheme should enable ordinary hard-working households that experience a redundancy or significant loss of income to reduce their monthly payments to a more manageable level, by deferring a proportion of the interest payments on their mortgage for up to two years. The Government will guarantee the lender against a proportion of any loss incurred on the deferred interest payments in case the borrower defaults.</p>

	<p pid="d.126W.9/1">The police forces of England and Wales will collect data depending on their own operational needs and priorities. The extent of what is collected is likely to be greater than what is requested by the Home Office, and will differ between police forces.</p>
	<p pid="d.126W.9/2">The Home Office collects crime data in two main ways: crimes recorded by the police; and the British Crime Survey (BCS), a victimisation survey covering adults aged 16 and over, living in private households in England and Wales. In January 2009 the BCS was extended to include under-16s. Other data may be collected on an ad hoc basis; this is included where relevant.</p>
	<p pid="d.126W.9/3" class="italic"> Knife Crime</p>
	<p pid="d.126W.9/4">The Home Office receives aggregated recorded crime data from the police forces for a wide range of offences. Since April 2007, the Home Office began to collect data on the numbers of offences where a knife or sharp instrument has been involved for selected offences: attempted murder; robbery and GBH. This was in addition to homicide, where offences including a knife were already covered by the homicide index collection, a more detailed individual record collection from police forces. The knife crime collection was extended in April 2008 to cover the additional offences of threats to kill, ABH, rape and sexual assault.</p>
	<p pid="d.126W.9/5">In addition to these returns, a separate data collection has been established as part of the Tackling Knives Action Programme (TKAP). TKAP is a time limited initiative which aims to tackle the possession of knives and knife related serious violence among young people in 10 police force areas in England and Wales. The programme started in June 2008 and is planned to finish in March 2009. A programme of monitoring has been established to assess progress and recorded crime information on knife and sharp instrument related homicide, attempted murder, threats to kill, GBH, ABH, robbery and possession offences are collected from the ten forces. Other information such as the age of victim and suspect and whether the incident is counted as domestic violence are also collected.</p>
	<p pid="d.126W.9/6">Findings from the TKAP will be published after its completion.</p>
	<p pid="d.126W.9/7">The BCS collects information on weapons, including knives, used in incidents of violent crime. Figures on the proportion of violent incidents involving knives are published regularly in the annual Crime in England and Wales publication.</p>

Figures for the proportion of young people aged 10 to 25 who reported carrying a knife in the past year (and further details, including their motivations for doing so) were published regularly in the annual reports on the survey.

Copies of these publications are available in the House of Commons Library (the most recent publication is Crime in England and Wales 2007-08).</p>
	<p pid="d.126W.9/18">Police recorded crime does not specifically collect data on alcohol related incidents, although whether the suspect has been drinking alcohol or not is included in the homicide collection.

	<p pid="d.131W.8/1">The Government take the issue of selling alcohol to under-age people very seriously indeed. The Home Secretary announced in her speech on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-06">6 February 2008</phrase>, that a number of new measures and possible steps would be taken to crack down on crime and antisocial behaviour which is fuelled by alcohol. This includes highlighting the message that it is not acceptable for young people to drink in public places.</p>
	<p pid="d.131W.8/2">The Home Office co-ordinated enforcement campaigns have provided support to police and trading standard officers in the use of the extensive powers available under the Licensing Act 2003 in relation to children. Indeed successive Alcohol Misuse and Enforcement Campaigns (AMECs) from 2004 and Tackling Underage Sales of Alcohol Campaigns (TUSAC) since 2006 have reduced the test purchase failure rate from approximately 50 per cent. to approximately 15 per cent. Additionally, we have recently launched a new &pound;4.5 million enforcement campaign in 190 areas, with a particular focus on the 50 areas of most concern to us from January to March 2009. The Home Office also supports the Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS), as well as initiatives which seek to reduce the number of under-age sales such as &quot;Challenge 21&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.131W.8/3">The Government have also introduced legislation to create an enabling power to introduce a new mandatory code of practice for alcohol retailers and to take forward the legislative announcements as set out in the written ministerial statement following the Licensing Act review and the Youth Alcohol Action Plan, namely: the creation of a new offence of persistent possession of alcohol in a public place by a person aged under 18, and amending the 'persistent selling' offence from three sales to an under 18 in three months, to two sales in three months.</p>

	<p pid="d.132W.2/2">However an alcohol confiscation campaign took place in February 2008 following a pilot in October 2007. 165 out of the 227 basic command units (BCUs) took part in the campaign and the result was that over 21,000 litres of alcohol (70 per cent. beer) was confiscated in over 5,000 separate seizures from individuals and groups of more than 23,000 young people. Activity in both campaigns focussed on school holidays and weekends when young people were most likely to be engaged in this activity.</p>

	<p pid="d.132W.5/1">The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 protects animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes. Protected animals include immature vertebrate animals, in the case of a mammal, bird or reptile from halfway through gestation or incubation and in any other case, including immature forms of Octopus vulgaris, when they become capable of independent feeding.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.5/2">We have no reliable data from which to estimate the numbers of immature forms used during the period in question. For the purpose of the annual statistical report of animal use project licence holders are required to declare if immature forms have been used, but not to provide estimates of the numbers used. This is because, in the case of some immature forms, such as fish fry, it is impossible to count and record accurately the numbers used for work licensed under the Act.</p>

	<p pid="d.141W.14/4">which acts as a hub of information and advice for running such campaigns as well as a platform to share good practice from around the country. We have also developed two toolkits, one for local stakeholders who want to run their own campaigns to tackle knife crime and a campaigning toolkit for young people themselves, to help them spread the message to their peers.</p>

	<p pid="d.142W.2/2">Prior to January 2009 the BCS was restricted to adults living in the general household population in England and Wales. Since then the survey has been extended to children 10 years and over.</p>
	<p pid="d.142W.2/3">The BCS does not include offences committed against children under 10 years or those where the victim is not in the resident household population, such as private and public sector organisations, tourists, residents of institutions and the homeless. The survey also excludes drug offences and homicide because it is based on interviews with individual victims.</p>

	<p pid="d.145W.8/1">All social research that is published by the Home Office is subject to an independent peer review process. Once the research is complete, our usual practice is to send the research report to be peer reviewed by two external experts. We choose peer reviewers for their knowledge of the subject and their expertise in the methodology used for the research. In a small number of cases, the Department instead gives permission for the research to be published by external contractors who completed the work. These cases are externally peer reviewed wherever possible.</p>

HOSDB scientists and engineers also present results at academic conferences where this is appropriate in order to ensure that scrutiny of our science is as robust as possible.</p>

However, it is completely reliant on the quality and timeliness of the information received and input onto the database. Since we cannot ensure that this information meets the rigorous standards applied to published statistics, it is for internal use only by UK Border Agency. Ensuring the information is of sufficient quality to be issued publicly would entail a manual cross checking of a number of individual case files against these figures, which could only be completed at disproportionate cost.</p>

As it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion, some profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates.

	<p pid="d.156W.2/1">The shift patterns of police officers is an operational matter, and as such is for the chief constable to determine. However, the Government published a review of the Licensing Act 2003 in March 2008 which revealed a mixed picture in terms of its impact. The change in opening hours has not led to the widespread problems some people feared. Overall, crime and alcohol consumption are down, but there has been a small increase in alcohol-related violence in the early hours of the morning and some communities have seen a rise in disorder. Our main conclusion is that people are using the freedoms, but people are not sufficiently using the considerable powers granted by the Act to tackle problems,, and that there is a need to rebalance action towards enforcement and crack down on irresponsible behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="d.156W.2/2">Additionally, we have introduced legislation for a new, mandatory code of practice. This will contain some compulsory national conditions, banning the most irresponsible practices and promotions which encourage people to drink excessively, or promote a binge-drinking culture. This will not affect the majority of businesses, small or large, who behave responsibly&mdash;but will target those that don't.</p>
	<p pid="d.156W.2/3">Further, the Government are funding a &pound;4.5 million enforcement campaign, in addition to existing resources from the police, local authorities, and others, focused on 40-50 priority areas and led by ACPO Commander Simon O'Brien. There is additional funding for the 20 priority PCT areas, and a &pound;10 million investment in national awareness campaigns.</p>

	<p pid="d.161W.5/2">The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) Belfast does not keep records of all instances when language facilities other than English are required in dealing with non-English speaking passport applicants. All applications are made in English and when foreign documents support these and require translation, customers are asked to provide a translation from an independent and verifiable translator. Given the range of applications submitted from persons whose birth, marriage, divorce, or change of name may take place abroad, it is impossible to provide a definitive list of the number or type of translation services that may be required.</p>
	<p pid="d.161W.5/3">On the rare occasion when a caller making an application or inquiry at the public counter does not speak English, they may communicate through a friend or family member. Given the infrequency of the requirement for translation or interpreter services at Belfast, it would not be cost effective for IPS to make separate permanent provision for this.</p>
	<p pid="d.161W.5/4">The only exception arises in the case of interviews to authenticate identity at the regional office public counter at Hampton House High street Belfast or at the IPS Interview Office at Norwood House, Great Victoria street, Belfast. In such cases for security reasons IPS will provide an interpreter if required.</p>
	<p pid="d.161W.5/5">In 2008 no interpreter services were required at the Hampton House public counter. Eight cases arose at the Interview Office in Norwood House, comprising six cases interpreting Chinese Mandarin, one case interpreting Cantonese and one case interpreting Bengali.</p>

	<p pid="d.163W.12/2">The law on speeding offences applies to police officers as it does to the general public. The police can however claim exemption from speed limits in the circumstances set out in section 87, Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. This provides that speed limits do not apply to vehicles being used for an emergency service purpose if observing the limit on that specific occasion would hinder such use. In the event of dispute, it would be for the courts to decide if the exemption was properly claimed or a speeding offence committed.</p>
	<p pid="d.163W.12/3">Within the constraints of the legislation, the use of the speed limit exemption is an operational matter for the police. The police will take into account the need on each specific occasion to reach an emergency scene as quickly as possible and to preserve road safety. Police have been convicted or offered fixed penalties for speeding when on duty, but there is no evidence that they are routinely acting inappropriately.</p>

The information given for pensions expenditure, both as a figure and as a percentage of the total budget requirement, consists in each case of the employer contributions made in that year. The current system of police pensions financing was introduced in April 2006, whereby each police authority pays employer and officer contributions into a separate account out of which pensions are paid. Where the income into the police authority pensions account from contributions (plus other payments such as inward transfer values) is insufficient to meet the cost of pensions payment, it is topped up by Home Office grant.</p>

Similar sums were allocated in those periods to the police and other agencies involved in the recovery of criminal assets, under the Asset Recovery Incentive Scheme. Police forces have invested most of their monies from the incentive scheme in further developing their asset recovery and financial investigation capacity, with the funding of financial investigator posts, anti-money laundering teams, and asset recovery operations. In addition some funds were used on local projects to tackle gun and knife crime. The Metropolitan Police Service also made a grant to the Safer London Foundation. Other forces supported a range of community initiatives, including youth projects, road shows, prevention of doorstep crime, over 60s club, and equipment for a faith based community centre. Other agencies have also reinvested their shares in asset recovery activity.</p>

	<p pid="d.184W.12/1">VASCAR is a device approved by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) as a means of corroborating an officer's opinion that a vehicle was speeding. Guidance on its use is a matter for ACPO. I understand that use was suspended briefly in Scotland while existing guidance was clarified, but that it has now been reinstated. It is now clearly understood that VASCAR can always be used without the risk of Airwave radio interference if the radio is switched off or its transmit inhibit function has been activated, or if an active radio is outside a police vehicle and VASCAR inside, there is a distance of at least two metres between them.</p>

It is designed to break down barriers between police and Muslim communities by promoting an understanding of how counter-terrorism operations work. At the same time, it provides police officers with an insight into Muslim community concerns and the impact that counter-terrorism operations can have upon those communities. It also addresses some of the myths that surround CT work.</p>

The CTUs enhance, complement and support the work of police forces by providing coordination and specialist support to deliver our counter-terrorism strategy. West Midlands CTU has a broad operational capability that incorporates intelligence, investigation and surveillance functions. Personnel working within the unit have been responsible for a number of arrests and prosecutions as well as more discrete day-to-day prevention and disruption activity to counter the threat posed by terrorism.</p>

	<p pid="d.196W.5/1">It is the responsibility of primary care trusts to ensure that their existing health care staff are well trained and provided with the opportunity to receive continuing professional development.</p>
	<p pid="d.196W.5/2">However, the Government are committed to actively supporting the training of undergraduate doctors, some of whom will go on to become general practitioners, in helping to reduce the harms that are attributable to alcohol misuse.</p>
	<p pid="d.196W.5/3">This will include ensuring that around 60,000 new doctors leaving medical training in England, over a 10 year period, will be able to deliver competent practice in both drug and alcohol misuse, including a clear focus on the recognition and the management of risky and harmful alcohol consumption.</p>
	<p pid="d.196W.5/4">We allocated &pound;650,000 in 2008 for the developmental work medical schools will need to carry out, to embed such an integrated substance misuse curriculum into their own core teaching and training programmes. This funding will enable the first major tranche of medical schools to make the changes needed; with full roll-out across all schools over the following three years.</p>

	<p pid="d.196W.8/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has received five written inquiries and three telephone inquiries, one of which related directly to one of the written inquiries, concerning sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) products used for desensitisation to allergies.</p>
	<p pid="d.196W.8/2">These products are unlicensed medicinal products and importation from elsewhere in the European Economic Area requires prior notification to the MHRA by a licensed importer. Notifications are assessed for regulatory compliance and for known issues with safety and quality and the MHRA may object to importation. In 2005 the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM, now the Commission on Human Medicines, (CHM) advised the MHRA that they should not object to the importation of unlicensed pollen based SLIT products, provided they were for use in non-asthmatic adults under the supervision of NHS specialists with access to resuscitation equipment. On this basis, the MHRA will object to importation of all non-pollen based SLIT products.</p>
	<p pid="d.196W.8/3">The MHRA has recently become aware that certain unlicensed SLIT products have been imported into the United Kingdom without prior notification to the Agency. The importer has been instructed to cease importation and distribution.</p>
	<p pid="d.196W.8/4">The MHRA is encouraging importers to make appropriate notifications. Some have been received and assessed in line with the CSM advice, with non-objections to import issued for pollen based SLIT products. Non-pollen based SLIT products continue to attract objections to import.</p>

	<p pid="d.206W.3/1">It is for primary care trusts (PCTs) to ensure that those providing NHS primary medical services meet the terms of their contract. There are requirements for those contracts set out in the National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) Regulations 2004, the National Health Service (Personal Medical Services Agreements) Regulations 2004 and the National Health Service Act 2006: Alternative Provider Medical Services Directions 2008. Where a contractor fails to comply with the terms of their contract, the PCT may issue a remedial notice giving the contractor a specified time within which the concerns should be remedied. Where the contractor takes no steps to remedy the matter, the PCT may terminate the contract. In certain circumstances, the PCT may impose sanctions on the contractor.</p>
	<p pid="d.206W.3/2">There are no contractual requirements for general practitioners (GPs) or GP practices to provide explanation for instances where misdiagnosis and other forms of mistreatment have occurred.</p>
	<p pid="d.206W.3/3">Under the terms of their contract, GPs are obliged to operate a complaints procedure which allows patients to raise concerns about any matter connected to the provision of services under the contract. Under this procedure, all complaints must be properly investigated and the complainant given a written summary of the investigation and its conclusions. There are also requirements set out in the regulations and directions referred to regarding the qualification of persons who perform services, conditions for employment and engagement of those persons, training, level of skill, appraisal and assessment.</p>
	<p pid="d.206W.3/4">Professional guidance published by the General Medical Council (GMC) includes an obligation for doctors to share with patients, in a way they can understand, the information they want or need to know about their condition, its likely progression, and the treatment options available to them, including associated risks and uncertainties and to respond to patients' questions and keep them informed about the progress of their care.</p>
	<p pid="d.206W.3/5">The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), which rewards GP practices for achieving quality indicators, includes an indicator (Education 4) to reward practices for undertaking a minimum of 12 significant event reviews in the last three years. A significant event occurs when a patient may have been subjected to harm, had the circumstances/outcome been different (near miss). Each review case must consist of a short commentary setting out the relevant history, the circumstances of the episode and an analysis of the conclusions to be drawn. The practice is required to report to the PCT on its analysis and the PCT is expected to discuss the reviews as part of its QOF assessment visit.</p>
	<p pid="d.206W.3/6">The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) has developed a form to help health care staff report patient safety incidents. These are any unintended or unexpected incidents which could have or did lead to harm for one or more patients receiving NHS-funded health care. NPSA recommend that it should be used as soon as possible after the incident has happened.</p>
	<p pid="d.206W.3/7">Subject to the outcome of consultation, it is planned that the Care Quality Commission will register all GP practices to a consistent set of essential quality and safety criteria. Registration of primary care practices would help both to drive up the quality of practice-level clinical governance and to enable PCTs to concentrate on overseeing a small number of poor-quality practices.</p>

	<p pid="d.214W.8/1">The Government are developing plans for a health research support service that will provide an appropriate environment for greater use of anonymised and linked anonymised (or pseudonymised) data sets for research. They will also strengthen the arrangements to avoid any breach of confidentiality in types of research requiring the use of information that could identify individuals.</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.8/2">A programme of work in NHS Connecting for Health (the research capability programme) has been under way since 2007 to facilitate medical research using data derived from patient information, strictly within the bounds of confidentiality. The aim is to realise the research potential of electronic patient records, as described in the Government's health research strategy &quot;Best Research for Best Health&quot;. Details of the programme are available on line at:</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.8/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/systemsandservices/research">www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/systemsandservices/research</a></p>
	<p pid="d.214W.8/4">and a copy has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.8/5">Research using patient information and DNA information is subject to several types of ethical and regulatory review. The health research support service must comply with the Data Protection Act 1998. The Human Tissue Authority regulates the use of human tissue for research, including analysis of DNA, under the Human Tissue Act 2004. The National Information Governance Board monitors uses of patient information under the NHS Act 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.214W.8/6">The Department's evidence to the select committee drew attention to important opportunities for research that will open up if the ethical and regulatory framework can provide for appropriate research access to data sets derived from both patient information and genetic information. No decisions will be taken without proper debate about consent and confidentiality. The plans for a health research support service are being developed with close attention to protecting the confidentiality of sensitive personal information. Improving access to anonymised data sets suitable for research is an important part of these plans.</p>

Such divergence is entirely appropriate and provides an opportunity for each part of the NHS to innovate and experiment with different models for the provision and organisation of health care services within a common framework of NHS principles, and to learn from each other. NHS services in both England and Wales have seen significant improvement in recent years.</p>

Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. <i> Cause Code</i><sup>(1)</sup><sup>( )</sup>The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) has used the following ICD-10 external cause codes as requested for this parliamentary question. It should be noted that this is not the full list of codes used to identify gunshot wounds and so the data should not be used to illustrate this. X93&mdash;Assault by handgun discharge X94&mdash;Assault by rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge X95&mdash;Assault by other and unspecified firearm discharge.<br/> <i> Data quality</i><i> </i>HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i> PCT/SHA data quality</i><i> </i>PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data. <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.234W.8/1">I've been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.8/2">The LinkAge Plus pilots have been testing the principles of joined-up working. Going beyond the traditional benefits and care agendas, they also provide access to a wide range of services encompassing housing, transport and volunteering opportunities to form aspects of a seamless service for older people.</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.8/3">Each pilot focuses on local needs, and how best to integrate services within those locations, being driven by the needs and aspirations of older people themselves, while also developing existing links between central Government, local authorities and other organisations The pilots finished in September 2008. They are currently being evaluated and a final summary report is scheduled for publication by March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.8/4">Early findings from the pilots suggest that LinkAge Plus is successful in enabling older people to access multiple services through a single contact and reaches those who are socially excluded.</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.8/5">In Gloucestershire, for example, they have set up a network of Village Agents who work directly with isolated older people in rural areas. Their presence within the community enables older people to get access to information and advice about the entitlements and services available to them&mdash;direct from a friendly, local contact.</p>
	<p pid="d.234W.8/6">We are also starting to disseminate the learning and core principles for LinkAge Plus across local authorities. To help do so, toolkit has been developed jointly with the Department of Health Partnership for Older People Projects. This seeks to help local authorities to put in place similar services.</p>

	<p pid="d.235W.3/1">The &pound;330 million announced for Maternity Matters covers three years, 2008-09 to 2010-11. This additional funding is included within the 2008-09 to 2010-11 primary care trust (PCT) revenue allocations. PCTs were informed of their revenue allocations for 2008-09 in December 2007. The 2009-10 and 2010-11 revenue allocations were announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-08">8 December 2008</phrase>. Revenue allocations for the year are made available to PCTs at the start of the financial year. We are in the first year of this additional funding and it is too early to assess the actual impact. However, through the national tariff money automatically flows to trusts when they do more maternity activity. In addition, the price itself for maternity services for 2008-09 has been uplifted by 10 per cent. compared to 2007-08, so even if there were no increase in activity, trusts would be getting 10 per cent. more. This equates to well over &pound;100 million over the current year and means that we know PCTs are passing on to trusts much more that the first year share of the &pound;330 million.</p>

	<p pid="d.244W.0/1">Information on the hospital schemes which have opened or begun construction (with their expected opening date) since 1997, with the capital construction cost of each, has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.244W.0/2">The private finance initiative (PFI) schemes in the list are currently accounted for as off balance sheet and are not therefore accounted as an asset by trusts. The national health service is in the process of determining of the value these assets which will be disclosed in their 2009-10 accounts under the new international financial reporting standards (IFRS) which apply to public sector accounts with effect from 2009-10. In respect of the public capital funded schemes, the total asset value of land and buildings for each trust is held centrally, but these are aggregate values which do not separately identify individual capital investment projects.</p>
	<p pid="d.244W.0/3">The 2000 NHS Plan set a target of opening 100 new hospital schemes by 2010. At the time of the NHS Plan, 69 schemes had already been given the go ahead&mdash;all but three of these schemes have opened (these three are currently under construction). The NHS Plan identified another 18 schemes to go ahead in the next two years under the PFI, bringing the total at the time to 87 schemes; the target of 100 was set in anticipation of more schemes being given the go ahead in future years. For example in addition to the 18 future PFI schemes identified in the NHS Plan, another 11 PFI schemes were given the go ahead shortly afterwards. Since then a number of other PFI and public capital funded projects have also proceeded and opened, which means that the NHS Plan target of opening 100 new hospital schemes was achieved in October 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.244W.0/4">The information placed in the Library identifies both PFI and public capital schemes currently under construction and which are due to be completed (open) in the next 10 years. Schemes developing PFI proposals and actively preparing an initial outline business case (OBC) or currently in procurement, are shown in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="d.244W.0/21">Proceeding to financial close and construction for these schemes is dependant on business cases being submitted and approved. It is too early to provide financial close and opening milestone dates for these schemes apart from the most advanced, North Bristol/South Gloucestershire primary care trusts (PCTs), where an expected financial close date is given.</p>
	<p pid="d.244W.0/22">The Government's policy continues to be that PFI and other public private partnerships should be used to deliver public services when this offers value for money. This is assessed on a case by case basis at the appropriate approval point for each scheme. The North Bristol/South Gloucestershire PCTs is the only health sector PFI scheme in the market at the moment and the two consortiums competing to be appointed preferred bidder have held discussions about current economic conditions and have factored this into their bids as part of the competitive process. No bidding consortium (which includes the prime contractor) has withdrawn from competition on an NHS PFI scheme in the last 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="d.244W.0/23">None of these schemes is awaiting approval from Treasury. The business case for the appointment of the preferred bidder at North Bristol/South Gloucestershire PCTs is expected to be submitted to the Department in April or May this year; it will need subsequent approval by Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="d.244W.0/24">There are a further four public capital hospital building schemes timetabled to begin construction in the next financial year (2009-10), subject to approval of their full business cases. No information is held centrally on the expected pipeline of public capital funded schemes for 2010-11 or later years.</p>
	<p pid="d.244W.0/25">The Department monitors the progress of all hospital building schemes (i.e. both PFI and public capital) in terms of the major project milestone dates (business case approval dates, financial close and opening) and collects and collates the appropriate information as it becomes available.</p>

	<p pid="d.250W.3/1">A number of factors have contributed to the decrease in the average net ingredient cost (NIC) per prescription item since April 2005. These include:</p>
	<p pid="d.250W.3/2" class="indent">the introduction in April 2005 of the category M scheme for calculating the reimbursement prices of selected generic medicines, which has lowered overall generic medicine prices in 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08;</p>
	<p pid="d.250W.3/3" class="indent">the introduction of the 2005 pharmaceutical price regulation scheme (PPRS) which required all companies that sold more than &pound;1 million worth of branded medicines to the national health service to reduce prices by 7 per cent. This lowered overall branded medicine prices in 2005-06; and</p>
	<p pid="d.250W.3/4" class="indent">more effective prescribing with high generic prescribing rates (83 per cent. of all prescription items were written generically in 2006). For example, the quarterly better care, better value indicator on statins has encouraged more systematic prescribing by general practitioners of therapeutically equivalent low cost generic statins in place of higher cost branded statins.</p>

A very small proportion of the UK MDR cases might now be classed as extensive drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).

In 2003, the National Audit Office carried out an audit of the national health service (NHS) isolation facilities. A total of 176 trusts were surveyed. Out of these, 63 had at least one airflow controlled room, with a total of about 300 (this figure includes paediatric facilities). It is for the NHS to determine the local level of provision of isolation facilities.</p>

	<p pid="d.265W.8/1">Vioxx (rofecoxib) was one of a relatively new group of anti-inflammatory medicines known as COX-2 selective inhibitors. It was licensed in the United Kingdom and many other countries for the treatment of arthritic conditions - osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis&mdash;and also for the short-term treatment of some painful conditions. COX-2 selective inhibitors are effective anti-inflammatory, pain-relieving medicines that are thought to have less risk of gastrointestinal side effects, for example stomach ulcers, than conventional anti-inflammatory medicines.</p>
	<p pid="d.265W.8/2">Since 2000, evidence from clinical trials had raised concerns about a possible increased risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular conditions associated with Vioxx, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)/Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) had continually reviewed the cardiovascular safety of this drug since it was first licensed. The product information for healthcare professionals and patients, which lists all the known side effects of the medicine, was updated on a number of occasions on the basis of emerging evidence, and in accordance with CSM's advice.</p>
	<p pid="d.265W.8/3">Data are not available on which to base a valid estimate of the number of heart attacks, strokes and other adverse effects that may have been caused by Vioxx and other COX-2 inhibitors. The underlying medical condition of many patients treated with COX-2 inhibitors means that they are already at higher risk of heart attack and stroke than the rest of the population, and the impact of the COX-2 inhibitor on this risk is not possible to calculate.</p>
	<p pid="d.265W.8/4">Since Vioxx was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer in 2004, the safety of other COX-2 inhibitors and traditional anti-inflammatory drugs&mdash;non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&mdash;has been under continual and intense assessment in the UK and Europe. The latest evidence suggests that both NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors might pose a small increased risk of heart attacks or strokes, although the exact level of risk may vary between medicines. The MHRA has widely communicated the latest information and advice for healthcare professionals in letters and bulletins, and other publications through liaison with the British National Formulary and National Prescribing Centre. In addition, product information (including patient information leaflets) has been updated in order to support informed decision-making in relation to the choice of anti-inflammatory medicine.</p>

However, in a number of countries supported by DFID, the co-ordination of TB and HIV programmes is continuing to improve. The World Health Organisation reports that there has been a substantial improvement in TB-HIV collaboration activities. The provision of HIV testing for TB patients between 2002 and 2006 increased from 21,806 across nine countries in 2002 to 687,174 patients across 112 countries in 2006.

However, we are aware that many older people struggle to meet the cost of day to day living, and that some have been borrowing to finance these costs.</p>
	<p pid="d.276W.2/2">The Government have invested considerable resource in debt advice over recent years. It has allocated &pound;130 million to expand the provision of free debt advice for the financially excluded through the Financial Inclusion Fund. A further &pound;15.85 million was allocated to support the National Debt Line and Citizen's Advice in the last Pre-Budget Report. These services are targeted at the financially excluded, including older people in financial difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="d.276W.2/3">The Government have also undertaken a number of measures to strengthen signposting to debt advice services, including a Direct.Gov campaign. The Direct.Gov website provides links to Help the Aged, Age Concern and other organisations able to provide financial information to this vulnerable group.</p>

	<p pid="d.277W.8/1">The Government fully understand the recent concerns over high interest rates charged by some credit card lenders. We secured agreement from credit card lenders to develop fair principles for any interest rate increase they introduce on reviewing an individual's account. These came into force in January 2009 and provide extra protections when a customer or group of customers' interest rate is changed as a result of a perceived change in their ability to repay their debts.</p>
	<p pid="d.277W.8/2">Where a lender increases their rates, customers will be given the option to close down their account and repay their remaining balance at the existing rate of interest. Lenders also agreed not to increase rates for customers who have failed to make two or more consecutive minimum payments, where an agreed repayment plan is in place for the account, or where lenders have been notified by a not-for-profit debt advice agency that the customer is in serious discussion with it.</p>
	<p pid="d.277W.8/3">Credit card lenders will also give a breathing space of up to 60 days to borrowers in difficulty. During this time lenders will not commence debt collection proceedings, giving borrowers time to agree a repayment plan with the help of a not-for-profit debt advice agency.</p>
	<p pid="d.277W.8/4">We have also implemented a number of measures to provide vulnerable and low-income consumers with access to affordable credit and free debt advice. &pound;80 million has been invested in the Growth Fund scheme to support loans to low-income families, and &pound;130 million has been allocated to expand the provision of free debt advice for the financially excluded through the Financial Inclusion Fund. The Government will continue to monitor the credit market closely through the new Consumer Finance Forum, bringing together representatives from the financial services industry, consumer groups and Government. This Forum will meet regularly to address issues facing borrowers during the downturn.</p>

	<p pid="d.283W.0/2">There are no plans to undertake an assessment. The Government recognise that in the current economic climate the bio-pharmaceutical industry is facing challenges. The Prime Minister held a summit with global leaders from the industry on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-27">27 January 2009</phrase> to discuss the main issues facing the industry in the United Kingdom. He reinforced the message that the Government are committed to working with the industry to ensure that the UK maintains its position as a world leader in this sector, and to this end, he announced the creation of an Office for Life Sciences, to be led by Lord Drayson, the Science and Innovation Minister. The Office will be tasked with undertaking work in the short-term to address some of the issues facing the industry, and to develop a longer-term life sciences industrial strategy.</p>

	<p pid="d.283W.3/1">According to data from a forthcoming, independent report by Innovas, commissioned by BERR, the global market value of the Low Carbon and Environmental Goods and Services (LCEGS) sector is &pound;3,046 billion, the UK (LCEGS) market (combined home market and export) accounts for 3.5 per cent. of this at &pound;107 billion. UK exports of (LCEGS) are currently at only &pound;10.5 billion or just around 10 per cent. of the UK market value, and there is a real opportunity for the UK to increase its global market share.</p>

Examples of the advantages differentiating the UK from our main competitors in the international EGS sector include leading the way in environmental improvements through progress in the waste management and water sectors, setting standards in professional services such as world class environmental consultancies, and investing in innovative approaches.</p>

The study will consider the existing relay service Text direct (also known as Type Talk which allows two way telephone conversations between deaf or speech impaired people), captioned telephony (where the relay assistant re-voices one end of the call into captions using speech recognition technology), Video relay (which enables sign language users to communicate with hearing people in real time, using a sign language interpreter based remotely) and internet protocol access to text relay (which would enable people to have fixed and mobile access to text relay via a PC with an internet connection, removing the need for specialist terminal equipment).</p>

However as part of our ongoing review of our 'National Calculation Methodologies', building performance assessment tools the standard assessment procedure for dwellings and the simplified buildings energy method for non-dwellings, Government are working with OFTEC (Oil Firing Technical Association) to establish the carbon emission factors for the bio-liquids that are being developed as a low carbon alternative for kerosene. While it is expected that these liquids, which are likely to include some used cooking oil as well as other liquids produced from biomass, will mainly be used in plant to produce space heating and hot water they could equally be used to generate electricity. Nonetheless, through this work we will be able to estimate the carbon impact of using such bio-liquids compared with other fuels.</p>

	<p pid="d.293W.2/1">My Department funds the Met Office Hadley Centre (MOHC), through its Integrated Climate Programme with joint funding from the MOD and DEFRA, to monitor, understand and predict climate change; this research includes incorporating sea ice into global climate models to ensure best possible predictions on melting of Arctic sea ice. We also liaise with other research groups in the U.K. and internationally on this topic.</p>
	<p pid="d.293W.2/2">The Northwest Passage temporarily became fully open and navigable in summer 2007, for first time in recorded history, due to the record low extent (September average area: 4.28 million sq km) of Arctic sea ice melt. The same situation occurred in summer 2008, when the sea ice area (4.67 million sq km) was at its second lowest on record. Satellite monitoring data since 1979, available from the US National Snow and ice Data Centre (NSIDC) shows there has been a long-term decline in the extent of summer Arctic sea ice and that this decline has accelerated over the last decade; the long-term downward trend of around 10 per cent. per decade can be linked to human emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. It is not yet clear if the much larger summer ice melt in the last two years is an acceleration of this long term trend or a short term variation around it. Recent analysis by the MOHC suggests that changes as large as the observed record low in 2007 can indeed result from natural year-to-year variability around the longer term downward trend; this provides confidence in the ability of the MOHC's climate model to simulate changes in the area of Arctic sea ice and its continuing decline. However, it is evident that climate models show a wide range of future predicted rates of sea ice decline. Whilst the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report suggested the Arctic would be largely free of summer ice by 2100, many more recent models predict this will happen much sooner&mdash;by the middle of this century or even earlier; several experts suggest there may possibly be no summer sea ice by the mid 2010s.</p>
	<p pid="d.293W.2/3">Satellite and other records also show a long-term decline in the average thickness and age of Arctic sea ice over recent decades. For example, scientists from University College London recently reported that the thickness of the ice was significantly lower (by an average of 10 per cent.) during the winter of 2007-08 than during the previous five winters, indicating that the total volume of sea ice has decreased significantly. Though based only on satellite data (which are not ideal for measuring sea ice thickness), this result confirms previous evidence of decreasing sea ice thickness over the past three decades from US and UK submarine sonar measurements.</p>
	<p pid="d.293W.2/4">The retreat of Arctic sea ice has geo-political implications, with the Northwest Passage becoming increasingly ice free and fully open to shipping. There are other important implications; by reducing the reflectivity (albedo) of the Earth's surface, it increases the amount of solar radiation that the surface absorbs, thereby accelerating warming. Temperatures have already risen almost twice as quickly in the Arctic as in the rest of the world over the past 100 years. Sea ice retreat also has significant impacts on Arctic ecosystems, as many organisms (including certain species of fish) depend on its presence for survival. DECC is continuing to seek updated assessments of Arctic sea ice conditions and impacts from UK and international experts.</p>

	<p pid="d.294W.5/2">The Government's policy on clean coal technologies was set out in the &quot;Strategy for Developing Carbon Abatement Technologies for Fossil Fuel Use&quot; in 2005 and more recently in the Energy White Paper, 2007. Clean coal technologies include: higher efficiency conversion processes; fuel switching to lower carbon alternative such as biomass co-firing; and C02 capture and storage (CCS). Some of these approaches will result in increased efficiency of the operation of the generation plant, but some such as CCS will require additional energy to operate.</p>
	<p pid="d.294W.5/3">The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) supports demonstration of carbon abatement technologies through the Environmental Transformation Fund (ETF). To date DECC has committed &pound;2.2 million to an oxy-fuel combustion CCS project.</p>
	<p pid="d.294W.5/4">In addition the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) support R &amp; D on clean coal technologies via the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) and the research councils. The TSB has identified carbon abatement technologies as a priority area in its energy generation and supply strategy and currently supports around 11 projects with a total value of around &pound; 13.4 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.294W.5/5">The research councils also support a wide range of underpinning research and training in carbon abatement technologies through their research councils' energy programme and through their individual programmes. In the last five years some 25 projects covering CCS totalling over &pound;23 million have been funded.</p>
	<p pid="d.294W.5/6">Sourcing of coal is a matter for generators and other coal users, but the Government believe that making the best use of UK energy resources, including coal reserves, contributes to our security of supply goals, and that this reflects a value in maintaining access to economically viable reserves of coal.</p>

The statistical annex to this report gives indicative projections for fuel poverty in England. These show an estimated further 1.2 million households moving into fuel poverty between 2006 and 2008, largely due to fuel price increases. However, these estimates were based on information known at the time and therefore have clearly been overtaken by a more complex price increase and so should not be regarded as representing the Government's view about what the current figures are.</p>

We estimate that energy suppliers invested around &pound;800 million of this in a priority group of vulnerable and low-income households, including pensioners. Under the current three year phase of the obligation to 2011, known as the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT), we estimate suppliers alone will need to invest over &pound;3.2 billion in household energy efficiency measures, &pound;1.8 billion of which will be delivered to the priority group. However, Government have not made specific estimates for what proportion of the priority group spend by suppliers might be attributed to pensioners.</p>

	<p pid="d.305W.11/2">Generic Design Assessment (GDA) of potential new nuclear power stations is being undertaken by both the Nuclear Directorate of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), and by the Environment Agency. From the start of this work in 2007 up to the end of 2008, the costs recovered from the companies requesting the assessment was &pound;5.84 million for work undertaken by HSE and I am informed by the Environment Agency that their recovered costs for the same period were &pound;1.72 million. Both regulators' costs will continue to be fully recovered for work assessing the two designs which are being taken through the final stages of GDA.</p>
	<p pid="d.305W.11/3">To help with the management of the GDA project, HSE's Nuclear Directorate employs four staff on project management activities. Three are on contract: two from an external agency, one from the Health and Safety Laboratory, and one was appointed from existing HSE resource. The head of the Environment Agency's GDA team was appointed from within the Agency's existing cadre, and acts as project manager for his team's work. One administration manager has been seconded into the HSE GDA team from another Government Department.</p>

	<p pid="d.315W.9/6" class="indent">Currently the UK National Accounts are calculated in accordance with the international guidelines set out in the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). In this framework the personal sector equates to the household sector which is combined with the non-profit institutions serving households sector (NPISH), and it is not possible to separate the two. Examples of institutions included within the NPISH sector are: charities; trade unions; universities; churches and political parties. Data on this basis are available back to 1987.</p>

	<p pid="d.335W.5/2">London 2012 is bringing a wide range of business and economic benefits including &pound;6 billion worth of contracts, over 75,000 supply chain opportunities and many jobs, skills training and apprenticeship opportunities. These include 30,000 people helping to build the Olympic Park and Olympic Village; 2,500 people directly employed on the staging of the games with a contractor work force of some 100,000; and 50,000 new permanent jobs in the Park and the wider Lower Lea Valley after the Olympics are over. As well as further jobs in the supply chain, the games will also create 6,700 jobs in the wider visitor economy. Visit Britain estimates the tourism benefits at &pound;2.1 billion. In terms of skills, at least 350 apprentices will gain valuable skills on the construction of Park and Village.</p>
	<p pid="d.335W.5/3">The economic downturn has reduced the amount of private sector investment available to the Olympic Village and the International Broadcast Centre/Main Press Centre projects. However, these projects remain on track; and to the extent that additional public sector funds are required, these can be delivered within the &pound;9.325 billion public sector funding package.</p>

	<p pid="d.336W.2/2">It is part of the Olympic Delivery Authority's (ODA) normal business to bear down on costs across the programme. As reported in the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games Annual Report, published January 2009, the forecast of potential final costs of the ODA programme includes estimated savings of &pound;193 million, offsetting forecast increases. There are a range of controls in place to manage risks and budgets, control changes and control access to contingency. The forecast in potential cost increases in venues is offset by potential savings in other parts of the project. So far, the powerlines tunnelling project, Orient Way railway sidings project and the Weymouth and Portland sailing venue have all been delivered on time and budget.</p>

	<p pid="d.337W.5/1">The potential increase in taxation, as reported in Table 2 of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games annual report published January 2009, was the amount of corporation tax estimated to be payable on an anticipated receipt for the sale of the assets post-games. As a consequence of the decision, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-06">6 February 2009</phrase>, to establish a dedicated 2012 Olympic Park Legacy Company, it is now more likely that the Company will benefit from that anticipated receipt and the corporation tax is now unlikely to be payable by the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA).</p>
	<p pid="d.337W.5/2">The increase in programme delivery costs is a result of CLM (ODA's Delivery Partner&mdash;and incentivised to deliver to programme and against cost targets) achieving a higher level of key performance indicators than anticipated in the original budget leading to a consequential increase in performance related payments. This reflects good progress in respect of the delivery of the project&mdash;to time and within budget&mdash;and in the achievement of savings which are outlined in the 2009 annual report.</p>

	<p pid="d.338W.0/2">The Funders Group contingency is principally for risks that fall outside of the control of the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA). The recent allocation of Funders Group contingency was to help fund the Olympic village and the international broadcast centre (IBC)/main press centre (MPC) projects, both of which had been affected by the global economic situation, particularly the downturn in the housing and banking markets. This downturn was outside of the ODA's control and therefore Funders' Group contingency is the appropriate source of funding.</p>
	<p pid="d.338W.0/3">A proportion of the funding for the IBC/MPC project (&pound;67 million) was funded from programme contingency. This is because, as part of the restructure of the IBC/MPC project, elements of new scope&mdash;including to ensure that the buildings left in legacy have the flexibility to be adapted to a wide range of uses to maximise potential future employment opportunities&mdash;and additional project contingency were included.</p>

In December the Olympic Board published the findings of the KPMG report. The Olympic Board agreed at the time of publication that further work to assess the venue for shooting would be carried out by the ODA and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic games and Paralympic games (LOCOG) in the new year. This work is ongoing, and includes an evaluation of Bisley which will be considered by the Olympic Board.</p>

	<p pid="d.339W.2/1">There are two routes by which the existing sporting facilities in Haringey could be used for the London 2012 Olympic Games. Firstly as a Pre-Games Training Camp venue; Haringey has one designated training facility in the LOCOG Pre-Games Training Camp Guide offering athletics training facilities at the White Hart Lane Community Sports Centre in Wood Green. A National Olympic Committee or National Paralympic Committee is yet to make arrangements to use this facility for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="d.339W.2/2">Secondly, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) has begun the process of identifying Games-time Training Venues and there is the possibility that this same facility could provide valuable training opportunities for athletes while competing at the London 2012 Games. The venue owner and operators have been asked to express their interest to LOCOG if they wish to be considered for this programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.339W.2/3">In addition, 371 businesses in Haringey have signed up for CompeteFor (London 2012's website for publishing Games related contract opportunities) and 14 Haringey schools are registered as part of Get Set (LOCOG's domestic education programme).</p>

	<p pid="d.339W.5/1">Provision of accessible transport was one of the major strengths in London's bid to host the Games&mdash;not just for athletes but also for spectators, with a fully-accessible network of buses, black cabs and the DLR to the heart of the Games in Stratford.</p>
	<p pid="d.339W.5/2">The Accessible Transport Strategy (appendix 2), published in June 2008, lists those organisations that worked with the ODA to produce this document, and who will help deliver our commitment to accessible transport provision.</p>
	<p pid="d.339W.5/3">The ODA is also making financial contributions, alongside existing TfL funding plans, to a wide range of transport upgrade works which include improved accessibility works. Five London underground stations have been identified as serving Olympic venues&mdash;Stratford, West Ham, Southfields, Baker Street, Green Park&mdash;and works are under way to make all of these accessible by the summer of 2012. Already, all DLR stations, buses (excluding heritage routes), and black cabs are accessible.</p>
	<p pid="d.339W.5/4">The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) will deliver accessible transport for athletes, officials and the Paralympic Family from their accommodation to competition venues in 2012. LOCOG is entering a phase of detailed operational planning, and has already started talking to specialist operators with experience in the provision of transport for disabled athletes.</p>

Information is not collected on the time taken to conduct treasure inquests.</p>
	<p pid="d.342W.3/2">Informal figures are, however, collated by the British Museum, which record the time between the inquest being requested by the British Museum and a verdict being returned.

The longest time between an inquest being requested and a verdict being returned was 525 days, while the other six ranged in duration from 77 days to 423 days. A statistical average based on such a small number of cases would be very volatile and heavily dependent on the particular circumstances of each case.</p>

	<p pid="d.343W.2/1">The Ministry has taken decisive action to improve data handling including minimising the amount of data put on removable media, encryption programmes for data and mobile devices that carry personal protected data and the introduction of training and education programmes to improve staff awareness of information risks.</p>

Central records only exist from 2003 and indicate that no members of staff have been dismissed for losing IT equipment.

	<p pid="d.348W.3/2">The Electoral Commission found in their report, 'Understanding Electoral Registration', published in September 2005, that the groups least likely to be registered to vote included young people, those residing in private rented accommodation and those belonging to certain minority ethnic groups.

	<p pid="d.348W.3/3">Section 9 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 placed a new duty on electoral registration officers (ERO) to take all necessary steps to register eligible electors. These steps include sending the annual canvass form more than once, making house to house enquiries and inspecting records that the ERO is permitted to inspect.

	<p pid="d.354W.2/2">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="d.354W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="d.354W.2/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking how long on average it took a prisoner eligible for Jobseeker's Allowance upon release to receive that benefit after release in the last 12 months. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="d.354W.2/5" class="indent">In answer to your specific question, I regret that this type of information is not routinely collected and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.354W.2/6" class="indent">Whilst information about prisoners' claims is not collected specifically, they are included in the overall Jobseeker's Allowance claim processing target. At the end of December 2008, our Jobseeker's Allowance claims clearance rate was an average of 10.4 days, against a target of 11.5 days. Whilst January figures have not yet been confirmed, we expect them to be at a similar level.</p>
	<p pid="d.354W.2/7" class="indent">All prisoners being released who wish to claim Jobseeker's Allowance are also able to use the Freshstart process. Freshstart involves pre-arranging a New Jobseeker Interview to claim Jobseeker's Allowance at the prisoner's home Jobcentre Plus office for as soon as possible after they are released. The customer normally has an appointment with a Jobcentre Plus Adviser within 3 days of leaving prison. The process helps to speed up the receipt of benefit and aims to ensure that the offender engages with the Jobcentre at the earliest opportunity to allow them to gain appropriate support.</p>
	<p pid="d.354W.2/8" class="indent">In addition, those serving shorter term sentences can also take advantage of the Rapid Reclaim Process. This service is available if a prisoner reclaims benefits within 26 weeks of their last claim and their circumstances have not changed. There are simpler and shorter forms to complete and processing the benefit is eased.</p>

	<p pid="d.360W.5/1">The re-designation of HM Prison and Young Offender Institution Drake Hall and HM Prison and Young Offender Institution Morton Hall as closed prisons will allow the Prison Service to more properly provide for the needs of women suitable for each of the prisons. The effect of the change will allow for greater flexibility in the use of the estate; improving closeness to home and families for some women, allowing appropriate lifer and indeterminate sentenced women to be placed so as to better meet their needs, and in general enable more women to access the resettlement regimes available at the two prisons. There are no plans to move any of the women out of Drake Hall and Morton Hall as a result of the change. The change is essentially an administrative one, both establishments will retain their current levels of internal and perimeter security and their current resettlement regimes, including their roles as specialist foreign national centres. Women suitable for &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot; conditions will be able to go these prisons if such a move meets their resettlement needs.</p>

The presence of the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda (FDLR) militia in eastern DRC is one of the fundamental causes of the conflict there. We support the decision of the two governments to co-operate in efforts to disband the group, and urge that they involve UN peace keepers fully in any military planning, and that any action undertaken minimises the risks to the civilian population.</p>

The cost of maintaining our 232 departmental websites on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)'s previous web platform in 2007-08 was approximately &pound;870,000. The cost of maintaining the 240 departmental websites on the FCO's new web platform in 2008-09 is expected to be &pound;1,386,000. These figures cover hosting and support costs, but are not directly comparable because of the extensive changes in the way the web platform is managed in 2008-09, compared to 2007-08. The costs do not include staff time spent updating the website.</p>

	<p pid="d.374W.0/2"><i> </i>The European Council sets the direction for the EU through a process of negotiation between the 27 member states, and makes its decisions known through Council conclusions. Every six months the rotating EU presidency publishes a plan of action which is reported to the Council and contains a section on foreign policy. However, these papers do not rank foreign policy objectives in priority order.</p>
	<p pid="d.374W.0/3">The 2003 European Security Strategy (ESS) provides the framework for the EU's external action. In December 2008 the European Council endorsed the High Representatives Review of the implementation of the ESS. The ESS and the review suggest that Europe needs to be more active, more capable and more coherent in the external sphere and to work with partners in achieving its objectives. These include tackling distant threats such as terrorism and proliferation, with a focus on Iran and North Korea; building security in our neighbourhood including in the Balkans, the Middle East and the Mediterranean; and contributing to a well functioning international institutional system that is rule-based. The documents set out the need for the EU to tackle concerns over &quot;frozen conflicts&quot;, to push towards a settlement in the Middle East and to focus on ensuring energy security, including greater diversification of energy sources and a more unified energy market within the EU.</p>
	<p pid="d.374W.0/4">The review makes clear the principle that states have a shared responsibility to protect populations, and that there is a link between security and development leading to the need for a comprehensive approach to conflict prevention and resolution combining all of the tools at the EU's disposal. The review also acknowledges the role that the EU has to play in conflicts further afield such as stabilising Afghanistan, and supporting UN objectives in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan/Darfur, Chad and Somalia. It also recognises the need for the EU to expand relationships with China and India and maintain close ties with Canada and Japan, and build on relations with Brazil and South Africa.</p>

	<p pid="d.380W.5/2">However, we have long had serious concerns about the support that Iran provides in the form of funding, training and arms supplies to groups which are undermining peace in the Middle East through violence, including Hamas. Such support is unacceptable and only serves to undermine regional security. We hope that Iran will instead give political and diplomatic support to the Palestinian Authority in its attempts to build institutions and improve security.</p>

A large number of British residents, both full-time and part-time, do not register with either their local consulate or with the Spanish authorities.

	<p pid="d.409W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.409W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated February 2009:</p>
	<p pid="d.409W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent parliamentary question concerning what changes have been made to the methodology for calculating the Civil Service headcount since May 1997.</p>
	<p pid="d.409W.2/4" class="indent">Estimates for the home civil service from Q3 2004 onwards are taken from the Civil Service element of the Quarterly Public Sector Employment Survey (QPSES). Estimates prior to this date are based on results from the Civil Service Statistics publication (Mandate collection) available for <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-01">1 October</phrase>. A quarterly path back to 1991 was estimated by Office for National Statistics (ONS) using standard procedures.</p>
	<p pid="d.409W.2/5" class="indent">In 2005, ONS, in collaboration with other departments and the devolved administrations, implemented major improvements to public sector employment estimates. Standard definitions for public sector employment across all departmental statistics were agreed and a single definitive set of quarterly public sector employment estimates introduced.</p>
	<p pid="d.409W.2/6" class="indent">The following are changes in definition that were implemented as part of the transition to QPSES. To maintain consistency with Cabinet Office no revisions were made to previously published statistics.</p>
	<p pid="d.409W.2/7" class="indent">Self-employed, contract workers and agency temporary workers should be excluded from estimates.</p>
	<p pid="d.409W.2/8" class="indent">Workers who only work part of the year (for example, those on casual or annualised hours contracts) should be counted at the time they are being paid for &mdash; if they are not working but are still being paid they should be included. If they are not working and not being paid at the reference point they should be excluded from the statistics.</p>
	<p pid="d.409W.2/9" class="indent">Employees on different types of leave should be treated in the following way in headcounts:</p>
	<p pid="d.409W.2/10" class="indent">All those on paid maternity leave should be included.</p>
	<p pid="d.409W.2/11" class="indent">All those on paid sick leave (being paid either in full or part) should be included.</p>
	<p pid="d.409W.2/12" class="indent">All those on paid special leave should be included.</p>
	<p pid="d.409W.2/13" class="indent">Those employees on short-term unpaid leave should be included if they are on leave for a period for less than their pay period &mdash; they should be included even if they are absent on the reference date. If they are off for a period longer than their pay period then they should be excluded (for example, someone on a career break).</p>

	<p pid="d.415W.2/1">We are helping the Further Education system deliver a more personalised learning experience for each learner, in ways that help learners acquire the skills and ability they need to succeed and thrive&mdash;personally and economically. That includes guidance titled 'Supporting Learners to Succeed' which is available through the Learning and Skills Improvement Service Excellence Gateway. The guidance helps providers develop their pastoral support systems and processes to improve the emotional, social and economic well-being of all learners.</p>
	<p pid="d.415W.2/2">In addition, the White Paper &quot;Further Education: Raising Skills Improving Life Chances&quot; (March 2006) recognised that when learners participate in decisions affecting their learning they are likely to play a more active part in improving the quality of provision. All providers are expected to have in place a Learner Involvement Strategy. The pastoral support guidance includes examples of how providers can encourage and motivate learners which in turn will help providers to further develop their strategies for engaging learners.</p>

	<p pid="d.415W.5/1">Typically, architecture graduates have high employment rates with the latest available data from the 'Destination of Leavers from Higher Education 2006-07' showing 93 per cent. of those with degrees in 'architecture, building and planning' in employment or further study six months after graduating. However, we recognise that the graduate labour market will not be immune from the effects of the economic downturn. Although indications suggest that overall vacancies are likely to fall, there will still be growth areas. Graduates will need to consider a wide range of jobs; look for jobs earlier; and do research on potential employers to maximise their chances of success. We are also considering a number of ways to provide real help and support for new graduates including new opportunities for internships; promoting volunteering; the development of entrepreneurial skills; and increasing the availability over the next two years of Professional and Career Development Loans.</p>

	<p pid="d.420W.2/2">The two types of student loan have different repayment terms. Borrowers with income-contingent loans introduced in 1998 repay 9 per cent. of earnings above &pound;15,000.</p>
	<p pid="d.420W.2/3">Repayments are usually collected through the tax system via employers, alongside income tax and national insurance contributions.

	<p pid="d.420W.2/4">With both types of loan, repayment is due to start in the April after borrowers graduate or otherwise leave their course, if their income is above the relevant repayment threshold. This point is known as the Statutory Repayment Due Date (SRDD). Some borrowers fully repay before they are required to commence repayments.</p>
	<p pid="d.420W.2/5">The average time taken to fully repay mortgage-style loans is six years after SRDD, according to data at <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>. It is not yet possible to give a meaningful average time taken to repay income-contingent loans, because in terms of repayments the income-contingent loans scheme is still relatively young.

	<p pid="d.421W.0/12">Borrowers are required to begin repaying their loans in the April after they graduate or otherwise leave their course, if their income is above the repayment threshold. Those below the threshold will include borrowers who have gone on to further study.</p>

	<p pid="d.421W.6/2">Neither the Department nor NWML publish comprehensive guidance to local authority trading standards departments on weights and measures legislation. Rather, the practice is to publish draft guidance on any new or amended weights and measures legislation in advance of the legislation coming into force to ensure both business and local authority trading standards departments have an opportunity to familiarise themselves with any changes before they take effect. Final guidance is then normally published when the new or amended regulations come into effect.</p>

	<p pid="d.423W.2/2" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.423W.2/3">There are no regulatory barriers preventing the development of broadband services without a voice service ('naked DSL') and nothing therefore preventing a commercial operator offering the service, indeed Virgin Media offer a broadband only service ('naked cable').</p>
	<p pid="d.423W.2/4">While some ADSL broadband customers may not want a traditional voice telephone service, they may still require the telephone line to deliver their broadband. Although a subscriber may no longer require a traditional voice telephone service therefore, there remains a cost to be met for the provision, maintenance and operation of the line. The majority of the line rental charge covers these costs.</p>
	<p pid="d.423W.2/5">Ofcom reports that over the past five years several operators have considered offering a broadband only service. However, such a service has never been launched. Given the level of competition in this market and the fact that several operators have considered offering a broadband only service it would appear that no operator has identified a commercial case for such a product.</p>

The proportion of centrally managed expenditure allocated to each region cannot be established without disproportionate cost. This is because many activities are categorised thematically rather than geographically, for example, research into seaside towns, aerial survey programmes or spend on interpretation at English Heritage properties.</p>

	<p pid="d.427W.0/1">DCMS channels its funding mainly via our family of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs). NDPBs are tasked with delivery of our overall strategies, including delivery of many bespoke programmes and projects.</p>
	<p pid="d.427W.0/2">At headline level DCMS does not target inner-city areas for special funding arrangements although NDPBs occasionally do target similar demographics via particular programmes or work streams.</p>
	<p pid="d.427W.0/3">Some of the key DCMS initiatives schemes, aimed at providing access and opportunity for all, will have particular beneficial effects on inner-city children. This list is certainly not exhaustive and further details of individual work strands can be found on the website of the DCMS family at</p>

	<p pid="d.427W.0/5" class="italic"> Sport</p>
	<p pid="d.427W.0/6">Through our PE and Sport Strategy for Young People, delivered jointly with DCSF, the Government are investing at least &pound;783 million over 2008-11 to offer five hours of quality PE and sport to all pupils in England. This includes &pound;22.8 million from my Department in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="d.427W.0/7">The strategy reaches into every maintained school, and so provides a wide range of recreational sporting opportunities for children living in inner-city areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.427W.0/8">Our key delivery partners, the Youth Sport Trust and Sport England, work with a wide range of national, regional and local partners including schools, sports clubs and youth and community organisations to attract more young people into sport across the country, including inner-city areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.427W.0/9">Sport England which is an NDPB and National Lottery distributor, focuses on ensuring quality sporting opportunities exist beyond the school gates, enabling children and young people to migrate from the school environment to community sport. Reaching out to diverse communities is a vital part of their work.</p>
	<p pid="d.427W.0/10" class="italic"> Free Swimming</p>
	<p pid="d.427W.0/11">Local authorities across the country have signed up to the Government's initiative to offer free swimming to both those aged 16 and under and over 60. The local authorities that: have opted in to offer the scheme to both age groups have also received a share of a &pound;10 million capital fund to spend on modernising or improving pool provision in time for the start of the two-year scheme in 2009. Those local authorities that will offer free swimming to both age groups also stand to benefit from a further &pound;25 million capital challenge fund in both 2009-10 and 2010-11 to spend on improving pool provision. Many inner-city local authorities have taken up this opportunity. Details of participating Authorities can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="d.427W.0/14">Through Arts Council England DCMS provided funding of almost &pound;8.5 million between January 2008 and December 2008. This provided recreational activity for inner city children aged 0-15 years in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield, Liverpool, Leeds, Bristol, Nottingham, and Portsmouth. These cities are top ten (by population) primary urban areas as defined by DCLG 'State of the Cities' database 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.427W.0/15" class="italic"> Find Your Talent</p>
	<p pid="d.427W.0/16">In February last year the Government announced the new &pound;25 million Find Your Talent (FYT) Pathfinder programme to trial different ways of delivering a five hour cultural offer for children and young people aged 0-19. The Pathfinders, running for three years were launched in September last year.</p>
	<p pid="d.427W.0/17">Our ambition is to offer all children high quality cultural experiences no matter where they live or what their background and the Find Your Talent programme is part of the Government's drive to unlock the creative talent of all young people.</p>
	<p pid="d.427W.0/18">This is on top of the investment the Government already put into cultural education programme. This means we fund cultural opportunities on a national scale and these funds are distributed to regions and localities via our funded bodies who fund projects in inner city areas and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="d.427W.0/19">The ten Find Your Talent Pathfinder projects are listed and include inner-city areas:</p>

	<p pid="d.429W.8/1">Since the implementation of the Licensing Act 2003, DCMS has been collecting alcohol, entertainment and late night refreshment statistics for England and Wales on an annual basis by financial year from licensing authorities. The first bulletin covers the period April 2006 to March 2007; the second bulletin covers the period April 2007 to March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.429W.8/2">For the period ending March 2008, 94 per cent. of new premises licence applications were granted, 2 per cent. were refused and 3 per cent. were unknown or undecided at the time the data were collected. For the same period, 95 per cent. of new club premises certificates were granted, 2 per cent. refused and 3 per cent. unknown or undecided (based on around 95 per cent. of Licensing Authority responses). We do not know how many of the rejected applications were for the sale of alcohol as licences and certificates also cover the provision of regulated entertainment and late night refreshment. However, generally we can say that 84 per cent. of premises licences and 98 per cent. of club premises certificates permitted the sale of alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="d.429W.8/3">For the period ending March 2007, 96 per cent. of new premises licences were granted, 1 per cent. were refused and 3 per cent. were unknown or undecided at the time the data were collected. For the same period, 92 per cent. of new club premises certificates were granted, 2 per cent. were refused and 6 per cent. were unknown or undecided (based on around 82 per cent. of Licensing Authority responses).</p>
	<p pid="d.429W.8/4">Prior to the implementation of the Licensing Act 2003, data on the number of alcohol licences revoked in England and Wales were collected by petty sessional division (magistrates court areas), on a triennial basis.

	<p pid="d.430W.2/1">The Department's first evaluation of the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 in March 2008 showed that the police have welcomed their new powers and provided evidence that local people are much better engaged than they were under the old licensing regime. Also, information and case studies we gathered from scrutiny councils as part of the review suggested that initial benefits were developing into longer term trends and that the Act is having a real impact on key issues such as crime and disorder and sales of alcohol to children. The Department does receive a number of letters, mainly from the public, where concerns are raised but it is not possible to categorically state which of these could be classified as complaints. We have always maintained that licensing is not the only solution to problems related to crime and disorder and nuisance and we continue to liaise with local authority representatives, police representatives, and other Government Departments (notably, the Home Office and the Department of Health, which have overall responsibility for the Government's renewed alcohol strategy) to develop new measures for combating these social problems.</p>

It should be noted that the times on a licence do not show the actual opening hours which will often be less as the licence provides flexibility. However, we did commission work for the evaluation of the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 (available from the House Library) which shows actual closing times on a Saturday night, provided by licensees. The summary shows, for example, that pub closures have increased by up to 27 minutes to a 11.30pm average closing time and that bar closures are up 28 minutes to a midnight average closing time.</p>

	<p pid="d.432W.2/1">The appointment of Colette Bowe was made following a process regulated by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) and was also subject to pre-appointment scrutiny by a joint session of the Business and Culture Select Committees. All applicants were considered against published selection criteria which set out the qualities, skills and experience required for the position and the decision on who to appoint was based on merit. While it is not appropriate to comment on specific details of selection processes or individual applications, appointments are always made following proper consideration of matters such as conflict of interest and probity.</p>

	<p pid="d.436W.8/1">Responsibility for what is broadcast on television and radio rests with the broadcasters and the organisations which regulate broadcasting&mdash;the Office of Communications (Ofcom), the BBC Trust and the Welsh Fourth Channel Authority (S4C)&mdash;within the overall framework set by the Communications Act 2003 and the BBC Charter and Agreement.</p>
	<p pid="d.436W.8/2">In relation to broadcasting, Parliament has charged Ofcom with maintaining standards, notably to protect children and to protect the general public from harmful and offensive material, including bad language. The Ofcom Broadcasting Code therefore sets out the rules with which broadcasters must comply. Ofcom also produces guidance notes to assist broadcasters in interpreting and applying the Broadcasting Code. In addition, the BBC's editorial guidelines, under the sovereignty of the BBC Trust, provide clear advice on the standards expected of all BBC content on television and radio. The S4C Compliance Guidelines also provide guidance on the standards expected of all content broadcast on S4C.</p>
	<p pid="d.436W.8/3">Within this framework, it is the broadcasters' job to make judgements about what individual programmes should contain and the time at which they are broadcast.</p>

In addition, companies from beyond the banking sector are showing an interest in entering the market. Discussions are also ongoing with the European Investment Bank.</p>
	<p pid="d.439W.5/3">PfS is also exploring with the Department and HM Treasury the option of accessing the shorter term debt market to support PFI schemes. This would involve refinancing schemes at seven or 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="d.439W.5/4">Against this backdrop, BSF continues to deliver. Deals have closed throughout the autumn and now into 2009, with the latest deal to close in Tameside, bringing the total to twenty-nine. Nearly a third of all secondary schools in England are now engaged in BSF, with the 50th school having now opened.</p>

	<p pid="d.441W.2/1">The Department commissioned research from Ipsos MORI (&quot;Extended Schools Survey of School, Pupils and Parents&quot;, 2009). Schools were asked how they fund activities and child care (multiple choices were possible). The report found that:</p>
	<p pid="d.441W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;Around three-quarters (73%) of schools that provide childcare, or activities used as childcare, say that users pay for services, although around three in ten (32%) say that the school itself provides funding to enable this service to run. Activities are also most commonly funded by the school (58%), although this is also more likely in secondary schools (74%) and schools in deprived areas (70%).

	<p pid="d.454W.2/1">History is a statutory subject for all pupils to the end of key stage 3, normally age 14, and at key stage 4 students are entitled to follow a humanities course (comprising geography and history).</p>
	<p pid="d.454W.2/2">The review of statutory requirements for key stage 3 was completed in 2007 and new programmes of study are being implemented in the current academic year for children in year 7. The range and content of the key stage 3 programme of study set out the aspects of British, European and world history on which teachers should draw when teaching the skills of historical enquiry, use of evidence and communicating about the past. The new programmes of study also allow for joint working on issues such as diversity and ethnicity; and there are strong links between citizenship education and the teaching of history.

When the three year funding settlement was announced in November 2007, local authorities were informed that we expected to see them work with their schools to reduce the total amount of surplus, uncommitted balances held by schools.

In general, local authorities fund special schools on the basis of the number of pupils for which they are expected to cater, including boarders, whether or not the places are actually occupied.

However, the overall cost of a scheme as set out in the White Paper, 'New Opportunities', will be affordable within the overall schools budget in 2010/11. Future years falls outside the current spending review period, so it is not possible to identify allocations beyond 2010/11.</p>

	<p pid="d.475W.8/1">In December 2008 we arranged for Capita Teachers' Pensions (TP), our pensions administrator, to write to all those pensioners who were known to be affected by this issue. The content of the letter was agreed across the public service pension schemes and provided a detailed explanation of how the calculation of an element of their pension, known as the guaranteed minimum pension, caused the overpayment. This was supported with a dedicated telephone helpline, which has received approximately 1,000 calls to date. TP will be writing again to those pensioners before the end of February to advise them of the impact on their pensions. At that time they will be provided with further information on how their revised pension amount has been calculated. A dedicated telephone service will continue to be provided to further assist those pensioners to understand their pension calculation.</p>

In certain circumstances the operator would not be able to contest damages, although they would not be liable if the accident was the fault of the passenger or caused by the passenger's negligence.

The Department is also promoting the importance of keeping tyres correctly inflated via the Act On CO2 campaign.</p>

	<p pid="d.490W.11/1">The Department for Transport's report, &quot;Improving the Air Passenger Experience&quot;, provides appropriate estimates of aircraft stacking above Heathrow. This report is available at:</p>
	<p pid="d.490W.11/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/airports/improveairpassenqer.pdf">http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/airports/improveairpassenqer.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="d.490W.11/3">Figure 27 on page 25 shows that in 2006-07, 56 per cent. of arriving aircraft were held in a stack and for those held, there was an average 8.5 minute hold. This equates to roughly 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted by aircraft stacking at Heathrow in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="d.490W.11/4">As the capacity constraint is reached at Heathrow, these delays and emissions are forecast to increase in future without additional capacity.</p>
	<p pid="d.490W.11/5">Although the effect on stacking of a third runway has not yet been quantified, it is anticipated that a third runway will reduce the need for aircraft to be held in stacks. It will also enable the airport to operate with greater flexibility for slot re-timing with potentially fewer delays for passengers.</p>

	<p pid="d.498W.8/1">Railcards offer a discount against the full price of travel. They are designed to encourage travel by groups of people who might otherwise be unable to use rail and to encourage social inclusion. In general, railcards are for off-peak travel where there is spare train capacity.</p>
	<p pid="d.498W.8/2">All franchised train operators must accept the Senior Railcard, Young Persons Railcard and Disabled Persons' Railcard. Other railcards are offered commercially by train operators.</p>

Fares revenue and subsidy together have to cover the costs of providing the service. We could require operators to offer more railcards but only if Government paid higher subsidies to offset the reduction in revenue. This would reduce the funds available for other things, including investment in train services.</p>
