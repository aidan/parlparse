	<p pid="c.209W.0/2">38 per cent. of lone parents who have had contact with Employment Zone (EZ) advisers in Great Britain and 36 per cent. of lone parents who have had contact with EZ advisers in London have moved into work.</p>
	<p pid="c.209W.0/3">Nine reports on EZs<sup>(1)</sup> and 23 reports on NDLP<sup>(2)</sup> have been published and are available in the Library. A list of the most recent reports is reproduced in the list.</p>
	<p pid="c.209W.0/4">Latest available data indicate that the cost of helping lone parents into work is around &pound;1,900 per person through EZs and around &pound;600 per person through NDLP. Direct comparisons cannot be drawn between the costs of helping someone into work through EZs and NDLP. EZs operate in some of the most disadvantaged areas in the country while the New Deals operate nationally. In London EZ areas, employment support is provided to lone parents through EZs rather than through NDLP. Outside London, lone parents in EZ areas are offered help through NDLP at their first work-focused interview (WFI), but can choose between EZ and NDLP support if they continue to claim income support and have a second WFI. This increases the likelihood of such EZ participants requiring additional, and thus more costly, support to help them into work.</p>

	<p pid="c.222W.5/22">The number of S29 cases has decreased since the introduction in March 2004 of Continuous Registration enforcement from the record. The requirement to electronically submit S29 cases to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service for prosecution, and the problems encountered in establishing this link led to a decrease in the number of prosecutions and an increase in the pursuit of these offenders by wheel clamping activity. A suitable method of transmitting cases electronically has now been found.</p>

	<p pid="c.225W.5/1">Funding for schools is a shared responsibility between central and local government. The majority of funding is provided by central government, with local authorities (LAs) providing the rest. In 2006-07, for the first time, schools received their funding from a Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) rather than as part of the local government settlement. The DSG is a ring-fenced grant and must be used for schools' budgets. It is for each LA to distribute funding using a locally agreed formula, and for schools' governing bodies to decide how to spend the available resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.225W.5/2">Support for children with special educational needs (SEN) accounts for a high proportion of all education expenditure. We do not hold information centrally about expenditure on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but information collected from LAs shows planned expenditure on the education of children with SEN of &pound;4.5 billion in 2006-07. This is about 13 per cent. of all education spending.</p>
	<p pid="c.225W.5/3">In addition, schools and LEAs can use their School Development Grant to support SEN. SDG is allocated to schools and LAs to spend on teaching and learning according to their own needs and priorities. Total SDG for 2006-07 is almost &pound;2 billion and schools will see an increase over their 2005-06 SDG allocations of at least 3.4 per cent. per pupil in 2006-07 and 3.7 per cent. in 2007-08.</p>

It includes special schools, and pupil referral and other educational units for pupils of secondary school age. It is prioritised on educational and social needs of geographical groups of schools proposed by local authorities. Projects including hospital schools or units are eligible where locally proposed. Such units are already eligible for devolved formula capital allocations.</p>

Of these, 3,000 children who were taken into care aged under one subsequently returned home between 2001 and 2006 to live with parents, relatives or other person with parental responsibility (excluding residence orders and special guardianship orders).

The 'category of need' codes record the main reason why a child is being provided with services. This provides a further insight as to why a particular child is being looked after. Information on 'category of need' was first collected in April 2000 and provides further information as to why a child is being looked after. Data on 'category of need' is not strictly comparable with the 'reason for being looked after' information that was collected prior to <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase>.</p>

At present we are unable to give similar percentages for 2005/06 as the sub-national participation estimates for 2005 are not currently available. They are due to be published in June 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.238W.2/27">Local authorities were responsible for the registration and inspection of children's day care facilities until these responsibilities were transferred to Ofsted in September 2001. The figures for 2005 were derived from the Ofsted database of registered child care providers. The figures for 1997 were derived from the Children's Day Care Facilities Survey, which was discontinued in 2001.

	<p pid="c.238W.2/28">With the introduction of the National Day Care Standards and the transfer of responsibilities for registration and inspection of child care providers from local authority social service departments to Ofsted in September 2001, child care places were classified according to the type of day care provided: full day care, sessional day care, child minder, out of school day care or cr&egrave;che day care. Ofsted have produced figures based on this classification on a quarterly basis from March 2003. Their latest figures were published in their report &quot;Registered Childcare Providers and Places, September 2006&quot;, which is available on their website:</p>

Subject to future public spending decisions, the intention is to achieve this aim for every secondary school pupil within 15 waves from 2005-06 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.8/3">The first contracts for the BSF programme were signed earlier this year. The first &quot;Quick Win&quot; BSF school opened in Solihull in June and the second in South Tyneside in September. The first non-Quick Win school is scheduled to open in Bristol in September 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.8/4">In financial year 2007/08, we expect 14 schools will open of which three will be refurbished and a further 117 will start construction.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.8/5">In financial year 2008/09, 56 schools will open of which 21 will be refurbished and a further 182 will start construction.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.8/6">In financial year 2009/10, 129 will open and a further 182 will start construction.</p>
	<p pid="c.241W.8/7">The figures for 2009/10 are indicative as this includes Wave 4 projects, which have just been selected this month, and certain Wave 2-3 projects where authorities have not yet finalised their plans.</p>

The apparent drop in participation may, in part, have resulted from a change in the wording of the question in relation to walking between the 1996 and 2002 surveys. Although in both surveys walks of two miles or more were asked about, the 2002 survey asked only about 'recreational walks.'</p>

	<p pid="c.264W.2/1">People 1st (the Sector Skills Council for the hospitality, leisure, travel and tourism industries) recently undertook a comprehensive Skill Needs Assessment as part of their 'Sector Skills Agreement' (SSA) process. This is a major DfES policy area designed to create a demand led system of education and training.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.2/2">The Sector Skills Agreement has five stages, the first of which is the Skills Needs Assessment. This Assessment, undertaken between May and November 2005, looked at the current and future skill needs of the sector through extensive consultation with employers regionally, by industry and across the four UK nations. The research identified management and leadership, customer service and chefs skills as the priority skill areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.2/3">Linked to this, retention was also identified as a priority. The industry has high staff turnover rates, which cost the sector nearly &pound;1 billion each year. The full report and a summary can be found at <a href="http://www.people1st.co.uk">www.people1st.co.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.2/4">The second stage is an assessment of the supply of learning, which People 1st undertook between January and June 2006 (consulting with both employers and learning providers). The research revealed the sector employs a high percentage of students and international workers, has weak progression routes, and the majority of employers are confused about both what support is available and how to access it.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.2/5">The third stage looked at the gap between supply and demand, and is being used to inform the final two stages which involve working with employers and delivery partners to finalise the agreement. Further details will be available when these discussions have concluded.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.2/6">This research has underpinned the series of Skills Summits that DCMS held with People 1st. These summits are overseeing the development of a National Skills Strategy for the sector (the England arm of the Sector Skills Agreement), which is due for completion in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.264W.2/7">I recently chaired the third summit in this series and launched the UK Skills Passport. The Passport will benefit both employers and employees by providing an entire system of career development and training, and signposting industry to qualifications and funding that meet their needs. A fourth Skills Summit will take place later this spring.</p>

The number of breeds with natural bobs is small and I think it extremely unlikely that an owner of such a dog would be prosecuted under the tail docking ban. Should such a case be brought before the courts, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution to prove that an offence has been committed, and evidence from a veterinary surgeon or breed society is likely to establish the necessary facts.</p>

Within the NBU, there are eight regional bee inspectors and approximately 36 seasonal bee inspectors led by a national bee inspector. They carry out a targeted apiary inspection programme together with an extensive series of training events for bee keepers.</p>

	<p pid="c.268W.8/1">For the Great Britain routine herd testing programme for bovine tuberculosis (bTB), the Government uses the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test (commonly known as the &quot;skin test&quot;). For reasons outlined, it is not possible to give a precise figure for the number of false positive results obtained from these bTB tests.</p>
	<p pid="c.268W.8/2">When the skin test is applied to cattle in bTB-free herds in Great Britain, there is less than a one in 1,000 chance that a non-infected animal will be wrongly classified as a reactor. This is known as the test's false positive rate. An alternative way of defining this is to say that the skin test has a specificity in excess of 99.9 per cent. Although the probability of getting at least one false positive result increases with the size of the herd being tested, it would be extremely rare to find more than one false positive in a herd.</p>
	<p pid="c.268W.8/3">It is important to bear in mind that failure to confirm the disease by post-mortem examination at the slaughterhouse, or by culturing the causative bacterium in the laboratory, does not mean that the animal was not infected with bTB. In the early stages of this infectious disease, it is not always possible to see lesions with the naked eye and, due to the fastidious nature of the organism, it is not possible to culture it from tissue samples in every case. Therefore, it is not correct to consider all skin test reactors that fail to disclose disease in the slaughterhouse or in the laboratory as false positives. The ease with which lesions of bTB can be detected at slaughter depends on the stage of infection, with lesions being harder to find in the early stages of bTB (that is, when most animals are detected using the skin test).</p>
	<p pid="c.268W.8/4">The following table shows, for 2004, 2005 and the first six months of 2006, the total number of test reactors slaughtered and the number of such reactors that had demonstrable evidence of infection at post-mortem examination and/or bacteriological culture:</p>

	<p pid="c.275W.0/3">There have been no prosecutions of intensive gamebird farms by DEFRA in the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.275W.0/4">The Animal Welfare Act 2006, which will come into force in April 2007, introduces a duty on people responsible for an animal to take such steps as are reasonable to ensure its welfare. This new power will apply to gamebirds reared for sporting shooting prior to their release, and to gamebirds reared for meat.</p>
	<p pid="c.275W.0/5">We have no plans to introduce regulations for the rearing of gamebirds. We do, however, propose to use powers under the Animal Welfare Act to produce a Code of Practice, which will provide guidance on accommodation and management methods, including aggression reduction. Specifically on the issue of raised laying units, before considering regulation or a ban on the system, I believe that it is important I obtain an independent view on this method of housing gamebirds. To that end, the Farm Animal Welfare Council's study of the system and its report will be fundamental in informing my decision on their future. As you are aware, I have particular concerns surrounding the use of raised laying units and will not hesitate to take appropriate action if, following the report, I believe that the bird's welfare is compromised. Any code would be subject to public consultation and endorsement by Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.275W.0/6">At present, all animals, including gamebirds reared for sporting purposes are covered by the Protection of Animals Act 1911. Under this Act it is an offence to ill-treat or cause unnecessary suffering to any captive or domestic animal. In addition, gamebirds reared for slaughter for food would be covered by the Welfare of Farmed Animals Regulations.</p>

	<p pid="c.287W.5/2">Trichloroethylene, chromium, nickel, and cadmium are strictly controlled by existing legislation, and REACH will take a similar approach. There is a separate regulatory regime for biocides under the EU Biocidal Products Directive (98/8/EC), and these substances will be regarded as already registered for the purposes of REACH.</p>

	<p pid="c.288W.5/1">The Recycling Credits scheme was reformed through section 49 of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 (CNEA). Changes to the Scheme increase the flexibility of payments from waste disposal authorities (WDAs) to waste collection authorities (WCAs) in two-tier areas by giving them the option to jointly agree alternative arrangements. These changes have been in effect since April 2006. The CNEA also clarified that recycling credits can be paid for reuse activity and that reuse should be treated in the same way as recycling for the purposes of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/2">Local authorities (LAs) have the power to pay credits to third parties for the recycling and reuse activity they carry out. These payments are at the discretion of individual LAs so that they can take account of local circumstances. The Government introduced updated guidance in April this year, which gives greater encouragement to LAs to adopt good practice. The guidance strengthens the existing presumption that LAs will consider applications for credits from third parties which meet certain criteria and consider the social, environmental and economic benefits associated with community recycling.</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/3">The guidance makes it clear that credit values should be the same for reuse as they are for recycling and disposal credits for third parties should be calculated on the same basis as credits for waste collection authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.288W.5/4">Guidance on the recycling credits scheme can be found on the Defra website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.291W.2/1">The decision to end the adjudication scheme was not taken lightly. The Scheme supports the Code of Good Practice for agri-environment schemes and diversification projects within agricultural tenancies. It is administered by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors and was set up in December last year, with the intention that it would continue for a period of four years. However, since its launch in December 2005, there has not been a single application for the Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.291W.2/2">Given the current financial constraints within DEFRA, it would not have been a sensible use of public money to allocate funds for a further three years to a scheme for which there has been no interest. Therefore, we decided reluctantly that the Scheme should be closed at the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.291W.2/3">The closure of the Scheme does not affect the validity of the Code of Good Practice, which stands in its own right and provides useful and informative advice to tenants and landlords contemplating diversification activities. The Code is available from the DEFRA website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.296W.11/1">The Department tried to negotiate a settlement through a schemed approach based on the Claims Handlers Agreement (CHA). The Department agreed with the Claimants Group (CG) on taking mixed workers&mdash;those who had worked both underground and on the surface&mdash;into the scheme. The Department offered that any surface worker in a dusty job&mdash;with agreement on what these were&mdash;could go through the medical assessment for chronic bronchitis and temporary exacerbation of asthma which provides for low levels of compensation (on the lines of the tariffs now operating in the fast track scheme). And any surface worker with a pneumoconiosis reading (which the Department's claims handlers, Capita, took as a proxy for a marker of exposure to dust) could go through the full medical assessment and have access to higher levels of compensation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).</p>

	<p pid="c.301W.6/1">As part of our analysis for the Energy Review we commissioned Jackson Consulting to undertake a high-level assessment of the suitability of the existing nuclear generating sites to support possible new power stations. The purpose of the report was to help us form a view on whether nuclear could play a role in the future generating mix. The study was not aimed at the potential siting of new plant&mdash;this will be for the private sector to decide, should they decide to bring forward proposals for new build.</p>
	<p pid="c.301W.6/2">Subject to confirming our view that nuclear has a role to play alongside other low carbon options, in the Energy White Paper next year, we intend to carry out a strategic siting assessment. We will publish the preliminary technical assessment that we undertook for the Energy Review once this strategic assessment is finished. We believe that publishing it before the strategic assessment would prejudice that assessment.</p>

	<p pid="c.302W.5/19">The contribution of renewables to total UK primary energy demand has grown from 1.3 per cent. in 2003 to 1.5 per cent. in 2004 and 1.7 per cent. in 2006. Thermal renewable sources appear to make a larger contribution to energy supplied by renewables when measured in primary energy terms because, by definition, the primary inputs of non-thermal sources such as wind and hydro are equal to the electricity produced and there are thus no conversion losses.</p>

The Government welcome the initiative taken by Ofgem in calling for reductions in wholesale prices to be passed on to domestic customers. The regulatory framework provides for Ofgem to fine companies up to 10 per cent. of annual worldwide turnover if it finds evidence of anti-competitive behaviour. Ofgem can also refer the market to the Competition Commission if it finds evidence that competition is not working.</p>

The purpose of the report was to help us form a view on whether nuclear could play a role in the future generating mix. The study was not aimed at the potential siting of new plant&mdash;this will be for the private sector to decide, should they decide to bring forward proposals for new build.</p>

HSE's Nuclear Safety Directorate has monitored the situation since the early 1990s and BE disclosed the phenomenon in its recent re-listing prospectus. The Department was informed of the recent incidents of boiler tube cracking at these stations shortly before British Energy made its announcements to the market.</p>

It is possible that section 216 may also apply to new businesses run by directors of other insolvent companies which have no connection with that previous business' activities and consequently would not be considered as a &quot;phoenix&quot; company. Section 216 applies to any director of an insolvent company, independently of any wrongdoing. The number of complaints received via the Hotline since February 2005, which relate specifically to section 216 is 10 and none have yet resulted in either a disqualification or prosecution of a director.</p>

	<p pid="c.316W.5/1">The aim of Regulation (EC) No. 2006/2004 is to formalise and improve co-operation arrangements between member states' consumer enforcement authorities, in order to better combat cross-border frauds and scams. Its focus is on practices that affect the collective interest of consumers, rather than complaints affecting only individuals, and its scope is limited to the 15 pieces of EC consumer protection legislation named in the annex to the regulation.</p>
	<p pid="c.316W.5/2">Basic details of alleged infringements e.g. business names and details of the complaint will be transmitted from one country's Single Liaison Office to another's and then on to the relevant enforcer by means of a secure database.</p>
	<p pid="c.316W.5/3">Access to the database is limited to enforcers designated as competent authorities and national Single Liaison Offices (in the UK, the Office of Fair Trading). Single Liaison Offices will only have access to information relating to requests for mutual assistance, which have not been given confidential treatment. Non-EU countries do not have access to the database. The regulation does anticipate entering into arrangements with third (i.e.: non-EU) countries but none are in place at present, and any future arrangements should have appropriate safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="c.316W.5/4">Data held on the database will be subject to the provisions and protections of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA). While the regulation requires us to prevent the subject access provisions of the DPA being used by business to obstruct the proper functioning of the regulation, we are satisfied that this fact should not cause problems in practice because appropriate safeguards have been built in.</p>

For Iraq this figure was 86 per cent. and for Afghanistan was 75 per cent. Recent improvements to the Afghanistan air-bridge include refurbishment of the runway at Kandahar Airfield, which was completed in November 2006. This now allows troops to fly from an airport closer to the majority of deployed locations, reducing in-Theatre journeys by up to 24 hours.</p>

The new units will be set up for three-year pilot periods and will receive initial funding of &pound;800,000 in 2007-08.

	<p pid="c.326W.6/1">The effective management of stores involves the assimilation of considerable quantities of information from a wide variety of sources. The MOD currently operates six major supply systems, seven major inventory systems and six major warehousing systems. Currently there is considerable integration within the single services and some integration across the services.</p>
	<p pid="c.326W.6/2">In light of experience during operations in Iraq in 2003 the Support Chain Programme was established to modernise and make significant improvements in the integration of the different information systems utilised for the management of stores, to drive forward change in logistic and engineering information systems and to provide a robust governance framework for the management of new projects and existing systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.326W.6/3">The Programme is focussing initially on delivering improved operational capability to the Front Line, with major changes to Base systems following on later.</p>
	<p pid="c.326W.6/4">Under the Support Chain Programme the six major supply systems are due to reduce to one over the next few years. Work is also in hand to achieve similar reductions in inventory and warehousing systems. The programme will integrate both legacy and future information systems to retain coherence. To assist this, work is also underway to modernise the means by which applications are able to communicate with one another, with modern technology allowing for the creation of more flexible and intelligent networks. The ultimate aim is to move to a position where MOD is operating a fully integrated stores management system working right across Defence, including industry.</p>

It is the Government's position that criminal investigations led by the police generally represent the best way of achieving this.</p>

	<p pid="c.343W.5/3">There are a number of different risk assessment tools for coronary heart disease (CHD) in use in England. Most of them derive from the Framingham prediction equations, which estimate CHD risk based on patients' age, gender, blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density cholesterol, presence of diabetes and smoking habit. Relative risk reductions in CHD events in the statin trials appear similar regardless of baseline risk and baseline cholesterol except where baseline cholesterol is less than 5.0 mmol/l when the relative risk reduction is less. This implies that the best way to target patients for cholesterol control and statin therapy to reduce CHD risk is to calculate absolute risk.</p>

	<p pid="c.346W.2/1">The national service framework (NSF) for long-term conditions, published in March 2005, is a 10-year plan to raise the standard of treatment, care and support for people with long-term neurological conditions across local health and social care services. As a result of the NSF, people with neurological conditions, including those with dyspraxia, will receive a faster diagnosis, more rapid treatment and a comprehensive package of care.</p>
	<p pid="c.346W.2/2">Local national health service and social services are responsible for reviewing their services to see if they already meet the quality requirements set out in the NSF. This will help them to decide their local priorities for making changes and improvements, to meet the criteria in full over the next 10 years.</p>

	<p pid="c.349W.2/1">National health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for the provision of health care services in their areas. Regular re-appraisal of their service provision should be carried out to reflect changing demands of health care and consequently the whole or parts of hospital sites may become surplus to their requirements. Under guidance provided by the Department's publication Estatecode, such property should be offered to other local trusts to determine whether these assets could be re-used by them for the provision of health care services. This policy accords with the Government's requirement to make better use of surplus public sector land.</p>

	<p pid="c.350W.2/1">The Secretary of State has deferred support for the trust as it is required to repay a significant debt to the Department in respect of an earlier income and expenditure deficit. The trust requires more time to make the necessary arrangements to fund the repayment and ensure that it remains financially viable.</p>
	<p pid="c.350W.2/2">A copy of the correspondence between the Department and the trust has been placed in the Library. There has been no correspondence between Monitor (the statutory name of which is the Independent Regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts) and the trust because the trust has not reached Monitor's assessment stage for authorisation as a national health service foundation trust.</p>

	<p pid="c.353W.0/1">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Effectiveness (NICE) published a health technology appraisal (HTA) on statins in January 2006. This took account of all available evidence and concluded that it was both clinically- and cost-effective to intervene with statin therapy in patients who scored a 20 per cent. or greater 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), regardless of the starting cholesterol. This updates the national service framework for coronary heart disease (CHD) which had set the threshold for intervention at a 30 per cent. 10-year risk of CHD, both by lowering the intervention threshold and by including the range of vascular conditions&mdash;including cerebrovascular disease&mdash;which are together termed CVD.</p>

	<p pid="c.353W.0/4">Cost-effectiveness estimates vary as costs change. The cost of generic statins came down sharply while the HTA was in preparation and has dropped again since its publication. The NICE website therefore includes a tool which the national health service can use to determine current cost-effectiveness in their local health economies.</p>

	<p pid="c.359W.8/1">The Government view credible elections in Sierra Leone in July this year as crucial to consolidating the post-conflict peace and stability there. Practical support to Sierra Leone's National Electoral Commission (NEC) is a high priority and we have committed &pound;4 million to the UN Development Programme's &quot;basket fund&quot;, which finances the NEC and contributes to the cost of the elections. It is essential that Sierra Leoneans should be able to participate fully in the elections and that the result should reflect their choices. To this end, the UK is implementing a &pound;2.5 million programme of electoral support that will provide training for political parties, strengthen the capacity of national and local media to cover the elections and address the gender disparity surrounding elections. Our high commission in Freetown is also working with the full range of political and civil society to support free and credible elections.</p>
	<p pid="c.359W.8/2">Effective election monitoring will also play an important role in the elections. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development (DFID) received representations on this issue from the interim leader of the People's Movement for Democratic Change, Charles Margai, during his December tour of the UK. Our high commission and the DFID office in Freetown have also discussed election monitoring with the main political parties, the NEC, local and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international partners, in order to assure adequate coverage before and during the polls.</p>
	<p pid="c.359W.8/3">Our &pound;2.5 million electoral programme will support a coalition of national election monitors, the &quot;National Elections Watch&quot;, which intends to host observers in every polling station in Sierra Leone. DFID will also be funding international election observers through the National Democratic Institute (NDI), an international NGO with expertise in election issues. NDI will host two observer missions prior to elections, one during the voter registration period and another during the campaign period, and one mission of 34 observers on election day. UK Government election observers will also be deployed for the critical phases of the electoral process and for the elections themselves. We have also called, in the EU Africa Working Group, for the deployment of an Election Observation Mission. Additionally, we are also engaging wider partners, including the UN, the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Carter Centre, to push for international support for the election monitoring effort.</p>

In this regard, we look forward to Ethiopia withdrawing its troops from Somalia as quickly as it can, as it has stated it wants to.</p>
	<p pid="c.360W.2/4">We are also encouraging all parties inside and outside Somalia to use the current opportunity to embed a political process across Somalia as envisaged in the Transitional Federal Charter.

	<p pid="c.364W.2/1">We continue to call on African leaders to speak out against Mugabe's bad policies. We are not aware of any recent public statements by President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, on Zimbabwe's land policy. But independent surveys of the fate of Zimbabwe's agricultural population tell a tragic story: 75 per cent. of farm workers and their dependants have been forced out of their farmland homes. These people, who number at least two million, now live marginal lives without income, access to proper shelter, food or medicine. We fear that many of these people have died. We are concerned that the Gazetted Land Act, which Mugabe signed into law in December, will be used as an unjust pretext for further intimidation and attacks on farmers, with more damage to Zimbabwe's economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.364W.2/2">We have always said that we would support a land reform programme that was transparent, fair and legal and that was carried out within a macro-economic framework that formed part of a wider Zimbabwe Government programme to reduce poverty.</p>

In doing so, our aim is to provide certainty for the development industry and other related businesses without over-regulating the sector. With an ambitious national framework in place to strengthen building regulations, local authorities should not need to devise and impose their own detailed standards for the environmental performance of individual buildings. The draft Planning Policy Statement (PPS) on climate change, published for consultation alongside &quot;Building a Greener Future&quot;, recognises there may be local development or site specific opportunities to justify higher levels of building performance than set out nationally.

	<p pid="c.368W.2/18">Funding for the scheme beyond March 2008 to 2011 will be decided following the next spending review.</p>
	<p pid="c.368W.2/19">The scheme was launched at the beginning of October so only limited figures are available. 4,000 households have been accepted by HomeBuy agentson to the scheme already since it was launched just10 weeks ago and are now looking for properties or beginning the process of buying a home. The first42 households have been approved to exchange on their property and the first five households have completed their sales just 10 weeks after the programme was launched. We expect to help up to 10,000 households through the scheme by the end of March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.368W.2/20">We do not hold information centrally on the number of applicants who have attended a presentation and/or an interview with a financial adviser to undergo a financial assessment as part of the application process.</p>
	<p pid="c.368W.2/21">All applicants to the Expanded Open Market HomeBuy scheme will receive information on the low cost home ownership options available to them, and undergo a financial assessment&mdash;along with other eligibility checks&mdash;before being accepted on to the scheme, but different HomeBuy agents will fulfil these functions in different ways depending on local circumstances, and the scale of delivery in their area.</p>
	<p pid="c.368W.2/22">Those HomeBuy agents handling large number of applications tend to ask applicants to first attend a presentation on low cost home ownership opportunities in their area, before they visit a financial adviser to undergo the financial check. Those operating on a smaller scale tend to direct applicants to their website for further information, and conduct financial checks in-house.</p>
	<p pid="c.368W.2/23">Once applicants are accepted on to the scheme, they are strongly recommended to visit a financial adviser of their choosing, before making the decision to proceed with a purchase</p>

	<p pid="c.369W.2/1">The Department does not collect centrally the number of houses planned for construction on flood plains, which depends on a large number of local decisions. It is a matter that regions and local planning authorities should consider in preparing regional spatial strategies and local development documents, and in taking decisions on individual planning applications.</p>
	<p pid="c.369W.2/2">Government's aim is to avoid inappropriate development in areas of high flood risk. The new Planning Policy Statement No. 25 directs development away from these areas through a sequential, risk-based approach. More vulnerable development, such as housing, should not be permitted in those areas unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the development will be safe, without increasing flood risk elsewhere and provides wider sustainability benefits that outweigh the flood risk.</p>

	<p pid="c.374W.2/1">Since 1997, Liverpool has seen significant improvements in housing, infrastructure and economic and social development. Last year (2005-06) through New Heartlands, the Housing Market Renewal (HMR) scheme, there were in excess of 1,300 new homes constructed and over 1,600 homes refurbished in Liverpool. There was also an additional &pound;10.5 million of private sector funding invested within the Liverpool pathfinder area, of which &pound;4.2 million went specifically into HMR projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.374W.2/2">Liverpool John Lennon airport, one of the fastest growing airports in the UK, received European objective 1 funding towards increasing terminal capacity and improving passenger and public transport facilities. The airport is a key economic driver in the regeneration of the area, and direct on and off-site employment at the airport has risen from 500 employees in 1997 to 2,350 in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.374W.2/3">Under the 2000-06 Programme of European objective 1 funding in Merseyside, over 1,700 projects have been approved, in excess of 37,000 jobs have been created and over 6,000 business start-ups have been assisted.</p>
	<p pid="c.374W.2/4">Social improvements are demonstrated by the city's progress towards narrowing the gap against key national floor target indicators. Particular progress has been made in education, housing and liveability, which has seen the gap reduce from 11.3 in 2003-04 to8.6 in 2004-05. Furthermore, the overall Liverpool employment rate has increased at a higher rate than the UK average, 1.3 per cent. compared to 0.3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.374W.2/5">In addition, GVA growth in Liverpool (1998 to 2003) outstripped the national average rate. Liverpool has also seen a significant expansion in knowledge-based employment and benefited from substantial private sector investment in its tourism infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="c.374W.2/6">The total funding Communities and Local Government has invested in Liverpool for regeneration projects since 1997 is in excess of &pound;670 million. Additionally Liverpool is also eligible to benefit from a further &pound;393.3 million which Communities and Local Government has invested into the wider Merseyside region. The European objective 1 programme (2000-06) also provides a further &pound;910 million for investment in Merseyside and Liverpool will benefit from this investment.</p>
	<p pid="c.374W.2/7">We do not hold the total figures of regeneration spend for Liverpool in every funding stream since 1997 on an annual basis. However, the following table details the main regeneration funding since 1997, available directly to Liverpool or from which Liverpool can benefit.</p>

	<p pid="c.382W.2/1">We welcome any serious attempt at getting AIDS drugs more accessible and affordable for those who need them. Partnerships between employers, unions and manufacturers are an integral part of what is needed to see progress in tackling HIV and AIDS in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.382W.2/2">We have not made a detailed assessment of the impact of the outcome of the International Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers' Unions talks with pharmaceutical companies onthe availability of affordable HIV/AIDS treatments.We would certainly encourage the pharmaceutical sector to do all it can to make essential drugsmore easily available and affordable to poorcountries.</p>
	<p pid="c.382W.2/3">This is why in 2005, the Department for International Development (DFID) published a framework for good practice in the pharmaceutical industry to help increase access to essential medicines that treat diseases of poverty including HIV/AIDS in all developing countries. DFID continues to subscribe to the framework's principles and welcomes all efforts to improve both access and affordability, including through differential pricing and negotiating agreements to lower the price of HIV/AIDS treatments. Our support to UNITAID, the new drug purchase facility, is helping to do this, most recently with the assistance of the Clinton Foundation.</p>
	<p pid="c.382W.2/4">We hope that it will be possible for both parties to reopen negotiations at some stage in the future, given the potential benefits overall. Trade Unions as well as companies play a vital role in efforts to tackle AIDS. Working with employees in large, small and medium sized companies, in the formal and informal sectors&mdash;and in the public and private sectors, Trade Unions can support the implementation of effective company work place policies. In turn this will ultimately reduce the impact of AIDS on employees and businesses.</p>

	<p pid="c.384W.8/1">DFID currently provides development assistance to three Overseas Territories, Montserrat, St. Helena (including Tristan da Cunha) and Pitcairn. Following completion of Gerald's airport in 2005,the next priority for improving transport links to Montserrat will be the improvement of the port at Little Bay. The project is currently at the design stage. It is expected to be jointly funded by DFID and the European Union (EU), and may include an extension to the existing jetty and construction of a breakwater. The cost will depend on the options selected, but could be up to &pound;10 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.384W.8/2">In March 2005, I announced the development of air access for St. Helena, through construction of an airport on Prosperous Bay Plain, and introduction of scheduled flights. The new airport will both meet our commitment to maintaining access, and contribute to economic regeneration through tourism. The project includes significant funding for tourism marketing. The project budget cannot be divulged in order not to prejudice the current procurement competition for the construction works. We also plan, with joint funding from the EU, to develop Jamestown Wharf. Currently the Wharf is the single point of entry to the island for all cargo and passengers. The proposed project addresses the need to improve cargo operations and to develop safe landing facilities for St. Helenians, business visitors and tourists. Costs will be about&pound;11.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.384W.8/3">In Tristan da Cunha, DFID, with joint EU funding, is currently rehabilitating Calshot harbour. Repairs to Tristan's harbour and breakwater were last carried out over 10 years ago and continuous wave action and storm damage now threaten to cause permanent damage to the island's only point of entry. Total project cost is about &pound;3 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.384W.8/4">Plans for the construction of a breakwater on Pitcairn, again with joint EU funding, are well advanced. Consultants have been appointed to prepare a detailed design and costing, estimated to be about&pound;6 million. A breakwater would provide more predictable and safer access to Pitcairn Island through Bounty Bay. This in turn will promote tourism on the island by increasing the opportunities for cruise ships, yachts and other ships to disembark passengers.</p>

	<p pid="c.385W.2/1">Projects funded by DFID by themselves have a very small effect on global emissions. They are part of a much wider development effort. We are therefore supporting developing countries to develop energy strategies to improve access to services while taking climate change into account. DFID's work with the World Bank and other development agencies allows us to influence these processes to the sustainable benefit of the poorest people in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.385W.2/2">DFID is providing assistance to the World Bank and other regional development banks to develop a framework for accelerating public and private investment in low carbon energy in developing countries. We have committed &pound;6.9 million over three years from 2005 to support this work.</p>
	<p pid="c.385W.2/3">DFID has committed &pound;140 million to the Global Environment Facility fourth replenishment (2006-10), making the UK the fourth largest donor. A third of the Global Environment facility's funding is used to address climate change. In China for example, GEF is providing more than &pound;18 million to help reduce China's heavy reliance on coal by helping to install five wind farms (190 mega watts) and 200,000 solar-powered systems.</p>

All of these themes address the environmental impacts of development, and involve collaboration and technical exchanges between different departments in the UK and China, as well as a range of small projects involving government, NGOs and the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.388W.0/3">Finally, DFID is a key participant in the UK-China working group on climate change, and plays a particularly strong role in promoting the need to adapt to the anticipated impacts of climate change, through both projects and dialogue.</p>

	<p pid="c.389W.8/1">DFID does not maintain an agreed list of 'states affected by conflict'. We do have a list of 'fragile states' which we are currently reviewing, as countries frequently move in and out of fragility and conflict, and political circumstances in a country can rapidly change. This list will include countries that are generally recognised to be conflict-affected. Detail on DFID's current definition and list of fragile states can be found in DFID's policy paper, &quot;Why We Need to Work More Effectively in Fragile States&quot;, page 7 and Annex 1, which is available in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.389W.8/2" class="italic"> (a) Education</p>
	<p pid="c.389W.8/3">The UK announcement in April to provide&pound;8.5 billion over the next 10 years in support of education will contribute to international efforts to achieve universal primary education by 2015. The Education for All Fast Track Initiative's (FTI) Education Programme and Development Fund will help assist conflict affected states prepare education sector plans for donor support. The FTI is currently piloting support in DRC, Haiti, Liberia, Somalia and Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="c.389W.8/4">DFID also supports the direct provision of education in a number of countries affected by conflict through United Nations agencies and international non-governmental organisations (INGOS). For example in Somalia DFID has a 3-year partnership with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) to increase children's access to education, with a strong focus on getting girls into school. In Burma our partnership with Save the Children UK supports early childhood education which provides safe schooling for young children in some of the poorest conflict-affected communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.389W.8/5" class="italic"> (b) Health</p>
	<p pid="c.389W.8/6">DFID is already providing much more aid to the health sectors in fragile states, with expenditure more than doubling between 2003-04 and 2005-06. Examples include a joint programme for HIV/AIDS in Burma. This has attracted increased funding and made possible a larger-scale national response. In Afghanistan, a multi-donor trust fund, the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) is helping to build government systems while at the same time raising additional finance for basic services such as health, education and water and sanitation that are focused on the poor.</p>
	<p pid="c.389W.8/7">DFID also contributes to Global Health Funds and Partnerships. An example, the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, has committed US $ 1.5 billion in 142 grants in fragile states, accounting for over one-third of total commitments.</p>

	<p pid="c.390W.8/1">The Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) signed up to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in March 2005. Since then important progress has been made in implementing EITI in the DRC. A multi-stakeholder national EITI Committee was established by Presidential Decree in November 2005 charged with ensuring the DRC implementation process complies with EITI criteria. In February 2006, the DRC Government named members of the EITI Committee and allocated a budget for its operations from the Government's finances. In addition, an EITI baseline study for the exploitation of copper, cobalt and diamonds is currently underway.</p>
	<p pid="c.390W.8/2">However, a lot more work will be needed before EITI is fully implemented in the DRC. Continued political commitment from the newly-elected DRC Government as well as capacity building and improved co-ordination within relevant DRC Government institutions will be crucial. Strong engagement from civil society, private sector and wider international community stakeholders will also be required.</p>
	<p pid="c.390W.8/3">Support for EITI implementation forms an important plank of DFID's planned support in the minerals sector in DRC. Over coming months, DFID will be working with all EITI stakeholders to develop a package of support aimed at ensuring EITI is successfully implemented in the DRC.</p>

	<p pid="c.393W.0/1">Aid is classified as poverty reduction budget support (PRBS) if it is merged with other domestic resources and accounted for alongside the rest of the partner Government's expenditure through their reporting and accounting systems and reports of the Auditor General. Sector budget support is aid that is earmarked for expenditure either in a particular sector, sub sector, programme, or set of expenditure lines. The general principle is that this is aid which is spent using national or sub-national financial management, procurement and accountability systems. Before deciding to provide sector budget support a fiduciary risk assessment is undertaken to assess the partner Government Public Financial Management Administration systems for the effective use of and accounting for the funds.</p>
	<p pid="c.393W.0/2">For financial aid to be classified as a sector wide approach (SWAp), the following criteria would need to be met:</p>

	<p pid="c.394W.8/1">Improved access to reliable and affordable energy supplies and services is essential for the achievement of international development goals. The poorest countries and regions of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, have the least access to electricity and to sustainable clean fuels for cooking and heating.</p>
	<p pid="c.394W.8/2">DFID has been actively engaged with the EU Energy Initiative for Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Development (EUEI) since it was launched in 2002. This has the primary aim of improving access to affordable and sustainable energy services to the poor. Alongside five other European Union member states, DFID is providing grant funds to an EUEI technical assistance programme, which is helping developing countries and regional organisations in Africa to prepare energy policies. In addition, DFID supported the launch in 2006 of a &euro;220 million EU Energy Facility, funded from the 9<sup>(th)</sup> European Development Fund, to improve access to energy in rural areas, mainly in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="c.394W.8/3">DFID contributes to the Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP), which is managed by the World Bank on behalf of the donors. The goal of the programme is to provide energy solutions to reduce poverty, through improved access to sustainable energy services. New policies and plans for the greater use of renewable energy and improved energy efficiency in developing countries are significant aspects of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.394W.8/4">DFID is also working closely with the World Bank and the regional development banks on a new Investment Framework for Clean Energy and Development. The World Bank and other International Finance Institutions have approved or are developing their Investment Frameworks and these will be implemented in 2007. These new frameworks include measures to help countries move towards lower carbon energy sources, to reduce the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, to adapt to the effects of climate change and to access new carbon credit financing. The World Bank has accepted an offer from DFID of a technical assistance grant to help them implement actions on climate change and clean energy and we are in discussion with the other IFIs on similar support.</p>
	<p pid="c.394W.8/5">DFID is launching in 2007 a new five-year Energy Research Programme to improve access to energy supplies and services in support of development. This is expected to include the application of renewable energy and other sustainable technologies. This new research programme will build on earlier DFID funded work on renewable energy technologies.</p>

	<p pid="c.398W.8/1">The most recent reliable unemployment data available for Iraq comes from the Iraq Living Conditions Survey carried out in 2004 by the Iraqi Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation/United Nations Development Programme. There is no other more recent comparable survey. The 2004 survey found that the core unemployment rate in Iraq was just over 10 per cent. (using the International Labour Organisation definition i.e. looking for but unable to find employment). In 2004, Iraq had a working age population of 16.4 million, but only 6.7 million (41 per cent.) were working or actively seeking work. 6 million of these were employed, leaving 700,000 (around 10 per cent.) unemployed. Unemployment was highest in Baghdad at 13.5 per cent., then the South at 10.8 per cent.; then 9.1 per cent. in the North and the lowest in the centre at 8.2 per cent. The survey also notes that workforce participation is higher in rural areas than urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.398W.8/2">Available data shows that Iraq has always had a very low workforce participation rate, in line with other countries in the region. This can be attributed to low participation rates among women (common to other countries in the region) and young men. Young men constitute 15 per cent. of the economically inactive (i.e. above 15-years-old but not seeking employment). The majority of young economically inactive men (68 per cent.) claim they are studying and thus not available to work. 20 per cent. claim that there are no jobs available and have therefore given up looking for work.</p>
	<p pid="c.398W.8/3">Ongoing violence in Iraq makes job creation difficult, and in particular discourages private investment which could boost employment. DFID is working with the Iraqi Government to ensure that when the security situation improves, the economy is stable and in a position to grow and to generate new jobs.</p>

	<p pid="c.399W.8/1">Following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (<phrase class="date" code="2006-11-21">21 November 2006</phrase>) by the Seven Party Alliance and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists) and subsequent Agreement on the Monitoring of Arms and Armies (<phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November 2006</phrase>), the combatants of the Maoist People's Liberation Army (PLA) are moving to 28 military camps (or cantonments) around Nepal. The Agreements state that here they would be registered by the UN and have their weapons locked up and monitored by the UN. After the holding of Constituent Assembly elections, scheduled for June 2007, these combatants would either be integrated into the Nepal Army or helped reintegrate back into civilian life.</p>
	<p pid="c.399W.8/2">The Maoists have already moved several thousand of their combatants to the sites of these proposed camps. Given that infrastructure has not yet been set up, the conditions at these sites are extremely basic. As an interim measure, the GON has provided funds directly to the Maoists to enable them to purchase food and basic plastic sheeting shelter for their combatants. Due to Maoist sensitivities and the desire of GON to lead this process, donor projects cannot go to sites and make unilateral assessments.</p>
	<p pid="c.399W.8/3">However, given the importance of the success of the cantonments of PLA to the peace process, several donors, including DFID have offered the services of their rural infrastructure programmes located in the districts where camps are to be constructed to assist with setting up the camps. Assessments of need are being undertaken now, and the first proposals for providing immediate support are being developed.</p>

	<p pid="c.405W.2/28">In 2007 DFID plans to carry out SCAs in Southern Africa, Zambia and Pakistan. DFID will also be assessing the causes of conflict and insecurity as part of our new country governance assessment, outlined in our 2006 White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="c.405W.2/29">In November 2005 DFID carried out a review of our use of the SCA methodology over the past five years which concluded that</p>
	<p pid="c.405W.2/30" class="indent">&quot;all the SCAs reviewed had produced at least some positive impact on the relevant country programmes and some had led to significant shifts in thinking&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.405W.2/31">Specifically the review found:</p>
	<p pid="c.405W.2/32" class="indent">SCAs directly inform DFID policies and programmes. In Nepal, the SCA led to DFID's policies and programmes fundamentally changing. New staff were recruited, new offices opened and new programmes developed to focus on the issues of social exclusion, an underlying cause of the Maoist insurgency. In Yemen the SCA helped identify and prioritise the need to strengthen access to justice, and led to the development of a new security and judicial reform programme. In the Balkans, the SCA process helped refocus the UK assistance programme, for example increasing support to final status talks in Kosovo.</p>
	<p pid="c.405W.2/33" class="indent">The SCA process 'joins up' thinking across UK Government Departments. The majority of SCAs have been conducted in partnership with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Ministry of Defence (MOD). This has helped develop a shared understanding of the factors underpinning violent conflict. For example, in Sri Lanka the SCA process brought together the UK's diplomatic, defence and development work and led to a unified policy framework focused on conflict prevention and peacebuilding.</p>
	<p pid="c.405W.2/34" class="indent">The SCA process strengthens coordination between different donor agencies. For example, the SCA for the North Caucasus was widely disseminated and used by other international actors to inform the strategy of moving incrementally from humanitarian assistance to reconstruction and development aid.</p>

This is our call to others&mdash;both international donors and governments in developing countries&mdash;to encourage them to do more.

	<p pid="c.409W.2/1">Close cooperation between the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank improves the effectiveness of their support for poverty reduction and stability. We welcome the External Review Committee on Fund-Bank collaboration established by Rodrigo De Rato and Paul Wolfowitz in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.409W.2/2">This has provided the opportunity to feed in UK views on how they can strengthen cooperation. Our contributions have been based around three themes. The first is to stress that there are important roles and responsibilities for both the Fund and Bank in both middle and low income countries. The second is to highlight areas where the Fund and Bank can make a more effective contribution through joint work. We have identified debt sustainability, financial sector strength, public expenditure management, and economic policy and growth, as the most critical issues. Both institutions also have an important contribution to make in supporting country-led poverty reduction strategies. The third theme is to highlight the need for a strong co-operative culture in both institutions so that there is consistent and effective collaboration in all developing countries. This requires a strong and sustained commitment from the management of the Fund and Bank. The UK continues to engage with the Committee and our international partners to exchange views and provide feedback on the extent to which the Fund and Bank are working together effectively in country. Examples of good and bad practice help to identify how they can achieve more effective collaboration.</p>

	<p pid="c.410W.2/1">The World Bank is recognised as a leader in the field of measuring and managing for results. It was charged under the Marrakech Action Plan with developing a global good practice guide, and has developed an approach which aims to (i) strengthen countries' capacity to manage for results; (ii) enhance the Bank's own effectiveness in results management and (iii) coordinate various efforts at establishing a more results-based approach. The International Development Association (IDA), the Bank's concessional lending arm, was the first international financial institution to introduce a results measurement system (RMS). It tracks both country outcomes and the Bank's contribution to those outcomes. At the country level 14 indicators have been identified for monitoring, covering economic growth and poverty reduction, public financial management, investment climate, infrastructure, and human development. Within the Bank, a steering group has been established to promote broader awareness of the agenda and to identify specific systemic improvements that will enable the results-based system to be effective.</p>
	<p pid="c.410W.2/2">Maintaining and improving the Bank's focus on country-level results is a key objective of the UK's current three-year strategy for the World Bank. It is also one of the performance criteria which DFID is monitoring to assess progress against DFID's 2005-08 public service agreement target for improving the effectiveness of multilateral agencies. We will continue to use every opportunity to promote this and encourage further progress by the Bank. These include discussions in Washington and in our work with the Bank in poor countries. The latest major discussion on the results-based approach was in Washington at the IDA 14 Mid-Term Review meeting in November 2006. The Bank produced a paper on experience to date, noting areas where good progress had been made, and areas were this had been more limited&mdash;particularly in respect of developing the capacity of poor countries. The UK, and many other countries, recognised the Bank's commitment to results and acknowledged progress. We also noted that there was still much to do, and that sustained efforts would be required, in a range of areas, to make the results-based approach effective.</p>

	<p pid="c.410W.5/1">The global economy has become increasingly integrated in recent years and as it continues to change, it is important that in both their function and governance the multilateral institutions are modernised to respond to those changes. Through reform the legitimacy and effectiveness of both institutions can be strengthened.</p>
	<p pid="c.410W.5/2">The UK has been committed to the strengthening of developing country say in the governance of the IMF and World Bank for a number of years. The Government have reiterated that commitment in the White Paper on International Development published in July 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.410W.5/3">Within the IMF, the UK welcomes the first steps towards reform and the timetable for further reform set out in the resolution agreed by Governors of the IMF in September 2006, to be completed, at the latest, by the autumn of 2008. The UK has given strong support and equal weight to both objectives of IMF reform: realigning member country shares to reflect global economic changes and strengthening the voice and participation of low income countries. The UK has been clear that reform must increase the voting share of low income countries as well as that of underweighted emerging market economies and we continue to emphasise this. In particular, the UK believes a stronger voice for low income countries requires a substantial increase in the share of basic votes which are assigned equally to all IMF members. These necessary governance reforms should be complemented by continued modernisation of the IMF's instruments to ensure its continued effectiveness with the entire membership. To this end, the UK also supports proposals to reinforce the IMF's crisis prevention role through a new framework for surveillance, with an emphasis on multilateral surveillance, and by expanding the IMF's range of instruments for crisis prevention.</p>
	<p pid="c.410W.5/4">The 2006 White Paper on International Development acknowledges the critical role which the World Bank plays in providing development assistance to developing countries. It also makes clear that the World Bank must reform if it is to remain relevant in a changing world. Four priorities are identified for the Bank:</p>
	<p pid="c.410W.5/5" class="indent">play a leading role in providing more long-term, predictable funding for developing countries;</p>
	<p pid="c.410W.5/6" class="indent">find new ways to work with middle income countries as they still face major development changes and are shaping the wider world;</p>
	<p pid="c.410W.5/7" class="indent">help tackle the global challenges facing developing countries&mdash;focusing urgently on a financing framework for clean energy and adaptation to climate change, and forging a new international framework to help developing countries tackle corruption and improve their governance;</p>
	<p pid="c.410W.5/8" class="indent">help developing countries obtain more influence in the World Bank, where they are weakly represented on the boards, with voting rights decided by financial contributions. This balance must change. The Bank must do more to support developing country priorities and not impose policy conditions in areas like privatisation and trade liberalisation. And if their members demand it, the Bank should be ready to change how members are represented, and how decisions are made&mdash;for example through greater voting rights for poor countries. There also needs to be greater transparency in the way that the World Bank and IMF operate. More World Bank analysis should be disclosed. I am pleased that in the recent discussions on conditionally, the Bank agreed to improve its practice in this area. And the practice of picking the heads of both institutions based on nationality should end&mdash;presidents should be chosen on merit.</p>
	<p pid="c.410W.5/9">We are actively pursuing these reforms in collaboration with like-minded partners.</p>

	<p pid="c.412W.2/1">I have not had such discussions, but I applaud the work of those who are campaigning for increased women's access to sanitary products in Zimbabwe and wish them every success in their fund-raising. The high cost and limited availability of these products is symptomatic of the dramatic economic decline in Zimbabwe in recent years. Along with others in the international community, we have made clear our deep concern about the policies of the Government of Zimbabwe which shows no interest in discussions about the fundamental policy reforms which are needed. Meanwhile, DFID's top priorities are to tackle HIV and AIDS, currently causing over 3,200 deaths per week; and assisting over a million people living in dire poverty, many of whom will face serious food shortages in the coming months. All of DFID's assistance is delivered through NGOs and UN agencies&mdash;none of our funding is channelled through the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid="c.427W.2/1">The 2006 pre-Budget report announced an additional &pound;130 million in direct payments for schools in England in 2007-08, including to support personalisation and extended services.</p>
	<p pid="c.427W.2/2">These additions, channelled through the schools standards grant, mean that direct payments to schools will rise to an average of &pound;200 per pupil for primary schools and &pound;225 per pupil for secondary schools in 2007-08. This compares to 2006-07 levels of direct payments at &pound;159 and &pound;171 respectively; and previously planned 2007-08 levels of direct payments at &pound;178 and &pound;213 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.427W.2/3">The pre-Budget report also announced &pound;10 million in 2007-08 to improve guidance to schools on supporting boys' reading and writing, and provide additional small group support and tuition targeted towards 400 secondary schools where the gender gap is largest.</p>

	<p pid="c.431W.2/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your parliamentary questions about unemployment. (109240,109243).</p>
	<p pid="c.431W.2/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles statistics of unemployment for parliamentary constituencies from the annual local area Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>
	<p pid="c.431W.2/6" class="indent">Table 1, attached, shows the number of unemployed people, aged 16 to 24 and aged 25 and over, resident in the Wellingborough constituency for the 12 months ending in February 1997 from the annual local area LFS and for the 12 months ending in June 2006 from the APS. Table 2 shows corresponding unemployment rates which are defined as the number of unemployed expressed as a percentage of the economically active population in the relevant age group.</p>
	<p pid="c.431W.2/7" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in a small geographical area, they are based on very small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty. In this case, the sample sizes are not sufficient to give an accurate estimate of even the direction of the change over the period.</p>
	<p pid="c.431W.2/8" class="indent">ONS also compiles statistics for local areas of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). Table 3, attached, shows the annual average number of people aged 18 to 24 and aged 25 and over, resident in the Wellingborough constituency, claiming JSA for the 12 months ending in November 1997 and November 2006. Sub-regional claimant count data is not seasonally adjusted and thus comparisons between different months may cause distortions. Annual averages are shown to remove seasonally and years ending November are shown to include the latest month's data in the comparison.</p>

	<p pid="c.433W.12/2">None. Those involved in the design of official publications are encouraged to minimise the cost, the size and the environmental impact of their publications. Her Majesty's Stationery Office will often remind Departments of the need for economy in the production of their publications. The overall aim for any publication though must be that it is both readable and accessible to all who will have a need or interest in its content.</p>
	<p pid="c.433W.12/3">The size of margins is one aspect in the design of any publication which will also be affected by the page size, the length of the publication, typeface, typesize and line and paragraph spacing.</p>
	<p pid="c.433W.12/4">Margins may also be affected by the nature of the printing process to be adopted and the size of the publication which will determine whether a larger inside margin is required to allow for binding.</p>
	<p pid="c.433W.12/5">Margins are very important for readers, providing space to hold each page without hiding any of the text and providing a resting spot for a reader's eyes. Long lines of type can also be difficult and tiresome to read. It is very easy for readers to get lost making the transition from the end of one line of text to the beginning of the next. Where lines are lengthenedit is generally necessary to increase the spacebetween lines and the overall result is no saving in paper.</p>

These figures do not constitute part of national statistics as they are based on management information.

	<p pid="c.451W.11/1">Many terrorist groups on the list of proscribed organisations are based abroad but have used the UK for funding purposes. Proscribing such organisations and seizing their funds can severely limit their operations, as all aspects of terrorist activity cost money and such organisations are often dependent upon funds raised in foreign countries, including the UK. Operations involving the seizures of cash have a dual effect of both preventing terrorist attacks and disrupting the flow of terrorist funds.</p>
	<p pid="c.451W.11/2">The National Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit is the UK's law enforcement agency responsible for the investigation of terrorist finance and therefore plays the leading role in identifying funds associated with terrorism. Such funds are liable to seizure and forfeiture as set out in various legislation, including the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.</p>

	<p pid="c.455W.6/2">At the start of the Home Detention Curfew Scheme in January 1999, there were three electronic monitoring contractors operating across England and Wales. New contracts were negotiated in 2005 resulting in two contractors taking over the operation. The contractors are responsible for all electronic monitoring schemes, including that of Home Detention Curfew. Release and Recall Section within the National Offender Management Service is responsible for the recall of offenders who have been released on HDC whereas the responsibility for breaching curfew orders falls to the courts.</p>
	<p pid="c.455W.6/3">The contractors are required to notify Release and Recall Section of breaches of the curfew condition by offenders on Home Detention Curfew. Figures for breaches are broken down annually. While reconfiguring this information into quarters would incur disproportionate cost, the following table provides the total number of offenders recalled to custody by Release and Recall Section for breaching the conditions of Home Detention Curfew since the scheme was first introduced in January 1999.</p>
	<p pid="c.455W.6/4">Release and Recall Section notify the police in every case where an offender is recalled to custody, and have a target to do this within 24 hours of being notified by the contractor of the breach of curfew.

The Victims Fund has been used to resource a wide range of provisions including: &pound;3.25 million directly into voluntary and community sector organisations; the development of sexual assault referral centres (SARCs); a Care and Evidence training package; and a free publication entitled &quot;From Report to Court: A Legal Handbook for Adult Survivors of sexual violence&quot;. We will make announcements in due course about the scope and arrangements for the 2007-08 Victims Fund grant scheme.</p>
