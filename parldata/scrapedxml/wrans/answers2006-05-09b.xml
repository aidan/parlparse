	<p pid="b.116W.5/1">The Government were closely involved in developing many of the initiatives agreed upon at the Eighth Conference of Parties (COP 8) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), including in its EU presidency role in the latter half of 2006. We will continue to support the EU in forthcoming international negotiations, including on the conservation of marine biodiversity and genetic resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and on the development of an international regime on Access and Benefit Sharing of Genetic Resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.5/2">Many of the decisions from the conference include a call for regional responses and we expect these to be discussed at the next meeting of the Working Party on International Environmental Issues (Biodiversity) in June.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.5/3">Once the definitive versions of the decisions taken at COP 8 are available on the website of the Convention on Biological Diversity, my officials will review with other Departments, the devolved administrations and the Nature Conservation Agencies how to ensure that the decisions taken, including the new programme of work on Island Biodiversity, and the decisions on climate change and biodiversity, invasive alien species, business and biodiversity, forest biological diversity and agricultural biodiversity are reflected in our policies, programmes and research for the United Kingdom. This exercise will be completed over the next six months.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.5/4">One of the key delivery mechanisms for these policies are the National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs), required under article 6 of the Convention. The COP decision to review the implementation of NBSAPs is opportune in the light of plans already in place within the UK to refresh the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, which is both a delivery mechanism for the CBD and a link from CBD to the devolved country biodiversity strategies.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.5/5">The decision on business and biodiversity arose from a joint UK Brazil initiative in partnership with the Secretariat of the CBD, Insight Investments and ILJCN&mdash;the World Conservation Union. We will be discussing with these and new partners how to take forward the elements of the decision requiring international development.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.5/6">I will be discussing the integration of biodiversity into official development assistance with the DFID parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the next meeting of the Inter-Departmental Ministerial Group on Biodiversity.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.5/7">We will continue to work closely with colleagues in Europe and the Secretariat to the CBD to support work on indicators and the development of improved outcome focussed reporting.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.5/8">Elements of some decisions will be implemented through existing EU measures, for example the recently concluded Regulation on Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade which strengthens efforts to promote sustainable forest management. In addition, existing EU legislation, in particular directive 2001/18/EC, already ensures a precautionary approach to the use of genetically modified organisms (including genetically modified trees and genetic use restriction technologies).We will continue to provide additional financial resources to support countries rich in biodiversity in the implementation of the CBD through the UK's substantial contribution to the global environment facility (currently &pound;118 million for 2002&ndash;2006, of which approximately 30 per cent. goes to biodiversity projects) and through the Darwin Initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.5/9">We will also support capacity building efforts over the inter-sessional period leading up to COP 9 in 2008 through DEFRA's World Summit on Sustainable Development Implementation Fund and through DEFRA's support for the Convention's Trust Funds. We will be focussing such efforts particularly on Africa and on support for implementation, particularly through national biodiversity strategies and action plans.</p>

	<p pid="b.119W.2/2">A proposal to extend the current provision for exceptional measures in the eggs and poultry market was adopted at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-25">25 April</phrase>. This allows exceptional market support measures to be taken where there is serious market disturbance because of concerns about avian influenza. Member states would need to specifically request any individual measures, and these would need to be 50 per cent. co-financed. The Commission has made clear that measures adopted by member states before <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-25">25 April</phrase> may be considered for co-financing on a case-by-case basis, and that serious market disturbance is defined at EU&mdash;not member state&mdash;level.</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.2/3">The UK view is that these kind of measures must be directly linked to exceptional circumstances and must not be used to distort the normal competitive nature of the EU market. It is long-standing UK policy that public funds should not be used to underpin changes as a result of normal market evolution.</p>

	<p pid="b.119W.5/2">Village shops are important to rural communities in providing goods and services, as well as crucial social contact. An increasing number of village shops are operating as social enterprises and able to sustain the business through volunteer action and earned income.</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.5/3">For social enterprises generally, local Business Links are a good source of advice and support. The Business Link website includes a selection of useful sources of information and business support. More specifically, DEFRA' s rural enterprise scheme, which is part of the England rural development programme (ERDP), can provide support to social enterprise projects such as community run shops, where they have strong community backing and a business plan which establishes the need for a grant. The current ERDP ends on <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2006</phrase> and the rural enterprise scheme will close to new applications on <phrase class="date" code="">30 June 2006</phrase>. DEFRA is currently consulting on priorities for the new rural development programme for England.</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.5/4">The Government have also assisted local services by extending mandatory rate relief at 50 per cent. to include sole village public houses, petrol stations and village food shops under the village shop scheme. Qualifying premises are entitled to a 50 per cent. reduction in their business rates bills, and local authorities have the discretion to top-up all other non-domestic premises up to 100 per cent. provided the rateable value is &pound;14,000 or less.</p>

	<p pid="b.127W.10/1">DFID is committed to tackling corruption. It is a problem in most countries, and is a result of failures in governance and accountability. The best check against corruption is to strengthen governance, supported by regular monitoring. We need to focus on building policies and institutions that prevent and deter corruption before it undermines development. DFID programmes include support for a range of governance reforms which are aimed primarily at improving accountability, transparency and the improved financial management of public resources. DFID is also promoting work internationally to develop better indicators that will help track progress over time.</p>
	<p pid="b.127W.10/2">A key part of DFID's work with developing country governments is to support the improvement of strategic planning and public financial management. For example, DFID supports public-financial management reform in Zambia, Rwanda, Malawi, Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Lesotho and the Gambia. Procurement reform is particularly important and DFID works closely with other bilateral donors and multilateral institutions (especially the World Bank) to improve countries' procurement capacity. Many DFID programmes are also supporting reform of public-service pay, conditions and performance management, in order to reduce the incentives for public officials to act corruptly.</p>
	<p pid="b.127W.10/3">DFID also provides support to a wide range of institutions in developing countries, working to tackle corruption and improve the effectiveness of aid and domestic resources to maximise service delivery and benefits to poor people DFID has provided technical and financial support to dedicated anti-corruption commissions, for example in Sierra Leone, Malawi, Uganda and Zambia. In addition work is under way to help improve citizens' capacity to hold governments to account for the way funds are used, by strengthening institutions such as parliaments, parliamentary committees and supreme audit institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.127W.10/4">Corruption is not just a developing country problem. Developed countries carry an equal responsibility. The UK Government are strongly committed to combating overseas corruption and have taken a number of steps including action to reform the UK domestic legal framework and providing support to developing countries to strengthen their own systems. DFID, working with other government departments, has launched the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative to improve the transparency of oil and mineral revenues. The UK also played an important role in negotiations to develop the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), the first global agreement on the action that needs to be taken to combat corruption. The UK formally ratified the convention on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February</phrase> this year and became only the second G8 country to have done so.</p>

	<p pid="b.129W.2/1">UK support to malaria control is provided through global partnerships, multilateral agencies, and bilateral country programmes. Most of these channels support both treatment of malaria and reduction of incidence including through more widespread use of insecticide treated mosquito nets (ITNs). DFID also supports public-private partnerships for the research and development of new tools and technologies (PDPs).</p>
	<p pid="b.129W.2/2">The UK is a key donor to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria (GFATM), and has pledged &pound;359 million to the fund through to 2008. Approximately 27 per cent. of GFATM funds go to malaria treatment and prevention&mdash;including both treatment (through provision of anti-malarial drugs) and prevention. DFID has provided &pound;48.5 million from 1998&ndash;2005 to the global Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Partnership, who work at global level, including by running the malaria medicines and supplies service which works to support countries to access supplies of effective malaria drugs and ITNs. DFID also provides core funding to the World Health Organisation (&pound;12.5 million in 2004&ndash;05), and funds the World Bank and European Commission who also provide support to malaria treatment and prevention.</p>
	<p pid="b.129W.2/3">At country level DFID supports malaria control through bilateral programmes. Our priorities for malaria control focuses on giving support to countries to develop strong and sustainable health systems that are able to scale up the coverage of treatment including artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) and ITNs. In Kenya&mdash;DFID has committed &pound;47.4 million to social marketing of ITNs. The aim is to increase the use of nets among pregnant women and children under five. DFID has also committed &pound;8.5 million to develop a sustainable market for ITNs in Mozambique, through community-based and public health centres and retail shops.</p>
	<p pid="b.129W.2/4">DFID has pledged &pound;10 million over five years (2005&ndash;10) to the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), which aims to discover, develop and deliver new affordable anti-malarial drugs. This is a joint commitment with the Wellcome Trust, who will match our support. DFID will also give &pound;6.5 million over the next three years to the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), which includes funding for work on developing a more effective artimisinin combination drug for treatment of malaria.</p>

	<p pid="b.130W.5/1">Supporting the basic needs of the Palestinian people is a high priority for DFID's programme of assistance. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the private sector play a vital role in meeting the needs of some Palestinians. However, NGOs and the private sector do not have the capacity to substitute for the Palestinian Authority (PA) which, together with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), provides the vast majority of basic services to people in the West Bank and Gaza. We hope that the new Palestinian government will comply with the Quartet principles. If this happened, DFID funding would continue through the PA.</p>
	<p pid="b.130W.5/2">DFID and Her Majesty's Treasury are continuing work that began before the Palestinian elections to take forward the Chancellor of the Exchequer's initiative on the contribution of private sector development and growth to sustained peace in the region. The business environment is clearly very difficult, but we are assessing what opportunities there might be.</p>

	<p pid="b.132W.0/1">We are concerned about the continuing reports of wide-scale sexual violence in the DRC, primarily against women, though also against significant numbers of children and men too. Rape seems to have become a weapon of war among armed groups. The prevailing culture of impunity, which creates the conditions for ongoing human rights violations, persists in the great lakes region.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.0/2">The UK is working with the international community at different levels to deal with causes and symptoms of this, and has raised the issue with the Congolese authorities at all levels on many occasions, reminding them of the need to protect the rights of all vulnerable groups and for judicial action to be taken to bring the perpetrators of such abuses to justice. Specifically, as a member of the International Committee to Support the Transition (CIAT), the UK has joined the international community in highlighting abuses perpetrated by the Congolese army against the civilian population.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.0/3">To end the cycle of human rights violations in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), there needs to be an end to conflict in the country and the whole great lakes region. Conflict reduction is a major focus of the UK's engagement in DRC, and at a local level in the East we support NGOs who are promoting dialogue and peace building work between communities previously in conflict, with a total commitment of &pound;3.3 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.0/4">In addition, all the projects within this peace building programme try to tackle many of the underlying causes of sexual violence and to enhance women's status in society by working with women's organisations. One example of this type of work is International Alert's support for the South Kivu Women's Forum, which brings together women's organisations from community groups to women politicians to work for women's empowerment and peace.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.0/5">Other areas of our work aim to address other aspects of women's empowerment. For example we are providing support of &pound;800,000 to the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) to ensure women's full participation in the electoral process, both as candidates and voters.</p>

	<p pid="b.132W.3/1">The high incidence of sexual violence in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is of great concern to the Government, particularly as recent evidence that suggest that levels are increasing.

	<p pid="b.132W.3/2">The Action Plan identifies 'protection' as a key sector for support, which includes ensuring that special measures are implemented to protect women and girls from violence in emergency situations and providing adequate assistance for survivors of gender-based violence.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.3/3">Many of the individual humanitarian projects that we fund include providing support, especially medical assistance to victims of sexual violence, particularly in Eastern DRC. We are providing &pound;440,000 to the Norwegian non-governmental organisation (NGO,) Christian Relief Network to set up and run a hospital wing in South Kivu treating women suffering from fistula&mdash;which is one of the most serious and devastating consequences of sexual violence.

	<p pid="b.133W.5/1">DFID is supporting the objectives set out in the Government of Sierra Leone's Core Mineral Policy. It has two main aims: to maximise the economic and social benefits of the diamond sector to both the Government and the people of Sierra Leone; and to ensure that the benefits accrued from the sector are divided more equitably among those involved. I refer the hon. Member for Cotswold to the answer I previously gave on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-03-07.1395"><i>Official Report,</i> columns 1395&ndash;6</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.5/2">DFID is committed to ensuring that the Government of Sierra Leone maximise the revenues it can accrue from its mineral resources, including the diamond sector. As part of this commitment, DFID is recruiting a Director General (DG) for the Ministry of Mineral Resources (MMR), whose principle task will be to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Ministry. The DG's responsibilities will include overseeing a work plan that the MMR will develop in close consultation with the Office of the President. The DG will also liaise closely with other ministries, such as the National Revenue Authority and the Ministry of Finance to ensure that the policies developed maximise the revenue potential available to the Government from its extractive sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.5/3">DFID officials are currently assessing options for providing support to fisheries policy development and more effective fisheries management by the Sierra Leone Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources. The European Commission (EC) is currently supporting a fisheries stock assessment in Sierra Leone and DFID's assistance would aim to build on this. At the same time, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has shown an interest in engaging with Sierra Leone on issues relating to illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing. Our combined objective is to ensure the wealth of this highly prized fishery accrues to Sierra Leone for use by Sierra Leoneans. It is commonly recognised that currently Sierra Leone and neighbouring countries Liberia and Guinea, are together losing $140 million in fish that is stolen by illegal foreign fleets operating beyond the reach of national policing. A recent DFID assessment mission noted that this would have important benefits for the many small-scale fishers and processors and help them access new markets for their produce.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.5/4">The mission was undertaken as part of the development of a new Joint EC/DFID Country Strategy Paper for Sierra Leone, which will be published in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="b.134W.2/1">There is currently no accurate or reliable data on the percentage of the population that have access to free education and basic health care services. The Ministry of Health estimates for 2005, indicate that approximately 60 per cent. of the population has access to health services of some kind. I refer the hon. Member to the information on 'gross school enrolment rates' in my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-13">13 March 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-03-13.1941W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 1941W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.134W.2/2">On the percentage of the population who have access to safe water, estimates from the Sierra Leone National Energy and Water Policy Planning Unit vary from 21 per cent. to 46 per cent. (Updated water data from a household survey will be available soon and DFID is supporting ActionAid to undertake a water user survey in the Freetown area.)</p>
	<p pid="b.134W.2/3">At the end of the conflict in 2002, DFID agreed a country assistance programme with the Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) which focused on promoting peace and security, and good governance. This, with poverty reduction budget support, has formed the core of DFID support to date. As part of the development a new Joint Country Strategy, DFID, the GoSL and the European Commission (EC) are reviewing existing country programmes. This will include an assessment of needs in the education, health and water sectors. A draft of the Joint Country Strategy will be available for wider consultation in July.</p>
	<p pid="b.134W.2/4">In the meantime, DFID is funding a number of separate initiatives across all three sectors. These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.134W.2/5" class="indent">providing support to implement a Malaria Outreach programme;</p>
	<p pid="b.134W.2/6" class="indent">undertaking preparatory work with the National Energy and Water Policy Planning Unit to support the National Water and Sanitation Policy. DFID is also financing a programme aimed at improving the effectiveness of state-owned enterprises, including in the water sector;</p>
	<p pid="b.134W.2/7" class="indent">through DFID contributions to the EU Water Facility a number of NGO programmes for rural water supply and sanitation are underway in Sierra Leone&mdash;with a total value of some &euro;5.4 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.137W.2/3" class="indent">All new rail vehicles must be accessible to disabled people, including wheelchair users. Over 4,400 accessible vehicles have already entered service.</p>

	<p pid="b.137W.2/5" class="indent">As service providers, TOCs are obliged to remove any barriers that make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to access their services. This duty applies to infrastructure including stations and services such as booking facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.137W.2/6">In addition, we have launched our &quot;Railways for All&quot; Strategy which sets out how we will improve the accessibility of rail travel in Great Britain. The strategy is complemented by a &pound;370 million Access for All fund to target improvements to the accessibility of stations through to 2015.</p>
	<p pid="b.137W.2/7">Powers in the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 will also have an effect in this area. In particular, they will give disabled people a &quot;right of access&quot; to transport vehicles&mdash;including rail vehicles, enable the setting of an &quot;end date&quot;, of no later than <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2020</phrase>, by which time all rail vehicles will become regulated, enable accessibility regulations to be applied to older rail vehicles when they are refurbished and other measures such as the introduction of compliance certification.

	<p pid="b.148W.3/1">The Legal Services Commission (an NDPB of the Department for Constitutional Affairs) is working with the Department for Trade and Industry and Department of Work and Pensions as part of a national agenda to tackle rising levels of debt. The Commission is currently piloting a number of innovative new advice services to help people facing financial exclusion, following a &pound;6 million grant from the Treasury's Financial Inclusion Fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.148W.3/2">During 2004&ndash;05 the Legal Services Commission spent approximately &pound;17.5 million on specialist debt advice through its contracts with both solicitors and not for profit agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.148W.3/3">The Public Guardianship Office is an Agency of the Department for Constitutional Affairs responsible for ensuring the financial well-being of people who lack the capacity to manage their own financial affairs. It does this by supporting the Court of Protection (CoP) in the appointment of Receivers, and through the registration of Enduring Powers of Attorney (EPA). The PGO also undertake checks to establish that appointed Receivers are carrying out their duties in an appropriate manner.</p>
	<p pid="b.148W.3/4">Exceptionally, when no suitable relative or friend wishes to act as a Receiver, the PGO try to find someone else to take on this role, or as a last resort, the Chief Executive of the PGO may be appointed.</p>
	<p pid="b.148W.3/5">In carry out its role the PGO provides practical guidance for people appointed by the CoP to make financial decisions for people who lack mental capacity to do so themselves. The PGO also undertakes awareness initiatives to inform the public on how to make provision in the event that someone may lose their mental capability&mdash;due to dementia, illness or accident&mdash;and may no longer be able to make their own decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.148W.3/6">The PGO currently recovers 82 per cent. of its full costs from fees, which results in approximately a net cost to DCA of &pound;5 million of which &pound;1 million is in respect to fee remission. This work is not an 'initiative' as such, as it is part of the core work of the Agency.</p>

	<p pid="b.149W.2/2" class="italic">Recruitment below the senior civil service</p>
	<p pid="b.149W.2/3">My Department does not hold this information centrally and it is, therefore, not possible to collate this without incurring disproportionate costs.

	<p pid="b.149W.2/4" class="italic">Senior civil service recruitment</p>
	<p pid="b.149W.2/5">No central information is held about the costs of campaigns as individual business areas pay their own recruitment costs.

The average cost for each of these campaigns would be approximately &pound;40,000, which includes the advertising and assessment centre costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.156W.0/1">In relation to questions 67115, 67025 and 67026, the Information Sharing Index will contain records of all children in England. Current estimates from the Government Actuary's Department, giving 2006 projections based on 2003 figures, indicate that there are approximately 9.5 million children in England aged 15 and under, and approximately 11.5 million children in the UK aged 15 and under. We estimate therefore that the England index will contain records of approximately 82 per cent. of children aged 15 and under in the UK. Decisions on whether to establish an index in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are for the devolved Administrations.</p>
	<p pid="b.156W.0/2">An index record will be created for each child at birth and maintained until the child's 18th birthday. To help ensure that the transition from youth to adult services is managed smoothly, it may also be desirable to make provision to retain information on the index on an individual basis for young adults with multiple needs, (for example care leavers and young people with disabilities), beyond their 18th birthday, with their consent.</p>
	<p pid="b.156W.0/3">In line with the Data Protection Act, information will be retained on the index for as long as it is accurate and relevant, for example, practitioner contact details will be available for the period they are involved with the child and for a year beyond the end of that involvement. This will enable contact to be made with those practitioners currently and most recently involved with a child.</p>
	<p pid="b.156W.0/4">In relation to questions 67039, 67044, 67046, 67047, 67048, 67050, 67051 and 67052, the objectives of the index remain as agreed by Parliament when the Children Act 2004 was passed. These are to support the duties on local authorities and other partners to co-operate to promote the well-being of children and to safeguard and improve their welfare. There is, therefore, no provision for a Child Population Register in the funding we have made available for the index.</p>
	<p pid="b.156W.0/5">We have accepted the recommendation in the final report of the Citizen Information Project that we should consider the scope for a Child Population Register. That consideration will be informed by an assessment of whether there are sufficient additional efficiency and effectiveness benefits. No decision has been taken to establish such a register. A Child Population Register would have wider objectives than the index and would therefore require new primary legislation. A clear case would have to be made for it.</p>
	<p pid="b.156W.0/6">My Department has not undertaken scoping or design work in relation to a Child Population Register. There are therefore no proposals for the ages at which children might be registered and their details removed, when a register might be established, who would be responsible for providing data, whether registration would be compulsory or voluntary, or what proportion of the population aged 15 and under would be included. My Department has so far spent and allocated no funds in relation to a register.</p>
	<p pid="b.156W.0/7">In relation to question 67045, officials from my Department and the Home Office are in regular contact on a range of information sharing issues with the aim of improving efficiency and the effectiveness of public services. These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.156W.0/8" class="indent">the cross-Government guidance for practitioners in children's services on information sharing in respect of children and young people, published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April 2006</phrase>;</p>
	<p pid="b.156W.0/9" class="indent">securing cross-Government agreement to the way forward for implementing the Information Sharing Index on the basis of the objectives set out in the Children Act 2004, and confirming that there are no operational dependencies between plans for the index and for the National Identity Register;</p>
	<p pid="b.156W.0/10" class="indent">how ID cards and the National Identity Register might be used to support business processes and improve customer services in the education and skills sector;</p>
	<p pid="b.156W.0/11" class="indent">the establishment of the new vetting and barring scheme for people working with children and vulnerable adults which is set out in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill currently before Parliament;</p>
	<p pid="b.156W.0/12" class="indent">how customer service in the student loans system could be improved through confirming the identity of students directly with the Identity and Passport Service; and</p>
	<p pid="b.156W.0/13" class="indent">how projects in each Department are addressing the common technical challenges of large data systems, with a view to sharing learning.</p>

	<p pid="b.167W.5/4"><i>(b)</i> I am confident that the governance of the site adheres to high standards on clinical and legal accuracy and that it is endorsed by officials from both the Department of Health and DfES.

	<p pid="b.167W.5/5">The website makes clear that an abortion can only be performed with the agreement of two doctors. We believe that it is more appropriate to explain the further eligibility criteria for an abortion under the Abortion Act 1967 (as amended), in the medical consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.172W.5/2">The North West Sports Board has been proactive in trying to engage with the private sector in support of our drive to increase participation in sport. The North West Sports Board organised &quot;private sector forums&quot; to discuss sport and physical activity in the workplace with employers and the private sector.

	<p pid="b.172W.5/6">There was no discussion on specific programmes or initiatives, but over the following eight months, in the light of this debate, the North West Regional Sports Board devised and developed the workplace health initiative, which was launched in May 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.172W.5/7">I attended a further meeting of this forum on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-14">14 November 2005</phrase> where Sport England updated the guests present on the progress that had been made in this area.

	<p pid="b.178W.3/2">All export licences are assessed on a case by case basis against the consolidated EU and National Export Licensing Criteria. The risk assessment takes place at the time of application and is carried out by dedicated export licensing teams in all four Departments (Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), Department of Trade and Industry, Ministry of Defence, Department for International Development) involved in the export licensing process. Each team is staffed appropriately for existing workloads, but levels may change.</p>
	<p pid="b.178W.3/3">In addition to the process of assessing licences against the criteria and prevailing circumstances, the FCO will review extant licences for all destinations when subsequent reporting from post, media, non-governmental organisations or other sources gives rise to human rights or diversion concerns.</p>

The decision has no implications for the Government's policy on the use of Memoranda of Understanding for the purpose in question.</p>

	<p pid="b.182W.5/1">Nepal has a deplorable human rights record. Both Maoists and security forces have carried out gross abuses, both against combatants and civilians. Our annual Human Rights Report (chapters 2 and 5) covers this in detail. The report can be found on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.182W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1119526503628">http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1119526503628</a></p>
	<p pid="b.182W.5/3">The UK has regularly spoken out against such abuses and has taken a number of measures to reduce them, including providing human rights training, bomb disposal equipment and funding for the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights in Kathmandu.</p>
	<p pid="b.182W.5/4">Since the beginning of the year we have been deeply troubled by the escalation of violent Maoist attacks, which have resulted in large numbers of deaths and injuries among the Royal Nepalese Army, the police and civilians. We have also been gravely concerned by human rights abuses carried out by the security forces and by the Government's infringements of civil liberties and democratic freedoms.</p>
	<p pid="b.182W.5/5">With our EU partners we condemned all such abuses in a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-27">27 January 2006</phrase>. In that statement we strongly condemned the escalation of Maoist violence and the Government's use of force to suppress the Nepalese people's fundamental rights. We also underlined the obligation of all parties to fully respect international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p pid="b.182W.5/6">In response to the nationwide demonstrations in April, I issued a public statement condemning the excessive violence that the Nepalese people have suffered. The full text of the statement is available on the FCO website:</p>
	<p pid="b.182W.5/7" class="indent"><a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front">http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front</a>?pagename= OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid= 1007029391629&amp;a=KArticle&amp;aid=1144253679044%20&amp;year= 2006&amp;month=2006&ndash;04&ndash;01&amp;date=2006&ndash;04&ndash;21</p>
	<p pid="b.182W.5/8">The EU also issued a statement calling on all concerned to exercise restraint and resolve the problems by restoring democracy and by initiating a dialogue for peace. The statement can be found on the EU website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.182W.5/9" class="indent">http://www.eu2006.at/en/News/CFSP_Statements/April/2504Nepal.html</p>
	<p pid="b.182W.5/10">For this reason we are greatly encouraged by the King's restoration of Parliament. This is a tribute to the Nepalese people's desire for democracy and peace. We hope that all those concerned will now work together to restore peace, democracy and human rights in Nepal and we will continue to assist them in their efforts.</p>

	<p pid="b.187W.5/1">The capture of information at small area level such as ward or below, is usually dependent on the existence of an administrative system containing individual records with a reliable geographical identifier attached such as postcode. Even in the event that such systems are maintained by Boards or Trusts, there can be issues around data quality and personal disclosure, that mitigate against the central collation and publication of data for small areas. Alternative data collection methods such as sample surveys can yield useful information at Northern Ireland or Health and Social Services Board level. However, cost constraints usually prevent achieving a 4 representative sample which would be large enough to provide reliable results at sub-Board level. For these reasons, the routine central collection and collation of the requested data items at ward or sub-ward level is not being considered.</p>

A Young Adult Offenders project is looking at the specific needs of this age group, including standards for the management of offenders in custody and the community. This will include consultation with the main interest groups. The project is due to report to Ministers in the autumn, following which a decision will be taken on the best way forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.200W.8/1">It is currently intended that the identity card will be a valid travel document for travel within the European Union. In order to meet minimum international standards for travel documents set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the identity card must include a &quot;proximity&quot; or &quot;contactless&quot; chip. Such chips are being introduced into travel documents worldwide to improve their integrity and security, with four of the five largest passport issuing countries, the US, UK, Japan and Germany introducing this chip in passports this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.8/2">The &quot;proximity&quot; or &quot;contactless&quot; chip is read by actively placing the chip on the reader (at a distance of 0 cm to 2 cm from the reader). The contents of the chip can only be 'unlocked' after special characters printed on the card/passport's Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) are scanned. An attempt to read the chip without using the information printed in the MRZ to 'unlock' it will yield no data which can be used to identify the individual. This is known as Basic Access Control protection, which is being implemented internationally in accordance with ICAO standards. It should be noted that this technology differs from that used in RFID tags. While both use radio frequencies, they operate very differently from one another&mdash;an RFID tag is just an identity tag that provides information.</p>
	<p pid="b.200W.8/3">A proximity chip is more advanced&mdash;it has processing capability with different operating systems and different security settings. This is reflected in the fact that they are defined by two separate standards set by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).</p>

The Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI), as the independent inspectorate for social care in England, is responsible for registering, inspecting and regulating all social care services, including care homes.

	<p pid="b.209W.11/2">The provision of palliative care for children and young people with a life threatening or life limiting condition requires a wide range of services provided in a variety of settings&mdash;home, school, hospital or hospice to enable them to live as normal a life as possible. It is for local primary care trusts (PCTs), working with local authority partners and stakeholders, to decide how these services will be provided; we have published guidance to support PCTs in working with local authorities and other partners, including hospices, to commission high quality services.</p>
	<p pid="b.209W.11/3">The Government's White Paper &quot;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&quot; (copies are available in the Library) reaffirms our manifesto commitment to double funding for end of life care to enable more people to have a choice where to die. For children this includes palliative care, quite often a life long need and not just end of life care. I will make an announcement about the manifesto commitment as soon as I can.</p>

	<p pid="b.210W.5/1">The Department offers a package of childcare support for working parents. The package comprises of access to 60 playscheme places offered on site in London and Leeds during the school holidays. The places are very popular and have been in place for more than five years. The places are subsidised on a daily basis. Each place is charged at &pound;18.00 per day. Parents contribute &pound;8.00 per place and the Department meets the cost of the difference. In addition, we will soon be offering childcare vouchers as part of a salary sacrifice scheme. This will be available to all staff to take advantage of the tax benefits attached to salary sacrifice. We are currently tendering for a voucher provider and expect the contract to begin on <phrase class="date" code="">1 September 2006</phrase>. The Department also shares nursery provision with the Department for Work and Pensions for providing 20 on-site nursery places for pre-school children based in Quarry House, Leeds. Finally, we offer three days per annum carers leave in addition to annual and special leave for parents with caring responsibilities. This is to enable staff to care for their children when their usual childcare provision has broken down or in order for them to make alternative caring arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.216W.0/38">3. Note that the data on registration numbers for December 1997 is calculated on a different basis from subsequent years. The registration period for both adults and children in GDS was 15 months from <phrase class="date" code="1996-09-01">1 September 1996</phrase> (registrations expire 15 months after the end of the month of registration). Previously the registration period for adults was an exact 24 months while children's registrations expired at the end of the next calendar year. Therefore, data on the 15 month registration period is available from January 1998 for children and September 1998 for adults. The introduction of PDS in October 1998 and subsequent growth has also affected the figures, changes in the registration period from two years to 15 months impacted on the number of patients registered after December 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.0/39">4. The postcode of the dental practice was used to allocate patient registrations to specific geographic areas (not the patient's home address).</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.0/40">5. Registration rates (i.e. the percentage of the population registered with a dentist) have been estimated by including registrations in the area of the dentist, that is according to the postcode of the dental surgery and not the patient's address. So the registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live. This can lead to figures being unusually high, even over 100 per cent. for child registrations, while other areas may have estimated rates which are lower than the actual (but unknown) proportion of residents who are registered with a dentist in or outside their own area.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.0/41">6. Figures have been provided by the Information Centre for health and social care. The data source is the Business Services Authority and the figures are based on the numbers of patients registered with dentists with open General Dental Service (GDS) or Personal Dental Service (PDS) contracts as at <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase> in each specified year.

	<p pid="b.217W.5/1">The health survey for England (HSE) undertaken by the Department collects data on fruit and vegetable consumption. Data is available for 2003 for adults and 2001 for children. This is shown in tables one and two. The highest consumption was found in women from the higher income groups eating 4.4 portions per day compared to the recommended portions of five portions.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.5/2">The Food Standards Agency's consumer attitude survey indicates that there has been a steady increase in awareness of the 5 a day message from 43 per cent. to 67 per cent. in 2005. Those claiming to have eaten at least five portions of fruit and vegetables the previous day had risen from 26 per cent. in 2000 to 30 per cent. in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.5/3">Fruit and vegetable consumption for adults and children, broken down by household income for 2001 and 2003 are shown in tables one and two.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.5/4">In 1997 to 2000, consumption of fruit and vegetables based on household purchases is available from the national food survey and after 2001, from the expenditure and food survey. Quantities purchased for 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04 broken down by income quintile are shown in table three. Quantities for 1997 to 2000 broken down by income bands are shown in table four.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.5/5">These tables show that overall, households have not seen a huge change in the purchasing of fruit and vegetables. However, we have seen a significant increase in purchases from those in the lowest income quintiles. This group has purchased 33 per cent. more fruit and vegetables per week in 2004- 05 compared to 2001&ndash;02.</p>

	<p pid="b.225W.3/1">&quot;National Standards, Local Action&quot; published in July 2004 recommends that primary care trusts (PCTs) will need to take into account specialist services, which can only be commissioned effectively on a pan-PCT or broader basis. PCTs, with the support of strategic health authorities (SHAs), are expected to act collaboratively to secure these services and their improvement.</p>
	<p pid="b.225W.3/2">Last November, we published &quot;Commissioning Children's and Young People's Palliative Care Services&quot; which gives commissioners important advice about the key aspects of children's palliative care both general and specialist which will improve the quality of service provision and promote quality of care for children, young people and their families in a range of settings, for example palliative care at home, in hospital or in a hospice.</p>
	<p pid="b.225W.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-22">22 March</phrase> a series of eight regional events were launched to bring PCT commissioners, hospital and community services and voluntary organisations to promote local networks to commission and deliver improved quality and choice in palliative care services for children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.225W.3/4">The Government's White Paper &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot; (copies are available in the Library) reaffirms our manifesto commitment to double funding for end of life care to enable more people to have a choice about where to die. For children this includes palliative care, quite often a life long need and not just end of life care. The White Paper includes additional commitments on:</p>
	<p pid="b.225W.3/5" class="indent">provision of emergency, home-based respite care;</p>

	<p pid="b.226W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-08">8 May 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.226W.2/2">It is the responsibility of clinicians to discuss with patients appropriate treatment options for their particular condition. However, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) was set up in 1999 to issue clinical guidance to support the national health service including: interventional procedure guidance to assess if a procedure is safe for routine use in the NHS; technology appraisals to assess if a treatment is clinically and cost effective; clinical guidelines to advise on the diagnosis and management of certain conditions; and cancer service guidance to advise on how services should be organised to ensure good outcomes for patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.2/3">In February 2006, as part of its programme of work on interventional procedures, NICE issued guidance on the use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of non melanoma skin tumours. It noted that the procedure was generally safe and did not cause major problems although, in theory, it could start off cancerous changes in the skin. It recommended that when doctors use this procedure for people with basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease or actinic keratosis, they should be sure that the patient understands what is involved and consents to the treatment and that the results of the procedure are monitored. NICE also noted that there is not much information available on how well the procedure works in people with squamous call carcinoma. There is a relatively high chance that the carcinoma will return after treatment, and there is a risk that the carcinoma will spread and become more dangerous. NICE has said that patients need to understand these risks before they agree to have PDT. They also need to understand that further treatment may be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.2/4">Also in February 2006, NICE published guidance on &quot;Improving Outcomes for people with skin tumours, including melanoma&quot;. This guidance includes recommendations on the management of patients with suspected precancerous or cancerous skin lesions. It describes PDT including the advantages and disadvantages of this type of treatment and notes that, at present, there is little information available on long-term cure rates. It does however recommend that a number of surgical and non-surgical procedures for the treatment of skin cancer, including PDT, should be available for use by clinicians in relevant teams, subject to locally agreed standards of competence.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.2/5">There are no plans to ask NICE to produce additional guidance on this treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.226W.2/6">The main agency through which the Government supports medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC is an independent body funded by the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Innovation. The Department is not directly funding research on PDT for cancer, but is providing NHS support through the national cancer research network for two trials of PDT for biliary tract cancers. Over 75 per cent. of the Department's total expenditure on health research is devolved to, and managed by, NHS organisations. Details of individual projects, including a number concerned with PDT, can be found on the department's website on the national research register at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/research">www.dh.gov.uk/research</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.229W.0/1">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published self-harm Clinical Guidelines for NHS mental health provider trusts in 2004. The NICE guidelines cover the care which patients who harm themselves can expect to receive from healthcare professionals in and outside of hospital settings and what they can expect from their treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.229W.0/2">However, NICE guidelines do not attempt to explain self-harm or describe the treatment for this in detail. This is why the Department and the National Institute for Mental Health in England are re-evaluating current treatment approaches for self-harm, by undertaking an exploratory exercise on the appropriate management of self-harm. This will focus on adult service users, predominantly female, who self-harm as a coping mechanism or survival strategy. The exercise started in January 2006 and will run until autumn. It will ascertain the level of support at both local and regional levels and the evidence base for adopting a harm-reduction approach. It will also judge the appropriateness (with NICE) of developing guidelines and training to facilitate a harm-minimisation approach amongst service providers.</p>

	<p pid="b.229W.3/1">The information requested is not collected centrally. There is no statutory requirement for statutory agencies to carry out serious case reviews for vulnerable adults. This is a matter for local decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.229W.3/2">The Department, together with the Home Office, issued &quot;No Secrets&quot; as statutory guidance under Section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970. It is designed to help authorities to investigate reports of abuse and develop measures for prevention. It requests local authorities to ensure that local communities are aware of the existence of adult protection procedures and that they know where they can report incidents of abuse.</p>
