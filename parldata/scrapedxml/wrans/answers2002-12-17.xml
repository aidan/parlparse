	<p pid=".677W.3/1">In May 2002 the Attorney General issued a consultation paper on the prosecution process in cases arising from a death in custody. During May and June he received many thoughtful responses, including the views expressed by those who attended a seminar which he held in May. The Attorney General had originally hoped to make a statement before the House rose in July, but was compelled to conclude that to do justice to this difficult exercise in the light of further developments following another case, the issues would need further work. He continues to be engaged on the project and expects to be able to publish a statement in the New Year.</p>

	<p pid=".678W.0/1">This Department fully supports the English Rugby Union's very strong bid for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The RFU has already demonstrated its ability to host major events by providing first class facilities, organization and hospitality as co-host of the 1991 and 1999 Rugby World Cups.</p>
	<p pid=".678W.0/2">To date this Department has not received any representations from the Welsh and Scottish Rugby Unions in respect of the bid.</p>
	<p pid=".678W.0/3">It is anticipated that the UK would benefit from the additional tourism that this event would bring. The Rugby Football Union has commissioned an independent assessment of the potential economic impact of the 2007 Rugby World Cup from Bone Wells Associates. The assessment estimates that the tournament would bring approximately 175,400 visitors to the UK, spending approximately #100 per day over an average of 14 days. Hosting a major sporting event of this size would also provide UK companies with a number of opportunities for commercial sponsorship and investment. The Rugby Union is working on its own assessment of the economic impact of the 2007 World Cup and should make the results available after the final bids have been submitted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-15">15 January 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".678W.0/4">The Rugby Football Union's bid document predicts that the 2007 Rugby World Cup will generate substantially enhanced income streams for investment in the development of grass roots rugby.</p>

	<p pid=".684W.8/2">The farmgate and retail prices of conventionally grown foodstuffs, where available, are shown in table 1. Prices are not collected for English wine or brandy. Small quantities of cream and yoghurt are sold at the farmgate direct to consumers at retail prices. The amount of processing taking place between farmgate and retail varies from commodity to commodity; an indication is given in the table. Farmgate prices include produce destined for highly processed food, which is normally lower quality and sells at a lower price. Changes to the level of processing over time will impact on the trends shown within the table.</p>
	<p pid=".684W.8/3">Prices of organically produced food are only available for 1998 onwards. Indications of farmgate prices in 2000 are shown in table 2, where available, as provided by the Soil Association. There are no retail prices available.</p>

	<p pid=".686W.2/1">The cuts in total allowable catches proposed for 2003 by Commissioner Fischler would correspond, in fisheries which are of critical interest to the UK industry, to a reduction of 80 per cent. in fishing effort on cod and haddock and of 75 per cent. on whiting. I do agree that we cannot ignore the scientific advice that radical action is needed to prevent the collapse of the cod stocks, but the action proposed would have a devastating effect on our fishing industry. I am determined to negotiate an alternative approach which will give sustainable fishing opportunities to our industry, while still respecting the scientific advice and leading to stock recovery.</p>

We are seeking to ensure that, where a local community wishes to consider this option, they have easily accessible and reliable information on the effects of fluoridation.

Steering groups including consumers, people sceptical about the benefits of fluoridation, doctors, toxicologists and dentists contributed to these projects.

	<p pid=".693W.5/2">We have, for a number of years, funded research directly or indirectly related to the welfare of the sow and her piglets, from farrowing to weaning. Part of this research has been directed towards determining which aspects of confinement in farrowing crates could, potentially, cause frustration in pregnant and lactating sows. A key issue emerging is that changes in farrowing systems to improve sow welfare can frequently have an adverse effect on the welfare of the piglets. As a result, we are not yet able unreservedly to recommend free-farrowing systems for widespread commercial adoption.</p>
	<p pid=".693W.5/3">Our research, and that of others, continues. Our aim is to reach a position where it is possible to avoid the close confinement of all sows.</p>

	<p pid=".704W.0/3" class="indent">We recognise that the benefits of resource extraction occur as revenue streams over many years and that, although highly price dependent, a public understanding of current and future revenue streams would help inform the choice of appropriate and realistic development options.</p>
	<p pid=".704W.0/4" class="indent">We support the principle and practice of accountability for the stewardship of revenue streams&mdash;from their receipt to their eventual end use.</p>
	<p pid=".704W.0/5" class="indent">We are committed to honest, legal and transparent behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".704W.0/6" class="indent">We support the principle and practise of financial transparency&mdash;as a necessary condition for good governance.</p>
	<p pid=".704W.0/7" class="indent">We believe that a comprehensive, consistent and workable approach to the disclosure of payments and revenues is required.</p>
	<p pid=".704W.0/8" class="indent">In seeking solutions, we believe that all stakeholders have important and relevant contributions to make&mdash;including host and home governments, multilateral organisations, regulatory agencies, financial and lending organisations, non- governmental organisations and industry.</p>
	<p pid=".704W.0/9" class="indent">We commit to develop effective mechanisms to achieve transparency of payments and revenues in the extractive industries. This will entail disclosure by oil, gas and mining companies of tax and non-tax payments to host country governments and government-linked entities, and transparency by governments over revenues from this sector.

	<p pid=".705W.9/13">The above data combine projects that have been marked against the Reproductive Health Services and HIV/AIDS policy markers. Increasingly, DFID is helping to tackle HIV/AIDS within the context of large sexual and reproductive health programmes and sustainable health systems development. In these circumstances, it is often difficult to attribute spend to particular aspects of sexual and reproductive health. For example, provision of condoms serves the dual purposes of HIV/AIDS prevention and protection against other sexually transmitted infections as well as family planning. We strongly believe that a cross-sectoral approach to tackling HIV/AIDS is essential if we are to be successful. The International Development Committee share this view. This does, however, pose problems of attribution.</p>

A substantial proportion will go to low income countries included within the Fast Track Initiative, notably to the five high population countries with large numbers of children out of school (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, DRC) which the Government successfully pressed to have included in the initiative.

	<p pid=".708W.5/1">The Supreme Court ruling of <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-21">21 November 2002</phrase> upheld the Independent National Electoral Commission's (INEC) right to set guidelines for the registration of political parties, but held that these guidelines could not impose requirements in excess of those set out in the constitution. As a result, 22 new political parties have now been registered, bringing the total to 28. Though the initial ruling by INEC was exclusive, the court system was used to good effect by the excluded parties to ensure a much broader participation. Thus, while the courts ruled that INEC was not 'fair' to have excluded parties in the first place, the system as a whole can be judged to have been fair.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.5/2">The registration of the additional parties will cause administrative difficulties, but it could have a beneficial impact, allowing more people to become involved in politics, and could increase the likelihood that parties will form on issue-based platforms. However the full impact of the registration of 22 new parties is yet to be felt. My Department is working closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to monitor developments.</p>

	<p pid=".718W.2/1">It is too early to make even the broadest of estimates of how much the military assistance will cost at this stage, because the costs incurred during the actual strike periods have yet to be fully captured through the Ministry of Defence's central cost reporting system, and because we have no relevant historical examples to predict from. This prevents the Department from making any accurate costs estimates beyond those associated with the initial purchase of the urgent operational equipment necessary to equip the services.</p>
	<p pid=".718W.2/2">In that regard, in the run up to the strike we incurred costs of around #8 million on purchasing major items of equipment such as protective clothing, breathing apparatus and hydraulic cutting equipment.</p>
	<p pid=".718W.2/3">Under the rules that apply to operations of this sort, the Ministry of Defence will recover from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) the additional costs that are incurred in providing military assistance, ensuring that the operation is cost neutral so far as the defence budget is concerned.</p>

	<p pid=".725W.2/1">Reservists called out into permanent service may apply for financial assistance in the event that their military salary is less than their earnings in civilian life. This assistance is paid in the form of a Reserve Standard Award (RSA). RSA is paid in banded rates that are related to a Reservist's rank. The current rates are set out in the Reserve Forces (Call-out and Recall) Financial Assistance Regulations (Statutory Instrument 1997/309). Work is in progress to raise the current bands to reflect the increases in inflation since these were brought into effect, and provide for automatic adjustment in line with inflation. It is currently planned to introduce the revised regulations early in 2003. Reservists are also eligible to apply for a Reserve Hardship Award (RHA) if the RSA alone would cause his/her dependents hardship. There is no ceiling for RHA payments.</p>

	<p pid=".726W.2/1">The sponsored reserves concept involves a service normally provided in peacetime under contract by civilian staff employed by a contractor being provided on operations by staff drawn from the contractor's civilian workforce who have volunteered to become sponsored reservists. It envisages letting contracts for services on condition that the contractor maintains in his workforce an agreed element of staff who will have volunteered to become sponsored reservists. Should it be necessary to do so, these sponsored reservists would be called-out and serve alongside the armed forces. Their role as sponsored reservists is to continue to provide the contracted support services to the armed forces in an operational environment. They receive appropriate military training in peacetime to equip them to deliver the support required when called out for operations. The details of the individual roles of sponsored reservists will be reflected in their civilian employment contract and the contracts between the employer and the Ministry of Defence.</p>

I expect anti-TNF drugs therefore to become more widely available next year.</p>

In recognition of the exceptional circumstances Huntingdon Life Sciences Group plc have found themselves in, the DTI has previously agreed to provide banking facilities for Huntingdon Life Sciences Group plc. The DTI is now extending its support to facilitate the provision of insurance services to Huntingdon Life Sciences Group plc on a worldwide basis. Both these actions have been taken to secure Huntingdon Life Sciences Group plc from the harm caused by the criminal intimidation and assault being directed at its employees, including their families and friends, and also those of its suppliers, customers and other companies. Huntingdon Life Sciences Group plc is a world-leading provider in the highly regulated area of essential research, development and toxicological testing services for the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and chemical industries. Any commercial damage to these industries or their supporting services, like Huntingdon Life Sciences, would have a very serious impact on UK scientific and medical research. The DTI is not using commercial insurance companies or brokers at this time and is providing insurance through its own resources.</p>

	<p pid=".738W.5/1">The post office card account is one of a range of accounts which people will be able, from next year, to receive benefit payments into. Our aim is that people should be able to choose the option which suits them best. Information about all the options is being supplied to customers by the Department for Work and Pensions and the Inland Revenue. When it is their turn to change the method of benefit and pension payments, the Government will be writing to customers with information which clearly sets out their account options and enables them to freely choose the account that is right for them. The migration programme will last two years beginning in 2003.</p>

Over the same period 115 project licence applications, 54 personal licence applications and one application for a certificate of designation have so far been recorded as not proceeded with.</p>
	<p pid=".745W.2/2">A feature of the regulatory regime under the 1986 Act is the discussion that often takes place at an early stage between applicants (or prospective applicants) and the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate. This means that proposals unlikely to meet the Act's stringent requirements are revised or withdrawn before formal refusal becomes necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".745W.5/2">This is one of the reasons why reducing the frequent use of any illicit drug has been included within the updated drug strategy target for young people. Government Departments are now looking at how best to convince young people about the health risk associated with cannabis use.</p>
	<p pid=".745W.5/3">The Department for Education and Skills will be revising its guidance to schools on the delivery of drug education and the revised guidance will be available in September 2003. We will also be working with youth media and health organisations to make sure the health risks associated with smoking cannabis are much more widely understood.</p>

	<p pid=".748W.5/1">Government statistics are not kept on the number of ethnic minority women's voluntary organisations in the United Kingdom. However the Council for Ethnic Minority Voluntary Organisations (CEMVO), an umbrella organisation funded by the Home Office to provide services to the black and minority ethnic (BME) voluntary and community sector had 444 BME women's organisations run by women on their database as of <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-09">9 December 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.5/2">Information for the number of ethnic minority women's voluntary organisations which have benefited from Health Action Zones or other regeneration programmes is not available centrally. Many programmes do however support marginalised groups and have strategies in place to increase their participation. In 2001 for instance, 560 (36 per cent.) of the 1,555 community champions funded by the Community Champions Fund were from BME communities, a success attributable to strategies such as simple application form and positive role models.</p>
	<p pid=".748W.5/3">The voluntary and community sector (VCS) makes a vital contribution to tackling deprivation and promoting community cohesion. We are working across Government to further increase our support for the sector. Race equality has been placed in the mainstream of all areas of neighbourhood renewal and regeneration. We are also raising awareness of the Compact, the framework for effective partnership working between Government and the VCS, and are developing a more robust evidence base for marginalised sectors such as BME women's groups so that all parts of Government can better respond to the VCS's requirements.</p>

	<p pid=".749W.0/2">In the past five years, France has made requests for the extradition of three persons accused of charges relating to terrorist activity.</p>
	<p pid=".749W.0/3">One request made in March 1996 led to the fugitive's surrender to France in March 1998.</p>
	<p pid=".749W.0/4">In another, a request made in April 2001 has just completed its judicial stages. The fugitive now has a statutory opportunity to make representations to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary as to why his surrender should not take place. Those representations are awaited.</p>
	<p pid=".749W.0/5">In the remaining case, there are two outstanding requests. The first covers three separate requisitions made in November and December 1995 and in February 1996. Following lengthy proceedings, a decision in October 2001 to order surrender was quashed in June 2002 by the courts. We are awaiting a response from French authorities on matters raised by the judgment in order that the case may be reviewed. A further request for extradition, involving additional charges, was made in the same case in October 2001. That matter is still before the courts.</p>
	<p pid=".749W.0/6">A Bill to streamline and modernise current extradition procedures is now before parliament.</p>

	<p pid=".750W.14/1">No. The UK Passport Service requirements that parental consent is given before a passport is issued to a child and that evidence of an appropriate court order be produced before accepting consent form a local authority social services department, are based on sound principles and are correct in law. It would be wrong for the UK Passport Service to attempt to decide whether or to whom parental rights have transferred in these circumstances; these are matters for the courts. The UK Passport Service is drawing up a guidance note for social services departments to clarify requirements for passport applications.</p>

	<p pid=".751W.2/1">British passports are issued to children only when parental consent is given. If an application for a child's passport is made by anyone other than the child's parents, the United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) must establish either that the applicant has parental rights or that a person with parental rights has given consent. In most cases where a child is in foster care parental rights are not transferred to the foster parent. The UKPS therefore advises the local authority to make the application in such circumstances and give details of the care order or other court order which deals with the issue of parental rights. Applications in which this information is provided are not delayed.</p>

	<p pid=".751W.5/1">We have not made final decisions about implementation of the measures in the Criminal Justice Bill, but on the basis of the modelling which has been undertaken to estimate the impact of the sentencing reforms and the cost of the Bill, we do not expect them to generate significant increases in the prison population. On current assumptions, the impact on the prison population of implementing the sentencing reforms would be broadly flat with a small reduction in places in late 2004 and early 2005, followed by a modest increase of up to 1,000 places between mid-2006 and early 2009, levelling out once the reforms have bedded in.</p>
	<p pid=".751W.5/2">The Review of Correctional Services is addressing a wide range of questions regarding effectiveness and value for money and is developing a strategy for managing prison population pressures and containing its future growth. The impact of proposals in the Criminal Justice Bill are being considered in the context of the review. The prison population projections will be revised when firm implementation dates for new policy initiatives have been set. The prison service will then be in a position to work up plans for delivering the capacity needed to meet the revised projections.</p>

AGP, whose arrangements were approved under the planning permission given by Westminster city council, have commented that the current waste disposal routing via the road network, instead of by barge, is more environmentally compatible. The waste is loaded into the transport vehicles once only and is then transported to the recycling centre approximately six miles from the site. This procedure is much less complicated and involves much less loading and re-loading of waste than transportation by water. Moreover, currently there are no recycling centres with the capacity that AGP require situated along the river.</p>

	<p pid=".754W.2/1">Visa regimes are maintained only where they contribute to effective immigration control. The visa regime has proved effective in reducing the numbers of inadmissible passengers travelling to the UK from Slovakia. Following Slovakia's accession to the EU in 2004, all categories of Slovak nationals will enjoy rights of free movement and will not require a visa to come to the UK. In the meantime, the visa regime on Slovak nationals, as with all visa regimes, will be kept under review and will be lifted when we consider that the threat to our immigration control is at an acceptable level.</p>

This is sometimes done by legislation, but on other occasions by administrative means. In yet other situations, domestic legislation which is being amended for other purposes, may also incorporate changes to reflect EU directives.

The Department conducted research of benefit recipients who were not already paid this way to provide an overview of their characteristics, experiences and attitudes. Some people indicated that they wanted to be able to continue to access their money from post office branches and also to be able to continue to collect it weekly. Both of these options will be available when this payment method becomes the normal way we pay benefits from April 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".768W.11/2">Benefit customers are increasingly choosing direct payment as the way they want their benefit or pension paid. Research has shown that around 85 per cent. of benefit customers already have access to bank accounts. The introduction of universal banking services (which consist of two elements: access to a basic bank account and the post office card account) will open up a wider range of banking and financial services. We have always recognised that there will be a small group of people who we cannot pay directly into an account. We will develop an alternate method to pay this group of people.</p>

	<p pid=".769W.5/2">The target to reduce the number of children in low-income households by at least aquarter by 2004&ndash;05 is measured by the number of children below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income as reported in Households Below Average Income (HBAI) statistics. Baseline for the target is 1998&ndash;99 with 3.1 million children in low-income households before housing costs (BHC) and 4.2 million after housing costs (AHC). HBAI statistics show a fall of around 400,000 children between 1998&ndash;99 and 2000&ndash;01 (3.1 million to 2.7 million) BHC, and 300,000 (4.2 million to 3.9 million) AHC.</p>

	<p pid=".769W.8/2">The combined pension forecast service was piloted from October 1999, and is now operational. Throughout the pilots the Department has worked with employers and pension providers to ensure they can issue combined pension forecasts to their employees and pension scheme members. Now the service is operational, we are continuing to recruit employers and pension providers in order to build up the service so that is can be made available to as many people as possible. To date, 348 schemes have expressed an interest in using this voluntary service.</p>
	<p pid=".769W.8/3">The complete process from recruitment to the time the employer or pension scheme provider provides combined forecasts, can take around 12 to 18 months, and as the private sector partner issues the statement, precise issue dates are their responsibility.</p>
	<p pid=".769W.8/4">The Department has, however, worked in partnership with a number of providers to facilitate the issue of combined pension forecasts on the following dates:</p>

	<p pid=".770W.2/1">This was a very busy Council with business split over two days. My right hon. Friend attended the Employment and Social Policy part, held on <phrase class="date" code="">3 December</phrase>, accompanied by the Minister for Employment Relations and the Regions, Alan Johnson. The agenda covered a wide range of employment and social policy issues. Council agreed an orientation toward political agreement on a Regulation to replace Regulation 1408/71 which coordinates social security for people moving within the EU. The issues covered at this Council were sickness benefits, benefits for work injury and illness, and death grants. Work will continue on simplification of this regulation under the forthcoming Greek Presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/2">The Council reached political agreement on a Regulation extending provisions of Regulation 1408/71 to nationals of third countries. This Regulation will be adopted at a future council.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/3">The Council also agreed to minor revisions to the objectives agreed at Nice in 2000 for the next round of National Action Plans on social inclusion.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/4">The Council agreed a number of Resolutions: on e-accessibility for disabled people, ahead of the European year for disabled people in 2003; on social inclusion through social dialogue; and on corporate social responsibility.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/5">This Council also produced Conclusions on gender mainstreaming within the Council and Council Conclusions on a series of indicators concerning violence against women.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/6">There were three substantive discussions at this Council. Council adopted a joint report with ECOFIN on the streamlining of the annual co-ordination of economic and employment policies after some discussion. The report is in line with the UK's desire to see reform of the employment processes to emphasise outcomes and ensure that all work is geared to achieving the Lisbon objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/7">There was also an orientation debate on the Commission's proposed Directive on improving working conditions for temporary agency workers. Amongst other issues, the UK continued to argue for a longer derogation than the six weeks proposed in the Commission paper. The Greek Presidency will continue to seek a compromise on this dossier when they take over the Presidency next year.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/8">The Council agreed a Decision establishing a Tripartite Social Summit after discussion. This will be forwarded as a Report from the ESPHCA to the General Affairs and External Relations Council, and recommends continuing the current informal arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/9">The Council adopted joint conclusions with ECOFIN on the structural indicators for the 2003 Synthesis report.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/10">The Commission presented its draft of the Joint Employment Report at this Council. The draft was remitted to the Employment Committee for consideration.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/11">The Presidency announced that it would shortly be bringing forward a revised proposal for a Directive protecting workers from the risks of exposure to electromagnetic fields and waves.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/12">No votes were taken on any of these issues.</p>

	<p pid=".774W.2/1">We have introduced a range of initiatives designed to encourage pensioners to take up their entitlements. For the minimum income guarantee (MIG) we have undertaken a national advertising campaign, which resulted in almost 140,000 successful claims, with an average gain of #20 per week. We have also reduced the MIG claim form from 40 to 10 pages, introduced a MIG specific leaflet, and we are identifying potential beneficiaries through key events, such as claiming state pension.</p>
	<p pid=".774W.2/2">A key priority, for both Government and The Pension Service is the successful take-up of the new pension credit, which will enhance and replace the MIG. It has been specifically designed to be easy for pensioners to claim and to be less intrusive. The weekly means test will be abolished for the over-65s and be replaced by a statement of their circumstances every 5 years. Capital rules will be relaxed and the upper capital limit abolished.</p>
	<p pid=".774W.2/3">Our take-up plan for pension credit is extensive and makes use of a range of channels. We will transfer existing MIG recipients to pension credit, ready for payments to be made from October 2003; write to all pensioners not already receiving MIG by June 2004 to alert them to possible pension credit entitlement, supported by a national publicity campaign; work with local partners to help support the communications to pensioners, and tailor marketing and communications activity accordingly.</p>
	<p pid=".774W.2/4">The Pension Service pension centres are backed up by local services delivered in partnership with local authorities and voluntary sector organisations provided in locations accessible to pensioners. There will be appointment surgeries and, in time, drop-in surgeries to meet pensioners in places where they visit.</p>
	<p pid=".774W.2/5">Outreach activity will be an important part of local service work. Staff will be meeting people in partner and other locations accessible to customers offering general advice and guidance and taking part in benefit take-up initiatives.</p>
	<p pid=".774W.2/6">We are planning to introduce a network of Internet access points, telephone points and hard copy information (displaying leaflets, posters, claim forms and other materials) points based in Government and partner locations: and a benefits information service for partners, care workers, volunteers etc. to raise awareness of The Pension Service, pensioner entitlements and how to apply for them.</p>
	<p pid=".774W.2/7">We have also set up the Partnerships Against Poverty group, and are undertaking negotiations with partners at a national level to agree the scope for partnership working.</p>

	<p pid=".776W.0/2">There has been an increase in the number of people who save for their retirement through private pensions since the introduction of stakeholder pensions. Although not all stakeholder pension sales will be to new pension savers, it is widely acknowledged that stakeholder pensions have had a beneficial effect on the provision of pensions more generally. For example, as an alternative to designating a stakeholder pension scheme employers have broadened access to their occupational pension schemes to the whole of the workforce, or have opened group personal pension schemes to which they contribute. What is clear is that for a very large number of people stakeholder pensions have provided a route into pension provision that they had never had before.</p>

The recent National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) report, Strategic Analysis 2002, analysed most of the directly-funded cancer research of Government and charity funders. The analysis revealed that 60 per cent. of research spend was relevant to all tumour sites. The other 40 per cent. was relevant to specific tumour sites. Approximately 18 per cent. of the site-specific research was on breast cancer.</p>

	<p pid=".784W.5/1">The Human Genetics Commission (HGC) consultation on genetic testing services supplied direct to the public closed in October 2002. HGC is analysing the responses and is conducting additional public surveys. HGC plans to publish its report and recommendations to Ministers early in 2003. It will also publish all of the non-confidential responses received during consultation and copies will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".784W.5/2">HGC has now received written responses from 42 organisations and 22 individuals. Approximately 14 written responses and four oral evidence sessions were from consumer and patient groups. Of these, six favoured statutory regulation for at least some tests and three favoured voluntary codes. Of the written responses from all sources that expressed a view, none favoured no action, 11 favoured voluntary codes for some types of tests, 24 favoured a mixture of voluntary codes and statutory restrictions and 13 favoured statutory restrictions for some types of test.</p>

	<p pid=".785W.2/1">Central data on genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinic waiting times are available only for patients referred by general practitioners. GUM is an open access service and the vast majority of patients self-refer and therefore these data do not provide an accurate picture of waiting times for these services. One of the action points in the sexual health and HIV strategy implementation action plan is to develop a waiting times indicator for GUM and work on this is already under way. However, we are aware that there are pressures on GUM clinics which have led to long waiting times for some services. We have therefore invested over #5 million this year to improve capacity and reduce waiting times.</p>

	<p pid=".786W.3/1">Amendments 9 and 11 proposed by the European Parliament in relation to the draft Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products would have the effect of allowing applications for traditional use registrations where individual active herbal ingredients had had traditional use but there was not evidence of traditional use of that particular combination. Elsewhere, within the proposed Directive, applicants are required to supply evidence of the traditional use of the specific combination and member states may refuse applications if the data on traditional use is insufficient. The amendments would therefore probably have limited effect.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.3/2">Our overall view on this issue is that active medicinal ingredients, herbal or otherwise, can interact causing adverse reactions and we would have concerns on public health grounds about combinations where safety was supported neither by tests and trials (as would apply in the case of a marketing authorisation) nor by evidence of long usage. In some cases one or more herbal ingredient in a combination could reasonably be regarded as non active, for example where included for taste or colour, and in that situation non active ingredients need not have been used as part of the traditional combination.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.3/3">It is likely to be possible to demonstrate traditional use of a great many herbal combinations. During continuing negotiations, and subsequent implementation if the Directive is agreed, we will look for ways to ensure that the regulatory impact of demonstrating traditional use of combinations is contained to the necessary minimum.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.3/4">Amendments 9 and 11 also follow through a concept introduced in Amendment 6 which has the effect that classification of a product as a herbal medicinal product would depend on the active ingredients being present at a pharmacologically active level.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.3/5">We have some concerns about the proposal as drafted. There is an existing definition of a medicinal product in Directive 2001/83/EC. We would not wish to change that definition in relation to one category of medicinal product only (herbal medicines), in relation to an issue, (levels of pharmacological activity) that is a generic one, relevant to all medicines. Second, the amendment does not address the regulatory position of products which, under the existing definition, are classified as medicinal products by virtue of their presentation. Third, the dividing line between pharmacologically active and non pharmacologically active levels may be difficult to determine for many herbal substances.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.3/6">Our top priority in relation to the definition of a medicinal product in the ongoing negotiations on the review of Directive 2001/83/EC is to resist the provision, originally proposed by the European Commission, that would give precedence to medicines legislation for any product which fell within the definition of a medicinal product, even if that product was already regulated under other sectoral legislation. This proposal could have lead to many more products being classified as medicines. From the outset of negotiations we have argued vigorously against this proposal, seeking to enlist the support of other member states and Members of the European Parliament. We are therefore pleased that the European Parliament has not supported the Commission's original proposal and we will continue to argue for its deletion from the proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.3/7">We also recognise that there are differences in member states' interpretation of the current definition of a medicinal product in relation to products close to the borderline of medicines and other regulatory regimes. We are therefore open to constructive dialogue, whether domestically or in a European forum, on this issue. We intend to discuss further the implications of these proposed amendments with the United Kingdom herbal sector in order to inform our negotiating position.</p>

In turn this would make it possible for the public to be given much clearer advice than is currently possible about how to avoid unregulated herbal medicines which may pose a risk to health.</p>

	<p pid=".788W.0/2">The better hospital food programme is designed to improve the quality, availability and access to food in hospitals and is a long-term programme. An additional #38.5 million has been made available to support this programme.</p>
	<p pid=".788W.0/3">The costs of providing meals varies, depending both on the particular dish involved and the method of production. Typically, a traditional system produces meals more cheaply, while a delivered meals service is more expensive. A report by the Audit Commission in September 2001 found average spending on food and beverages was #2.20 for a cook-serve system, #2.40 for a national health service operated cook-chill/freeze service, and #3.70 for a delivered meals service. However, there are a number of other issues such as overheads and capital replacement charges, which also vary according to the production system in use and which affect overall costs. There is therefore no average per meal cost.</p>
	<p pid=".788W.0/4">As part of the better hospital food programme, acute hospitals have been asked to include in their menus each day three of the dishes designed for the NHS by the 'leading chef' team. These dishes encompass main meals, desserts, salads and sandwiches. There are now 200 'leading chef' dishes included in the NHS dish selector and average costs for these dishes is no greater than those for other dishes currently in use in NHS hospitals.</p>

The analysis revealed that 60 per cent. of research spend was relevant to all tumour sites. The other 40 per cent. was relevant to specific tumour sites. Approximately 3 per cent. of the site-specific research was on lung cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.2/2">The NCRI has identified lung cancer as an area that might need more attention. We will be working with our research funding partners through the NCRI to fully understand the reasons for this and consider any actions that might be required.</p>

	<p pid=".795W.3/2">Regulations to increase the tariff and cap for the recovery of national health service (NHS) costs following road traffic accidents were laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-11">11 December 2002</phrase>. The regulations increase the tariff to take account of hospital and community health services (HCHS) inflation since 1997, which is the year the tariff was set. The regulations also increase the cap, as operational experience has shown that this was set too low when the scheme was introduced in April 1999. The increased cap would still relieve insurers of the full cost of treating those seriously injured in road traffic accidents.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.3/3">The Department undertook a consultation on the proposed increases, which ran for three months between July and September 2002. Departmental officials discussed the consultation and the proposed increases with members of the insurance industry and their trade bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.3/4">The increased charges would increase income to NHS hospitals by around #56 million per year. However, as NHS costs are not repaid until the accident victim's compensation claim settles, which takes on average 18 months, NHS hospitals would not feel the full effect of the increases until the latter part of 2004. If this cost was spread evenly among all holders of compulsory motor vehicle insurance, then the cost of the average policy could be expected to rise by around 0.7 per cent., or around #3 per policy.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.3/5">The consultation on increasing the level of charges and summary of outcome can be found on the Department of Health's website at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/consultations">www.doh.gov.uk/consultations</a></p>
