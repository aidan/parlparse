	<p pid="b.1107W.6/2">As the total area of land eventually designated as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones comprises 62% of England, rather than the 70% on which the 2008 estimates were based, the actual financial impact is likely to have been less than suggested above.</p>

	<p pid="b.1116W.8/1">Remanufacturing is an important feature of the move to a low carbon economy. Any process which reduces costs, waste and carbon emissions, whilst meeting demand and serving the economy, is to be welcomed. Job creation must though come from the private sector. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills,(BIS), working with the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), is carrying out a review of energy intensive sectors, such as iron, steel and aluminium, which will consider how remanufacturing-and recycling-will play a role in ensuring the future competitiveness of these sectors in the low carbon economy. In the revised waste framework directive the waste hierarchy is now a priority order providing a strong driver to encourage greater reuse and recycling.</p>
	<p pid="b.1116W.8/2">We are also working to create a Green Economy Roadmap which is a joint initiative between BIS, DECC and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, to provide clarity to business on the green economy, the Government's policy intentions and the implications for business over the next 10 years. We will be publishing details later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1127W.9/1">The assessment is being developed in collaboration with an independent group of specialists in health, social care and disability, including disabled people. We know it is essential that it accurately captures the needs of disabled people with autistic spectrum disorders and this is something that the development group is considering. For example, they believe that the new assessment should explicitly take account of the impact of a health condition or impairment, including autistic spectrum disorders, on an individual's ability to communicate. This would set it apart from the current DLA assessment. Both I and departmental officials have met with the National Autistic Society to discuss our reform proposals and to seek their views on how the new benefit can best support those with autism. We will continue to work with disabled people and their organisations as the detail of the assessment criteria and its operation is developed and tested.</p>

	<p pid="b.1133W.2/2">In the current tax credit system, certain elements are paid to the parent who is identified as the main carer for the children but the way in which funds are actually used will similarly depend on household management of finances.</p>

More detailed work is under way to allocate resources to the different parts of the Department, develop more detailed plans and assess the resulting staffing levels. Work on the future staffing position will also take account of estimated staff turnover rates and the potential for internal and external redeployment. It is not therefore possible to provide estimates of future staff numbers or potential redundancies in Sheffield or the wider Yorkshire area at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1136W.2/3">There have been departmental wide communications on the spending review settlement and potential impacts on overall staff numbers. There have been no additional formal communications specific to Sheffield or Yorkshire and the Humber.</p>

	<p pid="b.1137W.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-03">3 February 2011</phrase>, I announced to the House the Government's in principle decision to reform ATOL to improve protection for consumers in a changing holiday market. The reforms would extend the ATOL scheme to Flight Plus holidays sold by travel agents and tour operators. Such trips closely resemble package holidays but are not covered by the existing legal definition and so currently fall outside ATOL.</p>
	<p pid="b.1137W.3/3">Subject to consultation, the intention is for the reforms to be implemented by new secondary legislation in late 2011 or early 2012. It is estimated that, over time, this will ensure around an additional 6 million holidays per year benefit from full ATOL protection.</p>

	<p pid="b.1145W.0/1">The Renewable Fuels Agency's (RFA) budget in 2009-10 was &#163;1.43 million and in 2010-11 it was &#163;1.75 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1145W.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-14">14 October 2010</phrase>, as part of the cross-Government review of Public Bodies, it was announced that the Renewable Fuels Agency (RFA) would be abolished and its functions transferred to Department for Transport (DfT).</p>
	<p pid="b.1145W.0/3">To manage this process as smoothly as possible, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-24">24 February 2011</phrase> the Office of the Renewable Fuels Agency (Dissolution and Transfer of Functions) Order 2011 was laid. This Order will dissolve the RFA and transfer its functions to the Secretary of State for Transport on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April</phrase>, to align with the financial year break. From 2011-12, budgeting for the functions previously carried out by the RFA will be included in Department for Transport business planning.</p>
	<p pid="b.1145W.0/4">The Order transfers all the functions of the RFA and will deliver administrative efficiencies without compromise to the important regulatory role that the RFA currently provides. It introduces no new business costs. Exact future costs and savings are inherently uncertain, however, transitional costs are currently estimated at &#163;100,000 and these would likely be incurred in financial years 2011-12 and 2012-13. We intend that by 2014-15, the cost of administering the RTFO scheme will be reduced by around a third in real terms against the current baseline.</p>

Moreover, we have serious misgivings over the regime's official results. The Election Commission initially reported that in some constituencies voter turnout exceeded 100% and in Kachin state where the regime had banned the elections, two pro-government candidates were declared winners.</p>

Almost every middle eastern country has been affected at the same time by demands for greater political openness and democratic freedom.

In Libya, legitimate protest has been followed by bloody civil strife at the hands of a government willing to countenance any loss of life in order to cling to power.

	<p pid="b.1157W.2/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I have been asked to respond to your recent question asking what the plans are for the presentation of data resulting from those who have chosen to write in a religion on their 2011 Census form.</p>
	<p pid="b.1157W.2/4" class="indent">The ONS is currently consulting with users on the main set of statistical outputs designed for the 2011 Census (including religion) to ensure it reflects user needs and meets expectations. The current proposal lists twenty-eight tables relating to religion with cross-tabulations against other variables such as age, sex, health and occupation, and the religion categories presented in these tables include write-in responses. The tables will be available at different levels of geography down to Census outputs areas (approximately 175,000 areas in England and Wales consisting of an average of 125 residents each).</p>
	<p pid="b.1157W.2/5" class="indent">The 2011 Census aims to take action to improve outputs (compared to 2001) relating to minority groups who are often captured in written responses including religion. The current consultation refers directly to this and provides users with the opportunity to advise ONS of their requirements for such statistics.</p>

	<p pid="b.1159W.2/5" class="indent">Long Term International Migration (LTIM) estimates are provided for the years ending mid-2006 up to and including provisional estimates for the year ending mid-2010. These are the latest available estimates and are derived from several data sources. The International Passenger Survey (IPS) migrant data provides the foundation of the LTIM estimates with adjustments for asylum seekers, people whose intentions change with regard to their length of stay, and for international migration to and from Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1159W.2/6" class="indent">Projections of future migration are provided from the year ending mid-2011 to the year ending mid-2016. The most recent population projections of the UK are based on the mid-year population estimates for 2008 and a set of demographic assumptions about future fertility, mortality and net migration based on analysis of trends and expert advice. The assumptions for in-migration and out-migration are by-products of this process and do not feed directly into producing projections.</p>
	<p pid="b.1159W.2/7" class="indent">The national population projections are not forecasts and do not attempt to predict the impact that future government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors (whether in the UK or overseas) might have on demographic behaviour. However, the projections included in the table will reflect the impact of any government policy up to 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1159W.2/8" class="indent">Long-term international migration data produced by the ONS applies the UN definition of someone who moves from their country of previous residence for a period of at least a year, irrespective of citizenship.</p>

	<p pid="b.1163W.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-16">16 December 2010</phrase>, the Government announced a new package to deliver our commitment to end the detention of children for immigration purposes and the immediate closure to children of the family unit at the Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre. A new approach to managing family returns has been developed which places far greater emphasis on engagement with families and aims to encourage families to leave without the need for enforcement action if they are found to have no legal right to be in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.3/2">Most elements of this new process went live across the UK on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-01">1 March 2011</phrase>, including a new independent Family Returns Panel to advise the UK Border Agency on how to ensure the return of those families who do not take up the opportunities to leave under their own steam. A range of options has been developed to provide sufficient flexibility for a tailored approach to each family.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.3/3">As a backstop, a new option of pre-departure accommodation is being developed for use when other options for ensuring return have failed or are not appropriate. This will have a secure perimeter but families will be allowed to leave the premises with permission after a suitable risk assessment. It will have an entirely different look and feel to an immigration removal centre with more privacy and strictly time-limited stays. Barnardo's will deliver the key welfare, safeguarding and support services. We expect this to open in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1163W.3/4">The small number of family rooms at Tinsley House Immigration Removal Centre may be used in place of the new pre-departure accommodation until May. After May, Tinsley House will only be used for those few families who are refused entry to the UK at the border and need to be held for a short time prior to their return or for criminal and other high-risk families who could not be accommodated safely in the pre-departure accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1164W.2/2">Where enforcement action does need to be taken, a range of options has been developed to ensure the safe return of families. These options include open accommodation and, as a backstop when other options for ensuring return have failed or are not appropriate, pre-departure accommodation. A small number of family rooms at Tinsley House immigration removal centre may be used in place of the new pre-departure accommodation until May.

	<p pid="b.1164W.2/3">Families will enter open accommodation on a voluntary basis and will be entirely free to come and go during their stay. Families will only enter open accommodation where their return can be delivered within 72 hours of the family's arrival there, or within five working days for Third Country Unit or Non Suspensive Appeal cases. If the return fails, the family may remain in open accommodation, but their stay will not exceed a maximum of 28 days. Stays in pre-departure accommodation and in Tinsley House will be strictly time-limited: the normal maximum will be 72 hours, which may be extended in exceptional circumstances to a maximum of seven days with ministerial authorisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.2/4">Other than in border cases, families will enter open accommodation, pre-departure accommodation and Tinsley House only after advice has been sought from a new independent Family Returns Panel.</p>

	<p pid="b.1165W.2/2">The UK Border Agency takes its responsibilities for safeguarding children seriously and where possible ensures that families remain together. Typically, separations would take place only in cases where a member of the family is also a former foreign national prisoner and a decision has been made to maintain their detention pending deportation. Under the new arrangements for managing family returns, families without any criminal history would only be separated in exceptional circumstances and after advice had been sought from the independent Family Returns Panel.</p>

However, figures for council parking attendants are not provided as the Home Office does not collect statistics on local authority employed staff.</p>

	<p pid="b.1174W.0/5" class="indent">Ofsted publishes quarterly official statistics on early years registered inspection outcomes, at local authority, government office region and national level, with the annual position summarised in the Annual Report of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Education, Children's Services and Skills. The figures given in this response are consistent with published statistics.</p>
	<p pid="b.1174W.0/6" class="indent">Tables A, B and C show the inspection outcomes of childcare providers on the Early Years Register in the West Midlands which were active at the end of each period, since September 2008. Please note that we do not classify early years registered providers as 'maintained'. In addition, because there is no requirement for Ofsted to capture the funding streams of providers as part of the regulation and inspection of early years registered providers, we do not hold data on whether such providers are private, voluntary or independent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1174W.0/7" class="indent">The figures provided relate only to the inspection of those providers on the Early Years Register against the Early Years Foundation Stage framework and do not include a minority of providers inspected before September 2008, under the previous inspection framework. This is because there is no direct comparison between the two frameworks. Childcare providers offering care for children from birth to the <phrase class="date" code="2011-08-31">31 August</phrase> following the child's fifth birthday are required to register on the Early Years Register. The arrangements of the Early Years Foundation Stage came into effect in September 2008, marking the beginning of a 47 month cycle of inspection, during which Ofsted aims to inspect all providers on the Early Years Register at least once.</p>

	<p pid="b.1176W.2/1">The Department for Education has not issued any specific guidance to schools on reducing obesity since October 2010 and has no plans to issue further guidance in the next six months. However, this Government recognise that through physical education, competitive school sport and healthy eating, schools can help address the problem of childhood obesity. In the past, the Department has made available guidance and resources to help schools provide a healthy environment by providing nutritious school lunches, improving participation in high quality PE and sport opportunities, helping children learn about health through Personal, Social, Health and Economic education and practical activities such as cooking. Guidance from DFE and Department of Health has also issued to schools on how they can support the National Child Measurement Programme, which collects essential height and weight data on primary school pupils in Reception and Year 6.</p>

	<p pid="b.1176W.5/1">The most recent and authoritative international report on the well-being of children is UNICEF's Report Card 9, &quot;The children left behind: a league table of inequality in child well-being in the world's rich countries&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-03">3 December 2010</phrase>. The report assesses inequalities in child well-being for 24 of the world's richest countries, regarding material well-being, educational well-being and health well-being.</p>
	<p pid="b.1176W.5/2">'Material inequality' measures household income, access to basic educational resources and household living space. 'Educational inequality' measures reading, maths and science literacy using the 2006 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). 'Health inequality' measures self-reported health, healthy eating and vigorous physical activity, using the 2005/06 &quot;Health Behaviour of School-aged Children&quot; (HBSC) study.</p>
	<p pid="b.1176W.5/3">For material inequality, the UK showed higher levels of inequality than the OECD average, in particular for access to basic educational resources at home such as a calculator, dictionary, desk, etc. This measure of material inequality was the main driver for the UK's poor rank against other countries for this dimension of inequality (the UK was ranked 19<sup>(th)</sup> out of 24 countries).</p>
	<p pid="b.1176W.5/4">The UK ranked 13<sup>(th)</sup> out of 24 countries for educational well-being. There was below average inequality for maths literacy, but above average inequality in science literacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1176W.5/5">The UK had lower than average inequality for each measure of health well-being (the UK was 11<sup>(th)</sup> out of the 24 countries). We performed particularly well in comparison to other countries in the self-reported health complaints measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1176W.5/6">The UK's overall ranking was in the bottom two-fifths of countries, alongside Belgium, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovakia and Spain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1176W.5/7">The OECD report &quot;Doing Better for Children&quot; (2009) presents a similarly mixed picture for national average levels of child well-being in rich countries (as distinct from the UNICEF report, which addresses inequalities). There is a strong positive in respect of the quality of school life, where we are among the OECD's best-performing countries. The strongest negative is on risky behaviours (smoking, drinking, teenage pregnancy) where we are among the worst. For the remaining dimensions-material well-being, educational well-being, housing/environment, and health/safety-the UK's performance is broadly similar to the OECD average.</p>
	<p pid="b.1176W.5/8">UNICEF's analysis brings out the relationship between lower inequality and higher median scores. UNICEF has found that those countries with lower 'bottom-end' inequality are also those countries with higher median scores, particularly for education and health well-being. This suggests that it is possible to reduce inequality and have high performance in a country. Similarly, the 2010 Schools White Paper &quot;The Importance of Teaching&quot; highlights the importance of reducing attainment gaps between the rich and poor while maintaining high standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1176W.5/9">The Government remain committed to the goal of eradicating child poverty by 2020. The Child Poverty Act 2010 requires the Government to publish a child poverty strategy by spring 2011. To inform this process the Government conducted an eight week period of consultation with prominent members of the child poverty lobby and other interested parties. The consultation ran for eight weeks from <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-21">21 December 2010</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-15">15 February 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1176W.5/10">The Government continue to believe that work provides parents and their children with the most sustainable route out of poverty. The Government want parents to take advantage of the employment opportunities currently available. As a consequence the UK welfare system is being reformed to allow individuals and parents keep more of their earnings and progress in work. This will enable parents to give their children the best possible start in life providing stable financial support for families in the crucial early years of a child's life. A strong foundation in the early years increases the probability of positive outcomes across the child's life; a weak foundation significantly increases the risk of later difficulties.</p>

	<p pid="b.1177W.2/17">The Government do not routinely collect data on sexual activity by age. It is also the case that the surveys that have been carried out on this issue, typically report on sexual activity below age 16, rather than under 15, given that the age of consent is 16. The most authoritative and relevant of the surveys in this area is the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL), which is conducted every 10 years. NATSAL 2000 identified that among the 16 to 19-year-olds interviewed, 30% of young men and 26% of young women reported that their first sexual experience occurred before they reached age 16. This was consistent with the findings for young men and women in the survey who were aged 25-29, indicating that there had been no change in the proportion of young people having sex before age 16 over the preceding decade. The median age of first sex among 16 to 19-year-olds in the survey in 2000, was age 16.</p>
	<p pid="b.1177W.2/18">Fieldwork for NATSAL 2010 has been completed, but the findings have not yet been published. However, a range of separate smaller scale surveys that have been undertaken since 2000 have consistently shown between a quarter and a third of young people reporting that they had their first sexual experience before age 16. A tracking survey that was used to assess young people's reactions to the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy's media campaign showed that in 2007, the mean age for first sex among young men was 16.48 years and for young women was 16.53 years. These results were the same as the results from the same survey carried out in 2004.</p>

It set out several site options, including the Downshall Centre. Since November 2010, Partnerships for Schools, the proposers (E-ACT), officials from the Department and representatives of Redbridge council have had discussions about the site of the proposed free school, including the potential use of the Downshall Centre. These discussions have included the need for the council to relocate some community facilities if the Downshall Centre is used.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179W.2/3">The project is currently at the business case and plan stage. The business case and plan is being developed and will include the case for the use of a chosen site by the proposed school. No final decision to open the school will be made until a full assessment of the business case and plan has been completed and the Secretary of State has decided whether to sign the funding agreement with the proposers. As part of this process, the proposers (E-ACT) will be consulting on their plans to open a free school in Ilford. If the project proceeds, then transport issues will be fully considered and other agencies will be involved as necessary before the school opens.</p>

	<p pid="b.1183W.11/2"><i> </i>In the Green Paper &quot;Support and Aspiration: A new approach to special educational needs and disability&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-09">9 March</phrase>, we announced that we will retain, but review and update, the statutory guidance to schools and local authorities in the SEN code of practice to reflect the proposals for change in the Green Paper and responses to the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1183W.11/3">In the Green Paper we ask whether the statutory guidance on inclusion and school choice, 'Inclusive Schooling', allows appropriately for parental preference for either mainstream or special schools. In the light of the responses to the Green Paper we will consider whether to incorporate this guidance into the new code.</p>
	<p pid="b.1183W.11/4">The Green Paper also made a commitment to simplify and improve non-statutory guidance so that it is clear, accessible and helpful, and we will withdraw guidance that does not provide useful support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1183W.11/5">On non-statutory guidance, the Department issued guidance on pupils with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties (BESD) in 2008. The Green Paper is consulting on the categorisation of BESD and whether the term adequately identifies difficulties that may underlie difficult behaviour. The revised and updated code will include guidance on behaviour, following consideration of responses to the consultation, and we intend, therefore, to withdraw the BESD guidance. The revised code will also incorporate guidance on the effective use of data in monitoring the progress and achievement of pupils with SEN and disabilities currently set out in guidance on categorising SEN for School Census purposes (2005), Progression Guidance (2009), and Breaking the Link between Special Educational Needs and Low Attainment (2010).</p>
	<p pid="b.1183W.11/6">We will remove good practice guidance on autism spectrum disorders (2002) as this has been superseded by the web-based 2010 in-service training materials on autism. We will also remove the SEN Toolkit, as it replicates much of the existing code, and the SEN Governors' Guide video which is now out of date in both content and format.</p>
