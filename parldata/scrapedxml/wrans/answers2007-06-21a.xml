	<p pid="a.1972W.5/1">Decisions regarding the criteria for and funding of Olympic governing bodies of sport are made by the Sports Councils, not by Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1972W.5/2">UK Sport is charged with delivering UK success at the Olympic and Paralympic games. To achieve this it takes a 'no compromise' approach to its investment, targeting resources and activity at those athletes and sports deemed most capable of medal winning performances. Individual sports are allocated their funding through the UK Sport World Class Pathway programme, with the amount determined by a formula that includes results from the previous games and current rankings, as well as future medal potential and the identification of talent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1972W.5/3">In addition, some Olympic sports are funded by Home Country Sports Councils in pursuit of their wider aims and objectives; for example, increasing participation in sport. In England, Sport England provides funding to 21 Olympic sports to support delivery of their four-year strategic plans at community level. The sports apply the funding they receive to deliver against a range of key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs include increasing the number of accredited clubs, the number of club members and the numbers of coaches and volunteers working within their sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.1972W.5/4">Furthermore, as a part of the joint DfES/DCMS National School Sport strategy, Sport England also funds a total of 18 Olympic sports to support delivery of school club links and volunteer and leadership opportunities for young people.</p>

While the Act does not formally apply on the parliamentary estate, the Commission, on the advice of the Administration Committee, has decided that the House should comply with the principles of the legislation, as it is not desirable that those who work on or visit the parliamentary estate should be treated differently in this respect than in other workplaces and public places. The Commission recognises, however, that many who work on the estate are unavoidably present for long periods, particularly when the House is sitting. It is therefore desirable to make reasonable provision for those who wish to smoke to do so, provided that the health and safety of other users of the estate is not adversely affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1975W.0/3">With these principles in mind, the Commission has decided that smoking should cease to be permitted from <phrase class="date" code="">1 July 2007</phrase> in all internal areas of the House of Commons estate, including in bars and private offices. From that date smoking will, however, be permitted in four designated external areas: the Terrace, Commons Court (North West corner), North Terrace (between Portcullis House and Norman Shaw South), and in a designated area on the west side of Canon Row courtyard. Cigarette receptacles will be provided in these areas. &quot;No Smoking&quot; signs will be displayed at entrances to the buildings.</p>

	<p pid="a.1976W.2/1">DFID's support to democracy programmes is part of our broader approach to good governance. One of the components of good governance is an open and transparent political system with strong political institutions. This means our democracy work includes support to civil society to improve their capacity to hold governments to account; initiatives to build accountability into our health and education programmes to improve Government responsiveness to poor people; and work to strengthen political systems more broadly, including popular participation in the decision-making process. The latter includes direct support to elections and parliaments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1976W.2/2">In total, DFID's direct bilateral spend on governance programmes was &pound;212 million in 2004-05, &pound;322 million in 2005-06 and &pound;286 million in 2006-07. Within this DFID spent &pound;14 million directly on democratic elections in 2004-5, &pound;17.1 million in 2005-06 and &pound;15.5 million in 2006-7. Over the next five years, our support to governance will include an additional &pound;100 million for the governance and transparency fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.1976W.2/3">The aforementioned figures do not include our support to the UN, EU and other multilateral organisations some of which is used to fund governance and democracy promotion programmes. However, DFID does not hold details of what proportion of these contributions were used to assist with the promotion of democracy.</p>

	<p pid="a.1981W.0/1">The most important thing that needs to happen in Iraq is an end to the spiralling violence responsible for the deteriorating humanitarian situation and increasing levels of displacement. The Government of Iraq has put dealing with security at the top of its agenda and we will continue to support them. Furthermore, it has primary responsibility to ensure the protection of its citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.1981W.0/2">At the April UNHCR Conference in Geneva, the Government of Iraq made a commitment to take the lead in providing support and security for its citizens, including those who have fled the country. In the first phase, they pledged $25 million to finance the establishment of migration offices in Jordan and Syria. These offices will support vulnerable Iraqis and help alleviate the burden of the influx of refugees on host countries. We will continue to press them to step up their response to the situation and develop their policy on how best to provide assistance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1981W.3/1">DFID has actively supported the health systems in Mozambique for a number of years. DFID Mozambique provided support to the Technical Planning Unit within the Ministry of Health to facilitate development of a national health plan for the period 2000-05. DFID also funded the HIV/AIDS and Maternal Health Programme (2001-07) which aims to increase access to and use of good quality reproductive and sexual health services. DFID funding of the Essential Medicines programme (2000-06) aimed to improve the availability and rational use of essential medicines by strengthening procurement and distribution systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1981W.3/2">DFID is currently supporting the development of a Sustainable Distribution System for Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) for Malaria Prevention. The programme, which has a total allocated budget of &pound;8.6 million, started in 2005 and is due to run until 2010. It builds upon the lessons learnt as a result of a pilot Malaria Prevention and Treatment project. DFID recently agreed a new five-year programme of support to the Ministry of Health for &pound;3.7 million per annum. In 2006, DFID also signed a five-year &pound;215 million programme of direct support to the budget of the Government of Mozambique, which helps provide additional funding for health systems. The total amount of bilateral DFID expenditure in the health sector in Mozambique is shown in the following table. This includes a notional proportion of DFID's general budget support.</p>

	<p pid="a.1982W.2/1">It is for national governments to decide their own policies in relation to user fees in health. However, because of our own UK experience and that of developing countries, DFID is committed to helping countries that want to remove charges at the point of delivery. The recent White Paper commits DFID to help partner governments abolish user fees for basic health services and help them tackle other barriers to access, including discrimination against women.</p>
	<p pid="a.1982W.2/2">DFID is working with the Government of China to facilitate the provision of free (or substantially subsidised by the Government) primary health care. China is formulating a major health policy to address inequity in the health system, of which free primary health care for all is likely to be an important feature. Meanwhile various health insurance programmes for urban and rural residents will be improved to provide better financial risk protection and reduce out-of-pocket payments on in-patient services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1982W.2/3">DFID has supported China on rural and urban health and health policy capacity building since 1999. Our large and well designed pilots have provided evidence to Chinese policy makers on rural and urban health reform, which is now being used to inform the development of the new policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1982W.2/4">In Mozambique, services are already formally free for Malaria, TB, HIV treatment, maternal health services and immunisation for children. The Government of Mozambique has already made a public commitment to look at the case for removing fees, at least for primary health care. DFID is now working closely with the Government of Mozambique to consider the practical implications of removing the remaining user fees. This includes: studying the expected implications for demand; considering how systems will need to be reinforced to support the change; and preventing illegal charging. If the Government of Mozambique makes a decision to abolish more fees, DFID will support this, including through our continued financial support to the sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.1983W.2/1">DFID is committed to ensuring that its resources are used only for the purposes intended. The Department's Anti-Fraud and Corruption Policy aims to ensure that resources lost through misappropriation are minimised, and that appropriate action is taken to recover such funds. A specialist Fraud Response Unit within DFID's internal audit function coordinates DFID's response to allegations of fraud and corruption, and provides support to management to strengthen systems and processes to prevent or detect future losses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1983W.2/2">Where a loss relates to activities which are being managed on DFID's behalf by an NGO, an international organisation or a similar partner with whom DFID has an ongoing relationship, the partner concerned will usually be required to absorb the loss and to complete delivery of the agreed development goals without additional DFID funding. Before agreeing to this course of action, DFID will first require adequate assurance that the weaknesses in the partner's systems which allowed the losses to occur have been addressed. In other cases, the Department's practice is normally to seek the repayment of the monies which have been misappropriated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1983W.2/3">Where DFID cannot obtain the necessary assurance that a partner's arrangements for preventing fraud and corruption have been strengthened, and hence that UK taxpayers' monies will be properly safeguarded, future funding may be withheld or the relationship with the partner may be terminated.</p>

This includes instances where there has been full or partial repayment to DFID of misappropriated funds, those where the partner organisation managing the activities on DFID's behalf has absorbed the losses itself, and those where no recovery could be achieved.</p>

	<p pid="a.1985W.8/1">The Tanzanian Government established the Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC) in 1993 to reform and privatise loss-making public entities (including ports, railways and airlines). At the time, there were approximately 400 such entities, costing the Government US $100 million annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.1985W.8/2">At the request of the Government of Tanzania, DFID provided a total of &pound;7.1 million to the PSRC to support the divestiture of publicly-owned companies in Tanzania between 1992 and the end of our programme of support in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1985W.8/3">DFID's support helped to ensure that the privatisation process was implemented in a fair and transparent manner and that regulatory bodies were established to ensure privatised entities worked for the benefit of Tanzania. The assistance provided was used for the purposes of contracting advisory support for:</p>
	<p pid="a.1985W.8/4" class="indent">management of the privatisation process</p>
	<p pid="a.1985W.8/5" class="indent">broadening of share ownership&mdash;to afford Tanzanians greater opportunities to own shares in privatised entities</p>
	<p pid="a.1985W.8/6" class="indent">amendments to relevant enabling legislation and regulations, and supporting the development of suitable local regulatory capacity</p>
	<p pid="a.1985W.8/7">Different companies were awarded contracts. All work was procured under prevailing Tanzanian Government procurement regulations. The grants provided were for:</p>
	<p pid="a.1985W.8/8" class="indent">Technical Assistance&mdash;total value of &pound;6.1 million (from 1992-2007)</p>
	<p pid="a.1985W.8/9" class="indent">Development support&mdash;total value of &pound;1 million (from 2003-07)</p>

	<p pid="a.1992W.2/2">NATO Defence Ministers discussed a range of issues including the continuing transformation of NATO's capabilities, missile defence, and operational commitments in Afghanistan and Kosovo. Force planning issues were discussed at the annual meeting of the Defence Planning Committee in Defence Ministers' Session, and nuclear planning issues at the Nuclear Planning Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1992W.2/3">In addition, Afghanistan's Defence Minister, Abdul Rahim Wardak attended a special session of the North Atlantic Council together with the non-NATO nations contributing to the International Security Assistance Force. Allies underlined their commitment to the mission in Afghanistan, noted the progress that has already been made, and stressed the importance of Afghan ownership of security issues. The Council noted that the UN had been given a wider remit in the current Security Council Resolution and supported the efforts of the UN to maximise its impact and to expand its presence in the provinces of Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1992W.2/4">The Council also condemned the Taliban practice of deliberately endangering the civilian population of Afghanistan and underlined NATO's commitment to avoiding civilian casualties.</p>

	<p pid="a.1995W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1995W.2/4" class="indent">You asked whether Ofsted would ensure that young people with experience of care are involved in its inspection of care homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1995W.2/5" class="indent">Ofsted involves young people by seeking their views during inspection and through highly focused surveys and consultation exercises. Seeking the views of young people is part of the statutory duties of the new Ofsted and developing this further is explicitly outlined in our new Strategic Plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1995W.2/6" class="indent">Following the expansion of our remit in April this year, Ofsted is working hard to bring together the very best from all four predecessor organisations. At this stage, we are focusing on creating a high quality inspection programme across our expanded remit. We are also looking to incorporate the changes made to the National Minimum Standards and develop this work further over the next few years. This development work will include a range and choice of different methods for all children in inspected services to feed in their views about inspection outcomes.</p>

In 2003, a payment was made by the Department to a teacher assigned to the European Schools system in respect of the threshold pay that would have been paid had the teacher remained employed in maintained schools in England and Wales. The amount paid was &pound;2,001. This answer has been provided on the assumption that it relates to payments to serving teachers.

	<p pid="a.2002W.6/1">The Department is implementing the 'Every Child a Reader' (ECAR) programme. We are in the third year of a three-year pilot which is helping over 5,000 six-year-olds with significant literacy difficulties to learn to read. It does this by placing highly skilled reading recovery teachers in schools to provide intensive one-to-one or small group support to children most in need.</p>
	<p pid="a.2002W.6/2">As a result, we have announced that ECAR will be rolled out nationally from 2008-09, benefiting 30,000 children a year by 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.2002W.6/3">In mathematics, intervention 'Springboard materials' have been used for a number of years to support those children who have been identified as working just below age-related expectations and who, with support, might catch-up with their peers. Although they are more often used in group work, they can be used on a one-to-one basis. Wave three intervention materials have more often been used for individuals as well as small groups. Both these materials offer teachers a tracking chart to audit the child's attainment and to identify where to pitch the support.</p>
	<p pid="a.2002W.6/4">The Department is also currently providing funding for reading mentors. We provide funding to Volunteer Reading Help (VRH); a charitable organisation which recruits, trains and places volunteers to give one-to-one help twice a week to children aged 6 to 11-years who find reading a challenge. Currently VRH has around 2,000 volunteer readers working with around 5,000 children.</p>

	<p pid="a.2008W.2/1">We do not classify foundation degrees as public or private sector because students are recorded according to subjects studied and many courses would apply to the public, private and third sectors. Foundation degrees graduates are, however, well-represented in education, and subjects allied to medicine (which together amount to around 35 per cent. of all FD graduates) where the employment opportunities are largely in the public sector, and around a third of all FD courses currently running are in the areas of education, health and care, community or public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.2008W.2/2">Employer involvement is an essential feature of all foundation degree programmes. Employers can be involved in the design, delivery and regular review of programmes. It is also expected that there will be recognition from employer bodies such as sector skills councils and professional bodies as well as close collaboration between employer and provider institutions&mdash;to ensure foundation degrees are responsive to meeting the nation's skill needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.2015W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-13">13 June 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.2015W.5/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.2015W.5/4" class="indent">You asked what the evidential basis was for the statements made by Ofsted in its report, &quot;Time for Change? Personal, Social and Health Education (HMI 070049)&quot;, that (A) research suggests that education that promotes abstinence, but withholds information about contraception, can place young people at higher risk; and (B) school nurses are providing a valuable service by offering emergency hormonal contraception to pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.2015W.5/5" class="indent">Our report states that 'there is no evidence, however, that 'abstinence-only' education reduces teenage pregnancy or improves sexual health. There is also no evidence to support claims that teaching about contraception leads to increased sexual activity. Research suggests that education and strategies that promote abstinence but withhold information about contraception can place young people at a higher risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).' There has been widespread international research in this area, including three pieces of research completed by the National Children's Bureau:</p>
	<p pid="a.2015W.5/6" class="indent">1. Blake, S and Frances, G (2001) Just Say No to Abstinence Education. London</p>
	<p pid="a.2015W.5/7" class="indent">2. Abstinence-only Education, Sex Education Forum, briefing May 2004</p>
	<p pid="a.2015W.5/8" class="indent">3. Swann, C., Bowe, K. MCCormick, G. and Kosmin, M. (2003) Teenage Pregnancy and parenthood: a review of reviews. Evidence briefing. London: Health development Agency. <a href="http://www.hda.nhs.uk/evidence">www.hda.nhs.uk/evidence</a></p>
	<p pid="a.2015W.5/9" class="indent">We found this research persuasive because it reflected our discussions with pupils in 350 inspections who said they valued clear sex and relationship education in school.</p>
	<p pid="a.2015W.5/10" class="indent">Our report states that 'school nurses can also provide a valuable service, particularly in terms of providing emergency hormonal contraception and advising on other forms of contraception'. This is in line with non-statutory guidance published by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES). The DfES publication &quot;Teenage Pregnancy Next Steps: Guidance for Local Authorities and Primary Care Trusts on Effective Delivery of Local Strategies&quot; (2006) sets out the key findings from 'deep dive' reviews carried out by the Teenage Pregnancy Unit to identify factors responsible for the significant variation in performance between local areas, including between areas that are statistically similar. The guidance states:</p>
	<p pid="a.2015W.5/11" class="indent">'Provision of young people focused contraception/sexual health services, trusted by teenagers and well known by professionals working with them.' This was the factor most commonly cited as having the biggest impact on conception rate reductions in the high performing areas. Features of successful services reflected the &quot;Best practice guidance on the provision of effective contraception and advice services for young people&quot; issued by the Teenage Pregnancy Unit in 2000: easy accessibility in the right location with opening hours convenient to young people; provision of the full range of contraceptive methods, including long acting methods; a strong focus on sexual health promotion (as well as reactive services) through, for example, outreach work in schools, work with professionals to improve their ability to engage with young people on sexual health issues; and through highly visible publicity. Effective services also had a strong focus on meeting the specific needs of young men. All high-performing areas also had condom distribution schemes involving a wide range of local agencies and/or access to emergency contraception in non-clinical settings.</p>
	<p pid="a.2015W.5/12" class="indent">Ofsted's own discussions with young people suggest they want and trust services in schools and welcome and recognise the commitment that schools show to meeting their wider health needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.2018W.6/14">The revenue per pupil figures shown in the table below are taken from the new dedicated schools grant (DSG) and are in cash terms. They are not comparable with those for the years 1997-98 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.

EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's local government finance settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable. An alternative time series is currently under development.</p>

It is distributed to local authorities by formula which includes the number of EAL pupils in each LA. For this year, Somerset LA will receive an EMAG totalling &pound;37,585, with locally determined formulae devolving at least 85 per cent. of this to schools. The grant is worth &pound;179 million nationally in 2007-08.</p>

Support of a one-to-one type is more often undertaken by a teaching assistant who, working with the teacher, would identify the specific learning needs of the child. This one-to-one support is a mix of in-class support and out of class focused work.</p>
	<p pid="a.2026W.0/2">There are no specific qualifications that support staff acting as learning mentors in schools are required to have. It is for individual head teachers to assess and decide whether staff have the necessary skills and experience to carry out the role and whether they need to access the range of training and support opportunities that exist for support staff acting as mentors.</p>

	<p pid="a.2031W.0/2">Allocations currently include capital support for new pupil places which takes account of local authority forecasts of pupil growth.

	<p pid="a.2039W.2/2">Graduates earn considerably more than non-graduates. Over their working life, the average graduate will earn comfortably over &pound;100,000 more in today's valuation, than a similar individual who just had A-levels. The benefits of a degree are not just financial: holders of HE qualifications are about half as likely to be unemployed as non-graduates and graduates tend to live longer and be healthier than non-graduates.</p>
	<p pid="a.2039W.2/3">The repayments on student loans vary according to the income of the individual borrower. Based on projected lifetime earnings for all graduates, the average time taken by individuals entering HE in 2006/07 who will fully repay their student loans is estimated to be around 13 years.</p>

Secondly, from August 2006, &quot;Train to Gain&quot; was rolled out nationally. It is a new service to help businesses get the training they need to succeed including offering free training for low skilled employees. It offers employers impartial advice and easy access to quality training, matching training needs with training providers and ensuring that training is delivered to meet employers' needs. In its first year it has engaged more than 40,000 employers and over 150,000 learners in learning.</p>

	<p pid="a.2044W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="0157-06-14">14 June 157</phrase> employers made the Skills Pledge, which was launched by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and Sir Digby Jones, the UK Skills Envoy. Thus far more than 1.7 million employees, of which around 1.1 million are public sector and over a 1,000 from the third sector, are covered by the commitment of these employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.2044W.0/2">It is not possible to provide a detailed breakdown of the proportion of employees who will undertake their first full level 2 as each company will be working with the Learning and Skills Council to understand their skills gap and how best to meet that need. We expect that for some companies the gap may translate into higher level skills, as well as supporting those employees to gain basics skills, such as literacy and numeracy. All of these companies have access to the advice and guidance of independent skills brokers, should they need one. For companies with more than 5,000 employees they receive a similar service through the National Employer Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.2044W.0/3">Information on which of these companies hold a contract with Government agencies is not held centrally.</p>

Decisions on relocation and reorganisation of the school estate are also made locally, and the Department does not generally receive information on such changes. However, exceptionally Newcastle local authority have been granted additional funding for this off-site decant (&pound;900k), by the Department, after presenting a case based on health and safety concerns. This school is to be rebuilt as part of the 'Building Schools for the Future' Programme. I understand, from an update report published by Newcastle city council, that this decant will take place over Christmas 2007. I have received no information from the Highways Agency.</p>

	<p pid="a.2049W.14/1">In December, 2006, the Government published &quot;Partnership in Public Services: An action plan for third sector involvement&quot;. The plan notes that third sector organisations are particularly effective in delivering services where the high levels of public trust, confidence and affection they enjoy are most important. From enabling patient self-care to engaging parents in their children's education, third sector organisations' strengths often lie in developing services that empower people and which are tailored to their needs. In addition, third sector organisations play a highly effective role as a catalyst for service improvement. However, the plan also notes that there is variation in the performance of different organisations across all sectors and that opportunities should be open to all without bias to one sector.</p>

VE assess the effectiveness of the week by analysing media coverage and data collected via a questionnaire given to those who participated in the week.

	<p pid="a.2050W.2/2">The Government are committed to working with local government to enable the third sector to make an effective contribution to better public services. One mechanism for this is through the Compact. 99 per cent. of local authorities have local compacts in place or under development with the third sector. These provide the basis for partnership working within the sector and support local area agreements by setting out priorities for improving public services in local areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.2050W.2/3">Third sector organisations still face barriers to delivery of public services. However, the Office of the Third Sector (OTS) and Communities and Local Government are taking steps to address these barriers through OTS action plan: &quot;Partnership in Public Services&quot;. This includes a programme to train 2000 of the most significant public sector commissioners, many of whom will be drawn from local authorities.</p>

Owing to these developments, our reform programme and the fact that 10 years of economic prosperity, we have been able to treble the health budget in cash terms between 1996-97 and 2007-08. This has allowed us to employ over 79,000 more nurses and over 36,000 more doctors, to significantly reduce waiting lists (the average wait for inpatient treatment is now 6.4 weeks) and to regenerate the NHS estate (with 150 new hospitals open, under construction or in procurement).</p>

How Trading Standards undertake market surveillance with regard to the safety legislation they enforce is a matter for them. I understand Trading Standards liaises with HM Revenue and Customs on furniture imports as appropriate, and that this has resulted in furniture being detained and convictions obtained for non-compliance with the Furniture and Furnishings (Fire) (Safety) Regulations 1988 (FFRs). They also act on tip-offs regarding unsafe furniture being sold door-to-door, at boot sales or at the side of the road, and make routine checks of furniture in retail outlets.

Officials from the UK Mission to the IAEA in Vienna have met several times with the agency's personnel division to discuss their recruitment practices. The IAEA's personnel systems, including their recruitment section, are subject to oversight by the agency's external auditors, the latter are appointed by members of the IAEA board of governors of which the UK is a permanent member. In addition the IAEA division of management publishes a biennial report on human resource management, which is issued to IAEA member states. The Government believe this is an acceptable level of scrutiny for such an organisation and are therefore satisfied that the recruitment policy of the IAEA is fair and transparent.</p>

	<p pid="a.2078W.11/1">The Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB) completed a comprehensive survey of less lethal technologies in 2001. That survey, and the work that followed, resulted in the introduction of conducted energy devices to England and Wales in the form of the Taser M26 in 2003 and the Taser X26 in 2005. Kinetic energy devices were introduced to the United Kingdom in the form of the L21A1 baton round system in 2002. The L21A1 system was replaced by the L60A1 Attenuating Energy Projectile system in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.2078W.11/2">HOSDB has since been tasked with assessing promising commercial off-the-shelf products against the Association of Chief Police Officers' operational requirement as they become available. Additionally the UK Steering Group on Alternative Policing Approaches Towards the Management of Conflict has put in place a programme to develop a Discriminating Irritant Projectile (DIP) that will provide police with a round that will produce a discriminating cloud of irritant at distances of up to 40 metres.</p>

	<p pid="a.2093W.6/1">We share the view of the Commission and most other member states, that it would be too difficult and costly for organic producers to apply a GM threshold significantly lower than 0.9 per cent. It would imply, for example, that the organic supply chain would need to undertake widespread testing where products were liable to have an unintended GM presence. Such testing is expensive and time-consuming. During discussions, organic stakeholder groups indicated that they did not favour including a threshold below 0.9 per cent. in the EU organic production regulation.</p>

	<p pid="a.2093W.12/3">The framework places a duty on local authorities in England to identify contaminated land in their area, and to ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken. Where land has been identified as 'contaminated land', the local authority will seek the person who caused or knowingly permitted the presence of the substances causing the problem to carry out any necessary remedial works. Where this person cannot be found, for example because a company is no longer in existence, the landowner may be the appropriate person, subject to detailed rules in the Act and the accompanying guidance (DEFRA Circular 01/2006).</p>
	<p pid="a.2093W.12/4">The regime allows for voluntary remediation, and also for the authority to carry out remediation on behalf of those considered liable, allowing the authority to recover the cost. As a last resort, the authority can serve a remediation notice requiring work to be done, subject to the usual right of appeal. The regime also recognises that remediation can also be secured through the planning system in appropriate cases.</p>

We have not spent on R&amp;D in this area since then. However, the main expenditure on deep geological disposal R&amp;D during these periods has been by United Kingdom Nirex Limited (Nirex). The Government owned Nirex from April 2005 until November 2006, when it became part of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). This is funded by Government through the Department of Trade and Industry and, partially, through its commercial activities. During the period of Government ownership of Nirex, the company was largely funded by the NDA, with a small additional percentage coming from the Ministry of Defence (MOD).</p>

Prior to April 2005, Nirex R&amp;D activities were funded by its nuclear industry shareholders and the MOD.</p>

	<p pid="a.2096W.2/1">The recently published Waste Strategy 2007 put forward a range of measures to reduce waste arisings and build on recent improvements in recycling. A greater focus on waste prevention has been recognised through a new target to reduce the amount of household waste not re-used, recycled or composted, from over 22.2 million tonnes in 2000 by 29 per cent. to 15.8 million tonnes in 2010, with an aspiration to reduce it to 12.2 million tonnes in 2020&mdash;a reduction of 45 per cent. This is equivalent to a fall of 50 per cent. per person (from 450 kg per person in 2000 to 225 kg in 2020).</p>
	<p pid="a.2096W.2/2">Waste minimisation is not directly measured by any of the Best Value Performance Indicators (BVPI). However, it is reflected in BVPI 84a, which measures kilograms of household waste collected per head of population. In addition, household waste sent for reuse, including items such as furniture delivered to civic amenity sites, would be excluded from the calculation of BVPI 82.</p>
	<p pid="a.2096W.2/3">In October 2006, the Government published the local government White Paper, &quot;Strong and Prosperous Communities&quot;. This set out a new vision for delivering better public services through a rebalancing of the relationship between central Government, local government and local people. Local public service providers will be given more freedom to bring about the changes they want to see. The White Paper sets out a radical simplification of the local authority performance framework including fewer indicators and centrally set targets. This means that 2007-08 will be the final year of best value indicators and targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.2096W.2/4">Indicators in the new framework will reflect national outcomes, to be agreed later this year in the comprehensive spending review 2007, which will be delivered through local area agreements. The future framework will enable local authorities to contribute to an overall waste outcome that leads us towards more sustainable management of waste in England, focused on minimising the amounts of municipal waste produced and landfilled.</p>

	<p pid="a.2097W.0/1">The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP) was established in 2003 in response to the world summit on sustainable development. REEEP has been recognised by the G8 in the outcomes of Gleneagles, St Petersburg and Heiligendamm as a key delivery vehicle for accelerating the uptake of renewables and energy efficiency in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.2097W.0/2">REEEP has over 200 partners, including over 35 governments and a global network of eight secretariats based in leading energy organisations around the world. It has also developed strong links with the private sector, academia and international bodies such as the World Bank, UN agencies and the International Energy Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.2097W.0/3">DEFRA provides funding to REEEP of &pound;2.5 million each year for 2005-08. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) provided funding of &pound;1 million each year for 2004-06. Several governments, notably the US, Australia, a number of EU states and Norway now also provide funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.2097W.0/4">REEEP is well positioned to support future action on climate change and is already beginning to scale up and replicate its successful interventions. As the partnership develops it is now able to engage more strategically with key government, international bodies and the private sector in support of UK energy and climate objectives, and act as a platform for international co-operation on these issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.2098W.5/1">Since the UK and the anti-whaling bloc had a simple majority at this year's meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), we were able to sponsor and secure several key resolutions: calling on Japan to halt its lethal &quot;scientific&quot; research programme; promoting the non-lethal use of cetaceans; and reaffirming the continued need for the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling. This last resolution subsequently served us well in the Conference of Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, enabling us to defeat proposals aimed at eventually allowing trade in whale products to take place.</p>

	<p pid="a.2111W.5/1">The Department does not allocate funds specifically for dial-a-ride type services.</p>
	<p pid="a.2111W.5/2">The majority of support for local bus services, some &pound;350 million a year outside London, is provided by local authorities using the Government's revenue support grant (RSG). As well as conventional bus services, RSG is used by local authorities to support dial-a-ride type services or other demand responsive transport (DRT). Decisions on which services to support are a matter for individual authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.2111W.5/3">The Department also provides support for rural bus services through rural bus subsidy grant (RBSG). The grant to local authorities in England&mdash;&pound;55.6 million in 2007-08&mdash;can also be used to support DRT type services.</p>
	<p pid="a.2111W.5/4">Several DRT services benefited from the department's rural and urban bus challenge programme between 1998 and 2003. In total the challenge provided &pound;160 million to over 400 schemes around the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.2111W.5/5">We have also changed the bus route registration rules to encourage flexibly routed, demand responsive bus services and made these services eligible for bus service operators grant (BSOG) from the Department. Community transport organisations are a major provider of dial-a-ride and DRT services and many receive funding through BSOG.</p>

	<p pid="a.2130W.2/1">Out of a total &pound;2.83 billion allocated to run prisons during 2006-07 (excluding healthcare and education funding), &pound;77.3 million was provided for custodial drug treatment. This equates to 2.73 per cent. of the total allocation.</p>

	<p pid="a.2130W.2/13" class="italic"> Prison Drug Treatment</p>
	<p pid="a.2130W.2/14">Around 55 per cent. of those received into custody are problem drug-users (PDUs)&mdash;with some local prisons reporting up to 80 per cent. testing positive for Class A drugs on reception. This means around 70,000 PDUs enter custody each year&mdash;with 40,000 being present at any one time.</p>
	<p pid="a.2130W.2/15">Addressing drug-misuse is a priority for the MoJ&mdash;and NOMS has in place a comprehensive drug strategy, the three key elements of which focus on: (i) supply reduction, (ii) demand reduction (through effective treatment) and (iii) building effective through-care arrangements (particularly through prisons' engagement in the HO-led drug interventions programme (DIP)) so timely continuity of treatment can be maintained as PDUs move respectively between custody and the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.2130W.2/16">Drug 'treatment' in custody goes much wider than the 116 drug rehabilitation programmes running across the estate and includes: (i) clinical services (maintenance-prescribing and/or detoxification programmes) that are available in all local and remand prisons; and (ii) CARATs (Counselling, Assessment, Referral, Advice and Through-care services) that are provided in all prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.2130W.2/17" class="italic"> Spending on prisons</p>
	<p pid="a.2130W.2/18">The total spending on prisons in 2006-07 was &pound;2.83 billion. This figure is a provisional outturn and subject to audit. It includes HMPS, private prisons, and prison related-services managed in NOMS HQ. It does not include expenditure on education or health met by the DFES or DoH.</p>
	<p pid="a.2130W.2/19">Spending on Prisons has increased in real terms by 36 per cent. since 1996-97 (to 2006-07). Real terms means adjusted for inflation to 2005-06 levels using the Treasury deflator.</p>
	<p pid="a.2130W.2/20">For the purpose of this PQ, the total &pound;2.83 billion figure cited for running prisons has been based on the funding allocated to run prisons operationally&mdash;primarily on security, safety, decency and health, maintaining their fabric and providing prison officers to deliver/oversee services for prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.2130W.2/21" class="italic"> Prison drug treatment funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.2130W.2/22">While it is true that the level of funding allocated to drug treatment is only a small proportion of the overall prisons budget, this needs to be seen in context. A significant proportion of the prisons budget is spent on infrastructure and staffing&mdash;essential to keep prisons safe and to protect the public. It is however, better to compare expenditure on drug treatment against actual treatment need. With funding levels up 997 per cent. since 1996-97 and overall numbers engaged in prison treatment increasing year on year, prisons are doing much to close the treatment gap. The calculations are based on additional drug treatment funding allocated as a result of successive spending reviews. The figure approximates to &pound;7 million but it is not possible to breakdown between various treatment types. The pre-CSR baseline has therefore been excluded from the calculations.</p>
	<p pid="a.2130W.2/23" class="italic"> Integrated Drug Treatment System (IDTS)</p>
	<p pid="a.2130W.2/24">The integrated drug treatment system (IDTS) is designed to boost the quality and increase the volume of drug treatment with a particular focus on drug users during their first 28 days in custody. By March 2008 full IDTS (enhanced clinical services and psychosocial support i.e. CARATS) will be available in 17 prisons; additionally enhanced clinical services will also be available in a further 35 establishments. Collectively, NOMS/DH funding for delivery of IDTS during 2007-08 stands at &pound;18.7 million. This is expected to see around 24,500 drug users benefiting annually from enhanced clinical services.</p>
	<p pid="a.2130W.2/25">So far as IDTS is concerned, the Department of Health and NOMS have had to make challenging decisions in reviewing the totality of budgets in recent years. Current levels of funding are down significantly on planned expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.2130W.2/26" class="italic"> Treatment gap</p>
	<p pid="a.2130W.2/27">More work is needed to identify the gaps in treatment provision. Historically, local assessment and epidemiological studies have informed treatment delivery across the prison estate. Work is already underway on a needs analysis model but, ahead of its data being available later this year, NOMS already anticipates there being a significant treatment gap. For example, to identify offenders' drug needs effectively, the CARAT service would need to undertake substance-misuse triage assessments for up to 80 per cent. of the annual prison through-put; based on 136,000 offenders passing through custody, this would be around 108,000 offenders. As currently resourced, CARAT teams only deliver around 75,000 assessments&mdash;a potential shortfall of 33,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.2141W.2/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles statistics of inactivity from the annual local area Labour Force Survey LFS and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation Definitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.2/5" class="indent">The attached table shows the number of economically inactive persons, aged 16 to 24, resident in the West Lancashire constituency, from the annual local area LFS for the 12-month periods ending in February from 1997 to 2004 and from the APS for the 12-month periods ending in March from 2005 to 2006, These numbers are also expressed as a percentage of the total population in that age group.</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.2/6" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in a small geographical area, they are based on very small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.

	<p pid="a.2141W.5/1">The Treasury undertakes and commissions a wide range of evaluations. Most recently, the Children and Young People's Review conducted an extensive examination of the existing literature on spending on early intervention activity and preventative support, consulting practitioners, academics and commissioners of services. The review's public Call for Evidence attracted more than a 100 responses, details can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/spending_review/spend_csr07/reviews/cyp_review/cypreview_index.cfm">http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/spending_review/spend_csr07/reviews/cyp_review/cypreview_index.cfm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/3">The conclusions of this evidence and analysis were set out in &quot;Aiming High for Children: Supporting Families&quot; and &quot;Aiming High for Disabled Children: Better Support for Families&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/4">&quot;Aiming High for Children: Supporting Families&quot; highlights evidence from the United States that prevention and early intervention can represent a cost-effective response by public services. The conclusions of the review place a new emphasis on building children's resilience through improving attainment in education, good social and emotional skills and positive parenting. This analysis will be supported by significant investment over the next spending period in universal services, such as schools, health services and Sure Start children's centres. These all have a crucial role to play in focusing support on prevention and early intervention. New investment includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/5" class="indent">&pound;340 million additional funding for Sure Start children's centres, child care and early years by 2010-11;</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/6" class="indent">building on the Every Child a Reader scheme to help narrow attainment gaps by providing an average of 10 hours, one to one teacher-led tuition for 300,000 under-attaining pupils a year in English and 300,000 in Maths by 2010-11;</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/7" class="indent">funding so that by 2010-11 schools can offer two hours of free extended activities a week during term time, with two weeks a year of part-time holiday provision for children eligible for free school meals;</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/8" class="indent">faster roll-out to all schools of the successful Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning programme;</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/9" class="indent">intensive support for up to 30,000 parents who most need parenting support, focusing in particular on fathers; and</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/10" class="indent">a commitment from the Department of Health to examine how health services can best support parents and families in the early years of children's lives, by expanding the scope and duration of the current health-led parenting pilots, subject to the Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/11">&quot;Aiming High for Disabled Children: Better Support for Families&quot; acknowledged that despite an improvement in the outcomes for disabled children, they are less likely to achieve as much in a range of areas as their non-disabled peers. This report sets out policy proposals to encourage more responsive services and early interventions for disabled children and their families, across social services and health to enhance equality and opportunity for disabled children and their families. Improving their educational, social emotional development, and their opportunities for independent living, choice and control, is a key part of this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/12">This report announced the following provision:</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/13" class="indent">&pound;280 million over the next three years to fund short breaks for disabled children, meaning an extra 40,000 fortnightly short breaks for severely disabled children and their families to help prevent family breakdown;</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/14" class="indent">&pound;35 million to fund a pilot project to provide accessible child care, promote training, and tackle other barriers to accessing child care;</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/15" class="indent">&pound;19 million for a Transition Support Programme to promote wrap around support, and consolidate person-centred planning at the critical transition to adulthood. This builds on the Government's commitment to roll-out the successful Early Support Programme which provides intensive, co-ordinated support early in a disabled child's life;</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/16" class="indent">radical reform in the co-ordination and provision of community equipment and wheelchairs to maximise disabled children's mobility;</p>
	<p pid="a.2141W.5/17" class="indent">development of a national indicator as part of the suite of public service agreement targets, underpinned by a 'core offer' to help disabled young people and their parents understand what support they can get and how to access it across local services; and</p>

This guidance covers all aspects of a lymphoma patient pathway, including providing supportive care in both a home and community setting.

	<p pid="a.2147W.8/1">None. The Human Tissue Act 2004 was passed following a considerable amount of parliamentary debate as well as extensive consultation and discussion with a wide range of stakeholders including healthcare professionals, academics and researchers, families affected by organ retention, members of the general public as well as other Government Departments and the devolved administrations. It provides a sound regulatory framework that supports research activities, including tissue banking, while maintaining the confidence of both professionals and the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.2148W.2/1">The Department does not routinely collect data on the, number, location and clinical use of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning and therefore cannot make an assessment of the additional funding made available for lymphoma patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.2148W.2/2">However, 'The National Framework for the Development of PET-CT Services in England' published in 2005 estimated that 15,000 scans were needed for diagnosis and treatment of patients with lymphoma. A National Audit database is currently being developed by the United Kingdom PET-CT Advisory Board. In the future, this database will help to monitor the number of scans recommended against estimates of needs for conditions such as lymphoma.</p>
	<p pid="a.2148W.2/3">Annex C (pages 24-27) of the national framework identifies the PET-CT facilities in England in 2005. A copy of the national framework is available in the Library. In addition, the National Clinical Research Institute (NCRI) also published A 'Framework for PET Research in the UK' in March 2007 and Appendix IX of this report identified the location of current facilities for PET scanning within the national health service only.

This should help promote clinically appropriate care for patients while reducing workload for dentists. It will take time to build up detailed evidence on the impact on patient care and on dental workload and expenses.

	<p pid="a.2152W.5/1">Under the new contractual arrangements introduced from April 2006, dentists are no longer paid on the basis of separate fees for individual treatments. Dentists or dental practices instead have an agreed annual contract value, paid in monthly instalments, in return for which they carry out an agreed volume of dental services over the course of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.2152W.5/2">These annual service levels are defined primarily in terms of the courses of treatment provided for national health service patients, but with courses of treatment categorised into three main bands and with different weightings to reflect the relative complexity of these bands. There are separate, though similar, arrangements for defining annual service levels for specialist dental services such as orthodontics. Within the overall contract value, primary care trusts (PCTs) and practices may also arrange for the provision of other services that are not measured through courses of treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.2152W.5/3">A course of treatment which consists of an examination, diagnosis, e.g. x-rays and oral health advice, and a scale and polish if needed, is recorded as a band 1 treatment. This equates to one unit of dental activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.2152W.5/4">A course of treatment which includes band 1 items together with additional treatment such as fillings, root canal work or extractions, is recorded as a band 2 treatment. This equates to three units of dental activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.2152W.5/5">A course of treatment which includes band 1 and 2 items together with more complex procedures such as crowns, dentures or bridges is recorded as a band 3 treatment. This equates to12 units of dental activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.2152W.5/6">There are additional arrangements for urgent courses of treatment and for certain other categories of treatment such as the issue of prescriptions.</p>
	<p pid="a.2152W.5/7">The relationship between annual contract values and annual service levels, expressed in terms of units of dental activity, varies between contracts. For dentists or dental practices, who had previously provided services under the old general dental services arrangements, the calculation of annual contract values and annual service levels was based on an assessment of overall NHS earnings and corresponding courses of treatment during a 12-month reference period before the start of the reforms. The resulting variations in contract prices reflect, in turn, historic differences in treatment patterns and patients' oral health needs. Subject to these transitional protections, the calculation of annual contract values and corresponding service levels is a matter for agreement locally between primary care trusts and dentists or dental practices.</p>

	<p pid="a.2154W.2/1">Primary care trusts (PCTs) assumed full responsibility for local commissioning of primary care dentistry and received devolved budgets with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. A table listing the primary dental service resource allocations for 2006-07 for all PCTs in England as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July 2006</phrase> is available in the Library. PCTs determine the distribution of resources within their areas. A breakdown of the primary dental service resource allocations by constituency areas is not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Full year data on expenditure by PCTs on primary dental care in 2006-07 is not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="a.2154W.2/2">Prior to April 2006, most primary dental services were provided under former general dental service (GDS) arrangements. These were demand led services where the pattern of dental expenditure was largely determined by where dentists chose to practice, and how much national health service work they chose to undertake. PCTs were not given fixed GDS funding allocations. In a number of areas, personal dental services (PDS) pilots were also established, where some former GDS dental practices and some directly managed dental services converted to locally commissioned arrangements to test new ways of working and new forms of contract remuneration. PDS pilots were funded by PCTs from supplementary allocations issued by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.2154W.2/3">The following table shows the available data on expenditure on the former GDS and PDS services for the constituency of St. Albans for 2004-05 and 2005-06. The difference between gross and net expenditure is the contribution to costs from dental charges collected directly from patients.</p>

Obesity is one of the major causes of type 2 diabetes and tackling obesity, working through national and local partnerships, is a key departmental objective. The Government have a public service agreement (PSA) target, which is jointly owned by three Government Departments, to halt the year-on-year rise in obesity among children aged under 11 by 2010&mdash;in the context of a broader strategy to tackle obesity in the population as a whole. As childhood obesity often tracks into adulthood, the PSA-owning departments are working to support families to eat more healthily and be more active.</p>

	<p pid="a.2173W.0/1">The Department will introduce a new monitoring system to report the extent of abuse, based on a new national standardised method for the collection of data on referrals in England. The Department will also review the &quot;No Secrets&quot; guidance on developing and implementing multi-agency policies and procedures to protect vulnerable adults from abuse. The case for legislation will be considered as part of the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.2173W.0/2">The report, &quot;UK Study of Abuse and Neglect of Older People, Prevalence Survey Report&quot;, was commissioned jointly by the Department and Comic Relief in August 2005. A draft report of the findings of the prevalence survey was submitted at the end of March 2007. Independent peer reviews were commissioned at the beginning of April 2007 and received at the end of April. The final draft of the prevalence survey report was received on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-17">17 May 2007</phrase> and published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-14">14 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.2173W.0/3">The research, which was produced by the Institute of Gerontology, Kings College, London and the National Centre for Social Research, involved a feasibility study of the ethical and methodological issues that would be faced by extending the work to residential care homes. This is the last stage of the commissioned study and is due to be submitted to the Department in mid July. This will enable the Department to assess if, and how, it may be possible to commission further research with residential care populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.2173W.0/4">The prevalence survey will have included people with dementia, where they were able to give consent to be interviewed. No proxy interviews, however, were undertaken for those without the ability to consent. Research with people who have severe dementia is extremely difficult, but there are research teams working on innovative methods for involving people with cognitive impairment. The Departments research governance framework reminds researchers of the importance of working as inclusively as possible and the Mental Capacity Act 2005 provides a framework to enable those without capacity to be safely involved in research, where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.2173W.0/5">To date, the Department has received a wide range of representations on the abuse of older people. I refer the hon. Member to the answer given by my noble Friend, the Minister of State (Lord Hunt) on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-19">19 June 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 94.</p>

	<p pid="a.2174W.0/9" class="indent">'There is no consistent evidence to date that wireless fidelity (WiFi) and wireless local area networks adversely affect the health of the general population. The signals are very low power, typically 0.1 watt (100 milliwatts) in both the computer and the router (access point) and the results so far show exposures are well within internationally accepted (ICNIRP) guidelines. Based on current knowledge and experience, radio frequency (RF) exposures from WiFi are likely to be lower than those from mobile phones. Also, the frequencies used in WiFi are broadly the same as those from traditional RF applications.'</p>

	<p pid="a.2180W.2/2">Cancer registries in England participate in the Eurocare Project, which measures and explains differences in cancer survival rates across Europe. Twenty countries participate in the project covering a total population of 100 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.2180W.2/3">The latest report, EUROCARE-3, tracks patients who were diagnosed with cancer between 1990 and 1994 and followed up to 1999. It puts England in the middle ranking for survival rates, roughly below other Western European countries and above Eastern European Countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.2180W.2/4">The next report, EUROCARE-4, which is due later this year tracks patients diagnosed in 1995-2002 and followed up to 2003. We believe that the next publication of figures will show that the gap between England and other Western European countries has narrowed. Earlier reports cover cancer patients who were diagnosed between 1978 and 1985, and followed up to 1990 (EUROCARE) and those diagnosed between 1985 and 1989, and followed up to 1994 (EUROCARE-2).</p>

	<p pid="a.2184W.2/1">The national health service provides optical vouchers for children and other eligible groups who, following a sight test, have been given a prescription to correct a defect in sight. Optical vouchers can be used to purchase glasses or contact lenses. Parents of children with reading difficulties are encouraged to have an NHS-funded sight test to check that there are no refractive problems or eye disease which may be contributing to the difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.2184W.2/2">If, after a sight test (and glasses if necessary), difficulties are still being experienced then a wider assessment is called for. The best interests of children are likely to be served by a scheme of assessment and treatment, which takes into account the full range of possible ways of helping children with the symptoms associated with descriptions of Irlen syndrome. This is something that local education and health authorities should take forward in view of their responsibilities for services in their areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.2201W.2/2">All Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) staff are entitled to apply to work flexibly. The Permanent Under-Secretary is fully committed to promoting flexible working across the Department, both at home and overseas, and has recently appointed a member of the FCO Board as the FCO's first champion for flexible working. A growing number of staff at all levels, including senior managers, are working flexibly whether part-time, job sharing, working compressed hours or from home. New technology is being introduced to enable staff to work away from the office. Information on flexible working is available on the FCO intranet and a flexible working network has been established to offer support and guidance to staff working flexibly and those managing flexible workers. The FCO is a member of the working families organisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.2205W.8/1">In Dhi Qar, Muthanna and Maysan security responsibility has now all been transferred to the Iraqi authorities. Until late 2006, British police advisers were mentoring and advising police officers in Al Muthana, Dhi Qar and Maysan. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT) continue to offer support, but they are run by coalition allies rather than the UK. No UK financial resources are currently committed to support the rule of law in these provinces.</p>
	<p pid="a.2205W.8/2">In Basra, the Multinational Division (South East) Security Sector Reform team, the consulate's civilian police and prisons teams and the PRT work with the Iraqi police, prison service and judiciary to support the rule of law in Basra. Over 80 per cent. of Basra's police stations have been assessed as largely or fully capable of carrying out basic policing duties, a significant increase on the July 2006 figure. The prisons adviser is training local prison officers and advising on the recruitment of new prison officers to staff a new central prison in Basra. The PRT is building the investigative skills of judges and others involved in the judicial process. The PRT is also assisting with the design and construction of an additional courthouse for Basra.</p>
	<p pid="a.2205W.8/3">The results of the whole effort can be seen in the improvements in specialist police units, the action taken against some former police officers accused of abuse, and the building projects under way to improve the infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.2205W.8/4">The UK provides three staff to work solely on the rule of law with the Basra PRT, 31 police officers and former police officers, and one HM Prison Service officer. The broader military efforts are not included in the estimated cost of &pound;18 million for our rule of law activities in Basra for the current financial year.</p>

	<p pid="a.2208W.6/1">There are presently no plans to replace NATO's Kosovo Force with an EU mission. Following implementation of UN special envoy Ahtisaari's comprehensive proposals for Kosovo's future status, it is envisaged that NATO will provide the international military presence in Kosovo. Separately, there will be a European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) mission in the area of policing and rule of law.</p>

The EU set up the 'Temporary International Mechanism' (TIM) in 2006, which provided support directly to the Palestinian people, bypassing the Hamas led government. This has been extended for a further three months until September. The EU gave &euro;680 million to the Palestinians in 2006, more than in any previous year. &euro;200 million of this was transferred through the UK-inspired TIM. The UK has also provided &pound;15 million through the TIM. This has supported Palestinian front line health services, allowances for government workers and the operation, maintenance and repair of water, sanitation and electricity services in Gaza and the West Bank</p>

	<p pid="a.2213W.2/1">In April 2006 the then Hamas-affiliated Palestinian Interior Minister, Siad Siyam, established an Executive Force. By January 2007, the force was believed to have as many as 5,000 members, Hamas had announced its intention to increase this figure to some 12,000 and establish a 1,500 strong force in the West Bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.2213W.2/2">Hamas's military wing&mdash;known as the Izzedine al Qassam Brigades&mdash;was founded in 1992 and has been responsible for numerous attacks on Israel, including suicide bombings. The group is likely to be able to draw on thousands of men as required. Hamas militants in both forces appear well disciplined and capable of conducting mobile urban warfare, rocket and improvised explosive devices bomb attacks.</p>

	<p pid="a.2219W.2/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the Chief Executive. He will write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.2219W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty dated, <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-21">21 June 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.2219W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of state promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.2219W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what training courses were attended by Child Support Agency staff in the last three years; and what the cost was of each course to his Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.2219W.2/5" class="indent">You also asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, pursuant to the Answer of 26<sup>(th)</sup> February 2007, Official Report, column 1064W, on departmental training how much was spent on courses for staff in the Child support Agency in <i> (a)</i> stress awareness, <i> (b)</i> self development, <i> (c)</i> self awareness, <i> (d)</i> creative thinking, <i> (e)</i> curriculum vitae writing, <i> (f)</i> running staff clubs, <i> (g)</i> facilitation skills, <i> (h)</i> non-verbal behaviour, <i> (i)</i> intervention skills and <i> (j)</i> being a change agent in each of the last three years for which figures are available; and how many staff attended these courses.</p>
	<p pid="a.2219W.2/6" class="indent">The Agency's training programme is aimed at making Agency people experts in their specialist business areas in order to effectively deliver more money to more children and improve client service. The Agency offers a wide range of training programmes, including technical training, work towards professionally accredited qualifications, and personal effectiveness training, including some of the courses specified above.</p>
	<p pid="a.2219W.2/7" class="indent">This training is delivered using a number of methods, including our own Learning Resource Centre, Departmental e-learning courses that are available to all our people from their work station and accessed via the Department's Intranet, and external facilitator led training. Varying degrees of information are available for the training offered by each of these sources. Unfortunately, I am therefore unable to provide full detail of all Agency training over the last three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.2219W.2/8" class="indent">Such information as is available is set out in the attached tables.</p>
	<p pid="a.2219W.2/9" class="indent">In relation to the specific training courses you have requested details for, the number of training courses provided via the Learning Resource Centre over the past 3 years is set out in Table 1. However, the information provided is restricted to the number of variable length sessions delivered in the years specified, as information on the number of people participating in the training and the cost to the Agency of these training courses is not available in the format requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.2219W.2/10" class="indent">I am unable to price information for the number of Departmental e-learning courses undertaken by Agency people. There is no cost associated with accessing Departmental e-learning, beyond the time spent taking these courses and their initial development. The Department covered all the developmental costs of these courses and the direct cost to the Agency of each course is nil.</p>
	<p pid="a.2219W.2/11" class="indent">The number of Agency people undertaking the Department's external facilitator led course and the cost of these course is set out in Table 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.2219W.2/12" class="indent">Finally, Tables 3 and 4 set out the number of technical skills training courses attended by Agency people in the last three years. Training set out in Table 4 supports the implementation of the Agency's Operational Improvement Plan, which focuses on delivering more money to more children. Unfortunately, information the cost for each of these courses in not readily available.</p>

The volume of deductions from earnings orders/requests (DEO/Rs) decreased to 158,000 in December 2006. This sudden fall was caused by a fix to the new computer system to suspend 8,500 ineffective DEOs on cases where employers had informed the Agency that the non-resident parent on that case was no longer in their employment. These DEOs have been suspended and the Agency put together a recovery plan to trace those non-resident parents and restore compliance, through DEOs where appropriate.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.2223W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-21">21 June 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.2223W.2/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.2223W.2/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what performance targets he has set for Vertex to respond to cases referred to the Child Support Agency Bolton office by or on behalf of hon. Members; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.2223W.2/6" class="indent">and;</p>
	<p pid="a.2223W.2/7" class="indent">You also asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, if he will list the (a) performance indicators and (b) performance targets which he has set for Vertex for its management of the Bolton office of the Child Support Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.2223W.2/8" class="indent">Although the agency has contracted out the maintenance of its clerical cases to Vertex Data Science Ltd, the performance targets set by the Secretary of State apply to all Child Support cases regardless of whether they are clerical or not.</p>
	<p pid="a.2223W.2/9" class="indent">The Secretary of State targets for the current operation year are:</p>
	<p pid="a.2223W.2/10" class="indent">Number of children&mdash;By <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase>, maintenance will be collected or have been arranged by the Agency on behalf of 720,000 children.</p>
	<p pid="a.2223W.2/11" class="indent">Total Maintenance Collection (Arrears)&mdash;Collect or have arranged &pound;970 million in child maintenance between <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase>; of which at least &pound;120 million maintenance will be arrears.</p>
	<p pid="a.2223W.2/12" class="indent">Maintenance Outcomes&mdash;By <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase>, in 66% of cases across both the new and old schemes in which a liability to pay maintenance exists, the non-resident parent has either made a payment via the collection service or a Maintenance Direct arrangement is in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.2223W.2/13" class="indent">Uncleared applications to the New scheme&mdash;By <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase>, the volume of uncleared new scheme applications will be no more than 140,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.2223W.2/14" class="indent">In addition, the Agency's Client Service Standards, including responding to hon. Members correspondence applies to cases maintained by the Bolton office. We aim to reply to letters and either resolve complaints, or agree next steps, within three weeks of receiving them.</p>
	<p pid="a.2223W.2/15" class="indent">Vertex Data Science Ltd performance against these measures is continually reviewed to ensure they are supporting the Agency's aim to deliver more money for more children.</p>

	<p pid="a.2230W.8/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions about jobsearch services available through digital television. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to Lesley Strathie as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus. I am replying on her behalf as Acting Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.2230W.8/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus published a News Release on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-02">2 April 2007</phrase> to launch the national job search engine on digital television in partnership with Looking Local, the local government digital TV portal. Looking Local is part of DigiTV, which is a not-for-profit organisation run by, and for, local government. DigiTV is currently working with over 75 Local Authorities in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.2230W.8/5" class="indent">The digital television jobsearch services are available in Wirral. Although Wirral Council are not currently delivering services through DigiTV's Looking Local, other councils in the area are, and these are accessible across the Wirral.</p>
	<p pid="a.2230W.8/6" class="indent">Customers without digital television or the Internet can access Jobcentre Plus vacancies through channels such as Jobseeker Direct (a telephone job search service), Jobpoints (in all Jobcentre Plus offices), and External Kiosks in third party premises such as libraries. We also offer assisted jobsearch through our Personal Advisers in Jobcentre Plus offices, and some outreach premises, for more disadvantaged customers. In addition, all employment programmes delivered through Jobcentre Plus contain a jobsearch element, for example, Programme Centres offer Internet access, newspapers, and support on the range of jobsearch skills, including CV preparation, completing job applications and interview skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.2230W.8/7" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has no current plans to advertise or evaluate digital television jobsearch services. The services offered through digital television form part of a wider set of services, available across a range of channels for those seeking work. The two pilots that took place in Kingston-upon-Hull (2003), and London (2005), were evaluated, but did not report on the age range of users.</p>
	<p pid="a.2230W.8/8" class="indent">Looking Local currently averages 270,000 hits per month for jobsearch services but information is not available broken down by region.</p>

	<p pid="a.2236W.2/1">Contracting out on a defined contribution basis when over the &quot;pivotal age&quot; (currently 44 for personal pensions and 48 for occupational schemes) is not usually financially beneficial, particularly where there is no employer pension contribution. However, an individual may have their own reasons for making this choice as contracting out offers flexibility not available under the State pension scheme. It is not the Department's policy to encourage or discourage people from contracting out. It is for individuals to decide what sort of pension provision is best for them, given their own personal circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.2236W.2/2">Selling and advising on all personal pension schemes, including appropriate personal pensions, is subject to the Financial Services Authority's rules on marketing and promotion, provision of suitable advice and provision of information at the point of sale. In addition, in relation to contracting out via an appropriate personal pension scheme, The Financial Services Authority Factsheet &quot;The State Second Pension&mdash;should you be contracted out?&quot; says that those in older age groups are likely to be financially worse off by contracting out.</p>

That document signalled our intention to establish the personal accounts earning band in line with the primary threshold and upper earnings limit from 2006-07 and to uprate these thresholds annually in line with average earnings. This means that the personal accounts earning band will not increase to the new level of the upper earnings limit that was announced in this year's Budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.2244W.0/1">Estimates of pension income are heavily driven by a number of assumptions, such as the asset allocation in a particular fund choice, the age at which the individual starts saving and the choice of annuity. It is therefore not possible to say with absolute certainty with which amount of annual savings an individual would achieve a replacement rate of above 100 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.2244W.0/2">However, both under a contribution limit of &pound;3,000 and &pound;5,000 a median earner with a full working life is likely to be able to achieve an adequate pension income as defined by a replacement rate. This would require additional voluntary savings above the default contribution. Clearly, the higher an individual's contributions, the more likely they are to achieve a particular retirement income.</p>
	<p pid="a.2244W.0/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-14">14 June</phrase>, 2007, the Government published their summary of responses to the White Paper &quot;Personal Accounts: A New Way to Save&quot; consultation exercise. This document contained further analysis on the personal accounts contribution limit and concluded that an annual limit of &pound;3,600 would be an appropriate figure. Such a figure will ensure that personal accounts will stay focused on the target market, complementing rather than competing with existing provision, while still providing moderate to low earners with sufficient room to meet benchmark replacement rates.</p>

	<p pid="a.2244W.3/1">If investment returns were in line with the estimated average of a 3.5 per cent. real rate of return in each year, a median earner, who contributed up to the contribution limit in each year, would, in principle, be able to reach <i> (a)</i> around a two thirds per cent. replacement rate with a &pound;3,000 contribution limit and <i> (b)</i> around an 85 to 90 per cent. replacement rate with a &pound;5,000 contribution limit.

	<p pid="a.2244W.3/2">However, these replacement rates are based on the assumption of a full working life (age 21 to 68) and hence a high number of years of saving (46 years). Some people in personal accounts are likely to start saving at a later age than 21 or have caring breaks in their working life and thus need a somewhat higher degree of flexibility of saving to reach their benchmark replacement rates.</p>

	<p pid="a.2245W.2/1">Published analysis regarding the replacement rates and incomes individuals could expect at retirement can be found in Figure 2.iii of the May 2006 White Paper, Security in Retirement Regulatory Impact Assessment.

This individual would achieve a total replacement rate of 45 per cent.

	<p pid="a.2247W.6/1">Clydebank Benefit Delivery Centre currently retains files on site for nine weeks before dispatch to the Capita Document Management Centre (DMC) or Heywood Stores as they were known. This retention facilitates routine post-action checks, inquiries or other action. Documents/files are requested from DMC using an on-line retrieval with each request being made available for despatch by the TNT Courier by 20:00 on the day of request where the request is received before 17.00 hours or the next working day for requests made after 17.00 hours. Where the request is urgent we can request a response within two hours by fax or e-mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.2247W.6/2">Where files are not received there are two escalation routes, depending on the information held in the on-line retrieval system, either via the TNT Courier help desk or the DMC Customer Service Desk. DMC will endeavour to resolve the issue at contact. However, if this is not possible complaints will be investigated within 24 hours of receipt and the caller given the option of a written reply by fax or e-mail. If the inquiry cannot be resolved within 24 hours, DMC Customer Service Desk provides a progress report via e-mail or fax. If the response is unsatisfactory or is not received within 48 hours, the issue is escalated to the DWP Record Storage Contract Management Team. Scotland also has a nominated manager who represents our sites on matters relating to the JCP process and the DMC service.</p>
	<p pid="a.2247W.6/3">Clydebank is currently receiving a satisfactory standard of service and escalates individual cases where there are difficulties to the Customer Service Desk. Clydebank aims to reduce the holding to six weeks, rather than nine, in line with our agreed best practice in Scotland.</p>
