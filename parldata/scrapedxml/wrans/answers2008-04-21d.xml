	<p pid="d.1349W.2/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, hon. Members have been entitled to claim mileage allowances in line with Inland Revenue rates (now HM Revenue and Customs rates), which are 40p per mile for the first 10,000 business miles travelled in a year and 25p per mile thereafter. This was decided by Resolution of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-03">3 November 2004</phrase>. The Resolution was in line with a recommendation by the Senior Salaries Review Body of October 2004, Cm 6354-1, paragraphs 4.50-52, which gave the following rationale:</p>
	<p pid="d.1349W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;The approved IR rate is calculated to represent the actual cost of motoring, including fuel costs, wear and tear (including servicing and depreciation), road fund licence, and insurance.

	<p pid="d.1354W.3/1">Local authorities are required to work towards meeting the air quality objectives in the Air Quality Regulations 2000 by designating air quality management areas where concentrations of any of the seven pollutants in the regulations exceed, or are likely to exceed, the stated objectives. To help local authorities do this, DEFRA operates an air quality grant scheme, a capital grant for which local authorities bid. The total amount of this grant, which is divided between successful authorities, is approximately &pound;2.3 million per year.

	<p pid="d.1357W.2/1">The England catchment sensitive farming delivery initiative has been in place since April 2006 and is being delivered jointly by Natural England and the Environment Agency on behalf of DEFRA. It is currently based in priority catchments covering a little over a third of the agricultural area of England and its purpose is to encourage farmers to take voluntary action to tackle diffuse water pollution, mainly from nitrates, phosphorus, sediment, pesticides and livestock faeces.</p>
	<p pid="d.1357W.2/2">The main elements of the initiative are: forty priority catchments served by a network of 42 catchment sensitive farming officers working locally; a programme of farmer workshops, farm demonstrations and farm visits; partnership with the pesticides voluntary initiative; local catchment steering groups bringing together farmers, water companies and other stakeholders; a capital grant scheme. In its first two years the initiative also supported 20 projects, with similar aims and objectives, in other catchments.</p>
	<p pid="d.1357W.2/3">In February 2008 DEFRA launched Future Water, the Government's new water strategy for England. This stated that DEFRA will continue to support farmers on catchment sensitive farming for a further three years. DEFRA has since confirmed that the England catchment sensitive farming delivery initiative will receive funding of &pound;12.9 million in 2008-09. Most of the initial programme is being rolled forward for a period of six months, with a new programme planned from October.</p>

	<p pid="d.1357W.8/1">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report includes 'high-end' projections for global temperature rise from an ensemble of climate models. These are based on close to business-as-usual Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (for example, A2 and A1B).</p>
	<p pid="d.1357W.8/2">Using these projections, our current best estimate for a high-end UK-wide average annual temperature increase by 2050 (relative to 1990) is approximately 1.75&deg; C.</p>
	<p pid="d.1357W.8/3">In general terms, there is relatively little differentiation in temperature projections at 2050, no matter what emissions scenario is chosen. However, later this century, the gap between high-end and low-end scenarios will widen.</p>

	<p pid="d.1358W.8/1">DEFRA is working hard to identify where we can reduce the need to travel, through the use of video conferencing and other alternatives, and when travel is necessary, to encourage staff to make the most sustainable choices.</p>
	<p pid="d.1358W.8/2">We are working with our IT strategic supplier IBM and Tandberg to install the infrastructure necessary to make available the next breed of video conferencing services based around IP rather than ISDN telecommunication protocols and fixed v/conf studios. This will improve the availability, quality and mobility of the v/conf service and make it a more attractive alternative option for staff to choose when travelling to meetings would normally be required.</p>
	<p pid="d.1358W.8/3">But we recognise it is not a panacea for all meetings. Initial contacts and team building often require physical, face-to-face meetings to ensure good team relationships are built before moving to electronic meeting spaces. We also recognise that there are other technologies that can impact on the need for meetings&mdash;e.g. a quick teleconference session can often be appropriate and sufficient if there is a single issue to resolve among a small number of people.</p>
	<p pid="d.1358W.8/4">We will also be setting up SharePoint team spaces to provide a repository of shared resources, discussion threads and wikis etc. that should reduce the need for meetings in the first place and support the move of the core department to a more project-orientated structure.</p>
	<p pid="d.1358W.8/5">DEFRA is looking to these new technologies to assist in meeting its new travel targets to:</p>
	<p pid="d.1358W.8/6" class="indent">reduce carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles by 15 per cent. by 2011-12 (from a 2005-06 baseline)</p>
	<p pid="d.1358W.8/7" class="indent">achieve a new fleet emissions average of 130g/k by 2010</p>
	<p pid="d.1358W.8/8" class="indent">reduce carbon dioxide emissions from air travel by 5 per cent. by 2008-09 (from a 2006-07 baseline)</p>
	<p pid="d.1358W.8/9" class="indent">achieve an overall reduction in the amount of travel undertaken across the core-department</p>
	<p pid="d.1358W.8/10">More specifically we will look to see an increase in take-up and use of the new v/conf services following implementation of the new IP infrastructure, though a target has yet to be set.</p>
	<p pid="d.1358W.8/11">You may also wish to know that DEFRA worked with IBM to produce a White Paper on methods and techniques for assessing and reducing the carbon footprint of office IT services entitled &quot;Environmentally aware governance of the distributed IT infrastructure&quot;. This has now received two awards&mdash;a Gold Award from BCS link:</p>

In this case the authorities agreed that an assessment should be undertaken which would also take account of the possible effects of operating the new ferries on the Solent and Southampton Water protected site. The developers engaged consultants who produced a report on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-28">28 March</phrase> to underpin that assessment. This is currently being considered by Natural England and the Marine and Fisheries Agency.

	<p pid="d.1362W.9/1">As soon as we became aware that Pirbright was a potential source of the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak we put in place a number of additional safeguards at the site. We immediately asked the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Professor Spratt to carry out reviews of biosecurity, and subsequently accepted all of the recommendations in their reports. Since then, stringent new biosecurity conditions have been applied to work on the Pirbright site, providing several independent layers of safety and ensuring that the process is contained. For example, a comprehensive programme of preventive maintenance of the contained drainage system has been implemented and sections have been re-lined. These measures will ensure the highest level of biosecurity at Pirbright.</p>
	<p pid="d.1362W.9/2">In addition, a Safety Alert was issued last September to all similar laboratories, which has been followed up by a joint programme of inspections by HSE and DEFRA inspectors to these labs. The inspections of containment level (CL) 4 laboratories revealed no breaches of the legislation and no formal enforcement action was taken. This process has provided both the regulatory bodies and the operators of the laboratories with the assurance that their facilities are well managed. HSE will continue this series of Safety Alert inspections to consider CL3 facilities based on risk.</p>
	<p pid="d.1362W.9/3">The Government accepted all of the recommendations in Sir Bill Callaghan's independent review of the regulatory framework for the handling of animal pathogens, published in December 2007. These included that responsibility for the regulation of animal pathogens should transfer to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). DEFRA is working closely with the HSE and other departments, to implement all three phases of the work recommended by Sir Bill Callaghan. The formal legal transfer of the Specified Animal Pathogens Order enforcement and inspection responsibilities is well under way and is nearing completion.</p>
	<p pid="d.1362W.9/4">We have worked closely with the HSE and are satisfied that all necessary measures are in place to provide assurance that the risk of accidental release is as close to zero as possible.</p>

	<p pid="d.1365W.5/1">Waste incineration plants, including those in hospitals, are subject to the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations (the &quot;PPC Regulations&quot;) which were superseded from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-06">6 April 2008</phrase> by the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2007. These regulations require each incinerator to have a permit to operate which is issued by the regulator only after detailed consideration of the environmental and health impacts of the operation. Each permit contains operating conditions which incorporate the requirements of the waste incineration directive (the WID), among which is a maximum emission limit to air for dioxins of 0.1 ng/m<sup>(3)</sup> expressed as International Toxic Equivalents (ITEQ). This limit is considered to provide adequate protection to the human health and environment.</p>
	<p pid="d.1365W.5/2">Waste incinerators are responsible for a small proportion only of emissions of a range of pollutants. An independent, peer reviewed, study published in 2004, 'Review of the Environmental and Health Effects of Waste Management', concluded that based on the evidence from studies so far:</p>
	<p pid="d.1365W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;risks to human health from incineration are small in comparison with other known risks&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1365W.5/4">Of the 65 incinerators regulated by the Environment Agency, five were reported to have breached the 0.1 ng/m<sup>(3)</sup> emission limit during 2007. In four of these cases a formal warning was issued by the Environment Agency. In the last case the Environment Agency is considering what enforcement action is required.</p>
	<p pid="d.1365W.5/5">Crematoria are not waste incineration plants and so are not regulated in that way, although they are subject to controls upon emissions to air under other parts of the EPR regulations.</p>

The Government have been pressing for their removal for some time as they encourage producers to produce to a quota rather than to meet market demand. In addition, they are an unnecessary cost and regulatory burden. We look forward to their abolition in 2015. Consequently, we have no plans to encourage greater milk production to fulfil the new quota ceilings. we believe producers should produce for the market.</p>

	<p pid="d.1367W.9/1">The UK list of priority species provides a focus for conservation action over the next decade and will be used to inform statutory lists under legislation in each of the countries of the UK. The list has been published with an indication of the most important types of action necessary for the conservation of each species. The UK Biodiversity Partnership is adopting the ecosystem approach and, in addition to legal protection and management for single species and sites, these actions include habitat expansion and restoration, wider action on cross-cutting issues such as climate change, and research. Biodiversity conservation is a devolved matter, and implementation is being taken forward under biodiversity and environment strategies in each of the four countries of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="d.1371W.3/2">Fridges form a relatively small proportion of the material handled by fragmentisers and the associated emissions of green house gases are not routinely measured or recorded. However, the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires that all greenhouse gases with a global warming potential above 15 must be extracted before items are sent through a fragmentiser.</p>
	<p pid="d.1371W.3/3">Any fragmentiser handling separately collected waste electrical and electronic equipment&mdash;including fridges&mdash;must be an approved authorised treatment facility and deal with WEEE in accordance with the guidance published by the environment agencies on best available treatment, recovery and recycling techniques.</p>

	<p pid="d.1372W.5/1">Planning Policy Statement 25 on Development and Flood Risk (PPS25) advocates that regional planning bodies and local authorities incorporate policies for furthering the use of sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) in their regional spatial strategies and development plan documents. They should also ensure that their policies and decisions on applications complement building regulations on sustainable rainwater drainage. This gives priority to the use of infiltration drainage systems over watercourses and then sewers. PPS25 also encourages local authorities to promote the use of SUDs by developers when they design their developments.</p>
	<p pid="d.1372W.5/2">However, the principal obstacle to the increased take-up of SUDS is the lack of clarity over where responsibility for the ownership and long-term maintenance and renewal of SUDS infrastructure should lie. These issues are currently being addressed through a specific DEFRA work stream and have been the subject of informal consultation with the National SUDS Working Group. DEFRA is consulting on options for the responsibility for ownership and maintenance of SUDS as part of the current consultation on Improving Surface Water Drainage. This consultation was launched alongside the Government's Water Strategy in February 2007 and will close on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-30">30 April 2008</phrase>.</p>

The London Development Agency and the newly appointed masterplanning team have started the process to develop the LMF and will engage closely with local people and businesses to ensure the masterplan reflects their ideas.</p>

	<p pid="d.1384W.5/1">The Northern Ireland Policing Board has a statutory requirement to assess the effectiveness of district policing partnerships in performing their statutory duties. To fulfil this requirement the Board undertakes an annual performance assessment of each DPP against a performance management framework. The framework requires a number of key performance indicator targets to be met in relation to the DPP statutory duties.</p>
	<p pid="d.1384W.5/2">The Policing Board also commissions the Central Survey Unit in the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) to conduct the Policing Board module in its Omnibus Survey twice a year and the biennial District Policing Partnership (DPP) Public Consultation Survey. These surveys meet the Policing Board's statutory obligations under the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 to &quot;assess the level of public satisfaction with the performance of the police and district policing partnerships&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1384W.5/3">The Policing Board makes its annual assessment of the effectiveness of district policing partnerships (DPPs), using a range of performance indicators and targets.</p>
	<p pid="d.1384W.5/4">Information reported to the Board on the performance of DPPs during 2006-07 confirms that overall DPPs are fulfilling their statutory responsibilities:</p>
	<p pid="d.1384W.5/5" class="indent">The targets that assess the performance of DPPs in identifying local policing priorities for input to the local Policing Plan and NI Policing Plan were achieved by 23 of the 26 DPPs;</p>
	<p pid="d.1384W.5/6" class="indent">The targets that assess the performance of DPPs in monitoring police performance were achieved by all but one DPP;</p>
	<p pid="d.1384W.5/7" class="indent">The targets that assess the performance of DPPs in engaging with the community to gain the co-operation of the public with the police in preventing crime were achieved by 23 of the 26 DPPs;</p>
	<p pid="d.1384W.5/8" class="indent">The targets measuring the performance of DPPs in acting as a forum for discussion on policing were achieved by 24 of the 26 DPPs.</p>
	<p pid="d.1384W.5/9">The targets that assess the effectiveness of DPPs in consulting with the public were taken from the 2006 NISRA DPP Public Consultation Survey and the results were assessed against baseline results from the same survey carried out in 2004. Results were compared for 24 DPPs and the four Belfast sub-group areas. Dungannon and South Tyrone did not establish a DPP until December 2004 and no baseline was available for the 2006-07 assessment.</p>
	<p pid="d.1384W.5/10" class="indent">21 DPPs/Belfast sub-groups increased the survey respondents who had heard of the DPP;</p>
	<p pid="d.1384W.5/11" class="indent">Six DPPs/Belfast sub-groups increased the percentage of survey respondents who think that the DPP does a good job;</p>
	<p pid="d.1384W.5/12" class="indent">15 DPPs/Belfast sub-groups achieved the target to increase the percentage of survey respondents who are confident that the DPP is addressing local policing problems;</p>
	<p pid="d.1384W.5/13" class="indent">one Belfast sub-group showed an increase in the percentage of NISRA survey respondents who had heard of DPPs and are prepared to contact their DPP.</p>
	<p pid="d.1384W.5/14">It is the Policing Board's view that DPPs have made an important contribution to increased confidence in policing. Through working in partnership with the police to prevent crime DPPs have also contributed to a 15 per cent. reduction in recorded crime in the last five years.</p>

	<p pid="d.1396W.8/2">The estimates are derived from the information on available staff years published by Cabinet Office in their report Analysis of Sickness Absence in the Civil Service.</p>

	<p pid="d.1397W.2/1">The activities of the Digital National Framework (<a href="http://www.dnf.org">www.dnf.org</a>) are agreed by an Expert Group formed of officials representing local and central government, non-Department Government bodies and the private sector. Their aim is to promote linkages across national and local datasets, which have a geographic component, to support the sharing of information about a common location. The majority of their resource comes from &quot;in kind&quot; contributions of individual members, supplemented by limited financial sponsorship to cover promotional activities and some technical documentation. Therefore there is no single body taking the lead of the Digital National Framework.</p>

	<p pid="d.1400W.5/1">Targeted Response Vehicles (TRVs) are used as an extra resource by Fire and Rescue Authorities (FRAs) at specified times and locations to provide a more flexible and increased service in specific areas. Effective use of new midi fire appliances or TRVs crewed with three firefighters can, in certain circumstances, provide a better service for local communities. As well as tackling small fires, using TRVs in identified 'hot spots' can act as a deterrent to miscreants and free up staff for major incidents and community safety work.</p>
	<p pid="d.1400W.5/2">FRAs are required by the Fire and Rescue Service National Framework to have in place and maintain an integrated risk management plan (IRMP) which reflects local need and sets out plans to tackle effectively both existing and potential risks to communities. The IRMP enables the authority to tailor cover for fire and other incidents to local circumstances&mdash;evaluating where risk is greatest and allocating resource accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="d.1400W.5/3">It is not the role of Ministers to intervene in the operational proposals of an individual FRA's IRMP; that is rightly the decision for elected members of the authority concerned to determine following full consultation with the local community.</p>

The number of staff employed by each Fire and Rescue Authority including those in the South West is a matter for them and consequently the total figure fluctuates around this mark.

	<p pid="d.1404W.14/3">The performance standards that each Regional Control Centre will meet are presently under discussion but will not be less than those currently achieved. In addition service delivery and firefighter safety will be enhanced through bringing all controls up to the standard of the highest currently in use.</p>
	<p pid="d.1404W.14/4">Every Regional Control Centre will be able to mobilise any Fire and Rescue unit anywhere in England, which is currently not possible. This new network and the associated Firelink communications project will deliver a more efficient and resilient control service.</p>

	<p pid="d.1409W.8/2">However, it is recognised that the council would not wish to produce a Local Development Framework that sets out a strategy based only on expansion at Heathrow (beyond T5) and therefore advice on a possible approach has been given. The approach is for the council to consider appropriate strategic spatial options for development in the borough that take as a starting point a range of scenarios for the future development of the airport, including for example, additional capacity by addition of a third runway. This approach would allow the core strategy strategic spatial options to take account of the impact of these scenarios on future development patterns for housing and employment land within the borough.</p>
	<p pid="d.1409W.8/3">The council has been advised that it is not appropriate for realistic strategic spatial options, that are not supported by the council, to be excluded from consideration, particularly in relation to the expansion of Heathrow (beyond T5) which is Government policy.</p>

	<p pid="d.1420W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is planning to continue its humanitarian engagement with a further &pound;5 million in 2008-09. DFID's support will focus in particular on internally displaced persons (IDP) and host populations. DFID will continue to support immediate relief interventions, to improve humanitarian co-ordination and look for ways to encourage early recovery. DFID is working with a range of implementers from the United Nations (UN) agencies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the Red Cross to ensure that the final distribution of assistance is carried out in a transparent and appropriately targeted way, with particular attention taken to ensure that partners are acting with independence and impartiality.</p>
	<p pid="d.1420W.5/2">The relief initiatives supported by DFID are ongoing in spite of a security environment that makes access to vulnerable populations difficult. DFID has chosen partners that have a proven track record of delivery even in the most insecure areas at the Chad/Sudan border. The European Union Force (EUFOR) is mandated to protect IDPs, host populations and aid workers, and to promote the conditions for IDP return; as EUFOR deploys, we expect that it will become easier to deliver aid. DFID is making provision to allow the expansion of relief and early recovery efforts if and when the security environment is improved.</p>

Recently, discussions have focused on the development of a coherent post-conflict response. DFID is now working to stimulate the UN's planning in this area, and to ensure that the UK's own planning is complementary to the plans being put forward by European partners.</p>

	<p pid="d.1426W.5/1">A key element in the operational response to the humanitarian situation in Somalia is the logistical effort to deliver food and other relief supplies to Somalia by sea but the threat of piracy in 2007 made delivery hazardous. The introduction of military escorts has been useful, with no incidents of piracy affecting escorted vessels.</p>
	<p pid="d.1426W.5/2">Since December 2007 the French and Danish military forces have escorted in total 70,000 metric tonnes of humanitarian aid to Somalia. Consignments included relief materials for UNICEF and UNHCR in addition to World Food Programme food aid. The Dutch military have recently taken over escort duties.</p>

	<p pid="d.1426W.8/1">Officials at the Department for International Development, together with colleagues at the British high commission in Nairobi and the British embassy in Addis Ababa, are in regular contact with the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia, including the President and Prime Minister, and with the Government of Ethiopia. The discussions are varied, and the humanitarian situation has been regularly discussed, specifically on allowing agencies and NGOs unhindered access to areas in need.</p>
	<p pid="d.1426W.8/2">Officials based in Nairobi meet regularly through the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) to co-ordinate humanitarian assistance. The United States of America, European Commission and member states of the European Union are all represented at these meetings.</p>
	<p pid="d.1426W.8/3">The UK Government maintain regular contact with all parties the hon. Member lists. The Minister for Africa at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), my right hon. Friend Lord Malloch Brown, raised humanitarian issues when he met President Yusuf in January 2008 and with Prime Minister Hussein and the Government of Ethiopia at the African Union summit in February 2008. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Hilary Benn)&mdash;former Secretary of State for DFID&mdash;met with President Yusuf last year and discussed the humanitarian situation.</p>
	<p pid="d.1426W.8/4">Most of DFID's humanitarian assistance (which includes medical supplies) is not earmarked to regions within Somalia. This enables our implementing partners (e.g. the International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Food Programme) to remain flexible and to react to changing circumstances on the ground. However, some of the NGOs that we support work in specific areas, e.g. a nutrition programme with the International Medical Corps (IMC) in Bakool and a nutrition, water and sanitation programme through Action contre le faim (ACF) in Galgadud.</p>

	<p pid="d.1433W.3/1">Halifax is in the area covered by the West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority (WYPTA) and the Department's support for bus services is allocated to WYPTA rather than to individual local authorities in the area.</p>
	<p pid="d.1433W.3/2">In the last five years a total of &pound;4.9 million was allocated to WYPTA in rural bus subsidy grant. In the same period WYPTA also received &pound;5 million in funding from the Department's urban and rural bus challenge and Kickstart schemes. Four of the projects, totalling &pound;2.4 million, supported under these schemes involve services in Calderdale district which includes Halifax.</p>
	<p pid="d.1433W.3/3">Bus companies operating in and around Halifax also receive bus service operators grant from the Department. This is a payment equivalent to about 80 per cent. of the fuel duty operators incur in providing local bus services. However, as BSOG is a payment direct to operators, statistics are not kept of payments by local authority or geographical area.</p>
	<p pid="d.1433W.3/4">Local authorities may also use funding from the Government's unhypothecated revenue support grant (formula grant) to support local bus services.</p>

	<p pid="d.1433W.6/1">The Government have looked at various times at the issue of bus regulation, starting with the 1998 White Paper which led to the Transport Act 2000; and last year's review which has led to the proposals in the Local Transport Bill giving among other things, more scope for local authority involvement in bus services.</p>
	<p pid="d.1433W.6/2">On each occasion in the past, we concluded that constructive partnership between a largely private sector industry and local authorities is a better way forward than wholesale re-regulation in delivering the services needed by passengers. Indeed, we feel that the private sector strengths in management, innovation and investment are central to the future of the industry.</p>

As the Heathrow consultation document states, under current proposals aviation emissions would effectively be capped at the average level over the period 2004 to 2006. This means that when the trading scheme is established, any additional aviation emissions above that level would lead to no increase in total emissions, since airlines would have to pay for the equivalent emissions reductions in other sectors.</p>

	<p pid="d.1445W.3/1">Before scheduling the roadworks at Gateway services, the Highways Agency carefully considered the potential impact on road users. Based on the typical traffic flow over recent years on this part of the M1, and keeping the same capacity by ensuring all existing lanes are open during the day, any delay was assessed to be minimal.</p>
	<p pid="d.1445W.3/2">It is normal practice to maintain a separation of at least 10 km between concurrent major roadworks on motorways, where possible. The Gateway services are more than 10 km from junction 6a.</p>

This was part of the Government's programme for prioritising the surfacing of concrete roads under the Ten Year Plan. The results of TRL assessment indicated that the noise levels on the section of the M20 between Junction 8 (Maidstone) and Junction 9 (Ashford) were three dB(A) more than predicted and therefore it qualified as a high priority site for resurfacing.

In those areas the number of penalty charge notices served by an individual local authority, and paid by motorists, will increase or decrease primarily according to local circumstances and local parking behaviour. The new regulations are aimed at improving parking behaviour, thereby improving traffic flows in the interests of other road users.</p>

	<p pid="d.1448W.3/1">Following publication of the Department for Transport's &quot;Towards a Sustainable Transport System&quot; in October 2007, we intend to look at the full range of options for putting transport on to a less carbon-intensive path.</p>
	<p pid="d.1448W.3/2">More specifically, we have been considering with stakeholders whether changes to the existing arrangements for the subsidy of bus services, which are the main form of urban public transport, would increase the contribution of buses to delivery of our environmental and other objectives. A key consideration is whether particular subsidy changes would incentivise improvements to the fuel efficiency of the bus fleet and the use of environmentally friendly vehicles. We published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-13">13 March</phrase> a consultation document, entitled &quot;Local Bus Service Support&mdash;options for reform&quot;, which invites views on our proposals; and copies are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="d.1448W.3/3">The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation which comes into effect in April 2008 will require the major oil companies and fuel suppliers that supply fossil fuels for road transport to ensure that a proportion of the road fuel supplied in the UK comprises renewable fuels such as biofuels. The level of the obligation will be 2.5 per cent. of total fuel supplied by the supplier in the first year (2008-09), rising to 3.75 per cent. in 2009-10 and 5 per cent. in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="d.1448W.3/4">We are working with the rail industry to trial the use of biofuels which could, subject to satisfying concerns about carbon benefits and overall sustainability, reduce reliance on conventional fossil fuels. We will also keep under review the case for more strategic electrification of the rail network.</p>
	<p pid="d.1448W.3/5">We also support the Commission's intention to legislate to improve the average g/km carbon dioxide emissions performance of passenger cars. This should reduce use of fossil fuels, both by encouraging use of other fuel sources and by encouraging more efficient use by those vehicles that continue to be powered by oil products. We have pressed the Commission to commit to a target of 100 g/km CO2 average for 2020.</p>

	<p pid="d.1456W.2/1">The testing of food additives is carried out to satisfy the requirements of the Food Safety Act 1990, for which the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has responsibility, and is an example of specific legislative requirements under which procedures on animals are carried out. The number of animals used varies from year to year and depends on the requirements of industry and the regulators concerned. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to place a limit on such testing. However, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 requires that the procedures authorised must cause the minimum possible suffering to the smallest number of animals of the least sentience and we will continue to ensure that these requirements are met in all categories of animal use, including the testing of food additives.</p>

	<p pid="d.1462W.11/1">In practice there are two stages to the Secretary of State's decision making process in determining whether to proscribe an organisation. Firstly, the Secretary of State must consider whether she believes the organisation is concerned in terrorism within the meaning of section 3 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Section 3 provides that an organisation is concerned in terrorism if it:</p>
	<p pid="d.1462W.11/2" class="indent">(a) commits or participates in acts of terrorism;</p>
	<p pid="d.1462W.11/3" class="indent">(b) prepares for terrorism;</p>
	<p pid="d.1462W.11/4" class="indent">(c) promotes or encourages terrorism; or</p>
	<p pid="d.1462W.11/5" class="indent">(d) is otherwise concerned in terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="d.1462W.11/6">If the outcome at the first stage of the decision making process is that the Secretary of State believes that the organisation is concerned in terrorism, she then has discretion as to whether or not to proscribe it. In exercising that discretion successive Secretaries of State have had regard to five factors in particular. They are:</p>
	<p pid="d.1462W.11/7" class="indent">(a) The nature and scale of an organisation's activities;</p>
	<p pid="d.1462W.11/8" class="indent">(b) The specific threat that it poses to the United Kingdom;</p>
	<p pid="d.1462W.11/9" class="indent">(c) The specific threat that it poses to British nationals overseas;</p>
	<p pid="d.1462W.11/10" class="indent">(d) The extent of the organisation's presence in the United Kingdom; and</p>
	<p pid="d.1462W.11/11" class="indent">(e) The need to support other members of the international community in the global fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="d.1462W.11/12">The Baluchistan Liberation Army was proscribed in 2006 because the Secretary of State believed the organisation to be concerned in terrorism and determined, as a matter of discretion, that it should be proscribed. More information about the Baluchistan Liberation Army's activities was listed in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Terrorism Act 2000 (Proscribed Organisations) (Amendment) Order 2006 (SI2006/2016), which added it to the list of proscribed organisations. These included nine bombings of railway stations in 2005 and the murder of Chinese engineers in February 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.1462W.11/13">The Government do not comment on the nature and source of the evidence underpinning proscription decisions.</p>

	<p pid="d.1468W.5/1">The Youth Crime Seminar on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-08">8 November 2007</phrase> was held as a series of events on youth crime, as part of the preparation on the youth crime action plan for publication summer 2008. The action plan aims to deliver results across youth crime prevention, youth justice as well as cross cutting themes on youth victimisation and youth violence. There were no formal minutes produced&mdash;instead, officials who were present took note of the points raised so that they could be fed into discussion during the development of the Youth Crime Action Plan. The seminar was followed up by the key Departments contacting those who attended as part of the work to get views and inputs into the Youth Crime Action Plan. A future date and attendees list for any forthcoming seminar has not yet been confirmed.</p>

The education provision at Yarl's Wood is based on the national curriculum wherever possible and is delivered to three age-based groups. Children are assessed to determine literacy, numeracy and ESOL (English for speakers of other languages) skill levels. Tuition covers core areas of English, numeracy, IT, art and craft and PE.</p>
	<p pid="d.1478W.9/3">Families with children may also be detained at Tinsley and Dungavel House immigration removal centres, where programmes of structured activities are provided for children. Families with children usually remain at these centres for no longer than 72 hours. If detention continues beyond three days, they are normally transferred to Yarl's Wood.</p>

	<p pid="d.1489W.8/1">Mandatory registration with the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners was recommended in the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology Report &quot;Forensic Science on Trial&quot; (see recommendation 43 at paragraph 139), published <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-29">29 March 2005</phrase>. The response of Her Majesty's Government to that recommendation was as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.1489W.8/2" class="indent">&quot;It would not be appropriate for the Government to mandate registration with a private organisation. The criminal justice system must have access to appropriate expert testimony to ensure it reaches the correct decision. The use of a mandatory registration scheme would prevent appropriate experts from giving testimony in a number of circumstances, for example where the required expert does not normally work within the forensic arena and is therefore not registered. Another example might be that the required expert may work within the forensic arena but, perhaps due to working in research and development, does not carry out sufficient casework to be registered. The required expert may not work within the UK, or expertise may be required in a subject which rarely comes before the court. It therefore seems more sensible to have a scheme whereby the registration is voluntary. Where someone seeks to appear as an expert witness in an area where registration is available but they are not registered, this will highlight to the judge the need to consider carefully whether their testimony should be admitted and, if so, on what basis.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.1489W.8/3">My right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, continues to endorse this view and has recently appointed Mr Andrew Rennison as the Forensic Science Regulator. The Regulator will provide advice on issues surrounding individual competence for forensic science practitioners&mdash;including registration.

PACE provides that samples may be retained for persons who have been arrested and detained at the police station for a recordable offence; and that profiles taken from these samples and placed on the database may be subject to speculative search. We consider that is a proportionate and effective threshold to help eliminate the innocent during the course of an investigation as well contributing to the detection and conviction of the guilty.</p>

	<p pid="d.1495W.0/2">Table 1 gives the number of offences recorded under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 since 2002 that are separately identifiable within police recorded crime statistics. It also gives the number of offences detected by means of a sanction detection.

Recorded crime data is provided on a financial year basis and counts offences whereas court proceedings data are on a calendar year basis and count offenders.

	<p pid="d.1501W.2/3">SOCA will report on its achievements during 2007-08 in its annual report, due to be published in May, and the creation of the UK Border Agency from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April</phrase> will improve the Government's response to organised crime by strengthening the UK's border controls.</p>

	<p pid="d.1510W.8/1">The Police Service has established policy and standards which enable integration, notably the Management of Police Information, a statutory code of practice introduced in 2005 to ensure that all police operational information is managed in a consistent way. The Association of Chief Police Officers Information Systems Strategy for the Police Service, which was adopted in 2006, sets out the standards used to specify, acquire and operate nationally-compatible Police information systems.</p>
	<p pid="d.1510W.8/2">Police Information Technology (IT) systems are integrated with Criminal Justice partners; the Criminal Justice System Exchange provides IT services to enable common case information to be shared. Additionally, common solutions integrate the data from police forces to provide national information resources. Last year saw the completion of the National Firearms Licensing Management System and ViSOR, a United Kingdom-wide system used to store and share information and intelligence on those individuals who have been identified as posing a risk of serious harm to the public.</p>
	<p pid="d.1510W.8/3">The IMPACT Nominal Index, operational since 2005, allows police officers to establish whether any forces in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland hold information about a person of interest. The next phase of IMPACT, the Police National Database, is now in procurement and will provide a single access point for searching across all of the forces' main operational information systems.</p>
	<p pid="d.1510W.8/4">Police forces are implementing information systems where master filing eliminates data redundancy in incident recording, investigations, case preparation and intelligence: each item of data, such as a suspect's name, is recorded in the system only once. Collaborations on regional crime, such as East Midlands Special Operations Unit, are using the secure Police National Network (PNN3), to which all forces connect, to give officers access to intelligence sources in each of the participating forces.</p>
	<p pid="d.1510W.8/5">In his Review of Policing, Sir Ronnie Flanagan identifies further areas for the development of common approaches to operational processes and procurement which will set new challenges for the management of information systems across the Police Service. At the time of publication of the Review, my right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary, commissioned the National Policing Improvement Agency to carry out a review of police IT and report to the National Policing Board (NPB) on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-06">6 May</phrase>. The report will form the basis for our future strategy for the more effective delivery of policing, supported by excellent IT systems.</p>

Police tactics and decisions to achieve these objectives are a matter for the independent operational judgement of chief officers of police.</p>
	<p pid="d.1513W.0/2">The Metropolitan Police Service had an appropriate operational plan in place to police the Olympic torch relay. The Metropolitan Police anticipated that some officers would be abstracted from their core roles. The costs of the operation will not be finalised until after the event. These costs will be reported to the Metropolitan Police Authority in line with any other large-scale policing operation.</p>

	<p pid="d.1516W.2/2">Websites containing child abuse images are usually removed from the internet by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF).</p>
	<p pid="d.1516W.2/3">The IWF, a self-regulatory organisation funded by the internet industry and the EU operates the UK's 'notice and take-down' service for child sexual abuse content on the internet. They do not count individual images that are removed, rather they focus their efforts on removing web pages or websites which contain or provide access to one, tens, hundreds or possibly thousands of individual child sexual abuse images. On the rare occasion content depicting child sexual abuse is traced to servers in the UK, a takedown request is issued by the IWF and the content is removed, usually within a matter of hours.</p>
	<p pid="d.1516W.2/4">This partnership approach has proved very successful and UK hosted child sexual abuse content known to the IWF has been less than 1 per cent. since 2003, down from 18 per cent. in 1997. In addition, the IWF provides a list of newsgroups which feature, advertise or advocate child sexual abuse to all UK service providers who voluntarily block large numbers which, in turn, denies access to thousands of such images. Search providers are provided with a list of keywords so that they can manage the quality of their returns and remove potentially illegal websites known to the IWF.</p>
	<p pid="d.1516W.2/5">This work is about removing content, complicating access, protecting internet users from inadvertent exposure and making the operations of those behind the websites more difficult. Details of each website confirmed to contain child sexual abuse is also passed to UK law enforcement for appropriate investigation. As over 99 per cent. of online child sexual abuse content is now hosted abroad, the IWF works in partnership with the relevant hotline and other authorities around the world, passing on intelligence relating to content in that country. It also provides a dynamic list of child sexual abuse URLs hosted abroad to the online industry to enable them to protect users by blocking inadvertent access to such content.</p>

	<p pid="d.1520W.2/1">The information is not available in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="d.1520W.2/2">Table 1 gives the number of offences recorded for the offence classifications which came into force with the introduction of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. It also gives the number of offences detected by means of a sanction detection. Table 2 shows the numbers of defendants proceeded against and found guilty at all courts for the years 2004 to 2006, and is taken from the court proceedings database held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. Figures for crimes and sanction detections in 2004-05 and those proceeded against and found guilty in 2004 are not for complete 12 month periods, as the Sexual Offence Act 2003 was enacted in May 2004.</p>
	<p pid="d.1520W.2/3">The figures given in Table 2 relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>
	<p pid="d.1520W.2/4">Recorded crime and court proceedings statistics are from two different databases and recorded in quite different ways. Recorded crime data are provided on a financial year basis and counts offences whereas court proceedings data are on a calendar year basis and count offenders. Therefore, these two separate data-sets are not directly comparable.</p>

	<p pid="d.1524W.7/1" qnum="196643">To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to the Written Ministerial Statement of 18 February 2008, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 2-4WS, on tackling violence, how she will ensure that members of the public to whom child sex offenders' convictions are disclosed do not pass that information on to others; whether such people will be allowed to pass the information on to <i> (a)</i> other family members and <i> (b)</i> other categories of people; what (i) documentary and (ii) other evidence people will be required to provide to be entitled to receive information on convictions; when the scheme will come into effect; what restrictions there will be on disclosure of information; what guidance she will provide to police on disclosure of information; and what convictions will be disclosable.</p>

	<p pid="d.1525W.0/1">The Review of the Protection of Children from Sex Offenders, referred to in the ministerial statement, included two actions relating to the disclosure of information on child sex offenders' convictions to the public. Implementation of Action 3 of the review will introduce a legal duty on MAPPA responsible authorities to consider the disclosure of information about convicted child sex offenders to members of the public. Under Action 4 a separate process will be piloted whereby members of the public will be able to register their child protection interest in a named individual and receive information on any convictions for child sex offences that individual may have, where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="d.1525W.0/2">The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill will amend the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to impose a duty on MAPPA responsible authorities to consider disclosure of a child sex offender's convictions to members of the public. The convictions that the MAPPA authorities must consider disclosing are set out at schedule 24 to the Bill. However, under their common law powers, the police are able to disclose details of other convictions in appropriate circumstances (see R <i> v</i>. Chief Constable of North Wales ex parte Thorpe (1998) 3 AII ER 310). The extent of the information disclosed will be decided on a case by case basis.</p>
	<p pid="d.1525W.0/3">The MAPPA authorities will decide who, if anyone, should be provided with the information, and will be able to impose conditions, in order to prevent further dissemination of the information. Under the Bill, the MAPPA authorities will have discretion as to the extent of the conditions that they impose. When imposing such conditions, the MAPPA authorities will need to be mindful of their obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998 and what is necessary and proportionate to prevent harm to the child or children concerned.</p>
	<p pid="d.1525W.0/4">Existing statutory MAPPA guidance will be updated to take account of the new statutory duty to consider disclosure.</p>
	<p pid="d.1525W.0/5">In deciding whether to disclose details of convictions for child sex offences to a member of the public under the pilot scheme, MAPPA meetings will consider the risk of the recipient disclosing this information to others. Before a disclosure is made, the intended recipient will be required to sign a declaration that they will not share this information with others.</p>
	<p pid="d.1525W.0/6">Applicants for disclosure under the pilot scheme will be asked to provide documentary proof such as the child's birth certificate to demonstrate their relationship with the child with respect to whom they are declaring a child protection interest.</p>
	<p pid="d.1525W.0/7">The Government will ensure that the police are issued with comprehensive guidance on all stages of the pilot process, and are currently working with the four force areas participating in the pilot to develop the disclosure process.</p>
	<p pid="d.1525W.0/8">The extent of information disclosed under the pilot process will be considered on a case by cases basis by the MAPPA authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.1525W.0/9">It is intended that the statutory duty will come into force following Royal Assent being given to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, by means of a Commencement Order. It is intended that the pilots will commence this summer.</p>

	<p pid="d.1528W.9/2">Building Schools for the Future aims to renew all secondary school in England where there is need in 15 waves of investment which started in 2005-06. In early 2005, we announced the national programme for Building Schools for the Future, based on the expressions of interest for inclusion in the programme which authorities proposed. Expressions of interest include how authorities group their schools into geographically coherent projects. These projects were prioritised on the average social and educational need of the schools in them. Information on the national programme is available in the Parliamentary libraries. West Sussex proposed three projects, which are prioritised in waves 10 to 15. Later this year, when we have consulted on management of the later waves of the programme, we will invite authorities to revise their expressions of interest if they wish.</p>

This guidance was issued along with Circular LAC (2002)17 under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970, requiring local authorities to comply with it. The guidance sets out how local authorities and their partner agencies are expected to respond when young people go missing from their care placements. It includes information about measures that local authorities should put in place to prevent children from going missing as well as on reporting incidents. One of its requirements is that each local authority must appoint a designated senior manager to be responsible for monitoring missing from care incidents to identify any trends and to instigate any action necessary to respond to children's' needs ensuring that they are properly safeguarded.</p>

This sets out our intention to update and re-issue guidance to the Children Act 1989 and subsequent legislation. As part of this process we will be reviewing our 2002 guidance. This will provide us with the opportunity to consider whether in future we should include more information about how local authorities carry out their responsibilities to monitor any patterns and trends relating to children going missing from their care placements.</p>

	<p pid="d.1535W.5/1">In the 2006-08 period, funding for this activity was included as part of Sure Start, Early Years and Childcare Grant which covered not only child care sustainability but support for early years outcomes, quality and inclusion. A number of different factors were used to determine the allocations and these included numbers of children, deprivation measures, Ofsted registered stock figures, and rurality measures. In addition, for the 2008-11 period, an inflationary uplift was added to this wider allocation block above and the resulting funding was split equally between child care sufficiency and access and early years outcomes, quality and inclusion. These funding streams sit within the wider revenue block of the Sure Start, Early Years and Childcare Grant and the overall allocations were smoothed to ensure that each authority received a minimum increase of 5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="d.1539W.5/1">In private law child proceedings, where parents come to court for an order to determine the child's primary residence or the frequency of contact with a non-resident parent the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) introduced a new process in 2005. This means that when making an application for a child contact/residence order, allegations of domestic violence are expected to be raised at the point of the application. Courts are now required to consider whether any incidents of domestic violence&mdash;not just from direct violence but also from witnessing violence&mdash;have had an adverse impact on the child, or might affect the child in the future.</p>
	<p pid="d.1539W.5/2">An evaluation of this new system was commissioned by the MOJ. The report, 'Domestic Violence and the Supplemental Information Form C1A: An evaluation of the Introduction of the Form into the Family Courts' was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-11">11 December 2007</phrase> [MoJ 17/07]. It confirmed that the new arrangements are providing an improved mechanism that enables domestic violence and associated harm to parents and children to be recognised at an early point in proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="d.1539W.5/3">In public law child proceedings where local authorities apply for care or supervision orders, domestic violence concerns are a feature of about 50 per cent. of cases, though there is usually a range of other concerns, such as child abuse and alcohol or substance misuse.</p>

	<p pid="d.1540W.2/4">Additionally, Dr. Tanya Byron as part of her review on harmful internet content and games has made some recommendations on measures that strengthen these arrangements. She proposes lowering the statutory requirement to classify video games to 12+, so that it is the same as film classification and easier for parents to understand; issuing clear and consistent guidance for industry on how games should be advertised and challenging industry to provide sustained and high profile efforts to increase parents' understanding of age ratings and improved parental controls.</p>
	<p pid="d.1540W.2/5">Dr. Byron is clear that before any changes are implemented, there is a need for a consultation exercise on what exactly the changes should be. Government are committed to that public consultation and there will be a chance for everyone to contribute once the consultation is under way.</p>

	<p pid="d.1540W.5/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.1540W.5/4" class="indent">Between 2002 and 2005 in secondary schools and between 2003 and 2005 in primary schools, inspectors made an overall judgement about the quality of teaching in citizenship. These judgements were made using a seven point scale: excellent, very good, good, satisfactory, unsatisfactory, poor and very poor. The information is presented in the table attached.</p>
	<p pid="d.1540W.5/5" class="indent">From September 2005, Ofsted stopped specific subject reporting in Section 5 school inspections. Since then, Ofsted has inspected citizenship in a sample of schools. In the lessons observed that were mainly focused on citizenship objectives, teaching was generally good. Often, however, this was because of the good generic skills of teachers and there were weaknesses in specialist aspects of teaching such as dealing with topical and controversial issues. In some schools, the benefits of specialist training were apparent in the quality of the teaching. In approaching one in five of the schools, teaching was unsatisfactory, with weak subject knowledge evident. Important aspects of teaching citizenship, such as discussion, were limited. Sometimes teachers made links from other subjects to citizenship that were insubstantial and failed to add up to a sensible curriculum overall. In some of the schools where teaching was weaker, this was because it was taught by large non-specialist teams; and in some of these schools a decision had been made to move to greater specialism.</p>
	<p pid="d.1540W.5/6" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Jim Knight MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="d.1546W.8/2">The 2008-09 Grant Letter to the Learning and Skills Council sets out a record level of investment for post 16 education and training over the next three years, with some &pound;11.5 billion in 2008-09, raising to over &pound;12 billion in 2009-10, and over &pound;12.5 billion in 2010-11. This investment includes year on year increases in capital funding, and will ensure that we can continue to deliver the significant improvement in participation and attainment across all areas of the country, giving both young people and adults the skills and qualifications they need to succeed.</p>
	<p pid="d.1546W.8/3">Decisions about allocations to specific areas are made by the LSC based on overall learner numbers and strategic discussions with local partners about the range of provision that is needed. The allocations process for 2008/09 is currently under way and Mark Haysom the chief executive of the LSC has written to the hon. Member setting out the funding allocations for East Devon as soon as they have been confirmed and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid="d.1546W.8/4" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-09">9 April 2008</phrase>:</p>

	<p pid="d.1546W.8/35" class="indent">As you know, there are complex patterns of 16-18 learner participation in the East Devon Area with many students choosing to access courses at Richard Huish College in Taunton, Exeter College or elsewhere. The designated further education institute for the area is East Devon College in Tiverton and LSC funding information is provided for this College. The 2008-09 academic for funding is provisional at the moment but is a guaranteed minimum and, in reality, is unlikely to change.

	<p pid="d.1546W.8/38" class="indent">Bicton College, a specialist land based FE provider, is based in the East Devon District Council area.

	<p pid="d.1546W.8/40" class="indent">The LSC also invests significantly in the delivery of apprenticeships training but financial details related to specific home postcodes of apprentices are difficult and expensive to produce.

	<p pid="d.1550W.5/10">The general rise in secondary standards nationally and in Sunderland since 1997 may be attributed to improvements in teaching and learning, better school leadership, targeted intervention to tackle school failure, better use of pupil performance data and the ambitious targets that schools and local authorities have set for their pupils. Challenge and support through the National Secondary Strategy has also helped to raise standards in the last three years.</p>
	<p pid="d.1550W.5/11">As part of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's budget for 2008, the Government have now committed a new &pound;200 million package, over the next three years, for a National Challenge to raise standards in secondary schools, with the particular focus on those schools where fewer than 30 per cent. of pupils achieve five or more good GCSEs including English and mathematics. The National Challenge programme will provide intensive support for the most vulnerable secondary schools, and will empower many head teachers of strong schools to help turn around other schools that are unable to raise low attainment. The programme will help create new trusts and federations based on successful schools; and, in areas of greatest need, drive forward a faster expansion of the academies programme.</p>

	<p pid="d.1553W.2/1">These are matters for Ofsted and the Training and Development Agency for Schools. HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to the hon. Member and a copy of her reply has been placed in the Library. A response from the Training and Development Agency for Schools will be sent to the hon. Member and placed in the Library in due course.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/4" class="indent">You asked what steps Ofsted has taken in response to the recommendations of the National Foundation for Educational Research report 'Vision versus pragmatism'. The question has also been passed to the Training and Development Agency for Schools so that they may reply separately.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/5" class="indent">The NFER report 'Vision versus pragmatism' is the fifth annual report in a longitudinal research study. In summary, it recommends that Ofsted:</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/6" class="indent">take a broader view of citizenship to include whole-school and the wider community</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/7" class="indent">ensure that schools are fully aware of the guidance on citizenship in section 5 inspections and ensure that statutory requirements are met</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/8" class="indent">draw more attention to the place of citizenship in school self-evaluation and Joint Area Reviews</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/9" class="indent">continue to consult with children and young people to strengthen the student voice</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/10" class="indent">give more focus to issues of continuity and progression in citizenship.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/11" class="indent">Ofsted already takes a broad view of citizenship. Inspectors evaluate the quality of personal development and well-being which includes school, local, and global dimensions. Additionally, schools now have a statutory duty to promote community cohesion, which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September 2007</phrase>. From <phrase class="date" code="">1 September 2008</phrase>, Ofsted has a duty, under section 5 of the Education Act 2005, to report on the contribution made by schools to community cohesion. We are currently trialling our proposed approach to inspecting this aspect.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/12" class="indent">When evaluating how well learners contribute to the community, inspectors are specifically asked to consider the development of learners' understanding of citizenship ('Using the evaluation schedule: Guidance for inspectors of schools', September 2007). The self-evaluation form requires schools to assess their compliance with statutory requirements. During inspection, aspects of citizenship are evaluated when inspectors judge the quality of the curriculum. Any non-compliance with statutory requirements is brought to the school's attention, and may be a key issue for improvement.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/13" class="indent">Discussion with children and young people is an integral part of all inspections and their views are fully taken into account. The annual TellUs3 survey in 2008 asks children and young people for their views on their satisfaction with local services. It specifically asks them about outcomes relating to Every Child Matters, one aspect of which is their contribution to the community. The results of the survey are considered by inspectors undertaking Annual Performance Assessments and Joint Area Reviews. In 2007 over 100,000 children and young people responded to the TellUs2 survey. The Joint Annual Review programme comes to an end in 2008 and will be replaced by the Comprehensive Areas Assessment process from 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/14" class="indent">Ofsted's subject survey programme provides for the inspection of citizenship in a sample of schools and inspectors seek evidence of standards and progress. This year the survey includes a small sample of primary schools to provide evidence of the extent to which schools are following the non-statutory guidance and the resulting standards.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/15" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Jim Knight MP, Minister of State for Children, Schools and Families and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="d.1554W.2/14">Ofsted data on closures include registered places in settings which are transferring ownership, and in settings which move from one Ofsted category to another, not just in those which are ceasing trading. For example, if a full day care provider moved to offering sessional provision, this would be recorded as a 'closed' full day care setting and an 'opened' sessional day care setting. The Ofsted data therefore exaggerates the true extent of turnover.</p>

Funding for EAL children has fully kept pace with these increasing numbers through:</p>
	<p pid="d.1563W.0/2" class="indent">an element within the dedicated schools grant (DSG) for primary schools which was some &pound;256 million in 2004-05, rising to &pound;299 million in 2007-08, with a further rise to over &pound;330 million in 2010-11&mdash;an 11 per cent. real terms increase on the 2004-05 level;</p>
	<p pid="d.1563W.0/3" class="indent">a substantial provision for EAL through the ring fenced ethnic minority achievement grant (EMAG), which has risen from &pound;162 million in 2004-05 to &pound;179 million in 2007-08 and will rise to &pound;206 million by 2010-11&mdash;a 9 per cent. increase on the 2004-05 level;</p>
	<p pid="d.1563W.0/4" class="indent">in addition an exceptional circumstances grant (ECG) has been introduced to reflect changes in local authorities' pupil numbers which occur after the three year indicative allocations of DSG have been announced.</p>
	<p pid="d.1563W.0/5">These increases form part of the substantial overall increase in school funding: over the past 10 years since 1997, overall per pupil revenue funding for schools has increased by 67 per cent. in real terms, We expect local authorities to be able to manage new pressures from within these increases, and to ensure that the resources reach the individual schools affected by new arrivals and EAL speakers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1563W.0/6">The Government's policy is to encourage rapid English language acquisition as the key to successful integration into the UK education system and the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="d.1563W.0/7">Newly arrived pupils are given additional help in learning English by specialist advisers and teachers of English as an additional language (EAL) and bilingual classroom assistants, who work in collaboration with classroom teachers to plan lessons and teaching materials. The evidence indicates that EAL pupils typically catch up with their peers in attainment terms within two years of first admission to a school a England.</p>
	<p pid="d.1563W.0/8">The Government have recently launched a new arrivals excellence programme intended to provide practical support for local authorities, schools and individual teachers. This programme is backed by other practical support including measures to improve the supply, training and qualifications of EAL specialist staff, and to deliver new web-based teaching and learning materials.</p>

	<p pid="d.1565W.8/1">We do not know how many schools have been fitted with carbon monoxide detectors. Carbon monoxide detectors are not required under any statutory regulation but a number of local authorities have installed CO detectors in some or all of their schools following risk assessments. They have been installed in locations such as boiler rooms, kitchens and other areas containing gas fired appliances. They have been installed in primary and secondary schools and in both new and existing schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.1565W.8/2">DCSF, HSE, HPA and CORGI encourage the use of carbon monoxide detectors as part of a strategy for safe combustion in schools. However, regular maintenance, testing and inspection of gas and fossil fuel fired appliances are of paramount importance. The principles of gas safety, enforced by the gas safely regulations, rely on thorough testing at initial commissioning and regular maintenance by certified engineers thereafter. It is good practice to inspect and test all gas, oil and solid fuel fired appliances every year. As far as we know no official guidance has been issued to schools on the use of carbon monoxide alarms in schools.</p>

	<p pid="d.1570W.2/1">Although funding arrangements do not provide financial incentives to join consortia we believe that working in partnership offers schools the opportunity to deliver high quality educational provision for best value. Indeed working with other schools is fundamental to delivery of key policies such as extended services and personalisation.</p>
	<p pid="d.1570W.2/2">In autumn 2007 the Department commissioned a study to assess the activities through which schools can operate more efficiently. Collaborative working, through arrangements such as federation or consortia, was identified as one mechanism in which schools may deliver improvements in value for money.</p>
	<p pid="d.1570W.2/3">The merged governing body of a federation is able to make budget and staffing decisions jointly on behalf of all its schools. Working in a federation may allow schools to realise financial savings and to provide better value for money. This could be achieved by employing shared staff, acquiring joint facilities and equipment, or by rationalising duplicated functions.</p>

	<p pid="d.1573W.2/2">We believe that smaller, more highly skilled governing bodies, alongside improved governor training will provide more effective governance for schools, As we indicated in the Children's Plan, we will be consulting stakeholders on reducing the size of governing bodies.

	<p pid="d.1574W.2/1">Guidance on incorporating biomass-heating and other renewable and low carbon technologies in new schools is provided on our website. Biomass heating has been installed in many schools but biomass cooling has not been used. Schools have little demand for cooling, and where there is a need for cooling this can be achieved effectively using other low carbon energy sources. The potential to use biomass for cooling in schools is likely to be limited to large scale community energy schemes serving mixed-use developments that include school buildings.</p>

	<p pid="d.1575W.3/4" class="indent">Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September 2005</phrase>, there have been two categories of schools causing concern. These are:</p>

	<p pid="d.1575W.3/6" class="indent">'Schools requiring significant improvement'&mdash;those that, when inspected, were performing significantly less well than they might in all the circumstances reasonably be expected to perform. These schools are issued a 'Notice to Improve' and judged inadequate but, unlike special measures schools, demonstrate the capacity to improve.</p>
	<p pid="d.1575W.3/7" class="indent">Prior to the launch of the new school inspection framework in September 2005, the categories included 'serious weaknesses', 'underachieving schools' and 'inadequate sixth form'. These categories no longer exist.</p>
	<p pid="d.1575W.3/8" class="indent">The names of all schools that have been in categories of concern since 2003, broken down by local authority, are published each term on the Ofsted website at <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk">http://www.ofsted.gov.uk</a>.

Our aim is that over time the qualification should be open to all teachers and our expectation is that every teacher would want to complete it at some stage in their career. We propose to begin by targeting the masters mainly on teachers in the first five years of their careers, building on initial teacher training and induction. The Training and Development Agency for Schools has been asked to start developing the programme.

	<p pid="d.1585W.2/1">The Department has no plans to review the rules on the transferability of Enhanced Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) Disclosures. We are not aware of any adverse effects arising from the rules relating to transferability. We are aware of the fact that there are often extra costs relating to temporary teachers if their employers insist on new Disclosures every time they change post or agency. This is however the decision of individual employers and not a result of our guidance to schools and teaching supply agencies. We issued our principal guidance document on safeguarding for schools &quot;Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education&quot; in 2006. Within this guidance we clearly set out that CRB Enhanced Disclosure certificates could be reused by those teachers moving schools, local authorities, or further education colleges, provided that all other recommended safer recruitment checks had been carried out satisfactorily and that the gap between leaving their old employment and taking up their new post was not more than three months. The CRB has produced a comprehensive Portability Framework document which sets out the issues relating to the reuse of Disclosure certificates, and this can obtained from the CRB website at:</p>

	<p pid="d.1585W.2/3">The Department's Educational Procurement Centre (EPC) is currently undertaking a Temporary Workers in Education project. This aims to provide schools (initially in London) with an accessible, quality driven electronic one stop shop for their temporary support staff requirements. All participating agencies will hold the DCSF Recruitment Employment Confederation (REC) Quality Mark, thereby meeting the requirements of the &quot;Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education&quot; guidance. All London boroughs will be able to benefit from a safe and value adding central service, reducing their own resourcing requirement in relation to temporary staff.</p>

	<p pid="d.1592W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-17">17 March</phrase> the Department, working with the Learning and Skills Council, launched the first phase of a new high-profile marketing campaign to encourage adults in England to improve their numeracy skills. In addition, the Department is working with the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics and a range of partners to develop a new plan for meeting the numeracy challenge. This plan, to be published in the coming months, will ensure increased demand, supply and quality of adult numeracy provision.</p>
	<p pid="d.1592W.2/2">Good numeracy skills are crucial to life and work. Free numeracy courses are available to adults in England through the Government's &quot;Skills for Life&quot; strategy, which was launched in 2001. We are currently committed to improving the numeracy and literacy skills of 2.25 million adults by 2010. So far, 1,759,000 adults have improved their skills and gained a first qualification, and we are on course to meet the 2010 target.</p>
	<p pid="d.1592W.2/3">Our longer term ambition, as set out in &quot;World Class Skills&quot;, is for 95 per cent. of adults to have functional numeracy skills by 2020, up from 79 per cent. in 2005. To achieve this trajectory the Learning and Skills Council's recent &quot;Statement of Priorities&quot; set out plans to deliver 390,000 numeracy achievements at Entry Level 3 or above during the period 2008 to 2011.</p>

	<p pid="d.1593W.2/1">Ex-prisoners, who have been released on licence at the end of their term in custody, are able to apply for the Adult Learning Grant (ALG) subject to meeting the full eligibility criteria. The grant is primarily intended to help individuals in work with low skills and on low incomes; individuals receiving out of work benefits are not eligible for ALG. Participants must be undertaking full time learning for their first full Level 2 or first full Level 3 qualification. Serving prisoners who are released on temporary licence to attend college are not eligible for ALG.</p>
	<p pid="d.1593W.2/2">The 'on licence' process helps offenders re-build their lives, return to their families and gain work. For those offenders wishing to gain qualifications, ALG can help support them in that learning. ALG has been available throughout England since September 2007 and during its pilot phase showed that it was successful at helping more individuals complete their training and gain a qualification.</p>

	<p pid="d.1595W.5/1">In 2004-05, both HEFCE and the then DfES made additional, one-off, contributions to the Aimhigher budget. The funds were from underspends elsewhere, and amounted to over &pound;25 million in total. In 2004, Ministers reviewed the programme and, in the light of the decision to introduce the Higher Education Grant, decided to reduce expenditure on Aimhigher to help fund the increases in student support, thereby providing more money directly to students from less well-off backgrounds. The growth in expenditure on student support was shown in the answer to Question 172276.</p>
	<p pid="d.1595W.5/2">The Government remain committed to Aimhigher and recently announced its extension to 2011. The Government and HEFCE have together allocated &pound;239.5 million for the three years. This represents a substantial investment and is an indication of our continuing commitment to widen participation in higher education in line with the country's social and economic needs. More young people than ever before are applying to go to university. As of <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-15">15 January 2008</phrase>, 311,741 people from England applied through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) for 2008 HE entry, an increase of 7.1 per cent. on the same point of the previous year. Of the 18-year-olds and under applying for whom social class background is known, 28.9 per cent. are from lower socio-economic groups, up from 28.2 per cent. in 2007.</p>

	<p pid="d.1597W.0/1">There are no reliable estimates available. However, using the Annual Population Survey it is possible to calculate approximate estimates of the unemployment rates for those who hold an apprenticeship for various occupational groups. The following table shows for those holding an apprenticeship estimates for 2006 for the 10 minor occupational groupings with the highest unemployment rates. It should be noted that the apprenticeship may have been gained at any point in the respondents' working life and therefore will include many old trade apprenticeships. The occupation groupings are based on current job (if employed) and last job (if unemployed) and these may not be the same as the occupation grouping of the apprenticeship held. The analysis is for England and covers females aged 19-59 and males aged 19-64. These estimates are based on small samples and are not robust as the confidence intervals shown in the table make clear.</p>
	<p pid="d.1597W.0/2">Taking all those holding an apprenticeship does provide robust estimates and for 2006 the ILO unemployment rate for those holding an apprenticeship was 2.8 per cent. compared with 4.8 per cent. for all adults aged 19-59/64.</p>

	<p pid="d.1600W.8/1">The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) is a relatively new Department, formed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-28">28 June 2007</phrase>. As a general rule because most of the events that we organise are held during the working day, we rarely use the public purse to purchase alcohol. The majority of our catered events supply tea, coffee, water or juice.</p>
	<p pid="d.1600W.8/2">DIUS has provided wine at only four meetings, two of which were receptions involving journalists, and the other two were planning meetings in the evening and involving a small group of college principals.</p>
	<p pid="d.1600W.8/3">Events sponsored by DIUS where wine is served are consequently few in number and if wine is ordered, the question of whether the wine is Fairtrade is only one of the factors that is taken into consideration, however contracts for catering services and supplies are awarded on the basis of the best value for money for the taxpayer. We have no record of whether the wine purchased on our behalf was Fairtrade wine.</p>
	<p pid="d.1600W.8/4">Nevertheless, the catering companies used by the Department do supply Fairtrade products.</p>

	<p pid="d.1605W.5/1">DIUS is a new and relatively small Government Department, with the second smallest headcount in Whitehall. A member of the DIUS Departmental Board has been appointed as &quot;diversity champion&quot; to drive forward our commitment to diversity and a Diversity and Inclusion Programme Board has been established to set and deliver an effective strategy. We have already identified a number of priorities for intervention and the actions we will take to underpin them. These include the creation of a single database of information about the composition of our workforce so that we can assess our performance on equality and diversity relative to others and ensure that we are targeting action appropriately. We have also committed in principle to the setting of targets on representation within our workforce, including of disabled employees, with clear dates for achievement. This will form part of the wider proposition to employees and prospective employees of DIUS but at present the work is not sufficiently developed to indicate specific targets.</p>

	<p pid="d.1608W.2/1">The demand for English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) courses ties been very high with funding and enrolments across England tripling since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="d.1608W.2/2">Detailed information on ESOL funding and enrolments is collected by the Learning and Skills Council (LSG) but this does not extend to waiting lists. However, some institutions, particularly in London, have suggested they have waiting lists of up to 24 months.</p>
	<p pid="d.1608W.2/3">A number of ESOL funding measures were introduced from August 2007 to help vulnerable learners. The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills has commissioned a report to look at the impact of these measures. The interim findings indicate a continuing high level of demand for ESOL and that the learner profile seems to be changing in some colleges, with more enrolments onto evening than daytime classes. A full report is planned for early spring.</p>
	<p pid="d.1608W.2/4">The national comprehensive spending review (CSR) has fixed ESOL spending until 2010 and participation figures in London have been forecast to align with this. London Learning and Skills Council has negotiated an increase in the size of its employer responsive budget for 2008-09 due to the specific socio-economic needs of London and ESOL needs for the individual and employers will be addressed within this.</p>
	<p pid="d.1608W.2/5">In addition, the London Learning and Skills Council is expanding the offer of ESOL Skills for Life to Entry Levels 1 and 2 within the train to gain service. The service will also be expanded to include the new ESOL for Work qualifications. This enables a greater flexibility for employers and individuals in accessing ESOL.</p>

	<p pid="d.1609W.2/1">The Government have put adult skills at the heart of their strategy for long-term prosperity and social justice. The total Government investment in further education has increased by 52 per cent. in real terms between 1997-98 and 2006-07 and we are committed to further increases in adult participation funded through the Learning and Skills Council to &pound;3.6 billion in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="d.1609W.2/2">Since 2001 the Government have invested over &pound;3 billion through the Skills for Life Strategy.

	<p pid="d.1610W.3/1">The Government offer a range of support for adults to enable them to get the skills they need for their career, or for progression, in whatever way best suits their needs, including both full and part-time provision.</p>
	<p pid="d.1610W.3/2">We have put in place a different set of support arrangements for learners on full Level 3 courses in Further Education, compared to home-based university undergraduates. Our priority for Level 3 entitlement learners is to help young adults to complete their initial education and provide full fee remission to protect them from increases in FE fees and learner support for those on low incomes; the Adult Learning Grant pays up to &pound;30 per week during term times to help with learning costs for those studying for a first full Level 3 (or first full Level 2) qualification. They may then go on to higher education and take advantage of HE student support, or progress to higher skills training and/or employment. HE students undertake longer, more expensive courses, with higher additional incidental costs, such as books and materials, which is why the financial support arrangements are not directly comparable.</p>
	<p pid="d.1610W.3/3">We already have a strong package of measures in place to help young adults achieve advanced Level 3 qualifications. In the Budget, the Chancellor announced an additional &pound;60 million over the next three years for advanced Level 3 skills. This will allow more individuals to get the skills they need to get second chances and unlock their talents. We will be exploring new and innovative approaches to delivering training that individuals and employers need.</p>
	<p pid="d.1610W.3/4">These new resources will move us a step closer to realising our ambitious vision for universal Skills Accounts where adults will be able to access significant investment in their skills, including an Apprenticeships credit to cover training costs. We will be undertaking trials of Skills Accounts in 2008/09 and 2009/10, with national roll-out from 2010. And increasing the number of Advanced Apprenticeships will be a key focus for these additional resources, building on the recommendations of the recent Apprenticeships review.</p>

	<p pid="d.1611W.2/1">Following the creation of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills in June 2007 the Secretary of State, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Skills and I led an internal review of the post-19 skills landscape. The review considered a functional analysis of England's skills policy delivery mechanisms and was informed by stakeholder and other expert views given in confidence. The options examined for possible reconfigurations of the functions of the skills landscape were wide-ranging and comprehensive, as befits an organisational review following a major change in the Machinery of Government. The mechanism for the review was a series of ministerial submissions and discussions, focusing in on preferred options in an iterative process; no consolidated 'options analysis' covering the entire work of the internal review was compiled. The internal review resulted in the proposals published in Raising Expectations: Enabling the system to deliver, which are presented for external consultation until <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-09">9 June 2008</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="d.1612W.5/15">The changes in the number of higher education enrolments at further education colleges will have been affected by the transfer of institutions from the further education sector to the higher education sector. The number of higher education enrolments at further education colleges will also have been affected by the transfer of higher education activity from further education colleges to higher education institutions under franchising arrangements. Franchising is a process where students take a course delivered by an institution on behalf of another institution and this often occurs between higher education institutions and further education colleges.</p>

We also know that they recovered strongly for 2007/08, to resume an upward trend. The numbers fall of 2006/07 has affected the HEJPR for that year. Unsurprisingly it has fallen. A year from now, we will know how the counterbalancing rises of 2007/08 will affect the HEIPR, We expect to see an increase in the HEIPR.</p>

However, we asked the Higher Education Funding Council for England to consult extensively on the details of how our decision might best be implemented and our final proposals reflect the results of that consultation.</p>

The Department does not therefore issue guidance in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.1620W.5/2">I have been reassured by the Supporting Professionalism in Admissions (SPA) team, who provide a centre of expertise in admissions matters, that such practices are not a feature of university admissions, despite press suggestions to the contrary, I expect admissions officers to continue to select suitable candidates based on their achievements and potentially as they do now. Social and other networking sites will not provide reliable and authenticated evidence of the kind required to support such important decisions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1620W.5/3">As outlined above HE institutions operate within a legal framework in relation to recruitment, like other employers. As such, they would be responsible for determining their legal position if they chose to make use of material that candidates' have placed in the public domain in their recruitment processes. Institutions must comply with the law and in our view they should also comply with best practice in their recruitment processes.</p>

	<p pid="d.1620W.8/20">The figures indicate that international student numbers on first degrees at English higher education institutions have increased by nearly 62 per cent. since 1997. This is very much a success story as these students contribute to the cultural mix, the research capacity and the finances of our institutions. The growth of international student numbers has not been at the expense of home students as they are not in competition with each other for places and it can be seen that the number of home students has also increased by over 128,000 during this ten year period.</p>

	<p pid="d.1623W.5/1">Mature students are generally eligible for the same student support package as other students. For full-time students, fee loans of up to &pound;3,070 (&pound;3,145 in 2008/09) ensure that no one has to pay their fees upfront. Students under the age of 60 are eligible for maintenance loans of up to &pound;6,315 (&pound;6,475 in 2008/09)<sup>(1)</sup>. Means-tested grants of up to &pound;2,765 (&pound;2,835 in 2008/09) are available to new students. From 2008/09, we are increasing the income thresholds so that many more students will be eligible to receive a grant. At least one third of all students will receive a full grant; and two-thirds a partial grant. Students may also qualify for a bursary from their higher education institution.</p>
	<p pid="d.1623W.5/2">In addition, students with dependants can claim additional grants including: adult dependants grant worth up to &pound;2,510 (&pound;2,575 in 2008/09); parents learning allowance worth up to &pound;1,435 (&pound;1,470 in 2008/09); and child care grant worth up to &pound;7,735 for one child and &pound;13,260 for two or more children.</p>
	<p pid="d.1623W.5/3">Students may also apply for support from the Access to Learning Fund, a university-administered fund for students experiencing financial hardship. Student parents are eligible to receive child tax credit from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. Mature students who do not qualify for undergraduate student support may be eligible for a Career Development Loan which has an element of subsidy from public funds.</p>
	<p pid="d.1623W.5/4">Students over 25 years of age are treated as independent, and are assessed on their own income (and the income of their spouse or partner where applicable) and not on the income of their parents.</p>
	<p pid="d.1623W.5/5">Extra support for the disabled is available in the form of Disabled Students' Allowances (DSAs). DSAs can help students in higher education with the additional costs they may incur on their course as a direct result of a disability.</p>
	<p pid="d.1623W.5/6">Part-time mature students receive the same support as other part-time students. A fee grant of up to &pound;1,150 (&pound;1,180 in 2008/09) is available, depending on the intensity of the course, together with a course grant of up to &pound;250 (&pound;255 in 2008/09). Disabled Students' Allowances (DSAs) are available to part-time HE students. The Access to Learning Fund (ALF) provides a child care grant which offers a contribution to child care costs for eligible part-time students. Students must have received confirmation that they are entitled to statutory support. During the time it takes to receive this confirmation institutions can, if they wish, provide help with child care from ALF to ensure that child care can be secured from the start of the course.</p>
	<p pid="d.1623W.5/7" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> This is the maximum amount available to students studying in London. Students studying elsewhere can receive up to &pound;4,510 (&pound;4,625 in 2008/09).</p>

	<p pid="d.1626W.8/1">The National Employer Skills Survey (NESS) 2005 for England has the most current publicly available data on skill shortages. The 2005 survey shows that 143,125 employers reported at least one skills shortage vacancy (SSV). Of these, construction accounted for 11,900 skill shortage vacancies. Forecast data by ConstructionSkills anticipates that to meet the demand for new workers, the construction industry in England will need to recruit 74,340 people per annum between 2008 to 2012. The NESS 2005 also shows that 12,900 vacancies in hospitality, leisure, travel and tourism arise as a result of a skills shortage. People 1st research indicates that chef and managerial vacancies are hardest to fill. Updated data on skill shortage vacancies will be available when the NESS 2007 is published after the end of March.</p>

	<p pid="d.1627W.5/2">All schools receive devolved formula capital allocations for their immediate investment needs. In each year 2008-09 to 2010-11 this will be calculated on the basis of &pound;18,500 plus &pound;94.50 per secondary school pupil, if the school is unmodernised. Modernised schools will receive half that amount. Resources are also allocated at local authority level, for authorities to invest in accordance with local investment priorities. In the case of these four schools, they will form part of Stoke's Building Schools for the Future project. Construction is expected to begin for these schools in the latter half of the three year period, but there are no firm timescales at this stage.</p>

Furthermore, HESA allows only one reason for withdrawal to be recorded, however it is likely that many students leave for a combination of reasons.</p>

The fee loan is up to &pound;3,070 in 2007/08 (&pound;3,145 in 2008/09, The Student Loans Company pay the tuition fee direct to higher education institutions; the loan is repaid after graduation on the same terms as loans for maintenance.

	<p pid="d.1632W.5/1">The director for fair access is responsible for ensuring that universities have satisfactory access agreements in place as a pre-condition of charging variable fees and for ensuring that institutions comply with these obligations. A range of sanctions is available to the director if a university is found to be in breach. In 2006-07, the director has reported that all universities have complied with the obligations in their access agreements.</p>
	<p pid="d.1632W.5/2">The question rests on a misunderstanding of how bursaries work. Institutions do not allocate a fixed amount of expenditure for bursaries. They have made forecasts of the costs of their bursaries packages, but these have always contained a level of uncertainty for methodological reasons. Additionally, a number of universities forecast their highest level of overall payment rather than the most probable outcome.</p>
	<p pid="d.1632W.5/3">I have always made it clear that where a university is spending less than it had anticipated on bursaries, it would be right to spend on other activities to encourage widening participation, which will not normally be reported under the access agreement. The Russell Group and the 1994 Group of universities and individual institutions have supported this policy.</p>

	<p pid="d.1635W.5/1">Business engagement in different forms is increasingly a mainstream activity for every university. Over 90 per cent. provide an inquiry point for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and over 80 per cent. provide short bespoke courses on company premises. It is for individual higher education institutions (HEIs) to decide the nature of their engagement with business, including whether to twin with a business champion.</p>
	<p pid="d.1635W.5/2">However, the demands imposed by global competition mean that Government have a key role to play in creating the conditions within which individual HEIs develop a range of mutually beneficial collaborations with appropriate businesses and employer partners. For example, we have provided the funding to enable the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) to deliver its 'Transforming Workforce Development' programme of activities, which is set to enable a wide range of HEIs to work more closely with businesses in supporting work force development. This will allow growth in a new form of higher education, co-funded by employers, that will deliver higher level skills provision that meets business needs.</p>

	<p pid="d.1637W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence records instances of heat illness, as part of its monitoring of climatic injury. Heat illness has traditionally been divided into heat exhaustion and heat stroke, but in practice it is difficult to define the division between the two. Heat illness is therefore used to cover a continuum of illness ranging from mild symptoms such as muscular weakness, headache and excess fatigue to collapse, coma and death.</p>
	<p pid="d.1637W.6/2">In Iraq in 2006, 71 service personnel were recorded with a climatic illness, of whom 21 were bedded down in a medical facility as a result. In 2007, 90 service personnel were recorded with a climatic illness of whom nine were bedded down. In Iraq, the temperature and humidity can change very quickly, increasing the likelihood of sudden instances of heat illness.</p>
	<p pid="d.1637W.6/3">In Afghanistan, between August 2006 (when data collection started) and the end of 2007, 91 personnel were recorded with a climatic injury of whom 32 were bedded down.</p>
	<p pid="d.1637W.6/4">These figures provide an indication of instances of heat illness. It is likely that there have been other cases of heat injury which could not be identified from the available records as they may have been recorded under a variety of symptoms (e.g. dehydration, headache etc.) common to other illnesses.</p>

While works had been completed in a timely fashion, many orders had not been closed on the system. It is believed that the repair was completed in less than 324 days, but was recorded retrospectively on our repair reporting system. The system has since been updated to ensure that similar anomalies do not occur in the future. The change in process has, however, meant that it is not now possible to retrieve details of this repair.</p>

	<p pid="d.1645W.2/1">Life insurance is optional and is for those requiring additional cover above that provided by the Armed Forces and Reserve Forces Pension and Compensation Schemes. MOD facilitates voluntary insurance arrangements through commercial providers for personnel requiring cover.</p>
	<p pid="d.1645W.2/2">The cover provided by the PAX (for regular) and RPAX schemes (for reserve personnel including the TA) is virtually the same. Both primarily provide personal accident cover, but also include cover for injury and death resulting from war and terrorism, and (at an extra premium) death from natural causes. Both provide personal accident cover for bodily injury that causes permanent disability and also for certain fractures, burns and hospitalisation. The maximum cover for death is &pound;150,000. The maximum catastrophic disability cover is &pound;750,000 for quadriplegia and &pound;400,000 for paraplegia, with up to &pound;300,000 for other disabilities. From <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-01">1 March 2008</phrase> PAX increased its premiums, enhanced its cover for burns and added cover for flesh wounds; these changes will be replicated for RPAX in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="d.1645W.2/3">Service Life Insurance (SLI) provides life cover and was launched by MOD on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-08">8 May 2007</phrase>. SLI guarantees Regular and Reservists (including the TA) worldwide war and terrorism cover, at competitive premiums, throughout their service and beyond. It provides this by means of a unique partnering arrangement with the commercial providers of the scheme, Sterling Life. The maximum life cover available is &pound;200,000.</p>
	<p pid="d.1645W.2/4">MOD's Service Risks Insurance Premium Refunds (SRIPs) scheme contributes towards the inflated life insurance premiums which some insurers charge personnel (both regulars and reservists) in certain high risk trades and those serving on operations. The compensation available is 90 per cent. of the extra premium up to a total sum assured. The latter is increased every year in line with service pay and is currently &pound;162,000.</p>
	<p pid="d.1645W.2/5">Individuals requiring insurance cover can join any insurance scheme they choose and are not obliged to join PAX, RPAX or SLI.</p>

	<p pid="d.1650W.9/1">The Ministry of Defence views the loss of any personal data seriously and takes all the necessary steps following a loss to ensure that individuals are protected as far as possible against the unauthorised use of their personal information. In the recent case of the loss of recruitment data, this has included providing banks with account details where they were held in order that they can monitor accounts for unauthorised activity. In addition, MOD officials were in contact with the Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue and Customs, Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, Identity and Passport Service and the Border and Immigration Agency.</p>

Specifically he will examine: the adequacy of the steps taken to prevent any recurrence; MOD policy, practice and management arrangements in respect of the protection of personal data more generally; and make recommendations. It would therefore be premature to comment on any possible findings from the report.</p>
	<p pid="d.1650W.9/3">The Ministry of Defence has formal processes in place to ensure that suspected leaks of official information, including personal data, are thoroughly investigated. Such enquiries may be conducted by the Ministry of Defence police, service police forces or the civilian police as appropriate. Memorandums of Understanding between the Ministry of Defence and the civilian police are in place detailing respective responsibilities.</p>

It provides, free of charge, even in the most remote areas of Nepal where ex-servicemen live, primary health care including doctors' clinics. In addition it provides secondary health care free for all those not in receipt of a service pension and subsidised by 70 per cent. for those who do have a pension. It is involved in delivering community aid including bridge building, drinking water projects and building schools, which benefits not only the ex-service community but the infrastructure of the country as a whole in the brigade's traditional recruiting areas in the foothills of Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="d.1655W.5/13">The grant in aid is provided by the Department under the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding. The terms of the arrangement are reviewed every five years.</p>

The Status of Forces Agreement does not have a termination date. RAF Menwith Hill will continue to be made available to the United States Visiting Force for as long as it is in our mutual defence interests.</p>
	<p pid="d.1663W.2/2">Under the terms of the agreements which apply to the use of RAF Fylingdales for ballistic missile early warning and ballistic missile defence, the US Government retains ownership and control of all of its assets in the event of either party terminating the Agreements. Should either party decide to terminate the arrangement that currently exists, that party would be obliged to continue its participation until the effective date of termination, so as to minimise the impact to the other participant. In this situation, any costs that are incurred by the terminating participant would not exceed its total financial commitment for jointly approved activities. Outwith these agreements, RAF Fylingdales would remain in place to execute its ballistic missile early warning and space surveillance missions in defence of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="d.1667W.8/1">The security situation in Somalia as a whole remains unstable and volatile. Without the beginnings of a definable peace process and a willingness of Somalis to engage in such a process, a military deployment to stabilize the country is unlikely. Notwithstanding this, the continued efforts of Uganda and Burundi to supply troops to African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) should be commended for bringing an element of security and humanitarian assistance to critical areas of Mogadishu.</p>
	<p pid="d.1667W.8/2">The UK has not carried out a detailed assessment of the force structure required for a military deployment to stabilize the country as this is a task for the UN.

	<p pid="d.1674W.8/15">Over the last 10 years to 2007, alcoholic drinks became on average 25 per cent. more affordable in the on-trade and 33 per cent. more affordable in the off-trade, relative to consumer incomes. Tax increased by four pence per pint and 55 pence per 70cl bottle of spirits in Budget 2008. The percentage of retail prices that these increases represent in 2008-09 will depend on the industry's pricing decisions.</p>

	<p pid="d.1676W.2/1">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) administers and collects VED.</p>
	<p pid="d.1676W.2/2">Budget 2008 reformed the VED structure to strengthen the environmental incentive to develop and purchase fuel-efficient cars. The reforms take effect from 2009-10 and 2010-11. They are forecast to result in rising carbon savings over time as the number of low carbon cars significantly increases. In 2020 the changes are forecast to deliver carbon savings of 0.16 MtCO2. The role of VED also needs to be considered in the context of the wider range of economic and other measures which influence motorists, such as fuel duty, company car tax, European regulations and the labelling scheme in car showrooms.</p>

The disaggregated figures for VED revenues by CO2 emissions banding have been estimated by the DVLA based on DFT data. The figures for 2007-08 are provisional and subject to audit.</p>

The incomes presented here are at a household rather than individual level.  2. The figures are based on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) equalisation factors and are rounded to the nearest 1,000.  3. The national median income of the survey year in question has been used (i.e. the contemporary median) instead of using a fixed median for a particular year. This is consistent with the preferred way of measuring poverty.  4. All figures are shown in nominal terms (i.e. not adjusted for inflation).  5. Median incomes have been provided rather than mean incomes because the income distribution is skewed with some outliers with high incomes.  6. Socio-economic status of household is defined by the socio-economic group of the household reference person, who is defined as the highest income householder without regard to gender.  7. Information by socio-economic group is defined by National Statistics socio-economic classification. This was introduced in 2001 and information on a consistent basis for earlier years is not available. A split between the 'never worked and long-term unemployed' and 'undefined' category is available only from 2003-04.  8. Results cover the United Kingdom, except for 2001-02 where only Great Britain is covered.  <i> Source:</i>  Family Resources Survey.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.1681W.6/1">Since 1997, the Government have sought to support saving and asset ownership for all, from childhood, through working life and into retirement. The Government have introduced ISAs which seek to develop and extend the saving habit; one in five people from low income groups now holds an ISA. The Government have also introduced the Child Trust Fund, which will ensure that, in future, all young people have a financial asset at 18. Personal Accounts, for pension saving, will be introduced in 2012 and will promote saving for retirement. Budget 2008 announced that the Saving Gateway will be introduced nationally, with the first accounts available to savers in 2010. The scheme will provide a financial incentive to save for those on lower incomes through matching (a Government contribution for each pound saved).</p>

	<p pid="d.1684W.2/1">As stated in the Budget 2007 report, the Exchequer cost of extending stamp duty zero-carbon tax relief to flats is expected to rise to around &pound;15 million in 2011-12. This cost takes into account new flats and maisonettes as well as new houses. The stamp duty land tax relief for new zero-carbon homes only applies to residential property.</p>
	<p pid="d.1684W.2/2">Of those transactions for which a stamp duty land tax certificate was issued between <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>, 10 transactions claimed the stamp duty land tax relief for new zero-carbon homes. All of these transactions fell in the 1 per cent. tax band. No data currently exists for April.</p>
	<p pid="d.1684W.2/3">450,368 residential transactions were liable for stamp duty land tax between <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>. No data currently exists for April.</p>
	<p pid="d.1684W.2/4">The tax relief will help kick-start the market for new highly efficient technologies in homes, both for the fabric of the building and in the use of microgeneration, and sets a gold standard for green homes.</p>
	<p pid="d.1684W.2/5">We expect the number of qualifying transactions, including flats and maisonettes, to be initially low in the first few years but to rise as more properties eligible to claim the relief go on the market. For example, in December of last year, the Government announced details of 200 new homes to be built to a zero-carbon standard in Hanham Hall, near Bristol. The media release can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="d.1684W.2/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/611694">http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/corporate/611694</a></p>
	<p pid="d.1684W.2/7">The Government are committed to conducting an interim review of the relief in 2010 which will examine the effectiveness of the relief in stimulating the innovation necessary to ensure that all new homes are built to a zero-carbon standard from 2016.</p>
	<p pid="d.1684W.2/8">The level of fees that an energy assessor can charge for assessing whether a dwelling meets the Treasury's stamp duty land tax zero-carbon standard is purely a commercial decision. However, if the energy assessment is carried out by a Government Department, not in competition with commercial suppliers, then in line with Treasury guidelines on managing public money, the charge cannot exceed the full cost of the service provided without parliamentary approval.</p>

	<p pid="d.1685W.5/1">The stamp duty land tax rules for leases resulted in stamp duty land tax being payable on the upfront premium for any transaction in respect of which the annual rent exceeded &pound;600. In Budget 2008 the Government abolished this rule for residential transactions with effect from Budget day.</p>
	<p pid="d.1685W.5/2">As stated in the 2008 Budget report the Exchequer cost of the abolition of this rule for residential property is projected to be &pound;5 million in each of the fiscal years 2008-09 to 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="d.1685W.5/3">The abolition of this rule will mean that in most cases there will be no stamp duty land tax due upfront for shared ownership schemes. Indeed in the vast majority of cases no stamp duty land tax will be due until the purchaser has acquired at least 80 per cent. of the property. This will support the Government's affordable housing agenda of assisting at least 25,000 households into homeownership through shared ownership and shared equity schemes.</p>
	<p pid="d.1685W.5/4">The open market homebuy scheme is not a shared ownership scheme and will not therefore be affected by our amendment to the stamp duty land tax treatment of shared ownership purchasers. Shared equity schemes, such as the open market homebuy scheme, operate a different structure to shared ownership. Under shared equity schemes the purchaser owns one 100 per cent. of the property from the outset with the help of additional mortgage finance from the Government. The stamp duty land tax treatment of shared equity schemes is no different to the stamp duty land tax treatment of a property bought in the conventional way.</p>

Rules on the use of official residences are set out in the 'Ministerial Code'. There are no formal tenancy agreements in respect of the use of official residences. The liability for any damage to any of the residences would depend on the circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="d.1692W.12/4" class="indent">Consultation with users on their requirements for information from the 2011 Census has identified a demand for a language question to provide information to improve resource allocation at the national and local level and to inform service provision of, for example, the need for translation and interpreter services. There was also some demand expressed for information on the use of specific languages, including BSL. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has subsequently tested a number of variants of a language question, with a view to developing a concise question which is easily understood by respondents and gives reliable results. ONS are currently testing a question on main language used, including BSL through a write-in facility.</p>
	<p pid="d.1692W.12/5" class="indent">A White Paper setting out the proposals for the 2011 Census is scheduled to be published at the end of 2008. However it will not be possible to confirm what questions and response categories are to be included in the 2011 Census until the consultation and question testing programme is complete and formal approval is given by Parliament in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="d.1697W.5/4" class="indent">The Office for national Statistics compiles employment statistics for local areas from the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions. However, data prior to the 12 month period ending December 2004 are not available for this geography due to the redrawing of Scottish parliamentary constituencies in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="d.1697W.5/5" class="indent">Table 1, attached, shows the number of people in employment and the number of unemployed, aged 16 and over resident in the Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey constituency for each of the last three years. Estimates for the 12 months ending September 2007 have also been provided as being the latest data available.</p>
	<p pid="d.1697W.5/6" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in a small geographical area, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="d.1697W.5/7" class="indent">In order to produce estimates for small geographical areas, APS estimates are provided based on survey microdata. These are consistent with the UK population estimates published in February and March 2003, whereas the regional and national estimates published in the Labour Market Statistics First Release are based on more up-to-date population figures, so the two are not directly comparable.</p>

	<p pid="d.1699W.6/4" class="indent">Following the release of the Migration Task Force report ONS made a bid for funding of new work to implement the recommendations made. It was always intended that this would be necessary as the Task Force identified further work over and above that which ONS could have achieved on its own.</p>
	<p pid="d.1699W.6/5" class="indent">In 2007 ONS implemented some improvements to existing population estimates (mainly involving the distribution of international migration between local areas). The future work programme started on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.1699W.6/6" class="indent">In practice ONS has made progress where possible. In particular:</p>
	<p pid="d.1699W.6/7" class="indent">An interim Port Survey Review report was published in October 2007 identifying a series of short-term improvements that will be implemented in 2008. In addition, more emigrants are being sampled in the International Passenger Survey.</p>
	<p pid="d.1699W.6/8" class="indent">ONS published experimental statistics on short term migration at the end of 2007 and is researching the feasibility of producing these at local level.</p>
	<p pid="d.1699W.6/9" class="indent">A step towards more coherent reporting of migration statistics was made in February when the Home Office and ONS published outputs at the same time as a more joined-up package. This approach will be developed throughout 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.1699W.6/10" class="indent">ONS has been working closely with other government departments including DWP and DCSF to explore what administrative data is available and how it might be used to improve migration statistics. A paper was published in late 2007. ONS is also looking at how data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency might be used to improve internal migration estimates at student ages.</p>
	<p pid="d.1699W.6/11" class="indent">ONS and Home Office are working together to define the statistical requirements of the new e-Borders system, gathering data on people as they enter or leave the UK.</p>
	<p pid="d.1699W.6/12" class="indent">ONS published in late 2007 indicators of volumes of migration into and out of local areas.</p>

At the time of publishing, ONS set out the future pathway to achieving the higher quality standards of National Statistics status.

	<p pid="d.1707W.0/1">Cumulative records of small arms imported and immediately re-exported are not maintained. It is therefore not possible to say how many small arms entered the UK and were then immediately re-exported. Information on licences issued for the export of small arms has been published in the Government's quarterly and annual reports on strategic export controls, which can be found on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's website at:</p>

	<p pid="d.1707W.0/3">Licenses for arms exports are considered on a case by case basis and rigorously assessed against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licencing Criteria (&quot;The Code of Conduct&quot;). This takes into account conditions and circumstances in the country of destination and the end use of such arms.</p>
	<p pid="d.1707W.0/4">There is a limited number of exemptions or variations to this rule. For example, in the case of export of small arms by an individual when Part IV, Article 11 (8) or (9) of the Export of Goods, Transfer of Technology and Provision of Technical Assistance (Control) Order 2003, as amended, applies. In such cases an export licence may not be required if the criteria set out in the order can be met. Similarly, an individual could make use of the Open General Export Licence (Accompanied Personal Effects: Sporting Firearms) if they meet the criteria set out in that licence. In cases where the criteria for these exemptions are not met an export licence, assessed against &quot;The Code of Conduct&quot; as described above, will be required.</p>

We will continue to hold regular discussions with the US, and with other international partners, to deliver an ambitious and fair post-2012 deal at the UN conference in Copenhagen in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="d.1710W.0/1">The UK is a founder signatory of the 1997 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Convention on Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (OECD Anti-Bribery Convention) which we ratified in 1998&mdash;one of the first member countries to do so. My noble Friend the Advocate-General for Scotland, Lord Davidson of Glen Clova, represented the UK at the OECD High Level Conference to mark the 10th anniversary of OECD Anti-Bribery Convention in Rome in November 2007. The Working Group recognised in their Phase 1 bis review that the UK's laws comply with the requirements of the Convention. We continue to work closely with the OECD on improving our anti-bribery procedures. The importance that the UK attaches to this area is reflected in my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's appointment of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform as the Government anti-corruption champion and the range of measures proposed in the 2007 and 2008 anti-corruption action plans.</p>
	<p pid="d.1710W.0/2">The OECD Working Group on Bribery is the body responsible for monitoring compliance with the convention. It operates through an established peer review process intended to raise standards across the Group's membership. The Group meets formally in Paris four times a year. The UK has been represented on every occasion by Government officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, home departments and UK law enforcement agencies, including the Attorney-General's Office, city of London police, Crown Prosecution Service, Department for Business, Enterprise, and Regulatory Reform, Ministry of Justice, and the Serious Fraud Office. There are, of course, frequent ad hoc meetings between OECD and member country officials, including the UK.</p>
	<p pid="d.1710W.0/3">We shall continue to play a full and active part in the group and in its peer review procedures. Preparation for such reviews usually entails the provision of supporting written material such as laws, regulations and judicial decisions. To ensure the OECD is kept fully abreast of developments, it is also open for member countries to provide these on their own initiative in the interim. The UK has, for example, recently provided the OECD with core documents submitted to the Judicial Review by the Serious Fraud Office, the Law Commission Consultation Paper &quot;Reforming Bribery&quot; and the Constitutional Renewal White Paper and draft Bill.</p>

	<p pid="d.1715W.5/1">Despite the fact that a large number of states have ratified various international conventions prohibiting torture, torture continues to be committed with impunity in many parts of the world. The UK remains fundamentally opposed to torture and continues to be one of the most active countries in the world in the fight to eradicate it.</p>
	<p pid="d.1715W.5/2">For example, we continue to support wider ratification of the UN Convention Against Torture (CAT) and its Optional Protocol (OPCAT) through bilateral lobbying campaigns, EU demarches and our work in UN fora such as the Human Rights Council. We also use a combination of project work and diplomatic activity to encourage implementation of OPCAT, including by the establishment of national preventative mechanisms. Since September 2006, 13 additional states have ratified OPCAT. This marks significant progress, although there is of course more to be done.</p>
	<p pid="d.1715W.5/3">The UK continues to support various bodies which have a role to play in monitoring and promoting compliance with international conventions and standards relating to the prohibition of torture, including the UN treaty bodies formally mandated to help enforce the CAT and OPCAT, and the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="d.1715W.5/4">Further information on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) work in this area can be found in the FCO's 2007 Annual Human Rights Report. The report is also available on the FCO's website at:</p>

Applications by journalists for these permits have often been refused in the past.

	<p pid="d.1729W.5/2">As part of his report on excellence in the arts, Sir Brian McMaster recommended a new, light-touch and non-bureaucratic system for judging the quality of the arts in the future. The starting point for this will be a system of self-assessment within organisations, designed to allow them to measure themselves against their own and shared objectives and a cyclical process of peer review, led by respected practitioners.</p>
	<p pid="d.1729W.5/3">Underpinning both will be a move away from measurement of data to a more judgment based approach, where qualified individuals who have the confidence and respect of the arts sector can make value based judgments of performance, without the need to burden arts organisations with overly complex reporting procedures.</p>
	<p pid="d.1729W.5/4">This reflects the wider work the Department is doing to reduce the burden we place on our NDPBs. A process of risk assessment will enable us to focus our scrutiny on the few areas of higher risk and adopt a more light-touch approach in most cases. Funding agreements will be shorter, with fewer targets, fewer monitoring returns will be required, and where possible and appropriate we will extend NDPBs' delegated powers.</p>

	<p pid="d.1731W.5/1">It is very difficult to estimate the number of hours of art and culture that children currently receive each week. Schools offer many cultural experiences, for example in music, art, drama and poetry, both within and beyond the curriculum. Many schools also give pupils opportunities to visit museums, local theatres and galleries.</p>
	<p pid="d.1731W.5/2">The exact number of hours will, however, depend on the age of the pupils involved, the subjects chosen at the end of key stage 3, and the extended activities available outside curriculum time. Similarly, we are aware that access to arts and culture outside of school time is varied.</p>
	<p pid="d.1731W.5/3">Our Taking Part youth survey showed that 61 per cent. of young people said that they had engaged in cultural activities at least once a week during the previous 12 months, and a further 21 per cent. said that they had engaged in cultural activities at least once a month.</p>
	<p pid="d.1731W.5/4">The numbers quoted here relate to the percentage of 11 to 15-year-olds living in private households in England, both in and out school. The survey's definition of cultural activities includes, among other things, participating in an arts activity, visiting a museum or gallery and visiting a historic environment site. The interviews were conducted between January and December 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.1731W.5/5">The 10 pilots which will be selected as part of our recently announced 'Find your Talent' scheme will be asked to audit current level of arts and culture provision and the take up of these activities by children and young people in more detail.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State has had no discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on this subject, although as Minister for Sport I have held discussions with HMT and DCMS officials have been in regular contact with their counterparts at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). I have received a number of representations on the issue of VAT and its application in respect of leisure trusts. This included a meeting with Sporta, the leisure trust umbrella body, to hear their concerns. I have been assured by HMRC that there has been no recent change in policy on VAT and leisure trusts and that discussions have taken place and will continue to take place as necessary, between HMRC and businesses and organisations. In relation to retrospective charges in particular I am informed that trusts who can show that they have misunderstood the tax position in relation to their services or have been misdirected by HMRC can ask for consideration to be given to remitting the retrospective tax.</p>

	<p pid="d.1753W.8/1">As part of the strategic review of tourism support, VisitBritain is leading a discussion across the public and private sectors about the best use of the British Government's overseas offices and infrastructure in promoting the tourism industry. The review will include a full consideration of best value in the use of these assets, to that end.</p>
	<p pid="d.1753W.8/2">In advance of the review's findings, VisitBritain has advised DCMS that the costs of its stand-alone offices outside the UK are on average &pound;17.63 per square foot; and that the average costs in the 11 locations where VisitBritain rents office space at embassy, high commission, or British Council premises are &pound;30.71 per square foot. However the average cost figures do not reflect the particular circumstances of particular locations and it is therefore difficult to make accurate cost comparisons.</p>
	<p pid="d.1753W.8/3">Furthermore additional charges for administration and offices services are made in respect of British Council, high commission, and embassy locations, and these are not included in the above average figures.</p>

This aimed to produce a set of baseline energy and carbon balances for a range of electricity, heat and transport fuel production systems based on biomass feedstocks.

In response to the recommendations of the Biomass Task Force, DEFRA and the Environment Agency jointly updated the BEAT to make it widely available and BEAT2 is now almost ready for release.

	<p pid="d.1761W.2/1">Between 1976 and the early 1990s the UK carried out a major Geothermal Research Programme at a cost in excess of &pound;50 million. The key conclusions from the programme were that the UK was unlikely to see major developments based upon geothermal aquifers or the hot dry rock (HDR) method due to a limited resource, limited scope for their application and unfavourable economics.</p>
	<p pid="d.1761W.2/2">The programme produced estimates of the potential geothermal resource for both HDR and aquifers. Its final report estimated the accessible HDR resource in the UK regardless of cost to be 1,500 Terawatt hours of electricity, that if exploited over 25 years would result in 60 TWh/year or 7,600 MW of net output power at 90 per cent. availability. However, once possible constraints were taken into account it estimated that the practicable HDR resource could be as low as 4 TWh/year or 500 MW over 375 years.</p>
	<p pid="d.1761W.2/3">A final report of the Geothermal Aquifers Programme estimated the UK resource for three temperature ranges:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="d.1761W.2/6"> <td><i> Temperature range</i></td> <td><i> Mtce (million tonnes coal equivalent)</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1761W.2/7"> <td>Over 60C</td> <td>183</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1761W.2/8"> <td>40 to 60C</td> <td>1771</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="d.1761W.2/9"> <td>20 to 40C</td> <td>2285</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="d.1761W.2/12">Although these figures are large the report estimated that the exploitable resource was much smaller when taking account of the coincidence of high heat load density and resource. It estimated that the possible take-up of the resource based on a total of 100 schemes being developed would produce a total saving of 0.35 Mtce per annum.</p>
	<p pid="d.1761W.2/13">To make geothermal power a more attractive economic prospect in the UK now would depend on addressing the technical and practical constraints identified by this previous Geothermal Programme.</p>

	<p pid="d.1763W.9/1">The Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) was designed in consultation with key stakeholders, including representatives of the solar thermal industry. MCS scheme standards and requirements have been set by an industry-led Steering Group and expert working groups. The scheme's principal objective is to provide information and assurance to consumers unfamiliar with these technologies, by ensuring that products and companies eligible for grants, meet more robust standards.</p>
	<p pid="d.1763W.9/2">MCS is working towards accreditation by the UK Accreditation Service (UKAS), which, to an extent, places certain requirements on the scheme in order to comply with EN 45011. UKAS accreditation should help to deliver the quality and reliability that the Government and consumers want to see in the microgeneration market.</p>
	<p pid="d.1763W.9/3">UKAS is appointed in the UK to assess and accredit the activities of third party certification bodies against internationally agreed standards. The costs of certification under MCS are determined according to the same International Accreditation Forum guidelines used for other equivalent UKAS accredited schemes which operate in other industry sectors.</p>
	<p pid="d.1763W.9/4">As part of the development of the Microgeneration Certification Scheme, the Department provided &pound;350,000 to give 50 per cent. discounts to installer businesses during the first year (reducing first year costs to &pound;900). Discounts have been offered to 250 Clear Skies/PV programme installers who applied before <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-31">31 January 2008</phrase>. The remainder of the &pound;350,000 has been allocated to support 139 new installers, on a first-come, first-served basis (with a 50 per cent. discount). Discounts are payable on successful completion of the MCS assessment. Further funding of &pound;250,000 remains to be allocated, following discussions with the MCS Steering Group.</p>
	<p pid="d.1763W.9/5">After September 2008, MCS will be opened up to other certification bodies and the Department hopes to see further cost reductions coming from open competition.</p>

	<p pid="d.1764W.5/1">The decision to have a connection provided by an independent gas transporter (IGT) rather than the regional Gas Distribution Network rests with developers or individual householders. In January 2007, 840,000 domestic meter points were connected to IGT networks.</p>
	<p pid="d.1764W.5/2">The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) regulates gas transportation, distribution and supply. To promote connections as a whole, and competition in their provision, Ofgem previously allowed IGTs to levy a supplementary connection charge, recoverable over 20 years. Since 2003, to encourage more connections of existing domestic infill properties (that is, existing properties without a gas supply) to the mains gas network, IGTs have been able, under the Relative Price Control, to apply a surcharge on the transportation charge to such properties. Otherwise, the Relative Price Control for IGTs caps transportation charges at a level consistent with those of the Gas Distribution Networks. Around 580,000 customers already used networks regulated under previous arrangements. Relative Price Controls will be phased in for these customers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1764W.5/3">Once a connection has been made and the supply activated, households are not billed by transporters or distributors, whose charges are met by the gas supplier. It is for the supplier to decide whether or not to recover any additional element in the charge from the customer, or whether, for administrative simplicity, to apply a standard charge to all customers of IGT networks. Individual suppliers have different approaches, and it follows that the number of households that pay additional charges will depend on which supplier a household is contracted with at any one time. Neither British Gas nor Scottish and Southern Energy applies a surcharge to IGT customers; other suppliers' surcharges lie in the range &pound;30-&pound;60 per IGT customer.</p>

	<p pid="d.1767W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said that a significant expansion of nuclear in the UK in the coming decades could potentially create up to 100,000 jobs, thousands of which would be highly skilled and well paid. That estimate was based on experience of jobs created from past nuclear construction in the UK and in other countries, and includes jobs in the nuclear power stations, off site jobs for corporate, business, maintenance and fuel cycle functions, construction jobs, and jobs in the engineering and construction supply chains.</p>

Of this, an estimated 10 to 15 per cent. is the cost of the risk assessments themselves (ie the cost of the work force time and laboratory tests required for the assessment).

	<p pid="d.1780W.3/1">The National Chlamydia Screening programme (NCSP) published the Men too Strategy in November 2007 in response to the variation observed in the proportion of men screened in the local Chlamydia Screening programmes. All chlamydia screening offices (CSOs) have been made aware of the need to address the issue of equitable access to screening.</p>
	<p pid="d.1780W.3/2">Discussions on ways to increase uptake amongst men have been undertaken at a number of region-wide chlamydia screening co-ordinator networks. Work in relation to identifying interventions supporting male engagement and the success of each activity is underway through consultation with local Chlamydia Screening programmes. This feedback will be collated to inform a working group which has been convened to advise and steer the implementation of the &quot;Men too Strategy&quot; later in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.1780W.3/3">The working group includes representatives from the Men's Health Forum; a men's health promotion specialist from a primary care trust (PCT); a sexual health network director, who commissions and facilitates sexual health service provision; the chief executive of Brook, the young persons sexual health service; and a CSO coordinator.</p>
	<p pid="d.1780W.3/4">Work in relation to men's perceptions and experiences has been discussed by the working group but no formal study of this has commenced yet.</p>
	<p pid="d.1780W.3/5">Work on background information and guidance is in the early stages of development. These will be published in the form of a toolkit planned for launch in November 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.1780W.3/6">To date, examples of local initiatives include the Greater Manchester strategy to use sport to engage male participation in screening. In partnership with both Oldham Athletic Football Club and Oldham Rougheyeds Rugby Team, targeted sexual health education and chlamydia screening of the playing staff is being undertaken followed by a mass screening event for fans on match day. Chlamydia information and promotion of screening will be included in match day programmes for four weeks prior to the screening event.</p>
	<p pid="d.1780W.3/7">Other relevant work includes participation in the forthcoming Men's Health Week in June 2008. This week will have a focus on the workplace and will provide an opportunity to raise awareness, address men's concerns and dispel misconceptions about the chlamydia screening process. There will also be engagement with key media organisations whose target audience is young men.</p>
	<p pid="d.1780W.3/8">Access to screening for men is monitored quarterly by the Health Protection Agency by measuring at PCT and local programme level the proportion of screens that are taken up by men. These figures are currently fed back quarterly to the programme areas. These figures will be available on the NCSP website later this year.</p>

However, the Medical Research Council (MRC) is planning to set up a panel of experts from different disciplines to look more closely at the area. The panel will come from varied fields including neuroscience, immunology, toxicology and imaging, and will involve interested parties and focus on the subtypes and causes of ME/CFS.</p>

Internally the IP address is set dynamically rather than being static, e.g. fixed. This means that when someone logs in, their PC is given an IP address from a central pool of any one of around 4,500 IP addresses in daily use in the Department.

	<p pid="d.1788W.5/1">The United Kingdom Government are supportive of efforts to achieve gender equality and continue to work very closely with both the Women's National Commission and the Women's Budget Group on promoting gender equality within the UK.</p>
	<p pid="d.1788W.5/2">In 2004, HM Treasury undertook a pilot project on gender analysis of expenditure with the Women's Budget Group. The project demonstrated the value of gender analysis in some areas and identified what tools and expertise were necessary within Government to carry out gender analysis, but concluded that further work was needed before gender responsive budgeting could be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="d.1788W.5/3">In 2008, HM Treasury will be conducting further work that will determine whether it is prudent and feasible to disaggregate departmental expenditure statistics by gender.</p>
	<p pid="d.1788W.5/4">The Department is committed to creating a patient-centred health service that extends choice and is responsive to all patients and users, in particular ensuring that any gender inequalities in treatment and access are eliminated.</p>
	<p pid="d.1788W.5/5">The weighted capitation formula used to determine primary care trusts' (PCTs) target share of available resources is designed to enable them to commission similar levels of health care for populations in similar need. To determine the relevant population for each PCT, factors including gender are considered. In addition, the prescribing and primary medical services components of the formula take into account gender in determining the need for these services.</p>
	<p pid="d.1788W.5/6">To support the national health service in taking forward gender equality legislation, the Department published guidance in March 2007&mdash;'Creating a Gender Equality Scheme: A practical guide for the NHS'&mdash;to ensure that all NHS organisations understand their responsibilities. Similar guidance on transgender issues&mdash;'Transgender: A practical guide for the NHS'&mdash;is planned for publication in April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.1788W.5/7">In addition, the Department has commissioned the Men's Health Forum to conduct a review of the different ways women and men access health services. This review will provide evidence to help determine key gender health priorities for the Department and the NHS. The Department is also in the process of appointing a 'gender champion' to promote gender equality in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="d.1790W.2/1">The Department is committed to achieving the carbon reduction targets for the Government estate, published in June 2006. We encourage all our staff to use video conferencing where possible, to avoid the need for official travel. We have steadily increased our use of video conferencing, from a total of 6,679 conferences in 2004, to 10,526 in 2007, a 57 per cent. increase. We anticipate that usage in 2008 will be around 11,500, and we have plans to install a further 10 video conferencing suites in the coming months, to meet demand.</p>
	<p pid="d.1790W.2/2">We have estimated that approximately 776 tonnes of CO2 will be saved in 2008 as a result of holding video conferences instead of requiring staff to travel to meetings.</p>
	<p pid="d.1790W.2/3">Across the departmental estate, there are currently 36 video conference units. In May 2008, a further 11 units will be deployed in London and there are plans to increase the number in Leeds to accommodate the rise in London estate numbers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1790W.2/4">We have made significant use of video conferencing for over 10 years and we continually review the number of systems and bandwidth needed, to meet both business requirements and the sustainable development agenda.</p>

	<p pid="d.1793W.8/1">District councils may participate in health scrutiny in a variety of ways. Although district councils do not have the powers to review and scrutinise health services, there are opportunities for them to become involved in joint committees through co-option and to have the functions delegated to them.</p>
	<p pid="d.1793W.8/2">Joint committees may be established by two or more local authorities (LAs) including two-tier district councils for both a specific scrutiny review, and for on-going scrutiny planning and review.</p>
	<p pid="d.1793W.8/3">County councils may co-opt members of overview and scrutiny committees from district councils to participate as full members of the county overview and scrutiny committee considering health services. Councillors who are members of a district council executive are, by definition, not scrutiny members and therefore cannot be co-opted onto the county council health overview and scrutiny committee, nor can district councillors who are not members of an overview and scrutiny committee. Councillors who fall into these categories and who may have a role to play in a scrutiny process may participate in other ways, for example by providing information to the committee or attending as an expert witness.</p>
	<p pid="d.1793W.8/4">A LA may also arrange for its overview and scrutiny functions to be undertaken by a committee from another LA. The regulations enable the delegation of scrutiny functions between LAs including from county council to district council overview and scrutiny committees. When delegation takes place, the full powers of overview and scrutiny of health services are given to the delegated committee but only in relation to the specific delegated function.</p>

	<p pid="d.1801W.2/1">Following a detailed review of the delivery of official controls in approved meat plants, including slaughterhouses, the Food Standards Agency Board decided last July that continuance of the level of subsidy paid to industry into the future was unsustainable, and the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) should seek to recover an increasing proportion of those costs through industry charges. At the same time, the MHS would be expected to become a more efficient organisation that will carry out its role at less cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.1801W.2/2">Through a programme of transformation, the cost base of the MHS is being reduced from &pound;91.3 million in 2006-07 to &pound;75 million in 2011-12 in real terms in order to reduce the burden on industry as charge rates to businesses are increased. A new approach to charging is being developed with key stakeholders, including industry, and is taking into consideration that small and geographically isolated abattoirs may need some continuing support. Proposals for the new charging system will be subject to full public consultation, which will include a regulatory impact assessment.</p>

	<p pid="d.1805W.6/1">In accordance with the national health service care record guarantee and legal obligations of confidentiality, links will be made only with the consent of patients or where there is a statutory obligation. A recent example of the latter is the Children Act 2004 which provides for the mandatory disclosure of some NHS patient information to the Department of Children, Schools and Family's ContactPoint system.</p>
	<p pid="d.1805W.6/2">The strategy that underpins the national programme for information technology also envisaged that there would be appropriate integration of care records with social care where necessary for the care of patients. Until now, this has concentrated on close working to achieve a single assessment process between the NHS and social care with cross checks to agree the accuracy. Future linkages will be subject to feasibility work and agreements.</p>
	<p pid="d.1805W.6/3">Other linkages exist for the purposes of care with the Ministry of Defence for the treatment of armed forces personnel and with the Ministry of Justice for the provision of health care for prisoners.

This linear trend suggests that childhood obesity is growing at 0.5 per cent. points per year and this growth rate has been used to forecast a baseline trajectory over the period, with child obesity increasing from 16.1 per cent. in 2006 (latest year of actual data) to 18.7 per cent. in 2011.

	<p pid="d.1809W.3/1">The conduct of clinical trials in the European Union (EU) is governed by EU law, implemented in the United Kingdom by means of regulations. These represent a comprehensive framework for the conduct of clinical trials, including requirements on reporting. However, following an investigation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency into allegations that GlaxoSmithKline withheld relevant information gathered in clinical trials on the use of Seroxat in children and adolescents, some weaknesses in the law as it stood at the time of the alleged offences were identified. The Government have made a commitment to clarify and strengthen both EU and UK law in this area. We will seek to strengthen EU legislation on the obligations on pharmaceutical companies to report any information impacting on the risk and benefits of licensed medicines, including the results of clinical trials. In the meantime we will clarify the current law as it applies in the UK. Consultation on changes to UK law will take place in the summer.</p>

We have also introduced a national target to offer access to genito-urinary medicine clinics within 48 hours and rolled out the National Chlamydia Screening Programme.

	<p pid="d.1817W.3/2" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.1817W.3/3">The Government have no current plans to increase the age limit for compulsory annuitisation.</p>
	<p pid="d.1817W.3/4">The Government set out their approach to annuities in their December 2006 publication: &quot;The Annuities Market&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1817W.3/5">The age of earliest possible annuitisation will rise from 50 to 55 in 2010, in line with Government policy to encourage greater participation in the labour market by older workers. The latest available evidence suggests that the upper age limit (age 75) is not currently a significant constraint on retirement planning as only one in 20 people annuitise between ages 70 and 74. The limit therefore reflects current retirement patterns.</p>
	<p pid="d.1817W.3/6">Evidence suggests that age 75 strikes a balance between flexibility in securing an income and ensuring that tax incentives are used for their intended purpose of providing a pension income.</p>
	<p pid="d.1817W.3/7">The latest evidence from the Government Actuary's Department (GAD) also shows that increasingly during an individual's early 70s&mdash;and certainly by around 75&mdash;the rates of return required from alternative assets become unrealistically high for any individual in retirement to justify further delaying annuitisation.</p>

	<p pid="d.1818W.5/5" class="indent">The Agency begins to process new applications as soon as they are received and continues until they have been cleared. Any old scheme applications that have not been recorded on our computer question systems as cleared have been regarded as outstanding in the answer to this question. The Agency has significantly reduced the number of old scheme cases recorded as uncleared from 66,900 in March 2006 to 30,200 in December 2007. This is a 55 per cent decrease since the introduction of the Operational Improvement Plan.</p>
	<p pid="d.1818W.5/6" class="indent">Additional information on uncleared old scheme cases can be found in table 2.1 of the December 2007 CSA Quarterly summary of statistics (QSS), available in the House of Commons Library on online at; <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/csa.asp">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/csa.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="d.1818W.5/7" class="indent">Old scheme cases shown as uncleared are by definition a number of years old, and will include a significant number of cases which are suspended as the non-resident par4ent remains untraced, or cases which have been maintained clerically or have in fact been closed but remain stuck on the computer system and therefore recorded as outstaying. The average length of time taken to clear old scheme cases and the average age of uncleared old scheme cases therefore increasingly becomes less meaningful.</p>
	<p pid="d.1818W.5/8" class="indent">As we move towards the launch of the new Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission the measures needed to improve transparency across the whole range of information available on child support will need to be carefully considered.</p>

	<p pid="d.1819W.0/6" class="indent">This debt has accrued over the 14 years of the Agency's operation and represents money owed by non-resident parents who have failed to meet their financial responsibilities towards their children.</p>

In total the Agency has collected over &pound;181m in maintenance arrears since April 2006 and continues to make good progress towards meeting the Operational Improvement Plan commitment of collecting an additional &pound;200m in arrears by March 2009 in addition to the &pound;80m it was collecting each year at the inception of the plan.</p>

	<p pid="d.1822W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="d.1822W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, in what number and proportion of cases with arrears outstanding the Child Support Agency is taking enforcement action broken down by type of action being taken.</p>
	<p pid="d.1822W.2/5" class="indent">The data required to answer this question comes from several different information flows. Our information systems do not allow us to compare the number of cases with arrears outstanding to the number of individual enforcement actions taken. The Agency routinely reports on the number of enforcement actions instigated in Table 21 of the Child Support Agency's Quarterly Summary of Statistics. This is available online at <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/csa.asp">www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/csa.asp</a> or in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.1822W.2/6" class="indent">In the year to October 2007, the Agency undertook 102,120 new legal and administrative enforcement actions. These covered a range of processes including distress actions, county court judgement orders, 3rd party debt orders, charging orders, suspended committal sentences, committal sentences, requests for new deduction from earnings orders and deductions from earnings requests, suspended driving licence disqualifications and driving licence disqualifications. As the Agency records the numbers of enforcement actions rather than the number of cases, different types of enforcement action may relate to the same case.</p>
	<p pid="d.1822W.2/7" class="indent">In addition it should be noted that Table 9 of the Agency's Quarterly Summary of Statistics shows that a total of 169,700 deductions from earnings orders or requests were in place in October 2007. This figure will include all new deduction from earnings orders or requests noted in Table 21 and above.</p>

	<p pid="d.1840W.2/1">The standard rate of interest used to calculate support for mortgage interest payments in income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance and state pension credit is currently 6.83 per cent. which is determined by adding 1.58 per cent. to the current Bank of England base rate of 5.25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.1840W.2/2">From December 2004, the standard rate has been calculated using the Bank of England Base Rate plus an additional 1.58 per cent. Using the Bank of England base rate provides a more representative rate than the previous method, which was based upon an average of building society interest rates. The 1.58 per cent. was added to ensure that no-one lost out when the method of calculation changed.</p>

	<p pid="d.1849W.2/1">The Chancellor announced in his Budget 2008 speech that for winter 2008-09 an additional payment will be made alongside the winter fuel payment. Households with someone aged 60 to 79 will receive an additional &pound;50 and households with someone aged 80 or over will receive an additional &pound;100.</p>
	<p pid="d.1849W.2/2">The levels of benefits are increased once a year, in April. The increases are calculated, for most contributory and non-contributory benefits, using the increase in the retail prices index for the 12 months ending in the preceding September. This ensures that benefits keep their real value in broad terms.</p>
	<p pid="d.1849W.2/3">Income-related benefits (jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, council tax benefit and income support) are usually increased in line with September's 12-month rate for the Rossi index. The Rossi index is the retail prices index excluding rent, mortgage interest payments, council tax and depreciation costs. This index is used because help for housing costs is given to people getting income related benefits either as additional amounts in those benefits or in council tax benefit and housing benefit. Consequently any increases in council tax would usually be met by council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="d.1849W.2/4">The standard minimum guarantee in pension credit has been increased by 4.2 per cent. in line with the Budget 2007 announcement, more than keeping pace with earnings and prices.</p>
	<p pid="d.1849W.2/5">The inflation figures are based on a year-on-year comparison of prices. Therefore any recent fluctuations in inflation will be taken into account in the benefit increases that will take effect from April 2009.</p>

	<p pid="d.1851W.0/2">Unfortunately, through no fault of any individual, overpayments of benefit can arise following the death of a benefit recipient. Such overpayments normally arise as a result of the Department being notified of the death too late to stop an automated payment being made into the deceased's account.</p>
	<p pid="d.1851W.0/3">We are doing all we can to improve the current process. We are in the process of preparing to receive electronic notifications of death from the Office of National Statistics on a daily basis. This will assist in enabling a prompt cessation of payments following death and reduce the number of these overpayments occurring.</p>
	<p pid="d.1851W.0/4">The Department has a duty to seek recovery of all overpaid funds where it is reasonable and cost effective to do so. However, we seek to do this as sensitively as possible, taking account of the fact that this will be a stressful time, particularly if the person contacted is a close friend or family member. Overpayments are written off if the deceased has no estate or there are insufficient funds in the estate.</p>
	<p pid="d.1851W.0/5">The following table details how many of these overpayments have been recovered, and their value. We have only been collecting this information since 2005.</p>

	<p pid="d.1857W.2/1">When national insurance contributions are made, a proportion of them go directly to help fund the NHS, while the rest are paid into the national insurance fund (NIF). The fund pays out contributory benefits to which people who have paid sufficient contributions are entitled, such as the basic state pension, incapacity benefit and contribution-based jobseeker's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="d.1857W.2/2">National insurance contributions and associated social security benefits operate within the Government's fiscal rules designed to ensure sound public finances and when there is a surplus, it is invested in public services. Any surplus of contributions over social security benefits in any one year (the NIF surplus) is not therefore an extra resource available to spend.</p>
	<p pid="d.1857W.2/3">As the Government Actuary's latest report on the draft Social Security Benefits up-rating and Contributions re-rating Orders (CM7312) notes, the excess of income overpayments each year is the difference between two large numbers and so quite small percentage changes in either of them results in a large percentage change in the surplus income. This, in turn, could have a significant effect on the fund balances.</p>
	<p pid="d.1857W.2/4">However, if the equivalent of the national insurance fund's annual excess of receipts overpayments projected by the Acting Government Actuary for the years 2009-10 to 2012-13 were paid in its entirety to recipients of basic state pension, this would lead to an estimated percentage increase in the basic state pension of around 24 per cent. in 2009-10 and around 6 per cent. in the years 2010-11 to 2012-13. Any increase in basic state pension expenditure has a cumulative impact on Government spending going forward.</p>
	<p pid="d.1857W.2/5">The equivalent of the excess of receipts overpayments would need to be raised through tax increases to maintain the Government's fiscal strategy. The Government are committed to long-term sustainable state pension provision and views short-term spending of the NIF surplus as unaffordable going forward. The Government have guaranteed the basic state pension will increase each year in line with prices or 2.5 per cent., whichever is higher, and subject to affordability and the fiscal position, to increase the basic state pension in line with earnings in 2012, but by the end of the next Parliament at the latest.</p>

Measures to be introduced ahead of legislation include strengthening Rule 43 of the Coroners Rules 1984 to help coroners to prevent future deaths, revising the Charter for the Bereaved for a reformed service, and working with the Press Complaints Commission to establish whether their code of practice for editors could be refined, in respect of the reporting of inquests, for the benefit of bereaved families.</p>

My officials have met with representatives of the British Lung Foundation to discuss their report, and facilitated meetings between the Foundation and the Coroners Society. Following these meetings, best practice guidance for coroners and clinicians on how deaths from mesothelioma should be dealt with has been published on the Coroners Society website. The needs of the bereaved are integral to our proposals both in regard to longer term reform of the coroners' service. The appointment of a chief coroner and the introduction of national standards of service, which will be enabled by the Coroners Bill, will also address concerns about inconsistencies of practice between coroner areas. We will bring forward legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows, and continue to consult with the British Lung Foundation about those parts of the Bill which effect the investigation of mesothelioma deaths. In February 2008, I attended a parliamentary reception hosted by the British Lung Foundation and I was happy to give a commitment to work with them as the Government develops its policy further in these areas.</p>

It was because of the useful work that Dr Mark Walport did with the CST that the PM asked him to undertake a comprehensive review with the Information Commissioner of the use and sharing of personal information in the public and private sectors.</p>
	<p pid="d.1863W.5/2">The Government will take a considered view on what measures are necessary to strengthen the protection of personal information in the light of conclusions and recommendations of this review and the review by the Cabinet Secretary.</p>

	<p pid="d.1867W.0/2">The average sentence in terms of time served upon completion of the minimum tariff as established by the court at the time of sentencing is decided by a parole board in each case.

	<p pid="d.1872W.2/14">Police forces invoice NOMS in arrears and it is not possible to attach a specific cost to each of these figures. However, the current estimated average cost of a Safeguard place is about &pound;385 per night.</p>
	<p pid="d.1872W.2/15">In addition there were some 144 ad-hoc lockouts in the last six months. This is an emergency measure to hold prisoners overnight. It is used, for example, when the designated prison's reception will be closed before their arrival time, usually due to the distance of the journey or time of departure from court. Ad-hoc lockouts cost an average &pound;120 per night.</p>
	<p pid="d.1872W.2/16">Police cells have been used to hold prisoners before. They were used to hold prisoners regularly from 1982 until 1993, and from 1994-95. They were also used from July to November 2002. Their use peaked in 1988, and peaked again in 1990-92, when more than 1,000 prisoners a night were being regularly held in police cells.</p>

Our records indicate that since October 2006 two juveniles have been held overnight in police cells in Essex. Data prior to this cannot be obtained without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="d.1874W.0/1">The Ministry of Justice has just published its Disability Equality Scheme which covers all prisons. It sets out the approach that the Ministry of Justice will take to fulfil its statutory obligations to deliver equality of opportunity to disabled staff, offenders and other persons who come into contact with the Ministry of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="d.1874W.0/2">The National Offender Management Service will in April issue a revised prison service order and standard, to expand on and update existing instructions. These explain the duties and responsibilities prisons have for prisoners with disabilities. It sets out those actions which must be undertaken by prison staff to ensure that the duties under the Disability Discrimination Act are met.</p>

	<p pid="d.1886W.14/2">The Department does not hold central records on the achievements of young people in custody. Under the Offender Learning and Skills Service (OLASS), rolled out across England in August 2006, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) collects data on the academic achievements of young people in Young Offender Institutions. The LSC records literacy, numeracy, ICT and vocational training qualifications separately as well as GCSEs and AS/A level and any personal and social skills qualifications. However, for young people in custody still registered at learning providers in the community, their achievements will be attributed to the learning provider with which they are registered, rather than the custodial establishment's LSC provider. Therefore the LSC figures do not provide records of 'all' of the academic achievements of 'all' young people in YOIs. The LSC figures also do not include the academic achievements of young people in Secure Children's Homes or Secure Training Centres. However, in the context of the Green Paper a settlement announced in the Children's Plan. We are examining how the academic projects and attainment of all young people in custody can be collected and monitored.</p>
