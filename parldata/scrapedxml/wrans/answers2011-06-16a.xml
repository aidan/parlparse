Six printers were selected, including black and white, colour and multi-function devices. Members and their staff were invited to view and test the models before a final decision was made. The printers are procured through contracts that have been subject to full EU competitive tenders, thereby ensuring their pricing is competitive.

	<p pid="a.894W.8/2">Dr Weightman's interim report gives a clear indication that the UK's current safety regime remains robust and therefore, so far as is reasonably practicable, the levels of protection currently in place, including sea defences, are appropriate compared to the level of risk to ensure safety at the UK's nuclear power plants.</p>
	<p pid="a.894W.8/3">The Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR) ensures that nuclear operators comply with the UK's robust regulatory requirements so that the risks are reduced as low as is reasonably practicable. Part of the regulatory regime establishes a licensing regime which is the most restrictive regulatory approach available other than prohibition. As part of the licensing regime licensees are required to re-view and re-assess the safety of their plants periodically and systematically. Periodic safety reviews (PSRs) which are normally carried out on a 10 yearly cycle, are normally placed in the public domain once the regulator agrees that the findings have met the safety requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.897W.4/1">Biosolids (also known as sewage sludge, and which can include treated human effluent) are an important means of improving soil and have been used in agriculture for many years. Current EU legislative limits on metals in sludge-treated soils are designed not only to protect human health, but crop growth and livestock health as well. In addition, the water industry and producers using sludge follow The Safe Sludge Matrix guidance developed by scientists, retailers and producers, which prevents the transfer of pathogens to food crops. It is worth noting that sludge is not used in powdered form but is applied as granules or cake.</p>

The latest information available is on holdings as at <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase> used to distribute quotas for 2010, and it is available from the Marine Management Organisation's internet site at:</p>

	<p pid="a.899W.11/3">Similar information for the position as at <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase> is currently being finalised as part of final allocations of quotas for 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.899W.11/4">These reports do not include details of holdings by individuals. Such information would include personal data as defined in Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act as information relating to living persons, and thus disclosure would breach the principles within the Act. In addition, the information requested is effectively details of a commercial (or personal) asset held by the owner and is thus regarded as commercially sensitive, in that if others gain knowledge of their quota ownership (or possibly lack of ownership), it may potentially affect business agreements they might enter into.</p>
	<p pid="a.899W.11/5">The commercial sensitivity and personal nature of the information also prevents the provision of information on those who hold UK quota who are not actively involved in fisheries. In addition, a significant proportion of quota is held by producer organisations themselves on behalf of their members or other individuals. The actual beneficial holder of the quota is known by the producer organisation involved but this information is not routinely collected by fisheries administrations. As such it is not possible to determine to what extent these holdings may be held by those who are not actively involved in fishing.</p>
	<p pid="a.899W.11/6">An exercise was carried out in 2007 to look at the details on the ownership of the quota allocation units held by producer organisations on behalf of others. This indicated that for the total holdings of FQA units in the UK, the proportion held by producer organisations (PO) themselves rather than linked to individual vessels was 18.6%. Of this, 3.1% was being held by the PO itself on behalf of its members as a collective asset, 5.5% on behalf of individual active members of the PO, 4.4% held on behalf of vessels&#8217; agents or salesmen, 2.0% held as part of Community Quota Schemes and 3.5% on behalf of other types of owner.</p>

	<p pid="a.901W.2/1">The Health Protection Agency (HPA) runs a small environmental radioactivity surveillance programme in the UK. The most recent published results are for 2007 and 2008 and can be found on the HPA website. The results for 2009 will be published shortly. The main objective of the HPA programme is to provide data typical of the UK against which site specific data can be compared and to provide independent evidence that can be used in support of queries about the impact of radioactivity in the environment. Some limited monitoring of plutonium levels in air is carried out but no analyses are routinely done for uranium or actinides other than plutonium. No measurement data is currently available for the period <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-19">19 March 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.901W.2/2">The sites used by the HPA across the UK for its surveillance programme were used to monitor activity concentrations in air following the release of radioactivity to atmosphere from the Fukushima plant in Japan. The frequency of collection of air samples was increased and a very high volume air sampler at HPA's Chilton site in Oxfordshire was also deployed. The air samples collected were analysed for a wide range of radionuclides. All the results from the air samples taken from <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-20">20 March 2011</phrase> onwards have been published in the Fukushima updates on the HPA website. No other radionuclides have been measured using the very sensitive monitoring equipment which can pick up trace levels of radionuclides in air and other environmental materials. Some air filters were further analysed using radiochemical techniques for isotopes of plutonium and strontium-90. Only background levels of plutonium were found, which are consistent with levels routinely measured by HPA at Seascale in Cumbria; strontium-90 was not detected.</p>
	<p pid="a.901W.2/3">The Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Northern Ireland Environment Agency also deploy High Volume Air samplers at locations in Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales. Results of the routine monitoring carried out using the samplers are reported in &#8220;Radioactivity in Food and the Environment&#8221; publications. During the Fukushima event, filters were collected and analysed weekly and the results sent to HPA for collation and publication on its website.</p>

Where rivers are at risk during dry weather, the Environment Agency can support their flows using augmentation schemes&#8212;it currently operates a number of such schemes. It can also protect rivers, and the wildlife they support, by restricting abstractions during a drought. Under Section 57 of the Water Resource Act 1991, it has the power to alter the right to abstract on some agricultural licences under specific predefined conditions to protect the environment. The Environment Agency manages the use of Section 57 powers carefully, taking into consideration local circumstances, along with consultation with those potentially affected.</p>

Our high commission in Kingston has already had some initial contact with the Jamaican authorities about plans for a 'Jamaica Village' in London during the 2012 Olympics.

	<p pid="a.909W.6/3">We regularly keep in touch with industry organisations who have valuable insight into the current market and supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.909W.6/4">The E. coli outbreak has had a disruptive economic impact on growers and others within the supply chain for fruit and vegetables across the EU, including our domestic industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.909W.6/5">At retail level, prices for domestically produced salad (lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet peppers and courgettes) have remained relatively stable, although demand continues to decline. As a result more produce is being sent to the wholesale market, which is experiencing consequential price movements. Surplus EU produce has been directed to alternative EU markets, including our own, with similar consequences for prices, although I understand that prices for English produce are faring better than those for imported produce. But the situation continues to develop and the latest indications from our trade organisations are that the market continues to remain depressed, which is not helped by retail demand for salad crops in particular being sensitive to the weather.</p>
	<p pid="a.909W.6/6">However, the welcome news that the Russian Federation has lifted its ban on imports of fruit and vegetables from the European Union is an important development, which should start to alleviate the pressure on volumes and prices being experienced on the domestic market.</p>

	<p pid="a.910W.2/1">Under the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2005, if a pharmacy opens in a rural area, or if an area is no longer considered rural, general practitioners (GPs) are required to reduce their dispensing unless the area is designated as a &#8220;reserved location&#8221; (where both the pharmacy and the doctors can dispense). Specifically, doctors can no longer dispense to patients who live within 1.6 kilometres of the new pharmacy or who live in a non-rural area. This change can take effect immediately, but can also be phased in if the primary care trust considers that would benefit patients more (&#8220;gradualisation&#8221;).</p>
	<p pid="a.910W.2/2">Without these rules, it would rarely be viable for new pharmacies to open in rural areas. That would deprive people living in rural areas of the opportunity to benefit from the more comprehensive health service that a combination of a GP practice and a pharmacy offers.</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.3/1">The grading structure in the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) differs from the rest of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). The definition of Grade C is different in each case. Senior Manager C in NOMS refers to a more senior responsibility level than a Band C in MOJ. The equivalent of a Senior Manager C within MOJ is Band A. It is this level for which information is supplied in the answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.3/2">The number of senior managers (Bands A and above) that left the MOJ between <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase> was 348. The number of senior managers (Senior Manager C and above) that left NOMS during the same period was 109. Of these, 38 staff were operational grades.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.3/3">The MOJ and NOMS do not keep records of employment taken up by former staff after they have left. NOMS is however aware that a small number of senior managers resigned in 2010 to take up posts in the private sector, including the governors of Holloway, Whitemoor, Moorland and the Isle of Wight prisons. The former director general of NOMS also took up an appointment with G4S after he had left Crown employment in 2010. There may have been others who joined private sector providers but there is no requirement for those leaving to advise the Department or agency of their future employment plans, save for any obligations under the Business Appointment Rules.</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.6/2">In order to answer this question the UK Border Agency would need to cross reference individual records with the National Offender Management Service. This would incur a disproportionate cost. The latest figure available shows that on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March</phrase> there were 10,745 foreign nationals in the prison estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.6/3">However, I can advise that a proportion of the foreign nationals in prison have a right to be in the UK either as an EEA national, or through another form of leave for example Indefinite Leave to Remain or having been granted asylum. The UK Border Agency will seek to revoke leave in order to remove individuals who meet the criteria for deportation.</p>

	<p pid="a.925W.3/1">Local authorities have a statutory duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in their area. They work in close co-operation with the police and the UK Border Agency to support and provide protection for potentially trafficked children. This will include assessing their needs and putting in place support packages, which may include the child becoming looked after in the care system. Where a child does become looked after, local authorities must allocate the child a social worker who will draw up a care plan. This sets out how the authority intends to respond to the full range of a child's needs, including the need to safeguard them from contact with traffickers.</p>
	<p pid="a.925W.3/2">The plan will also include arrangements to be followed if the young person goes missing. The National Minimum Standards (NMS) for Children's Homes and Fostering Services require all homes and fostering services to have explicit procedures for when looked after children are missing or absent. &#8220;Statutory Guidance on Children who Run Away and Go Missing from Home and Care&#8221;, issued in July 2009, requires local authorities to collect information on missing from care incidents. Local authorities must make regular reports to council members with responsibility for &#8220;corporate parenting&#8221; on patterns of children going missing from care. However, information on whether a looked after child has been the victim of human trafficking, or has been trafficked into the country and subsequently goes missing from care, is not collected centrally.</p>

This change will allow people to retire when they choose to. The legislation will still allow employers to use compulsory retirement ages, which can be earlier than 65 years, providing they can objectively justify it.</p>

The assessment continues to be developed and at this stage, therefore, an evaluation is not available of the impact that changes could have on existing disability living allowance, or future recipients. We are working with disabled people and organisations that represent them on the detailed design and delivery of personal independence payment and the outcomes from this work will be reflected in updates to the impact assessment for this change. We have already announced that personal independence payment will be a non-taxable, non means-tested benefit payable to people in and out of work.</p>

This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.0/4">The main measure of Jobcentre Plus performance is the rate at which people leave Jobseeker's Allowance, Income Support and Employment and Support Allowance and move into employment. The measure supports the Department for Work and Pensions 2011-15 Business Plan and the Coalition Government's structural reform priorities. Jobcentre Plus provides regular monthly progress and performance reports to the Department and Ministers, and performance data will be made available to the public through the DWP website.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.0/5">For the very large numbers of Jobcentre Plus claimants, it is not cost effective or appropriate to routinely monitor what happens to them after they have been successful in finding work. However to help identify those claimants who return quickly to benefit and who experience difficulties remaining in work, Jobcentre Plus monitors the number of times claimants have been on the same benefit over the previous two years, and the period since they last claimed the benefit. The Department also undertakes a range of evaluation activity of its programmes to assess the impact on long term employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.0/6">The Work Programme is now providing support for claimants at most risk of longer dependency on welfare. The Work Programme includes financial incentives for providers for achieving sustained employment outcomes for up to 2 years. A substantial element of the total potential payment is linked to sustained employment. Official statistics will be published in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.935W.3/1">We know it is essential that the assessment for personal independence payment effectively accounts for the needs of disabled people with autistic spectrum disorders. We want the assessment for personal independence payment, which we have been developing in collaboration with a group of independent specialists in health and disability, to consider the impact of disability in a more holistic way than DLA does. The activities we have chosen to assess are intended to allow us to accurately consider the impact of physical, sensory, mental, intellectual and cognitive impairments. For example, the introduction of communication is a significant departure from DLA and one which will ensure we better take into account the effect of impairments that impact on sight, hearing, speech and comprehension.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.3/2">We have published our initial proposals for the assessment criteria and are currently seeking views on them. As part of this officials have already met with the National Autistic Society and are currently considering their initial contribution to our informal consultation. We are also testing the draft assessment criteria over the summer to enable us to better understand their likely impact. As part of this we will be specifically looking at how they affect people with autistic spectrum disorders.</p>
	<p pid="a.935W.3/3">I have separately met with the Society to hear their views on DLA reform firsthand. We hope to continue working closely with them and other disability organisations as we continue to develop the assessment criteria and move towards implementation of personal independence payment.</p>

	<p pid="a.945W.8/2">Child protection is an absolute priority for the Government and we are committed to ensuring we have the best possible arrangements in place to protect children and families from harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.8/3">The police play an important part in local child safeguarding arrangements and have a statutory responsibility to safeguard and promote the welfare of all children in England and to investigate child abuse and other crimes committed against children.</p>
	<p pid="a.945W.8/4">The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) have recently carried out a scoping review of child protection resources and found no evidence to suggest that any force has made or intends to make reductions to their public protection units, in particular their child protection teams. ACPO have also identified good work that is being driven locally to enhance safeguarding through stronger partnership working, and are working with forces to make these good practice models available nationally.</p>

	<p pid="a.947W.2/1">Drugs misuse among young people, including the migrant youth population, is being addressed through the Drug Strategy 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.947W.2/2">There are three strands to the Strategy: reducing demand; restricting supply; and building recovery in communities. The reducing demand theme outlines our approach to preventing young people taking drugs in the first place and, for those already misusing drugs, intervening early and providing support to help them stop their drugs use. By working with the Department for Education and others we are ensuring young people have access to information on drugs&#8212;and the effects and harms of drugs&#8212;via schools through the internal review of Personal, Social, Health and Economic education and review of the National Curriculum and the FRANK drugs information and support service.</p>
	<p pid="a.947W.2/3">The Strategy recognises that particular groups of young people may be at increased risk of drug misuse. Approaches to identifying the needs of young people, and appropriate support are best made at the local level. For those young people who already misuse drugs we are ensuring they have rapid access to specialist support through local substance misuse and youth offending services.</p>
	<p pid="a.947W.2/4">To facilitate this we are encouraging local services to work together by simplifying the funding mechanisms that are used to deliver tailored interventions in local areas for young people and families.</p>
	<p pid="a.947W.2/5">The focus of the Strategy as far as young people are concerned is preventing the escalation of drug misuse by young people to stop them becoming drug dependent adults.</p>

	<p pid="a.949W.9/1">The running costs of Police and Crime Commissioners should be no more than police authorities currently. The only additional cost to the taxpayer under the new system will be that of elections. Democratic accountability will create a sharp incentive on Police and Crime Commissioners to cut bureaucracy, increase efficiency and drive down costs, ensuring that forces focus on the policing the public want.</p>
	<p pid="a.949W.9/2">As stated in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill's impact assessment, elections for Police and Crime Commissioners in England and Wales will cost &#163;50 million in 2012. These estimates are based on the costs of other national elections and costings are, therefore, not available for each force area. However, the money was allocated separately by the Treasury as part of the comprehensive spending review; no money for elections will come out of police force budgets.</p>

	<p pid="a.954W.4/1">Corruption in Afghanistan is endemic. The UK Government, including the Department for International Development (DFID), is working closely with the Government of Afghanistan to tackle corruption, enforce the law and improve government accountability at all levels. Progress to date has been mixed. However, since January 2011 a significant achievement has been the establishment of an independent anti-corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (MEC).</p>
	<p pid="a.954W.4/2">The MEC, comprised of Afghans and international experts will assess progress with tackling corruption against agreed benchmarks and the effectiveness of international assistance in support of these efforts. The UK Government played a key role in lobbying for the creation of the MEC and are supporting its development.</p>

While the ONS collect data on FDI flows to the UK by country, the ONS do not publish a disaggregation by source country of inward investment made specifically into research and development.</p>

	<p pid="a.962W.2/2">The UK&#8217;s research base is a vital national asset and critical to long-term economic growth. Despite enormous pressure on public spending, the funding for science and research programmes has been protected in cash terms at &#163;4.6 billion for each year of the spending review within a ring-fence. Maintaining a substantial flow of new researchers was indentified as a priority in the allocations to the research councils, Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the national academies.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/3">The research councils UK strategic vision includes the promotion of high level skills and states that they will consolidate and focus support for people giving greater attention to establishing the careers of the best early career researchers. The financial allocations to the research councils for the comprehensive spending review period 2011 to 2015 will ensure that the research councils maintain significant support for early career and postdoctoral researchers.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/4">BIS funds a number of early and mid-career fellowship programmes run by the three national academies: these enable the brightest and best academics to work full-time on research and were given priority when negotiating funding allocations. BIS funding for these programmes increases in each year of the current spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/5">The main funders of research in the UK are all signatories to The Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers which has the overall aim of increasing the attractiveness and sustainability of research careers in the UK and improving the quantity, quality and impact of research for the benefit of UK society and the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.2/6">A significant number of early career and postdoctoral researchers are, of course, employed directly by individual universities and it is up to them to decide on the levels of financial support and other available assistance provided.</p>

	<p pid="a.962W.5/2">The E. coli outbreak has had a disruptive economic impact on growers and others within the supply chain for fruit and vegetables across the EU, including our domestic industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.5/3">At retail level, prices for domestically produced salad (lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet peppers and courgettes), have remained relatively stable, although demand continues to decline, as a result more produce is being sent to the wholesale market, which is experiencing consequential price movements. Surplus EU produce has been directed to alternative EU markets, including our own, with similar consequences for prices, although I understand that prices for English produce are faring better than those for imported produce. But the situation continues to develop and the latest indications from our trade organisations are that the market remains depressed, which is not helped by retail demand for salad crops in particular being sensitive to the weather.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.5/4">While there has been an impact on our industry it would be against both the single common market organisation and WTO rules to implement a trade ban for the purposes of protecting domestic producers from price competition. However, the welcome news that the Russian Federation has lifted its ban on imports of fruit and vegetables from the European Union is an important development, which should start to alleviate the pressure on volumes and prices being experienced on the domestic market.</p>

	<p pid="a.965W.2/2">Generally, no undergraduate student studying for their first, full-time qualification will have to contribute to their higher education until they are in a job, and earning over &#163;21,000. As now, the repayment will be 9% of income above the threshold. The repayment period will be a maximum of 30 years. Interest will be set at RPI (retail prices index) + 3% while in study, and once the borrower is liable to repay, interest will vary according to income. If earning &#163;21,000 or less, interest will be set at RPI, and gradually it will increase up to a rate of RPI + 3% for those earning &#163;41,000 or more.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/3">This will mean that those who choose modestly paid or unpaid work&#8212;which may include time spent bringing up a family&#8212;will not be asked to make a contribution and will only be charged the lowest rate of interest. And where someone is contributing and ceases work or begins to earn under the threshold, contributions will cease and the interest rate will decrease.</p>
	<p pid="a.965W.2/4">An interim impact assessment was published in November 2010 which looked at the reforms to higher education funding and student finance and this set out that the new system is more progressive to benefit those who earn less in future.</p>
