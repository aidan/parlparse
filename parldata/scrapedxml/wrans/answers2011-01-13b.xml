	<p pid="b.390W.6/1">The total discard estimate in 2009 (the latest period for which figures are available for those fisheries sampled in UK) is 51,179 tonnes. There are many reasons explaining these discards; however, the current system for recording catch and discard data does not allow us to differentiate (year on year) why each fish is discarded. Despite this, Cefas analysis, conducted in 2010 on the 2008 English and Welsh discard data, estimated that:</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.6/2" class="indent">54% (13,230 tonnes) of total discards were discarded for reasons relating to weak/absent markets (i.e. non-quota species);</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.6/3" class="indent">quota constraints were estimated to account for 22% (5,390 tonnes) of discards (i.e. quota species above the legal minimum landing size);</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.6/4" class="indent">24% (5,880 tonnes) of total discards were quota species below the legal minimum landing size (MLS) and were too small to land.</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.6/5">High grading is another type of discarding where fishermen try to optimise the value of their catches by keeping the good value fish and discarding the poorer value ones. This creates a financial profit for fishermen but is still a waste of legally landable fish. A European high grading ban is in place in waters around the UK to prevent this behaviour. The extent of high grading has not been successfully separated from estimates for other types of discarding. Other types of discarding, such as unmarketable species, over quota and under MLS may represent a loss of value to the fishermen and from the fishery.</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.6/6">Because discard estimates 1997-2010 have not undergone the same analysis as 2008 data, estimates of the financial impacts of discards for the British fleet as a whole are unreliable. To simply use the average market value of all fish species as a multiplier would give an inaccurate estimate of the financial impact of discards. We do, however, have a more robust study under way looking at the economic impact of discarding fish.</p>

Their typical biological characteristics mean most relevant species are thought to be more vulnerable to over-exploitation, and therefore a precautionary approach should be taken.

Effort limits are used to help control fishing as if there is less fishing effort there is also less fishing mortality.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.2/2">There has not yet been any formal assessment of the effectiveness of the existing effort management schemes in achieving the objectives of the management plans. However, at the recent December Fisheries Council the Government secured a commitment from the European Commission to a full and detailed review of the long-term management plan for cod in 2011, in particular the restrictions that apply to fishing effort. The European Commission also recently requested its Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries to look at the relationship between fishing effort and fishing mortality for stocks subject to effort management. The results from this analysis have not yet been published but should become available in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.392W.5/1">EU technical conservation measures set a minimum landing size (MLS) for many commercial fish stocks to protect juvenile fish from being targeted, ensuring they cannot be landed and sold. However, small fish of quota species can still be caught while fishermen are targeting other species; such fish are discarded.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.5/2">We estimate that around 24% of discards (England and Wales-2008) are quota species below the legal MLS. To reduce the number of discarded fish scientists work with UK fishermen to improve the selectivity of fishing gears so that less juvenile fish are caught. The Government's fully documented catch quota trials are also a promising way of reducing discards in UK fisheries.</p>

	<p pid="b.393W.0/1">Policy on reducing mercury emissions from crematoria is kept under regular review. Mercury abatement for 50% of cremations is a proportionate response to tackling a pollutant that has significant health effects-as a neurotoxicant, with the biggest effect on the foetus, newborns and children-as well as damaging ecosystems including fish-eating birds and mammals, Arctic ecosystems, and wetlands.</p>
	<p pid="b.393W.0/2">The improvements are being delivered by the industry through an innovative burden-sharing scheme. The sector currently advises an increase in the fee per cremation of &#163;45 to cover costs. This compares with 2010 data from AXA that the average cost of a funeral by burial is &#163;2,857, and around &#163;800 less expensive by cremation.</p>

	<p pid="b.394W.5/2">The direct ecological effects of discard mortality are inextricably linked to overall fishing mortality. In the North Sea, excessive fishing mortality has been shown to:</p>
	<p pid="b.394W.5/3" class="indent">reduce potential yield from the stocks;</p>
	<p pid="b.394W.5/4" class="indent">reduce species diversity;</p>

	<p pid="b.394W.5/7">Several seabed dwelling species utilise discards. However, evidence for expansion of these populations, as a response to discards, is weak. In general, the full impacts of discarding on marine communities are not well understood, and neither are the consequences of reducing the amount of discarded material. However, it is recognised that removing non-marketable marine organisms from the ecosystem will reduce its health, and is therefore not consistent with good ecosystem management.</p>
	<p pid="b.394W.5/8">A wide range of scavengers, including seabirds and fishes, are also known to feed on discards. In the North Sea, discarding is estimated to account for up to 10% of the overall annual food consumption of scavengers. This level of contribution is probably sufficient to allow larger populations of these scavenging species to exist than would otherwise be possible. For instance, seabirds are estimated to consume 50% of discarded material; enough to potentially support over 6 million birds.</p>

	<p pid="b.398W.3/1">Provision of accommodation for eligible asylum seekers is procured through contracts placed with a mixture of private and public sector providers. The UK Border Agency has in some cases contracts with individual local authorities but most of the provision is with consortiums made up of a number of local authorities operating within a specific region of the UK. The following local authorities and consortiums were all contracted to provide accommodation in each of the last five years:</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/2" class="indent">Glasgow city council</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/3" class="indent">Liverpool city council</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/4" class="indent">Cardiff city council</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/5" class="indent">Swansea city council</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/6" class="indent">Yorkshire and Humberside consortium</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/7" class="indent">North East consortium</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/8" class="indent">North West consortium</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/9" class="indent">West Midlands consortium.</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.3/10">The UK Border Agency does not hold the information requested in respect of the number of homes each local authority has provided in each of the last five years. Each contract stipulates a minimum and maximum number of asylum seekers each local authority/consortium is required to accommodate. The UK Border Agency refers individuals to the contractor whose responsibility it is to provide accommodation and related services whilst the service users remain eligible for asylum support. Accommodation providers are not required to make a specific number of homes available but to ensure they can provide suitable accommodation for asylum seekers up to the maximum figure contained within their contract. Payment is made on a per person per night basis and no tenancy agreement is formed.</p>

	<p pid="b.398W.6/1">The UK Border Agency is obliged under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act to provide accommodation for eligible asylum seekers. The current suite of accommodation contracts expire in 2011 and a recent exercise to reduce the number of contractors in line with the reduction of asylum applications in recent years has meant a number of private sector and local authority/consortium contracts will naturally expire during 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.6/2">The agency is working with both existing and remaining providers to ensure that all asylum seekers continue to have their accommodation needs met. The UK Border Agency is committed to working with providers to identify solutions that will minimise any disruption to asylum seekers who may be affected. We have sought commitments from providers that they will look to minimise the number of relocations, particularly for families where there are children at school.</p>
	<p pid="b.398W.6/3">This may result in a contractual novation of properties allowing asylum seekers to remain in their current accommodation but this can not be guaranteed in all cases. When it is necessary for asylum seekers to move to alternative accommodation provided by a new provider we aim to provide suitable notice and will take into account special requirements to ensure minimum disruption.</p>

	<p pid="b.409W.0/1">All the Ministry of Justice's front-line services are currently exploring ways in which they can operate more effectively in order to deliver the savings required in the Government's spending review. Our current estimate is that over the next four years we will need around 10,000 fewer staff in NOMS. This includes around 500-800 posts in NOMS HQ as a result of the organisational restructure designed to reduce back office costs by a third, with the remaining reductions being at prison establishment level. These reductions will be achieved through a combination of front-line efficiencies and reducing prison capacity due to the plans for rebalancing of sentencing set out in our recent Green Paper.</p>

The first is that the Legal Services Board, the oversight regulator for legal services, will in the next year undertake a review to assess whether the scope of regulation is set appropriately to protect consumers. The second is that the three largest legal regulators (the Solicitors Regulation Authority, Bar Standards Board and Institute for Legal Executives Professional Standards) are currently undertaking a review of regulatory requirements in relation to the education and training of the legal workforce. One of the issues the review will consider is whether regulatory requirements should be put in place in relation to the training and competence of individuals who are not qualified lawyers but who work in regulated organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.427W.5/1">The Department for Transport's approach to appraising proposed transport schemes involves identifying a wide range of economic, environmental, and social impacts. An overview is available at:</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/webtag/documents/overview/unit1">http://www.dft.gov.uk/webtag/documents/overview/unit1</a>.1.php</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.5/3">Benefit-cost ratios (BCRs), after adjustment for non-monetised impacts, are used to inform the economic case through a value for money assessment. Scheme decisions are taken on the strength of their overall business case, of which the economic case is one part.</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.5/4">The impacts of a scheme on: physical activity and obesity; journey time reliability; carbon dioxide emissions; and, time savings by users are reported in the Appraisal Summary Table (AST). Impacts on GVA are captured within these and other categories in the table.</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.5/5">In line with HM Treasury's Green Book appraisal guidance, wherever possible, impacts are monetised using evidence-based values. The size of each impact, and its monetary value, determine its contribution to a scheme's BCR, before it is adjusted for non-monetised impacts in the value for money assessment. However, the presentation of the impacts in the AST allows the decision maker to form their own view over each impact's relative importance, when considering the overall business case.</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.5/6">Last year, the Department for Transport issued 'in draft' scheme appraisal guidance requiring scheme promoters to report how benefits from travel time changes break down into time bands, one of which is zero to two minutes per trip. The guidance is available at:</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.5/7" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/webtag/documents/expert/pdf/unit3">http://www.dft.gov.uk/webtag/documents/expert/pdf/unit3</a>.5.3d.pdf</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.5/8">At the same time, the Department for Transport also published updated 'in-draft' guidance to reflect the current carbon prices that were based on the then current guidance from the Department for Energy and Climate Change. These carbon prices are provided in Table 2a of the 'In Draft' 'Greenhouse Gases Sub-Objective' guidance available at:</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.5/9" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/webtag/documents/expert/pdf/unit3">http://www.dft.gov.uk/webtag/documents/expert/pdf/unit3</a>.3.5d.pdf</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.5/10">These 'in draft' carbon prices were used for the appraisal of schemes during the spending review, to ensure decisions were informed by the most up-to-date values of carbon impacts.</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.5/11">The Department for Transport's Business Plan for 2011-15 states it will reform the way transport projects are assessed, and funding prioritisation decisions are made, so that the benefits of low carbon proposals are fully recognised. This includes reviewing and revising its guidance on appraising transport projects, as well as its processes for assessing schemes and supporting ministerial decisions. We aim to announce the scope and timetable of this review shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.428W.3/1">We have no plans to amend the entitlement conditions for attendance allowance to introduce a mobility component. It is normal for pensions and benefit schemes to contain different provisions for people at different stages of their lives. Disability living allowance which has a mobility component is intended to focus additional help with the extra cost of disability on people who have the very considerable disadvantage of being severely disabled earlier in life and who as a consequence have less opportunity to work, earn and save compared to non-disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="b.428W.3/2">Attendance allowance provides help with the disability-related extra costs of people who experience the onset of disability after age 65. Based on the need for personal care, this help is part of the wide range of support that the Government make available to older people so that they can have a decent and secure income in retirement.</p>

	<p pid="b.432W.6/3">More detailed costs are currently being assessed, however, the Student Loans Company and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, who administer income contingent repayments of student loans, have indicated that the cost of uprating the earnings thresholds for graduate repayments of student loans both on an annual and five-yearly basis are not expected to be significant, and relate mainly to the updating of the relevant information, advice and guidance for employers and graduates.</p>
	<p pid="b.432W.6/4">These costs will be incurred more regularly by uprating annually but this approach is fairer to graduates and is an important element of a progressive system of repayments of student loans.</p>

	<p pid="b.437W.2/1">As set out in my written ministerial statement published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-09">9 December 2010</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2010-12-09.31"><i> Official Report, </i>columns 31-34WS</phrase>, our new delivery model for affordable housing will offer housing associations flexibility to charge rents higher than social rent and at a maximum of 80% of local market rents.</p>
	<p pid="b.437W.2/2">A housing association's calculation of the market rent would need to be based on a</p>
	<p pid="b.437W.2/3">residential lettings estimate for a property of the appropriate size, condition and area. Valuations should be in accordance with a RICS recognised method. We anticipate that landlords nonetheless have regard to the relevant local housing allowance cap for the broad rental market area in which the property is located and other caps on benefits which are currently being implemented such as the aggregate benefit cap. It should be noted that 80% of market rent is a maximum, not a fixed requirement. So it would be open to housing associations to offer a rent at less than 80% of market rates if that best suited local circumstances, including for example if the benefits cap limited the ability of tenants to pay the maximum level of rent in some areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.437W.2/4">A broad rental market area is the area used to set local housing allowance. It is an</p>
	<p pid="b.437W.2/5">area within which a person could reasonably be expected to live having regard to facilities and services for the purposes of health, education, recreation, personal banking and shopping, taking account of the distance of travel, by public and private transport, to and from those facilities and services. The range of rents and how they are dispersed within a broad rental market area depends on the profile of the area itself. In practice, a broad rental market area may include a diverse range of micro-markets with differing rental values, all influenced by the access to facilities and services but equally influenced by very local factors.</p>
	<p pid="b.437W.2/6">There are 152 broad rental market areas in England and each broad rental market</p>
	<p pid="b.437W.2/7">area typically contains three to four local authorities. Information on median rents as at December 2010 for broad rental market areas in England is published by the Valuation Office Agency and is available from the following link. The median represents the &quot;average&quot; rent but in practice there will be variation in rent levels within broad rental market areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.437W.2/8" class="indent"><a href="http://www.voa.gov.uk/LHADirect/Documents/LHA_percentile_rates_Dec_2010.html">http://www.voa.gov.uk/LHADirect/Documents/LHA_percentile_rates_Dec_2010.html</a></p>
	<p pid="b.437W.2/9">The above link also contains information on what the proposed lower local housing allowance rates would be if based on the 30th percentile of rents as at December 2010 and taking into account the new upper limits for each property size.</p>
	<p pid="b.437W.2/10">Given broad rental market areas are so large in size, the median rental figures will mask a very significant variation in rents. Even within a local authority area, market rents will vary street by street, ward by ward. The median, by definition, represents the statistical mid-point across a range of figures, both low and high. In this context it is potentially misleading to make assumptions about the availability of private rented properties, the implications of the upper limits on local housing allowance rates, and the scope for housing associations to charge 80% of market rents based on broad market rental area data covering such wide areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.445W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) made estimates of the costs and savings accrued from measures in the strategic defence and security review for the purposes of formulating policy. It is estimated that not bringing Nimrod MRA4 into service and the RAF vacating Kinloss will save around &#163;2 billion over the next 10 years. Release of further detail may prejudice commercial interests. Furthermore, final savings figures will depend on detailed implementation, which will generally be subject to full consultation with all relevant parties, including the trades unions and the devolved Administrations, as well as the results of mandatory assessments on the impact that the measures will have on sustainability, equality and diversity and health and safety. The MOD is therefore not able to release more detailed figures at this time.</p>

	<p pid="b.447W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.2/2">The application process for disabled students' allowances (DSAs) has several stages involving a number of parties. On receipt of a DSA application form, the Student Loans Company (SLC) will assess the student's eligibility for DSAs and, if the student is eligible, authorise an assessment of their course-related needs at an independent assessment centre. On receipt of a report from the assessment centre, the SLC will write to the student telling them what equipment and other support can be paid for from the DSAs.</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.2/3">This Department has provided the SLC with additional resources to speed up the processing of DSA applications for the academic year (AY) 2010/11 and set shorter target times for completing the two stages of the process for which it is responsible. Last year (AY 2009/10) the SLC's target was to assess eligibility within 15 working days of receipt of the DSA application form and decide what support can be paid for from the DSAs within 15 working days of receipt of the needs assessment report, for 95% of applications. This year (2010/11) the SLC is required to complete each of these stages within 10 working days, in 95% of cases. In November 2010, the latest month for which there is complete data, the SLC was achieving the target level for 94.3% of applications for the first stage and 87.5% of applications for the second stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.2/4">In consultation with stakeholders-through a stakeholder forum which includes representatives from a range of disability organisations as well as higher education institutions and needs assessment centres-SLC has streamlined its processes for dealing with DSA applications, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.2/5" class="indent">an increase in the number of staff allocated to this work, with better training and quality assurance to ensure consistency in the service provided to customers;</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.2/6" class="indent">better forecasting and daily management of all parts of the process, allowing SLC to pro-actively manage resources to match the flow of applications;</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.2/7" class="indent">SLC proactively contacting needs assessment centres to follow up applications and assess processing levels; and</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.2/8" class="indent">disability awareness training for both advisers and processing staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.447W.2/9">These measures have contributed to improved processing times for the overall process from receipt of the application to payment. We recognise that there is still more to do and the SLC continues to work with partners and stakeholders to improve the service for disabled students.</p>

	<p pid="b.450W.2/1">It is not possible to provide the information requested due to the way in which funding is provided to schools through local authorities. Local authorities receive their schools funding through the dedicated schools grant. It is for each local authority to distribute funding to its schools using its locally agreed formula. Local funding formulae determine how much of the schools budget will be retained for core services to children and families and how much will be delegated to schools. It is then for governors and head teachers to determine how much of the total funding delegated to their school will be used to provide SEN services in their school.</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.2/2">There is publicly available data on school funding made to local authorities through the dedicated schools grant; planned expenditure on the provision for pupils with SEN in the 2009-10 financial year was almost &#163;5.2 billion. Of this, &#163;2.1 billion was delegated to mainstream schools, &#163;1.6 billion was delegated to maintained special schools, and &#163;612 million was spent on placing children with SEN statements at independent and non-maintained special schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.2/3">The Schools White Paper 2010 recognises that funding for schools should be fairer and more transparent, enabling schools to meet the needs of their pupils. Extra resources should clearly follow those pupils who might need extra help and support. The White Paper stated that the Government will be consulting on developing and introducing a clear, transparent and fairer national funding formula based on the needs of pupils, to work alongside our recently announced plans for a pupil premium.</p>

	<p pid="b.450W.5/2">Data on under 18 conceptions will continue to be collected and published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on an annual basis and each quarter. The Business Plan of the Department for Education published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-08">8 November</phrase> included an impact indicator on reducing teenage pregnancy, based on the under 18 conception rate. This demonstrates the importance which the Government attaches to this as a key measurement indicator for showing progress in narrowing equalities and reducing child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.5/3">It is important that local areas take action to reduce teenage pregnancy rates and I have asked them to continue giving this priority. Each area knows its local population and is best placed to decide what services to put in place, using the international evidence and lessons from areas where rates have fallen fastest.</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.5/4">That is why we will be giving local authorities greater freedom and flexibility through future funding arrangements from April 2011. The proposed Early Intervention Grant will bring together funding for Sure Start, families with multiple problems and targeted support for vulnerable young people who are at risk of a range of poor outcomes including teenage pregnancy as well as substance misuse and involvement in youth crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.450W.5/5">We have also made clear in the White Paper, 'The Importance of Teaching', published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-24">24 November</phrase>, that children need high quality sex and relationships so they can make wise and informed choices for themselves and that they can benefit enormously from high quality Personal, Social, Heath and Economic (PSHE) education.</p>

While the Secretary of State for Education has not had specific discussions with the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport on access for young people on low incomes, these issues are at the heart of what the coalition Government are trying to achieve through a rich menu of cultural experiences.</p>

	<p pid="b.455W.0/1">As part of the National Audit of Dementia, the NHS Information Centre is currently collecting information on the Department's behalf on dementia services throughout England. The results from this exercise are expected in the spring of 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.455W.0/2">In addition, at the end of September we published a new dementia outcomes-focused Implementation Plan. This set out the Department's priority objectives for improving the care of those with dementia including a focus on early diagnosis and intervention for all, improved quality of care in general hospitals, living well with dementia in care homes and reducing the use of antipsychotic medication to treat people with dementia. Managers and clinicians who provide local services need to account for the quality and standards of care for people with dementia and will be held to account for these services locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.455W.0/3">In support of the Implementation Plan a National Dementia Declaration was jointly launched in October by the Government and the Alzheimer's Society. This brings together a range of bodies, each setting out what they plan to do to support the implementation of the strategy. The Department is also developing a commissioning pack to provide guidance for primary care trusts (PCTs) and local authorities on how best to commission dementia services.</p>
	<p pid="b.455W.0/4">The revised NHS Operating Framework for 2010-11 introduced a requirement for PCTs to publish locally how they deliver services for people with dementia, building on the work of the National Dementia Strategy. This requirement continues to apply under the terms of the NHS Operating Framework for 2011-12, which also spells out that national health service organisations are expected to make progress on implementing the National Dementia Strategy, including the four priority areas as set out in the implementation plan published in September 2010:</p>
	<p pid="b.455W.0/5" class="indent">good quality early diagnosis and intervention for all;</p>
	<p pid="b.455W.0/6" class="indent">improved quality of care in general hospitals;</p>
	<p pid="b.455W.0/7" class="indent">living well with dementia in care homes; and</p>
	<p pid="b.455W.0/8" class="indent">reduced use of antipsychotic medication.</p>
	<p pid="b.455W.0/9">In implementing the strategy, PCTs and NHS trusts also need to take account of the findings of the report from the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death 'An Age Old Problem: A review of the care received by elderly patients undergoing Surgery', published in November 2010. The report identifies shortcomings in the care of older people and suggests how services can be improved.</p>

	<p pid="b.457W.2/1">Departmental officials have been in regular contact with pharmacy representative organisations in relation to seasonal flu. This has been part of our approach to ensuring patients have access to the antiviral medicines they may need.</p>
	<p pid="b.457W.2/2">Vaccination in pharmacies has arisen in those discussions, including for children. Community pharmacies typically provide flu vaccinations under a patient group direction (PGD). This allows a prescription only medicine to be supplied or administered without a prescription from a doctor. There are rigorous governance procedures that must be used when a PGD is developed. The PGD can be used only by named, registered health care professionals trained to use it and within criteria set by those developing it, such as any age restriction.</p>
	<p pid="b.457W.2/3">Where vaccination is a private transaction, it is for pharmacy companies to set eligibility criteria, such as age, for example reflecting their staff training. Where a PGD is used in pharmacies within the same organisation and outside of the national health service, the organisation must be registered with the Care Quality Commission.</p>

	<p pid="b.459W.13/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has done much to meet urgent needs in Haiti, providing support immediately after the earthquake and again in December 2010. This has helped to reach a million people with food, shelter, clean water and medical care and 200,000 people with cholera treatment and prevention. The UK continues to support Haiti through its contributions to agencies like the UN and World Bank, who are best placed to lead efforts on the ground. Our share of their commitments already amounts to more than $170 million in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.13/2">Haiti continues to face difficult humanitarian challenges exacerbated by the subsequent cholera epidemic following the disastrous earthquake a year ago. Shelter and sanitation are the most pressing needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.459W.13/3">According to the latest United Nations figures, the number of people remaining in camps has fallen from 1.5 million last July to 800,000 in January. Of those 700,000 people leaving the camps, 100,000 have been re-housed in temporary accommodation. Others have returned to their former homes, with some continuing to camp outside their homes where they are too badly damaged. 95% of children in affected areas who were in school before the earthquake have now returned to school. As of <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-07">7 January</phrase>, the Haitian Ministry of Health has reported 3,759 deaths through cholera and 181,829 cases nationwide. The latest United Nations analysis suggests that the epidemic is stabilising in some parts of Haiti but rural areas are still suffering increasing infection rates.</p>

This figure does not include the costs of any analysis and research carried out by other Government Departments to support the review, nor does it include the cost of any follow-up work, as these figures are not centrally held.</p>

	<p pid="b.461W.9/1">ISAs are the Government's main non-pensions savings incentive, and are held by 20 million adults. The Government believes that ISAs are a trusted brand, and that it is important that this is maintained. The Government also believes that ISAs should be mainstream savings products. The Government therefore does not intend to allow shares listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM)-which can be riskier and less liquid-to be qualifying investments for ISAs. It is already the case that companies listed on AIM may benefit from other incentive schemes, such as investments made through the Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Trusts.</p>

	<p pid="b.464W.4/2">In June 2010 we announced our commitment to publish the first ever Government action plan on transgender equality by the end of 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.464W.4/3">Work to develop the action plan is progressing. Our firm commitment is to work with transgender groups to develop the action plan. As part of this, to date the Government Equalities Office has held two informal workshops involving invited members of the transgender community to seek their views on what action is needed to tackle the inequalities they experience. I attended the workshop which took place on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-06">6 December 2010</phrase>. Our engagement with the transgender community will continue throughout 2011 as we continue to develop the action plan.</p>
