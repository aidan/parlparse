This enables them to identify which locations in the UK-have significant historic peak PMSE spectrum demand. Furthermore, Ofcom consults regularly with its contracted PMSE spectrum licensing body, JFMG, to understand which future events are likely to require significant quantities of spectrum for PMSE.</p>

	<p pid="c.766W.11/1">Games are classified according to guidelines set out by either the British Board of Film Classification or the Pan European Games Information (PEGI) system. These take into account the content, and games that contain violence or misogyny would be classified accordingly. We are working with the video game industry to ensure it does all it can to increase parents' understanding of age ratings and of improved parental controls on equipment.</p>
	<p pid="c.766W.11/2">The advertising of computer games is controlled through the UK Advertising Codes, which are robustly administered by the independent Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The codes require that all video games advertising should be socially responsible and that ads for games carrying a PEGI rating of 15+ are not targeted at audiences below the age of 16. Should the ASA find that an advertiser has breached the advertising codes, they will not hesitate to take action.</p>

	<p pid="c.769W.2/1">The Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General, (Mr Maude) issued a written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-16">16 March 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2011-03-16.9"><i> Official Report,</i> columns 9-10WS</phrase>, updating Parliament on progress with the public bodies reform. That statement announced that Departments' estimate that cumulative administrative savings of at least &#163;2.6 billion will flow from public bodies over the spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="c.769W.2/2">The 40 health bodies listed in the Public Bodies Reform-Proposals for Change document are a mixture of advisory non-departmental public bodies (31, of which, 23 will be abolished or be reconstituted as a Department of Health or Public Health Service expert committee) and executive non-departmental public bodies (nine, of which, seven are to be abolished).</p>
	<p pid="c.769W.2/3">In terms of the Department's advisory non-departmental public bodies, the current costs are small and the opportunities for savings are corresponding in size.</p>
	<p pid="c.769W.2/4">For the group of executive non-departmental public bodies, savings will accrue not just from the seven bodies that are leaving the sector, but also through efficiency savings from those remaining. An analysis of all nine executive organisations listed in the Cabinet Office document (Alcohol Education and Research Council, Appointments Commission, Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, General Social Care Council, Health Protection Agency, Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), Human Tissue Authority (HTA), Care Quality Commission and Monitor-for HFEA and HTA the plan is for them to leave the sector at the end of the parliamentary session) indicates that &#163;67 million could be saved in grant in aid in 2011-12.</p>

	<p pid="c.770W.11/1">'Improving Outcomes-A Strategy for Cancer', published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January 2011</phrase>, sets out a range of measures to improve the quality and efficiency of cancer services in England. Backed by more than &#163;750 million over the next four years, the strategy sets out the Department's plans to improve earlier diagnosis, access to screening and treatment and improve patients' experience of care, putting patients and the public at the heart of cancer services.</p>
	<p pid="c.770W.11/2">The strategy sets out actions to tackle preventable cancer incidence, improve the quality and efficiency of cancer services; improve patients' experience of care; improve quality of life for cancer survivors; and deliver outcomes that are comparable with the best in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="c.770W.11/3">The impact assessment published alongside the strategy shows how we can save an additional 5,000 lives every year by 2014-15 through early diagnosis and improved access to screening and radiotherapy.</p>
	<p pid="c.770W.11/4">To support the national health service to achieve earlier diagnosis of cancer alongside efficiency savings, the strategy is backed by over &#163;450 million investment over the spending review period. The earlier diagnosis money will:</p>
	<p pid="c.770W.11/5" class="indent">give general practitioners (GPs) increased access to key diagnostic tests;</p>
	<p pid="c.770W.11/6" class="indent">allow for the increased testing and treatment costs in secondary care associated with more people being diagnosed;</p>
	<p pid="c.770W.11/7" class="indent">support campaigns aimed at raising awareness of the signs and symptoms of cancer and getting symptomatic patients to present earlier; and</p>
	<p pid="c.770W.11/8" class="indent">support GPs to diagnose cancer earlier, including support on when to commission and how to interpret diagnostic tests.</p>
	<p pid="c.770W.11/9">This funding is part of over &#163;750 million additional funding for cancer over the spending review period to support delivery of 'Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer'. This includes funding for screening (flexible sigmoidoscopy) and radiotherapy (proton beam therapy) announced earlier in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="c.770W.11/10">The Department published the national 'No Health Without Mental Health' strategy on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-02">2 February 2011</phrase>. It has the twin aims of promoting and sustaining good mental health and well-being in the wider population, and improving the quality of existing services for people across the full range of mental health problems. It looks at prevalence of problems and effective approaches at different stages in life, stressing the importance of prevention and early intervention.</p>
	<p pid="c.770W.11/11">Although a national strategy, it illustrates how local health organisations could make real improvements in quality of life for people with mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.770W.11/12">The Department's work with partners, including the Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, has made it clear that the context for this strategy is one of great financial pressure; so it has focused on priority areas of improvement while leaving plans and actions to local decision making. So this strategy should inform local planning, but not constrain it.</p>
	<p pid="c.770W.11/13">The approach to quality and outcomes is about shifting responsibility to the local level; there are no national performance management and no targets. Our focus will be on ensuring local areas have access to information that supports their individual approaches and enables individuals, neighbourhoods and communities to make appropriate change happen in a reformed system. This is not about central Government enacting change from the centre.</p>
	<p pid="c.770W.11/14">The Government expect clinicians in all areas to follow the guidance in both documents.</p>

	<p pid="c.776W.2/1">Offences of dog fouling, the dropping of litter and parking offences are summary offences and do not feature in the police recorded crime statistics collected by the Home Office. The Home Office does collect penalty notice for disorder (PND) data on recorded offences of criminal damage, which includes graffiti-related offences, although these are part of an aggregate count and therefore cannot be separately identified.</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.2/2">Within the Home Office classification of &quot;Public Health offences&quot;, there are two sub-classifications which would cover the offence of fly-tipping although the actual term 'fly-tipping' is not specified. These sub-classifications cannot be separately identified from the police recorded crime statistics and in practice, it is more likely that offences of fly-tipping would be reported to and recorded by the relevant local authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.2/3">Information on fixed penalties for motoring offences (FPNs) reported to the Home Office shows that there were 496,000 FPNs issued for 'obstruction, waiting and parking offences' in 2006, 447,000 in 2007 and 332,000 in 2008. Data for 2009 are scheduled to be published in April 2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.2/4">In addition to the FPNs for motoring offences as collected by the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) collects data on fixed penalty notices for disorder offences such as 'depositing and leaving litter', which can be accessed via the following link to the MoJ website:</p>

	<p pid="c.776W.5/1">Criminal record exchange within the European Union takes place within the framework of Council Decision 2005/876/JHA on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record. Between 2007-08 and 2009-10 the amount of criminal convictions exchanged has increased:</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.5/2" class="indent">Notifications received of UK nationals convicted in the EU increased from 3,120 to 6,298.</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.5/3" class="indent">The number of notifications from the UK to other member states about the convictions of one of their nationals here has increased from 12,736 in 2007-08 (when only the first conviction of an EU national was sent) to 33,583 in 2009-10 (when all convictions were sent).</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.5/4" class="indent">The number of requests received for the criminal record of UK citizens subject to criminal proceedings in other member states has increased from 190 to 341 in the same time period.</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.5/5" class="indent">The number of requests made by the UK police and law enforcement agencies in relation to EU nationals subject to criminal proceedings here increased from 2,372 to 6,513.</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.5/6">As a result we now know a significant amount about the offending of UK nationals abroad and the previous offending history of EU nationals being prosecuted here. A new Framework Decision (2009/315/JHA) will make exchange mandatory from April 2012 and so we expect to see further increases in exchange.</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.5/7">The UK Central Authority for the Exchange of Criminal Records is leading a project to look at how the exchange of fingerprints can confirm the identity of individuals being prosecuted in the UK so that the correct previous convictions can be obtained from the country of nationality. Significant results have already been obtained through finding out the true identity of individuals being prosecuted here.</p>
	<p pid="c.776W.5/8">The UK Central Authority for the Exchange of Criminal Records has also begun to exchange criminal convictions electronically with other member states through the Network of Judicial Registers Project. Electronic exchange is quicker and cheaper than existing methods and should ensure that there is a continued increase in the number of criminal record files exchanged with other EU countries.</p>

There are currently three general AVR programmes which are co-funded with the European Return Fund:</p>
	<p pid="c.779W.2/2">Voluntary Assisted Return and Reintegration Programme (VARRP) is for those who have sought asylum and those with certain forms of related temporary status in the UK. Returnees receive support in acquiring travel documentation, flight to country of origin and onward domestic transport, airport assistance at departure and arrival airports and up to &#163;1,500 worth of reintegration assistance per person including a &#163;500 relocation grant on departure for immediate resettlement needs, additional luggage allowance and, once home, a range of reintegration options. The majority of returnees use their reintegration assistance in income generation activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.779W.2/3">Assisted Voluntary Return for Families and Children (AVRFC) is for families comprising of a maximum of two adult parents or legal guardians and at least one child (under 18) and from unaccompanied children (under 18) who have either sought asylum or who are in the UK illegally and wish to return home. Returnees receive support in acquiring travel documentation, flight to country of origin and onward domestic transport, airport assistance at departure and arrival airports and up to &#163;2,000 worth of reintegration assistance per person, including a &#163;500 relocation grant on departure for immediate resettlement needs, additional luggage allowance and, once home, a range of reintegration options. The scheme offers flexibility of reintegration for the whole family and increased emphasis is placed on the use of reintegration assistance for educational needs as well as income generation.</p>
	<p pid="c.779W.2/4">Assisted Voluntary Return for Irregular Migrants (AVRIM) is for those migrants who have not sought asylum, but who are in the UK illegally and wish to return home. Returnees receive support in acquiring travel documentation, flight to country of origin and onward domestic transport, and airport assistance at departure and arrival airports. There is generally no reintegration assistance for AVRIM applicants; however, there is discretionary reintegration assistance of up to &#163;1,000, considered on a case by case basis, available for vulnerable applicants. In addition to the general AVR programmes, the Facilitated Return Scheme is designed to help non-EEA foreign national prisoners return and reintegrate back into their home country. The main aim of the scheme is to promote and assist the process of early removals by encouraging full compliance and cooperation of foreign national prisoners wishing to return voluntarily.</p>
	<p pid="c.779W.2/5">Applications for the scheme are accepted from non-EEA nationals who have been convicted and are serving or have served a custodial sentence in a UK prison. Those who apply for and are accepted for the Facilitated Return Scheme will receive a cash payment of between &#163;750 and &#163;1,500 to help them build a new life on return to their home country.</p>

Further details of representations received for the limits consultation can be found on the UK Border Agency website. We announced our response to this consultation in November 2010. In addition we held a public consultation on the student visa system, the results of which will be published in due course.

	<p pid="c.786W.5/2">The setting of premiums is a commercial decision for individual insurers and younger drivers pay more because they pose a higher risk to insurers. The Government are, however, taking a number of measures to help mitigate insurance costs, including steps to tackle uninsured driving and insurance fraud and to reduce the costs of litigation.</p>
	<p pid="c.786W.5/3">Continuous insurance enforcement will come into effect in the next few months to identify uninsured vehicles, which will make it harder to evade detection and penalties if vehicles are driven without the driver being insured. We are working with insurers to allow them access to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency drivers' database in order to tackle insurance fraud at the underwriting stage. The Ministry of Justice has consulted on measures for reducing litigation costs and working with enforcement agencies and insurers to tackle fraud. These steps will all help to reduce insurance premiums, including for young drivers.</p>
	<p pid="c.786W.5/4">We are also considering how the driver testing and training process can be improved to better prepare new drivers for the roads, and therefore reduce their risks and hence insurance premiums.</p>

	<p pid="c.800W.0/5" class="indent">This includes cuts, scratches, grazes, bloody noses, concussion, serious bruising and sprains where medical treatment is given by a member of staff or a nurse.

	<p pid="c.800W.0/7" class="indent">This includes serious cuts, fractures, loss of consciousness, damage to internal organs and poisoning. Where 24-hour healthcare is available the young person may remain onsite. At other establishments, the young person will be taken to a local hospital. Treatment will reflect the more serious nature of the injuries sustained and may include stitches, re-setting bones, operations and providing overnight observation.</p>

	<p pid="c.802W.2/1">If an increased discount for an early guilty plea had the desired effect of encouraging defendants to plead guilty at an earlier stage in the proceedings, it would potentially reduce burdens on the police (and the Crown Prosecution Service) to the extent that less effort would need to be devoted to assembling evidence, and on the probation service to the extent that where shorter sentences were imposed, a smaller percentage of offenders would be subject to post release supervision and these periods of supervision would also be shorter resulting in a reduction in probation workload, although it would also be possible for there to be greater demand on the service through a long community order rather than a short prison sentence. Victims and witnesses would benefit from a prompt resolution of the case, as they would no longer need to worry about having to go to court to give evidence. We would not anticipate that there would be any effect on businesses.</p>

We are working closely with industry partners to achieve this: by backing the industry led Campaign for the Farmed Environment and Greenhouse Gas Action Plan. Specific support that DEFRA provides to farmers to help them undertake sustainable farming is funding via the Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) in the form of agri-environment schemes such as Entry Level Stewardship, Higher Level Stewardship and Uplands Entry Level Stewardship. We also provide advice and guidance on effective nutrient management of land to maximise efficiency whilst minimising environmental impacts.</p>
	<p pid="c.803W.10/2">The Department uses a number of complementary approaches to assess the economic, environmental and social impacts of sustainable farming policies, including on the wider rural economy, but measured principally at a national level. These include specific evaluation projects, such as that of the RDPE, monitoring the uptake of relevant schemes, such as Entry Level Stewardship and the Campaign for the Farmed Environment, and developing comprehensive indicator sets to monitor progress along the economic, environmental and social vectors. Among these a small number of high level impact indicators will be used to track progress with respect to the DEFRA business plan but a much wider range of information is available, in particular, from the Agricultural Change and Environment Observatory indicator set, published at:</p>

	<p pid="c.804W.2/1">As indicated in the 'Renewable Heat Incentive' report published by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-10">10 March</phrase>, the Government recognise that at farm scale some energy crops may be required in combination with slurries and that such crops can be grown as part of the normal agricultural rotation. Furthermore, there is land available which is not suitable for the production of food crops but which may, therefore, be used to supply energy-crop only anaerobic digestion (AD) plants. However, it is not our policy to encourage energy crop-based AD, particularly where these crops are grown to the exclusion of food producing crops.</p>
	<p pid="c.804W.2/2">If evidence shows that there is a large scale use of crops in AD, and a resulting land use change to support this, then measures will be considered to address the issue. DECC and DEFRA will discuss how such a mechanism could work in practice, including possible measures to exclude the large scale use of energy crops in AD from renewable heat incentive support.</p>

	<p pid="c.809W.9/1">We remain committed to research that will benefit the forestry industry as part of the GB activities of the Forestry Commission, and to maintaining our front-line science capacity, especially in high priority areas like plant health research. However, all activity areas have been asked to make reductions to meet the requirements of the spending review. Delivery of the Science and Innovation Strategy will remain a key element. Reducing transaction and back office costs will allow funding to be concentrated on evidence and science. High priority areas such as tree health and climate change will receive increased funding and we will work with other funders to ensure continued access to appropriate research capacity and capability, and to explore partnership opportunities to ensure best value for money.</p>

Forest Research will shortly be consulting staff on a proposed restructuring programme; no decisions will be made until the results of the consultation with staff and trade unions are known.</p>

Professor Bob Watson is jointly leading a project with the Forestry Commission director general, Tim Rollinson, to develop an &quot;action plan&quot; for tree health and plant biosecurity. One strand of the action plan will consider the issues, priorities and research opportunities. Professor Watson is already taking this forward with the Forestry Commission, Forest Research and the Food and Environment Research Agency, along with other interested parties such as the research councils and experts in academia. As well as identifying priorities for research, we are keen to explore all possible avenues for partnerships and co-funding to deliver this new work.</p>

	<p pid="c.812W.3/1">Two parties were directly involved in the seed contamination incident in the Somerton and Frome constituency in 2008. They were the farmer who grew some of the affected seed in part of a field on his holding, and the company who owned the seed. The latter was a subsidiary of Aardvark Investments SA. The GT73 trait is owned by the company Monsanto. The conventional seed variety is not being considered for inclusion on the UK National List.</p>
	<p pid="c.812W.3/2">The question of whether the name of the farmer involved in this incident should be disclosed has in effect just been reviewed in a relevant case before an Information Tribunal. In this, the GM Freeze organisation appealed against a decision by the Information Commissioner that DEFRA was justified in not disclosing the precise location of the Somerset incident, in part because it would serve to reveal the identity of the farmer and could unfairly prejudice his interests. After considering the matter in detail, the tribunal has recently decided to dismiss the GM Freeze appeal, upholding the stance taken by the Information Commissioner and DEFRA.</p>

However, a report from the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) &quot;Realising the value of recovered plastic-an update&quot; (spring 2010) estimates that around 4.5 million tonnes of plastics enters the UK waste stream each year. In 2009, it is estimated that around 900,000 tonnes of this material was recovered for recycling.</p>

	<p pid="c.819W.0/1">In the past there has not been the political space in Egypt for a strong democratic opposition to be able to develop. We believe that it is important that the political reform process in Egypt includes representatives from every part of society. Before parliamentary elections are held in Egypt, opposition groups will need time to coalesce and form their respective platforms.</p>

A key first step to this action will be a new law on political parties. We understand that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces will issue such a law shortly after the referendum on constitutional reforms. We will continue to urge the Egyptian Government to engage in meaningful dialogue with opposition and activist groups to build trust with them so as to enable the aspirations of the people to be realised.</p>

The west bank's economy grew at 7.2% in 2009; however, much of this growth was derived from higher Government spending and international aid rather than from exports, which fell in that period.

	<p pid="c.826W.3/1">The UK imports small quantities of oil from the Persian Gulf, so physical supplies are not directly affected by the problem of piracy off the Somali coast. However, the phenomenon is a concern because the undisrupted supply of Gulf oil to global markets helps to ensure stable oil prices, including for UK consumers. The UK imports increasing volumes of liquefied natural gas from the Gulf, which uses the same maritime routes, and UK-flagged vessels and their crews are vulnerable to the threat of piracy.</p>

	<p pid="c.832W.9/25">Weather-related reasons which can preclude non-operational flying, include low cloud base and high wind, snow and ice. Certain stations with a key operational role have an enhanced level of snow and ice clearing equipment enabling them to return to flying operations more quickly. Other reasons for lost flying days can include spilt fuel or debris on runways, bird activity, designated flight safety days, air traffic control maintenance and, last year, volcanic activity in Iceland.</p>

	<p pid="c.834W.0/13" class="indent">(ii) With respect to the 2011 Census in England and Wales, the cost increase compared with 2001 is predominantly due to: the need for developing, evaluating and operating an address register, a questionnaire tracking system, and a secure online questionnaire completion system; the development, testing and processing of a fourth page of questions per person; the additional resources to conduct the follow-up operation in the areas which are hardest to enumerate; and increased contact centre capacity and improved communications.

	<p pid="c.835W.9/2">The relocation of Government staff outside of London continues to be considered among other options to deliver the savings set out at the spending review and increase the efficiency of the Government's estate.</p>
	<p pid="c.835W.9/3">It is the Government's property strategy to implement and manage a system of national property controls across the central civil and operational estate as well as setting up property vehicles (PVs) that will make savings through a more co-ordinated approach to property asset management of the central civil office estate. As a first step, the Government Property Unit will set up pilot PVs for the central London and Bristol office estate from 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="c.835W.9/4">The current spending controls on Government property will result in a reduction in both the cost and size of the estate. To date, the national property controls have produced estate cost reductions of around &#163;50 million. As the estate reduces in size, retained buildings will be utilised more intensively wherever possible. This reduction of property in London and elsewhere could see posts being relocated to areas close to London, and where there is a strong business case, to other parts of the country.</p>

	<p pid="c.837W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.837W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated March 2001:</p>
	<p pid="c.837W.2/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking how many deaths (a) in Southend, (b) in Essex and (c) nationally were attributed to an individual being (i) overweight and (ii) underweight in each year since 2009. (45595)</p>
	<p pid="c.837W.2/4" class="indent">The terms 'overweight' and 'underweight' are not normally used in the registration of deaths. Consequently, figures can only be provided for deaths recorded using the medically recognised terms 'obesity' and 'malnutrition' or 'effects of hunger'. The number of deaths so recorded is unlikely to be a complete or accurate reflection of the actual numbers of deaths which result, directly or indirectly, from being overweight or underweight.</p>
	<p pid="c.837W.2/5" class="indent">The tables attached provide the number of deaths where (i) obesity was the underlying cause of death (Table 1) or was mentioned on the death certificate, either as the underlying cause or as a contributory factor (Table 2), and where (ii) malnutrition was the underlying cause of death (Table 1) or malnutrition or effects of hunger were mentioned on the death certificate, either as the underlying cause or as a contributory factor (Table 2), for (a) Southend-on-Sea unitary authority, (b) Essex county and (c) England and Wales, for 2009 (the latest year available). Data for deaths registered in 2010 will be available in July 2011.</p>
	<p pid="c.837W.2/6" class="indent">Malnutrition is rarely the underlying cause of death, as people with malnutrition or effects of hunger mentioned on their death certificate often have another serious illness, and it is this illness that is the underlying cause of death. For example they may have cancer of the digestive tract, which means they can't eat properly or can't absorb nutrients; they may have suffered from a stroke or have advanced dementia which can cause difficulties chewing and swallowing; or they may abuse alcohol and so not eat properly.</p>
	<p pid="c.837W.2/7" class="indent">The number of deaths registered in England and Wales each year by sex, age and cause are published annually on the National Statistics website at:</p>

The UK Government doesn't enter the ring on the rights and wrongs of abortion. But the fact is that nearly 70,000 women in the developing world die every year as a result of unsafe abortions-and millions more risk their lives. Giving women the power over whether and when they have children is one of my top priorities. The UK Government will not stand by and let women die needlessly in pregnancy and childbirth.</p>
	<p pid="c.843W.5/3">On value for money, the Government take the view that investing in reproductive health is highly cost-effective and has far reaching returns for women and girls. A copy of IPPF's PPA Evaluation, 2008-10 will be placed in the Library of the House, of which Chapter 4 covers value for money.</p>

	<p pid="c.851W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-04">4 February</phrase> a technical failure occurred within the Department's IT system that supports the processing of parliamentary questions. This system does not monitor letters from hon. Members. We were advised following initial investigations that the problem would be rectified within a few days and given this initial advice we did not inform Parliament. On further investigation the scale of the problem was far greater than originally anticipated, taking three weeks to be resolved. The Department did not intend to mislead Parliament, however given the eventual scale of the issue we accept that we should have informed Parliament of this situation. Since the House returned on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-28">28 February</phrase> the Department has answered over 600 questions.</p>

	<p pid="c.851W.8/1">The Government are committed to reducing the administrative burden on school staff. We have already announced that: the time consuming self-evaluation form will be removed; the inspection framework will be streamlined; all data collections from schools are being reviewed; and have included measures in the Education Bill to remove unnecessary regulations. In addition, we are taking action to significantly reduce the volume of guidance and advice issued to schools and have adopted a new approach to ensure guidance is clear and concise. These changes are just the start of an ongoing programme of work and our intention is to work with local authorities and other Government Departments to reduce the administrative burden further.</p>

The assessment is being developed and at this stage, therefore, an assessment is not available of the impact changes could have on existing disability living allowance, or future recipients. We are working with disabled people and organisations who represent them on the detailed design and delivery of personal independence payment and the outcomes from this work will be reflected in updates to the impact assessment for this change.

	<p pid="c.862W.5/1">In order to drive the best value for money for the taxpayer we are using a Prime Provider model to deliver the Work Programme. The Prime Providers will be underpinned by smaller, specialist sub contractors to ensure the individual needs of all customers are met at a local level. It is at this sub contractor level where we would expect to see small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="c.862W.5/2">The provider payment model for the Work Programme has been extensively tested and assured to ensure that it is commercially and financially viable for potential suppliers. The payment model is largely outcome-based with a job outcome payment paid once the customer has been in employment for 13 or 26 weeks depending on customer group, and sustainment payments paid monthly thereafter for continued employment. During the first three years of the contracts the Department will also be paying an attachment fee to providers. The attachment fee is specifically designed to help providers with cash flow in the early years of the contracts, before being withdrawn as the programme matures and they start to receive greater remuneration from outcome-based payments.</p>
	<p pid="c.862W.5/3">Within the standard terms and conditions of contract for the Work Programme, the Department has committed to pay all providers within 30 calendar days of notification. The Prime Contractor will be entitled to receive interest after 30 calendar days on any payment that is not made when properly due.</p>
	<p pid="c.862W.5/4">In addition, the Department has sought to strengthen the hand of smaller organisations in their dealings with our Prime Providers, and I believe that the systems we are putting in place will mean a more level playing field. In particular our 'Merlin Standard' will ensure that smaller organisations are treated fairly in their dealings with primes and that supply chains remain robust and healthy.</p>

	<p pid="c.863W.2/1">The European Commission has yet to announce the scope and nature of its proposed review of EU health and safety legislation. Consequently, it is not yet possible to provide a meaningful or accurate estimate of how much it would cost. The Government will work to ensure that any future proposals respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, and are accompanied by a full impact assessment. Provided these principles are respected, in principle, a review of EU legislation in this field could provide the opportunity and evidence for removing obsolete or inefficient laws. In particular it could be used to examine which EU health and safety rules for low risk businesses are overly prescriptive, which are disproportionate and which seek unnecessarily to eliminate risk instead of managing it. These aims would be consistent with the recommendations in &quot;Common Sense, Common Safety&quot;, which the Government accepted in October 2010.</p>

	<p pid="c.868W.5/1">The Commission Communication &quot;An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs&quot; makes no specific proposals in relation to social security beyond calling for an awareness campaign on the EU social security coordination rules so that citizens understand their rights when moving within Europe. This campaign has been designed by the European Commission and does not involve any direct costs to the public purse or transfer of powers from the UK. Furthermore, the campaign does not change in any way conditions for receiving social security benefits, and the UK already has in place strict controls on access to non-contributory benefits for migrants.</p>
	<p pid="c.868W.5/2">The Communication also refers to social security as one of four components of the policy concept of &quot;flexicurity&quot;. This was defined by Council Principles in December 2007. The term is applied to a range of measures within national competence under the long-running European Employment Strategy, now incorporated into Europe 2020, which allows for coordination between member states. Flexicurity seeks to improve the flexibility of labour markets while providing adequate security of employment. The UK is one of the leading models in this regard and we are promoting our approaches to welfare reform with other countries so that across the EU more people are in employment.</p>

There are additional rules determining how much households containing more than one eligible individual and individuals in receipt of certain benefits receive. These additional rules are also included in the calculations.

	<p pid="c.872W.5/2">The One-in, One-Out policy took effect from autumn 2011. It applies to domestic regulation and the Government plan to release a Statement of Regulation shortly. The Statement of Regulation will detail the classification of regulation due to come into effect in the first half of 2011 as either an In, Out or net zero measure. To ensure the analysis underpinning the regulatory measures is accurate, all measures are independently validated by the Regulatory Policy Committee.</p>

	<p pid="c.872W.8/1">Rural economies have a greater reliance on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and this means it is especially important that the administrative burden is proportionate and fair if they are to thrive.</p>
	<p pid="c.872W.8/2">All Ministers in Government are committed to this. Rural businesses will benefit from a number of initiatives I am taking, such as amending the Companies Act to bring small company audit rules in line with the EU minimum in 2012, saving UK companies up to &#163;40 million in unnecessary audit fees.</p>
	<p pid="c.872W.8/3">In addition, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have commissioned research to reduce the regulatory burdens on very small businesses by examining how environmental regulation impacts on micro businesses, including those in rural areas, and how it can be designed in ways that minimises the burden while still achieving environmental outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="c.882W.5/1">Lord Browne's recommendations on a tariff were intended to introduce more competition into the system by allowing institutions with higher demand to expand in response to student choice. While we currently have no plans to introduce a minimum tariff score for entry to higher education, we are interested in exploring whether there could be some categories of students with higher UCAS scores for whom a tariff approach could work. But decisions about admission to university will remain a matter for individual universities, and not for Government. We will set out proposals in the forthcoming White Paper.</p>
