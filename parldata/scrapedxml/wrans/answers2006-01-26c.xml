	<p pid="c.2235W.6/1">As G8 lead nation on counter narcotics in Afghanistan, the UK and the international community are supporting the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) to deliver their National Drug Control Strategy and to bring about a sustainable reduction in the cultivation, production and trafficking of opium. To that end, the UK spent &pound;24,442,350 on counter narcotics activity in Afghanistan in 2004&ndash;05. This included the running of seven training courses on intelligence and investigation techniques for the Afghan Counter Narcotics Police, support for interdiction operations, resulting in major seizures of opiates, the provision of a mobile forensic laboratory and help to establish regional law enforcement offices in seven provincial centres outside Kabul.</p>
	<p pid="c.2235W.6/2">Over the next three financial years, the UK is providing more than &pound;270 million. This is a funding increase, agreed by the Domestic and Overseas Policy Cabinet Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July 2005</phrase>, of &pound;115 million. &pound;130 million of the funding will be provided by the Department for International Development, with the rest coming from other Government Departments, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office. In this three year period, we will focus on the following three key priorities, which we judge will make the greatest impact: targeting the trafficker and the top end of the drugs trade; strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihood opportunities; and developing strong and effective counter narcotics institutions.</p>
	<p pid="c.2235W.6/3">In November 2005, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) confirmed the poppy cultivation figures for 2004&ndash;05 from their annual survey. UNODC reported a 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation from 131,000 hectares (ha) in 2003&ndash;04 (production of 4,200 metric tonnes) to 104,000 ha in 2004&ndash;05 (4,100 metric tonnes). Good weather and an absence of crop disease were responsible for the increased yield. While there remains a risk that cultivation may increase again this year, our goal is to ensure that the downward trend in cultivation is maintained in the long term. We are working hard with the GoA and other international partners to ensure that it is able to deliver on this goal.</p>

The UK led an EU demarche on the Chinese Government on freedom of religion in Beijing on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-29">29 December 2005</phrase>. Individual cases of concern, including Christians, were raised at this meeting and at the Dialogues. We will continue to raise our concerns about religious freedom with the Chinese authorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.2240W.11/1">Iraq sells its oil on the world market and the revenue gained is subject to fluctuations according to the world market price. The dollar average revenue per barrel of oil for 2005 was US$ 46.89. In 2005, Iraqi revenue from oil sales was US$ 23.5 billion. The latest estimate from the Iraq Reconstruction Management Office in Baghdad for the amount of gas flared is 770 million standard cubic feet per day for the south of Iraq and 20 million standard cubic feet per day for the north.</p>

Ibuka, the genocide survivors' umbrella organisation, makes regular representations to the Government of Rwanda. The Rwanda National police is tasked with investigating all allegations of crimes against genocide survivors and witnesses involved in genocide related gacaca trials. We have received no representations in the past 12 months on behalf of prisoners released into the community as part of the gacaca process. Fears among the population about the punishments believed to be meted out by gacaca courts led to around 15,000 Rwandans fleeing to neighbouring countries in the past six months.

	<p pid="c.2244W.0/1">Our embassy in Tel Aviv investigated the detention of Theresa McDermott on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-25">25 December 2005</phrase>. Ms McDermott arrived in Israel for a conference on Celebrating Non Violent Resistance in Bethlehem and was refused entry to Israel because she has been on the black list&quot; since June 2004 due to her participation in a demonstration at Bidu and her alleged connection to the International Solidarity Movement. Ms McDermott appealed the decision but, as the appeal was held after the date of the conference, the appeal therefore became obsolete. She was deported on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-02">2 January 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.2244W.0/2">Ms McDermott has previously tried to enter the Occupied Territories in May 2005 and was refused for the same reasons. In June 2005, Our Deputy Head of Mission wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Ms McDermott's behalf, asking for her to be allowed to enter Israel.</p>

	<p pid="c.2252W.0/1">House prices have been stable for the past year, with prices over 2005 rising by around 3 per cent. The outlook for the near future is for further subdued growth. Stable house prices contribute to a less volatile economy, which has in turn enabled the UK economy to take full advantage of robust global economic growth, with steady domestic growth, low unemployment and low inflation.</p>

Draft legislation to establish Real Estate Investment Trusts was released for consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-14">14 December 2005</phrase>. Updated draft legislation, including clauses relating to groups of companies, will be published tomorrow. Copies will be available in the Libraries of both Houses and on HM Revenue and Customs' website, <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk">www.hmrc.gov.uk</a>. The Government continue to consult extensively with representatives of the property and investment industries.</p>

	<p pid="c.2268W.5/1">The Government note the decision of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and will, of course, follow the guidance it has given. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will now consider the detail of the ruling in order to determine the extent to which it applies to their previous decisions. The amounts claimed as recoverable VAT by the three traders total almost &pound;40 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.2268W.5/2">It is not possible to give a precise figure of the total amount that may be repaid to all traders affected by the decision, as the status of each case is being reviewed in the light of the ECJ's guidance and other action to protect the revenue may be taken.</p>
	<p pid="c.2268W.5/3">The Government remain determined to tackle Missing Trader Intra Community (MTIC) VAT fraud and the criminals perpetrating it. HMRC is intensifying its operational activities throughout the UK and its co-operation with other countries to combat this fraud.</p>
	<p pid="c.2268W.5/4">In order to strengthen further our strategy to combat VAT fraud, the Government have made an application to the European Commission (EC) for a derogation from the provisions of the EC sixth VAT directive to enable it to introduce a reverse charge procedure for transactions between VAT-registered businesses in certain goods. The Government consider this measure to be a proportionate response to MTIC fraud. This is only one facet of a comprehensive strategy designed to thwart MTIC fraud by taking the criminal profit out of the transaction.</p>
	<p pid="c.2268W.5/5">This measure will be targeted on those goods used in MTIC fraud, in particular mobile telephones, computer chips and some other similar electronic items. However, the Government will also be monitoring very closely how those carrying out this fraud react to this measure and will not hesitate to act to prevent any further threats to the tax system.</p>

	<p pid="c.2275W.8/1">A compulsory P-plate scheme was one of the options discussed in the Department's consultation paper, A Structured Approach to Learning to Drive&quot;, published in 2002. The decision letter responding to that consultation, published in August 2004, explained that Ministers had decided against additional regulation of newly-qualified drivers, and no further work has therefore been done on a P-plate scheme. Copies of the consultation paper and the decision letter were placed in the Library of the House and are also available online at&mdash;<a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_control/documents/contentservertemplate/dft_index">http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_control/documents/contentserver template/dft_index</a>.hcst?n=10204&amp;l=2.</p>
	<p pid="c.2275W.8/2">The Department also commissioned research in September 2003 on the likely impact of a trial P-plate scheme, during which free plates would be issued to all those passing the practical driving test. This study found so much resistance to P-plate use within the target population, however, that the trial itself was abandoned. A short report on this project will be published by the Department in due course.</p>

A separate report by London TravelWatch on railway closures in connection with the Thameslink project is expected to be completed around spring 2006. This will also need to be considered by the Secretary of State.

However, the Mayor has indicated that he intends to take forward construction of this further extension in the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.2280W.3/1">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) established a team of specialist antisocial behaviour (ASB) prosecutors in March 2004. They are located in 14 CPS areas, and have led the CPS' contribution to the multi-agency drive to reduce antisocial behaviour. In September 2005, those CPS areas without a specialist ASB prosecutor were required to appoint an ASB co-ordinator to lead on ASB work in their CPS area.</p>
	<p pid="c.2280W.3/2">Antisocial behaviour response courts, which are magistrates courts having a particular focus on dealing effectively with ASB cases in co-operation with local agencies, were established in 12 areas in summer 2004. These locations were chosen so as to dovetail with the appointment of the CPS specialist prosecutors. There are now 157 ASB response courts located within 31 criminal justice areas across England and Wales. Lesson learned from their operation have been circulated to all courts to promote best practice in the handling of ASB cases.</p>

	<p pid="c.2283W.2/1">The Children Act 1989 recognises that, in the majority of cases, it will be in a child's best interests to maintain contact with his or her birth family and includes a duty to promote contact, unless that is not reasonably practicable or consistent with the child's welfare. In such cases, the Act makes provision for contact arrangements to be supervised, restricted or suspended. Exceptionally, contact will be refused from the time the child enters care.</p>
	<p pid="c.2283W.2/2">Consideration of contact is an essential part of the care planning process for looked after children and any arrangements for contact will therefore be kept under ongoing review and monitored in order to identify problems which may arise and changes which may need to be made to the arrangements. Detailed records about contact will form part of each child's case record and will be considered as part of regular formal review meetings, although the review of contact arrangements should not be restricted to such meetings. Following an amendment to the Review of Children's Cases Regulations in 2004, review meetings must, where possible, be chaired by an independent reviewing officer, whose role it is to ensure both that the child's views are understood and taken into account and that reviews are carried out in accordance with the relevant regulations.</p>
	<p pid="c.2283W.2/3">Once an adoption order is made, any existing contact order will be extinguished and the adopters will acquire full parental responsibility for the child. Unless the court makes a new contact order, it will be for the adopters themselves to decide on the nature and extent of the child's contact with his or her birth family. The Government have, however, put in place a new framework for supporting adoptive families, which includes counselling, advice, information and assistance with facilitating appropriate contact arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="c.2284W.3/1">Our current targets in this area run until 2006 and 2008 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.2284W.3/2">In SR 2002 (amended by the SEU report 'A better education for children in care' in 2003) a national PSA target was set to improve life chances for children by:</p>
	<p pid="c.2284W.3/3">Substantially narrowing the gap between the educational attainment and participation of children in care and that of their peers by 2006. This will have been achieved if:</p>
	<p pid="c.2284W.3/4" class="indent">outcomes for 11-year-olds in English and Maths are at least 60 per cent. as good as those of their peers;</p>
	<p pid="c.2284W.3/5" class="indent">the proportion who become disengaged from education is reduced, so that no more than 10 per cent. reach school leaving age without having sat a GCSE equivalent exam; and</p>
	<p pid="c.2284W.3/6" class="indent">the proportion of those aged 16 who get qualifications equivalent to five GCSE's graded A*-C has risen on average by 4 percentage points each year since 2002; and in all authorities at least 15 per cent. of young people in care achieve this level of qualification.</p>
	<p pid="c.2284W.3/7">This target is still extant and will be reported on when the figures for 2006 are made available in May 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.2284W.3/8">In SR 2004 a national PSA target for looked-after children was set as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.2284W.3/9" class="indent">To narrow the gap in educational achievement between looked after children and their peers, and improve their educational support and the stability of their lives, so that by 2008, 80 per cent. of children under 16 who have been looked after for 2.5 or more years will have been living in the same placement for at least two years, or are placed for adoption.</p>
	<p pid="c.2284W.3/10">This is underpinned by a number of indicators to improve absolute performance and narrow the gap between the performance of looked-after children and that of their peers. For education this included the following measures:</p>
	<p pid="c.2284W.3/11" class="indent">percentage of children aged 11, looked after for at least 12 months, who obtain level 4 in key stage 2 English and Maths;</p>
	<p pid="c.2284W.3/12" class="indent">percentage of young people, looked after for at least 12 months, who reach school leaving age without having sat a GCSE equivalent exam;</p>
	<p pid="c.2284W.3/13" class="indent">percentage of young people, looked after for at least 12 months and in year 11, who achieve five or more GCSEs graded A*-C or equivalent;</p>
	<p pid="c.2284W.3/14" class="indent">participation of care leavers aged 19 in education, employment and training.</p>
	<p pid="c.2284W.3/15">Local authorities are still required to set targets against these performance indicators through the school and local authority target setting exercise (SaLTs).</p>

	<p pid="c.2285W.2/1">The IFS report identified a number of issues relating to the employer training pilots. The report has highlighted that we need to do more to attract the harder to reach employers and the subsequent phases of the pilots have shown us better how to do so. That has been one of the many real values of the pilots and their evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="c.2285W.2/2">In some ETP areas around 25 per cent. of eligible employers are now taking part in the pilots&mdash;a far higher penetration rate than the 8 per cent. that IFS estimated carried out similar training without the pilots. We therefore anticipate that a higher proportion will be additional. Skills brokers in the new national programme, Train to Gain, will have a target of at least half the employers they engage being hard to reach&quot;, additional employers. We are making &pound;15 million available in 2005&ndash;06 and &pound;20 million in 2006&ndash;07 to develop the capacity of the brokerage network and implement a performance management system that focuses services on this priority and rewards achievement accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="c.2285W.2/3">A number of evaluations, including the IFS report, have shown that employers identify many benefits from ETP including productivity improvement, changed attitudes to learning, improved motivation and provided employers and employees with a platform for progression. Participating employers were more likely to train their low-skilled staff to the benefit of their business and say that ETP has allowed them to train more people over a shorter period of time. So we are confident that we are already involving more hard-to-reach learners.</p>
	<p pid="c.2285W.2/4">We expect Train to Gain to deliver over 40,000 additional level 2 qualifications in 2006&ndash;07; over 140,000 in 2007&ndash;08 and, by the time the programme reaches full capacity, 175,000 in 2008&ndash;09 and in each year thereafter.</p>

	<p pid="c.2286W.3/2">The Government want to ensure that young carers can gain maximum life chance benefits from educational opportunities. Local authority children's services and adults social services should work with families to ensure that young people are not expected to carry inappropriate levels of caring. We have also advised schools that in a genuine crisis, they can approve absence for a child to care for a relative until other arrangements are made&mdash;the school should set a time limit for the absence and set some school work so that the pupil does not fall far behind while at home. This advice is reflected in the existing guidance on the codes which are used to record absence and attendance in the school register. It is also reflected in Managing Behaviour and Attendance: Groups at Particular Risk&quot;. This guidance has been available since 1999, initially included within the Department's Social Inclusion circulars, and was published again on the Department's school attendance and behaviour website in 2005 as Managing Behaviour and Attendance: Groups at Particular Risk&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.2286W.3/3">The Department has not made any assessment of the proportion of young carers who have school attendance difficulties and does not collect or hold data that would enable it to do so. Census data are based on self-identification by carers' families.</p>
	<p pid="c.2286W.3/4">When a pupil is not attending school regularly, for whatever reason, local authorities are best placed to decide on the most appropriate course of action on a case by case basis. The Government would expect, however, any assessment of school attendance difficulties to take into account the possibility of circumstances such as caring responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.2286W.3/5">One of the options available is the Fast-track to Attendance framework which is a time-focused approach to case management. Its aim is to ensure that schools and local authorities deal with attendance cases quickly and in the most effective way to get the child back into school. The Fast-track framework promotes early intervention both by the school and, when necessary, by the local authority and other agencies. Fast-track is not just about prosecutions or sanctions, rather the approach aims to ensure that appropriate action is taken to identify and tackle attendance problems as soon as they become apparent. Guidance on the 'Fast-track' process was issued to local authorities in 2003. As the guidance relates to a process it does not specifically refer to young carers or any other group.</p>

It is important that this decision is based on the individual assessed needs of each child. To set a target to reduce the number of looked after children could create a perverse incentive that would serve as a barrier to children who may need to become looked after, which would not be in their best interests.</p>

	<p pid="c.2291W.2/4" class="indent">You asked what steps Ofsted is taking to ensure that inspectors who have previously been removed from, and subsequently reinstated to, the list of team inspectors should not be subsequently disadvantaged in the award of future contracts.</p>
	<p pid="c.2291W.2/5" class="indent">In connection with inspections under Section 10 of the School Inspections Act 1996, a person whose name was included on the roll of team inspectors should not have been disadvantaged in seeking and securing inspection work on the basis that they had previously been removed from, and then reinstated to, the roll. Inclusion on the roll signified that a team inspector satisfied the conditions of his or her enrolment: that he or she was fit and proper, and competent and effective, to discharge the functions of a team inspector. However, the roll of team inspectors was discontinued in September 2005 following the implementation of the Education Act 2005 and the introduction of the new Section 5 inspection arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.2291W.2/6" class="indent">Under the Education Act 2005, Ofsted has secured the provision of inspection services for the inspections of schools covered by Section 5 of that Act, by contract with six Regional Inspection Service Providers (RISPs). The RISPs are responsible for the recruitment, selection, training and deployment of inspectors, and the standards of competence required of the inspectors are specified; inspectors must be fit and proper, and competent and effective. Further details on the competencies of inspectors are available at:</p>
	<p pid="c.2291W.2/7" class="indent"><a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/publications/index.cfm?fuseaction=pubs">http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/publications/index.cfm? fuseaction=pubs</a>.summary&amp;id=1438</p>
	<p pid="c.2291W.2/8" class="indent">It is for the RISPs to satisfy themselves that inspectors meet these competences and they may only carry out Section 5 inspections once they have inspected satisfactorily under the supervision of HMI. The RISPs have different recruitment and selection processes but all include checking whether inspectors were previously Section 10 inspectors. Where an inspector had previously been de-registered or removed from the roll, the RISP would have to look at the individual's circumstances. However, we have no reason to believe that inspectors would be disadvantaged in seeking and securing inspection work simply on the basis that they were previously removed from, and reinstated to, the Section 10 roll of team inspectors. Finally, I should inform you that, although there is no longer a roll of team inspectors, HMCI is required, under the Education Act 2005, to publish at intervals of not more than 12 months the names of those persons who are notified to him by a RISP as persons with whom the RISP proposes to make arrangements for carrying out of inspections on behalf of HMCI. The list of these persons, known as additional inspectors, was published on the Ofsted website on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-07">07 December 2005</phrase> and can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="c.2293W.0/1">Thanks to the &pound;155 million play programme announced by the Big Lottery Fund in March 2005, a huge number of existing play facilities across England will be improved and new ones created. 80 per cent. of the fund will be used to develop free, open-access play provision in the areas of greatest need. Allocations will be made to local authorities based on child population weighted by the level of deprivation in each area but also taking into account where relatively affluent areas have pockets of deprivation (for example, rural areas).</p>
	<p pid="c.2293W.0/2">For the older child, we have outlined new national standards for 'things to do and places to go' for young people. The standards include ensuring access to 'a range of safe and enjoyable places in which to spend time'. We intend to introduce new legislation that will clarify local authorities' responsibilities to secure access to such provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.2293W.0/3">The Youth Matters Green Paper also outlined plans to put resources directly into the hands of young people so that they have more say over the way that resources are spent. Extra resources made available through the pre-Budget report mean that a total of &pound;115 million will be available in the two financial years from April 2006 to support the provision of youth activities in communities, including the development of the Youth Opportunity and Youth Capital funds which will particularly help to support access for young people from vulnerable families.</p>
	<p pid="c.2293W.0/4">We have also committed &pound;840 million to help develop extended services, including holiday play schemes, so that they are accessible through all our schools by 2010. These funds have also been distributed with a weighting for levels of deprivation. The National Remodelling Team within the Training and Development Agency has been appointed to provide support to all schools to help develop extended services.</p>

	<p pid="c.2293W.3/1">Under the Education Act 1996 local authorities have a duty, where necessary, to assess the special educational needs of children for whom they are responsible. If, during the course of the assessment, a child transfers to a school in another local authority's area but remains resident in the original authority's area then the original authority remains responsible for completing the assessment. If the child moves to the area of the school which he or she is transferring to or any area other than that of the original authority, the original authority is no longer responsible for the child or completing the assessment. If the new authority to which the child moves deems that it is necessary to assess the child's special educational needs then the new authority is under a duty to do so. In such circumstances we would expect the two authorities concerned to contact each other and, within any legal constraints, transfer information from the assessment begun by the original authority to inform the assessment by the new authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.2294W.2/2">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State and I have regular discussions with representatives from the higher education sector about a range of student finance issues, including the access to learning fund. The fund is designed to ensure that support is available to students from low-income backgrounds who might otherwise be unable to enter or remain in higher education. Higher education institutions, who administer the fund, have a high degree of discretion as to how to provide support, in order to target those most in need.</p>
	<p pid="c.2294W.2/3">Last October, as part of our continuing commitment to part-time study, we announced an enhanced support package for part-time undergraduates from 2006/07, including an increase in the discretionary funds available to part-time students from &pound;3 million to &pound;12 million. Institutions will have the added flexibility to use this resource to provide additional fee support (on top of the statutory part-time grant) or to increase help to students facing financial hardship, for example, in meeting child care costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.2294W.2/4">We also announced, in November, an additional &pound;40 million (&pound;20 million each from the Department and the Higher Education Funding Council for England) of institutional funding for 2006&ndash;07 to encourage participation and improve provision for part-time students from the most under-represented groups.</p>

	<p pid="c.2294W.5/1">We recognise that a minority of teenage pregnancies are planned. However, around half of under-18 conceptions end in abortion and the 1999 Social Exclusion Unit report on Teenage Pregnancy estimated that around 75 per cent. of teenage conceptions were unplanned.</p>
	<p pid="c.2294W.5/2">While recognising that decisions about the outcome of pregnancy are for individuals to make, the aim of the Government's Teenage Pregnancy Strategy is to reduce unplanned pregnancies while encouraging young people to delay parenthood. Health and education outcomes for young mothers and their children are likely to be significantly worse than for older mothers.</p>

	<p pid="c.2297W.2/1">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport's sectors contain many iconic and high profile buildings, which are used by large numbers of the public. Some have introduced innovative projects demonstrating sustainable development, such as the installation of photovoltaic panels in the roof of the Science Museum in South Kensington. These now power the Museum's Energy Gallery. The DCMS Sustainable Development Forum draws membership from DCMS's non departmental public bodies who share these innovative ideas and other examples of best practice. My officials also provide the secretariat for the Museums and Galleries Energy and Carbon Forum, a body which seeks to implement energy saving and the reduction of carbon emissions in national museums, galleries and libraries. Sustainable development considerations are being fully included in the current refurbishment of DCMS Headquarters building. The Department's Headquarters building and The Royal Parks are both powered entirely by renewable sources.</p>

The costs and timing of providing the necessary water and sewerage infrastructure and services will be a part of the study.</p>

It is not possible in all cases to determine whether those who engaged our troops were Iraqis or foreign insurgents. Nor is it always possible to determine whether those incidents represented planned attacks on the Coalition, or chance encounters with those engaged in criminal behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="c.2306W.5/2">In MND(SE), British troops are authorised to open fire only when they judge that doing so is the only way in which they can avert a threat to life. It follows that in the vast majority of incidents, British troops will only have opened fire when fired upon, or when clear hostile intent had been demonstrated towards them.</p>

All QinetiQ employees were given the chance to buy shares in the company at the time of the Public Private Partnership between the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the Carlyle Group, and around 2,000 chose to do so. The investment amount was not restricted and provided for employees to invest through a Co-investment share scheme on the same terms as the MOD and the Carlyle Group. All employees were also issued free share options worth a nominal value of &pound;40 on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-25">25 July 2003</phrase>.

For example, in October 2005 the UK contributed a Nimrod Maritime Patrol Aircraft on a short term basis to Operation NEPTUNE IV, a Greek-Italian operation to organise and perform counter illegal immigration operations in pre-defined sea areas and ports in the Mediterranean.</p>

	<p pid="c.2310W.5/1">United States visiting force military assets stationed in the United Kingdom are potentially available, as necessary, in support of NATO missions. Any actual deployment will be undertaken on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.2310W.5/2">The US visiting force makes a significant contribution to the local economies, where they have a large presence, largely through the direct hire of labour and the award of contracts on, for example, construction projects as well as more routine servicing and maintenance works. It is difficult to gauge a precise figure in monetary terms although one study by the US Air Force Europe suggests that the overall benefit to the UK economy in 2004 was in the region of $1 billion.</p>

As part of the normal negotiating process officials had a series of meetings with trade union representatives on the 2005 pay round dating back to July of last year. In addition, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland met personally with the Trade Union on two occasions in an attempt to reach agreement with them on the 2005 pay deal. During the course of the negotiations a number of information bulletins were issued to staff, continually up-dating them on the negotiations and providing them with details of the 3.49 per cent. pay offer made by management. This offer represented the maximum available to the Northern Ireland Civil Service under the terms of the Government's pay policy. Officials made it clear that they were prepared to negotiate the content of the offer in order better to meet Trade Union concerns, subject to remaining within the 3.49 per cent. envelope approved.</p>
	<p pid="c.2315W.2/2">Under the terms of the offer the majority of staff this year will see their pay increase by between 2.2 per cent. and 6.5 per cent. depending on their position on their pay scale. It took cognisance of the fact that inflation was 2.3 per cent. at July 2005 (the settlement date was <phrase class="date" code="">1 August</phrase>) while private sector earnings growth was less than 3 per cent. In this wider context I firmly believe that the 2005 pay deal is fair and reasonable and represents the best that could have been achieved for staff in the prevailing economic circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.2315W.2/3">There was no additional money available for this year's pay round and as a result there was nothing to be gained in further delaying payment of the pay offer to staff. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State therefore wrote to all staff on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-20">20 December 2005</phrase> indicating that the deal would be paid as soon as possible. This was the fairest course of action in all the circumstances. Naturally it would have been preferable if agreement could have been reached with the Trade Union not just on this year's pay deal but on how best to address next year's pay remit. In that context My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has invited the Trade Union to work with officials in developing the strongest possible business case in support of the 2006 pay remit. I hope that that invitation will be accepted and that we can work constructively together to secure the best possible deal for staff in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.2315W.2/4">I hope that the staff will form a judgment based on the facts, and that a strike can thus be avoided. In the meantime however, Departments have been asked to draw up appropriate contingency plans to be put in train in the event of an all out strike. All appropriate measures will of course be taken to minimise the impact of any strike action on our public services.</p>

	<p pid="c.2317W.0/1">The Northern Ireland Office has a specific public service agreement to reduce the incidence of domestic burglary in Northern Ireland by 15 per cent. by March 2007 and to reduce vehicle crime by 10 per cent. in the same timescale. The reduction is measured against the recorded crime figures for the year 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid="c.2317W.0/2">At <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, the level of domestic burglary against the 2001&ndash;02 recorded crime figures had reduced by 19.5 per cent. and the level of vehicle crime by 37 per cent. Further reductions have been noted in the crime figures for the first nine months of the 2005&ndash;06 year against both categories of crime. We are therefore well on course to meet these targets but will continue to closely monitor progress and take appropriate action where necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.2317W.0/3">While there is no specific target to reduce the fear of crime, we consider reducing fear of crime to be a key part of our target to improve confidence in the CJSNI. It is crucial that the people of Northern Ireland feel safe in their homes and in going about their daily lives. The criminal justice organisations, working together through the Criminal Justice Board, are committed to improving public awareness and understanding of the justice system, and therefore help reduce fear of crime. A number of these initiatives include: a one-stop CJSNI website, a criminal justice module in the citizenship curriculum for key stage 4, and a series of criminal justice roadshows planned for spring and summer of this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.2317W.0/4">All criminal justice agencies are working towards reducing crime and the fear of crime. The police are, for example, on course to meet their target in the Policing Plan around the number of police that are available for frontline duties by 2007&ndash;08. The Northern Ireland Community Safety strategy outlines further measures to be taken forward to tackle fear of crime among older people, vulnerable adults and children. A number of successful projects have or are being implemented, including the extension of the Bee Safe project for primary school children, supporting Get Home Safe&quot; projects across Northern Ireland and providing information to older people about bogus callers in addition to improving home security through the Lock Out Crime scheme.</p>

	<p pid="c.2320W.5/1">Reducing the number of delayed discharges is a key priority for the Government. We have set a target to reduce the number of delayed discharges in 2005&ndash;06 by 15 per cent. Action is being taken to streamline processes within hospitals to ensure that people remain as patients no longer than is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.2320W.5/2">HPSS bodies have drawn up detailed plans to address delayed discharge, a key feature of which is the expansion of intermediate care services designed to prevent unnecessary admissions and facilitate prompt discharge. These developments are part of wider reform and modernisation across the HPSS, which aims to reduce reliance on hospitals by expanding community-based services so that people can have access to efficient and high quality services in the most appropriate setting.</p>

(obtained through NICS 2003&ndash;04 and the April 2004 Northern Ireland Omnibus Survey).

To address this I recently announced a total redesign of the whole outpatient system and by March 2008 no patient will be waiting more than 13 weeks for an outpatient appointment following referral by his or her GP.</p>
	<p pid="c.2326W.3/2">In the meantime, partial booking systems are already being implemented in all outpatient specialties to ensure that patients are given a choice of available appointment times and that no appointments are booked any more than six weeks in advance.

	<p pid="c.2326W.6/1">An additional &pound;9 million has been provided over the last four years for specialist drug therapies, including disease modifying therapies for people with multiple sclerosis. A further &pound;100,000 was made available from 2002&ndash;03 specifically to support the infrastructure for the provision of disease modifying therapies for MS.

	<p pid="c.2326W.6/3">The Department remains committed to improving access to specialist drugs which offer the potential for significant improvements in patient care. Last November I indicated my intention to allocate an additional &pound;9 million recurrently for hospital and specialist drugs in 2006&ndash;07, with a further &pound;5 million in 2007&ndash;08. I will be making a further announcement about specialist drugs shortly.</p>

The restructuring of the Task Force last year will further improve operational co-operation and strengthen the analytical focus on which this work is based.</p>
	<p pid="c.2328W.2/2">The 2005 OCTF annual report has made clear that the overall levels of organised criminal activity remain high and criminal gangs are increasingly sophisticated and ruthless in the way they undertake their activities.

	<p pid="c.2329W.5/2">A significant policy decision taken has been to bring a more integrated approach to economic development through amalgamating the Industrial Development Board, Local Enterprise Development Unit and the Industrial Research and Technology Unit into one single agency, Invest Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="c.2329W.5/3">The Economic Vision for Northern Ireland recognises that the private sector must grow if Northern Ireland is to improve its economic performance. Investing in innovation, enterprise, skills and infrastructure will facilitate private sector growth in the Northern Ireland economy while policies such as national minimum wage, tax credits and new deal will ensure that work pays.</p>
	<p pid="c.2329W.5/4">Since 1997, the number of private sector jobs in Northern Ireland has increased by 16.5 per cent. to 472,944 compared to an 11.6 per cent. increase in public sector jobs which at September 2005 stood at 217,805 jobs.</p>

Capacity planning is the responsibility of strategic health authorities (SHAs) in conjunction with their primary care trusts; NHS trusts; and other relevant stakeholders in their local health economies. SHA level capacity plans are taken forward through the Department's local delivery planning process.</p>
	<p pid="c.2334W.2/3">The Department's access directorate undertook an assessment of the Barts and the London NHS Trust private finance initiative scheme in October 2005. The assessment found that the bull business case for the scheme took into account the expected impact of the key elements of the capacity planning agenda and was broadly consistent with national assumptions and projected local capacity requirements. To supplement this work, the Secretary of State has asked the SHA to commission an independent review to ensure we have the right balance of cancer and cardiac services in North East London.</p>

	<p pid="c.2334W.5/3">Training in endoscopy (bowel scoping) is vital to the diagnosis of bowel cancer. To prepare for the bowel cancer screening programme, we have built on the training established as part of the NHS Cancer Plan. A national training programme has been established, with three national and seven regional centres, to train medical staff, general practitioners, nurses and other health professionals to carry out vital procedures for diagnosing bowel cancer. By increasing the pool of staff able to undertake endoscopy and colonoscopy procedures, waiting times will be reduced and services made more convenient.</p>
	<p pid="c.2334W.5/4">Based on current trends and definitions the training programme is projected to deliver 217 newly trained non-medical endoscopists and 1,353 medical endoscopists by 2006&ndash;07.</p>

This guidance is aimed at helping those involved in planning, commissioning, organising and providing bowel cancer services to ensure that services are configured to ensure appropriate high quality services. Implementation of NICE guidance is a developmental standard as set out in National Standards Local Action (July 2004). The Healthcare Commission is responsible for assessing progress of healthcare organisations towards achieving developmental standards.</p>

	<p pid="c.2337W.2/2">As part of their statutory duties, primary care trusts (PCTs) should ensure arrangements are in place for the provision of primary care services in the event of influenza pandemic. Local capacity planning should include arrangements with all primary medical care contractors including general medical services, personal medical services, PCT-led medical services and alternative provider medical services. In order to meet the likely volume of work during a pandemic, PCTs should discuss with their general practitionerss the non-essential work that can be put on hold. Specific arrangements will also be needed with their out of hours providers.</p>

Local national health service bodies are expected to implement standard one in their localities.</p>

	<p pid="c.2342W.2/2">The Government recognises the significant achievements of female entrepreneurs to the UK economy. Female entrepreneurs and female-owned businesses make a significant contribution to UK economy adding up &pound;70billion to gross value added.</p>
	<p pid="c.2342W.2/3">That's why the Government views the development of women's enterprise in the UK as an economic imperative. The Government are continuing the development of the economic argument for Women's Enterprise following the publication, in March 2005, of the booklet, Promoting Female Entrepreneurship&quot;, which captures headline facts and has been used to stimulate thinking across Government and the regional development agencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.2342W.2/4">There are encouraging signs that entrepreneurial activity amongst women is increasing. Nearly one million women are self employed in the UK and this number has increased by around 10 per cent. over the last four years. 19 per cent. of UK businesses are now majority-owned by women.</p>
	<p pid="c.2342W.2/5">Women are seizing the opportunities to turn their good ideas into great businesses. Women such as Manjit Sahota whose business, the Rocking Horse Kindergarten based in the Holbrooks area of Coventry, provides a supportive and stimulating learning environment for pre-school children. This business provides employment for fourteen members of staff. That's good news for the local and national economy.</p>

	<p pid="c.2343W.6/2">The General Dental Council's (GDC) decision on <phrase class="date" code="">7 December</phrase> signalled an important first step in removing unnecessary restrictions on the business of dentistry. Under recently conferred powers, the GDC has agreed that appropriately qualified clinical dental technicians, who are also known as denturists and whose practice is currently prohibited by law, should be allowed to see edentulous patients, without prior review by a dentist, for the purpose of supplying and maintaining complete dentures.</p>
	<p pid="c.2343W.6/3">There will also be wider scope for treatments by other dental care professionals such as dental hygienists and dental therapists. The GDC has agreed that a dentist should carry out a full mouth assessment and provide a treatment plan, which specifies the intervals at which the patient should attend for further examination or treatment. Pending the re-assessment, the patient could take the treatment plan to any appropriately registered dental professional who could, within the overall limits of the plan and the limits of his or her competence, treat the patient.</p>
	<p pid="c.2343W.6/4">The GDC has made it clear that it would welcome proposals to expand the curricula of dental care professionals to enable increased direct access by patients to dental care professionals, where there is robust training to ensure that patient safety is protected.</p>
	<p pid="c.2343W.6/5">The Department shares the GDC's view that this represents the right balance between improving flexibility and patient choice and protecting patients.</p>

However, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that there are currently 180 trillion cubic metres of proven gas reserves. At current production rates, the IEA estimates that these would last for 66 years; based on its expectation that production rates will increase at 2.3 per cent. per year, these reserves could then last some 40 years (source&mdash;World Energy Outlook 2004&quot;, <a href="http://www.iea.org">www.iea.org</a>.</p>

By 2010, under current plans, the Belgium-UK Interconnector will have a total import capacity of 66 million cubic metres per day (mcm/d); the new Balgzand-Bacton pipeline (BBL) from the Netherlands of 44mcm/d; and the Langeled pipeline from Norway of up to 70mcm/d.

In addition to the projects listed in the report, new liquefied natural has (LNG) projects at Canvey Island and Teesside have recently been announced.

For workers on plantations and in processing factories, their employers must pay decent wages, guarantee them the right to join a trade union, and provide good housing, where relevant. Minimum health and safety as well as environmental standards must be complied with, and no child or forced labour can occur.</p>
	<p pid="c.2346W.5/2">The price paid to producers is not determined as a percentage of profit, but Fairtrade criteria establish a minimum guaranteed price that covers the cost of production and ensures a living wage for growers. In addition to the purchase price paid by importers, a separate payment is designated for social and economic development in the producing communities. The farmers and growers themselves decide how these funds are to be spent, while being encouraged to invest in further sustainable development.</p>

	<p pid="c.2347W.2/1">The Government believe that the most effective way to develop fair and ethical trade labelling schemes is to ensure that they are voluntary and business led as they are likely to be more flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances. Government should provide an enabling rather than a prescriptive framework. There are already a number of successful voluntary labelling initiatives, which have been those developed by business, sometimes in partnership with civil society. For example, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) label, put together in partnership with NGOs and full industry backing, fills a communication gap and delivers environmental improvements.</p>

	<p pid="c.2350W.6/1">The Government have reviewed with industry the performance of the telecommunications sector and provision of services on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase>. This shows that there was no failure of the mobile networks but the level of demand was significantly greater than usual and exceeded the extra margin of capacity&mdash;about 20 percent. above the average daily peak&mdash;that is built into the networks for unseen demand. Consequently, service was either restricted or not available for some customers at periods during the day. The congestion was managed by the operators through the application of network calming measures such as call gapping&quot;, which restricted access from the fixed networks onto the mobile networks&mdash;but does not affect 999 services&mdash;and by squeezing more calls within the available capacity by reducing the quality of voice calls. Restricting customers to text messages only at such times to ease congestion, as has been suggested, is not possible because voice and text services use separately allocated network channels that are not interchangeable.</p>
	<p pid="c.2350W.6/2">The measures taken by the operators, together with their advice to customers to keep calls short, succeeded in ensuring there was no collapse of the networks. This enabled a swift return to normal services when the congestion eased.</p>

	<p pid="c.2352W.3/1">SITPRO, UK Trade and Investment and the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) have distinct roles. SITPRO is the world's leading trade facilitation agency and its expertise lies in the simplification of documents and procedures, e.g. customs, for clearing goods at the border. UKTI's role is to support UK businesses undertaking international trade and in attracting inward investment to the UK. The RDAs work closely with UKTI on both inward investment and trade development activity at regional level. UKTI promotes the whole of the UK as a location for inward investment, working in partnership with the English RDAs and the Development Agencies (DAs) of the Devolved Administrations. In addition to working with UKTI to attract, retain and add value to inward investment, staff in all these agencies have actively participated in the Committee on Overseas Promotion (COP), which brings together inward investment practitioners from throughout the UK to discuss strategic and operational issues, as well as share best practice. In addition to the regular meetings of COP and its sub-groups, there is regular contact with the RDAs and DAs on a daily basis concerning individual investor inquiries.</p>
	<p pid="c.2352W.3/2">SITPRO complements the international trade work of UKTI by providing technical advice to traders on customs formalities. It also influences customs and other border agency policy and regulation with a view to making trade procedures simpler. SITPRO and UKTI meet at least three times a year. UKTI is the largest source of inquiries referred to SITPRO's helpdesk, reflecting the close co-ordination they have on policy and operational issues affecting the UK international trading community and demonstrating full awareness of the unique way the two organisations work together.</p>

	<p pid="c.2353W.2/1">The UK's small business research initiative (SBRI) was modelled on the US Government's small business innovation research (SBIR) programme, which remains the most relevant international benchmark for SBRI.</p>

	<p pid="c.2363W.2/1">There is no research which directly answers this question. However, there is a body of research evidence which shows that having parents who have been convicted is strongly predictive of their sons being convicted or cautioned (Maguire et al, 1997; Dodd and Hunter, 1992).</p>
	<p pid="c.2363W.2/2">The National Reducing Re-offending Action Plan, published on July 19, 2004, committed the Government to developing a cross-government approach to providing information, advice and support for offenders' children and families. &pound;2.04 million has been secured by the Home Office from the Invest to Save Budget to pilot a regional approach over three years which will evidence a model for engagement and inform national roll-out in partnership with the Voluntary and Community Sector, DfES, DWP, the Learning and Skills Council and the Legal Services Commission. The Home Office works closely with a wide range of organisations, including the DfES, on preventing young people who are at risk as a result of a number of factors, including family circumstances, from involvement in offending and a range of negative outcomes. For example, the Youth Justice Board and Youth Offending Teams provide a number of targeted services for children and young people at high risk of offending. In addition, the Government's Every Child Matters reforms are an essential part of this work as they shift the focus of children's services towards early intervention and prevention. The DfES are supporting five organisations providing adult relationship and parenting skills support to prisoners' families.</p>

	<p pid="c.2363W.5/2">Local pay additions are currently paid to staff at 28 sites to address local recruitment and retention difficulties. In October 2005, the Prison Service proposed to extend the scheme to five new sites, in its submission to the Prison Service Pay Review Body (PSRB). The PSRB is due to make its recommendations in February.</p>

	<p pid="c.2364W.0/1">Calculation of age-related average reading scores is only feasible for children up to about the age of 16, and adults have neither individual reading ages nor average ones for separate age groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.2364W.0/2">However, a few studies have been conducted expressly on this topic. In 2005, the Home Office published findings based on a longitudinal evaluation of basic skills training for prisoners which indicated that the only significant predictor to improved literacy and numeracy was the amount of training received (over 30 hours). This can be found at: <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/r260.pdf">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/r260.pdf</a>percent5D The Home Office has also developed a new longitudinal study of prisoners that aims to explore how interventions, including education and employment programmes, might work in combination to address the range of prisoners' needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.2364W.0/3">The study, Surveying Prisoner Crime Reduction (SPCR), began in late 2005 and is of four years duration. It should greatly improve our knowledge about the nature of prisoners problems and needs on reception, how prison interventions are targeted, the extent of association between participation in interventions and post-release outcomes, as well as which prisoners benefit the most from interventions.</p>

	<p pid="c.2365W.2/1">In purely financial terms, over &pound;60 million is available as part of the PS Plus two programme, and an additional &pound;14 million a year through the Prison Service Custody to Work Scheme. The Voluntary and Community Sector is also an important provider of these services and a leading partner in several large European Union funded programmes, such as Women into Work (SOVA) and PRISE (Rainer).</p>
	<p pid="c.2365W.2/2">There is also a significant amount of time invested in preparing prisoners for release by staff from both the Prison and Probation services, from other Government departments and by voluntary and private sector partners. Significant progress has been made in both areas: nearly all prisons now have housing advice workers drawn from a wide range of providers and Jobcentre Plus surgeries to provide job advice. In 2004&ndash;05 the proportion of recorded offenders released from prison without accommodation to go to fell by one third; and over 41,000 had an education, job or training place to go to on release.</p>

An improved quality assurance system is now in place, which adheres to the Adult Learning Inspectorate common inspection framework.</p>

	<p pid="c.2373W.8/1">During the last three years, the public sector Prison Service has introduced a new and robust framework for managing absence caused by ill health. Provisional figures for 2005 show average absence rates in the public sector Prison Service (including absence caused as a result of accidents and assaults at work) at 12.5 days per staff member. This represents a fall of up to 21 per cent. since 1999 and a fall of 15 per cent. since the introduction of a new policy framework in 2002&ndash;03. Absence rates for the financial year 2005&ndash;06 are expected to show a further fall.</p>

	<p pid="c.2374W.0/1">Ministers receive regular analysis of the performance of the learning and skills arrangements in prisons through the Home Office's standard reporting arrangements. The development of new arrangements for delivering learning and skills to offenders, planned and funded by the Learning and Skills Council, has involved a wide range of stake holding partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.2374W.0/2">A national Project Board includes very senior Prison Service representatives, and each region has set up a separate Regional Partnership Board to drive forward arrangements there. The Regional Partnership Boards include Prison Service Area Managers, Governors and Heads of Learning and Skills. At each stage, therefore, the views of Prison Service Managers&mdash;and Regional Offender Managers&mdash;have been influential in determining the strategic way forward in developing the new service as it affects prisons.</p>
	<p pid="c.2374W.0/3">In addition, officials from the Offenders' Learning and Skills Unit have taken account of contractors' views, for example through running a consultation workshop at the most recent Association of Colleges conference and arranging other stakeholder events at which contractors have been present as part of the preparatory activity towards publication of the Green Paper 'Reducing Re-Offending Through Skills and Employment'.</p>

	<p pid="c.2375W.2/1">The home detention curfew scheme was introduced in January 1999. Over 120,000 prisoners have been released on HDC since then. Before release on HDC is granted, Probation Service staff are involved in assessing the suitability of the offender and the proposed release address.</p>
	<p pid="c.2375W.2/2">There is no special allocation of funding for this work. However in 1999, the year in which HDC began, funding for the Probation Service increased by 6 per cent. All offenders serving sentences of 12 months to four years, and young adult offenders aged under 22 years of age serving less than 12 months, are released subject to probation supervision. Changes in the way HDC has been applied have caused short term increases in the number of offenders released but they have not had any long-term impact on supervision resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.2375W.2/3">The Probation Service piloted the Intensive Change and Control programme (ICCP) for young adult offenders in 17 areas from 2003. Additional funds were provided to the pilot areas in 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05. From April 2005 the Criminal Justice Act 2003 has enabled orders to be made that contain several requirements. These new intensive orders are gradually replacing ICCP.</p>
	<p pid="c.2375W.2/4">Funding to probation boards reflects the increase in workload stemming from the Criminal Justice Act. Funding increased by &pound;54 million in 2005&ndash;06 (to &pound;759 million) and is planned to increase further in 2006&ndash;07.</p>

	<p pid="c.2376W.2/1">No dedicated projects currently receive support from this Department. In 2000 the Home Office awarded &pound;850,000 from the crime reduction programme to 11 multi-agency projects to assess what works in tackling prostitution.</p>
	<p pid="c.2376W.2/2">The evaluation of these projects was published in the Home Office research study report Tackling Street Prostitution: Towards an Holistic Approach&quot; and these findings will form the basis of commissioning guidance for dedicated support projects to be developed for local partnerships as part of the implementation of the recently published prostitution strategy. Government funding is already available, for example to fund drug and alcohol treatment services, to support essential elements of the work of these projects in developing routes out of prostitution.</p>

	<p pid="c.2378W.2/1">The Probation Service assesses offenders using the Offender Assessment System (OASys). There are two main elements within OASys, an assessment of the risk of serious harm posed by an offender and an assessment of the likelihood of reconviction.</p>
	<p pid="c.2378W.2/2">Risk of serious harm to the public or to particular groups of people is assessed as low, medium, high or very high. The assessment involves two variables: the likelihood of an event occurring and the potential impact of that event. Serious harm is defined as life threatening and/or traumatic from which recovery (psychological as well as physical) can be expected to be difficult or impossible.</p>
	<p pid="c.2378W.2/3">An offender's likelihood of reconviction is expressed as a numerical score that is split into three bands: low, medium and high. This assessment is based on such factors as the offender's criminal history and whether for example he or she is a drug misuser, abuses alcohol or anti-social attitudes. The two elements of assessment come together in the allocation of offenders to a four level 'tiering' structure through which all offenders under Probation Service supervision are managed.</p>
	<p pid="c.2378W.2/4">Those offenders who require the least probation input will be in Tier One, while those requiring the most will be in Tier Four. Tier Four includes those offenders released on licence who are assessed as posing a high or very high risk of serious harm and where it is likely that more than one agency should be involved in their risk management under the Multi- Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA).</p>
	<p pid="c.2378W.2/5">The MAPPA provide the framework to co-ordinate and strengthen the risk management activity of all the relevant agencies involved. High and very high risk of serious harm offenders are managed in the community at MAPPA Levels Two or Three, dependant on the nature and imminence of their risk and the level of resource, or senior management involvement, needed from the relevant agencies.</p>

	<p pid="c.2380W.3/1">In 2005 my Department made an assessment of the additional support that might be helpful to vulnerable victims and witnesses, including those with communication difficulties, in the criminal justice process. An interdepartmental examination of early advice provision is also examining ways in which access to independent early legal advice can be improved for vulnerable groups. In addition my Department is testing the use of television as a means of delivering education and information for potential users of the Justice System, with a particular focus on vulnerable and socially excluded witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="c.2380W.3/2">Her Majesty's Courts Service's victims and witnesses strategy aims to improve the court experience of victims and witnesses, including vulnerable ones. Examples of help given to vulnerable witnesses are: instructions to court ushers to offer witnesses the option of repeating the oath after the usher rather than reading it, thus assisting those with literacy problems; videolink facilities to enable housebound witnesses to give evidence from home and children to give evidence separate from the parties and in a less intimidating environment; and providing an interpreter automatically when a party has a hearing impediment and for those whose first language is not English in cases of committal, domestic violence and where children are involved, and in other cases if this is the only way in which a party can give evidence.</p>
	<p pid="c.2380W.3/3">The Legal Service Commission, through the Community Legal Services Strategy, is looking at ways of targeting expenditure more on those who need it most, particularly the socially excluded. Community Legal Services Direct provides free legal advice and information which is available in different languages and formats and is particularly useful to people who may have problems accessing traditional services. People with literacy problems can call a national telephone service to find information about their nearest solicitor, obtain information leaflets in audio formats, and access a website that is speech-enabled.</p>

The public authority is not required to comply with requests whose cost exceeds that limit. The Act also enables the Secretary of State to make regulations for public authorities to charge for requests that costs less than the appropriate limit. Under the Freedom of Information and Data Protection (Appropriate Limit and Fees) Regulations 2004 the appropriate limit was set at &pound;600 for requests to central Government and &pound;450 for requests to public authorities outside central Government. Public authorities could only charge for the cost of disbursements (such as photocopying and postage) if the cost of complying with the request was less than the upper limit.</p>
	<p pid="c.2382W.3/2">DCA has no plans at present to revise either the appropriate limits or to change the fees that may be charged under those limits. As with any new regulations, however, provision was made for a review of fees and a ministerial commitment was given at the time of the passage of the regulations through Parliament that this should take place after the Act came into force. No timetable for any review has yet been agreed. There have also been no decisions taken on the scope of any review.</p>

	<p pid="c.2385W.2/1">The Permanent Secretary is responsible for the effective leadership and management of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's 2,000 staff and for the Government office network. As part of its work, the Permanent Secretary's management board commissions surveys to ascertain the views of staff on their working environment attitudes to their work in the Department, and the leadership provided by the senior civil service in the Office.</p>
	<p pid="c.2385W.2/2">Peter Housden was appointed as Permanent Secretary of the ODPM in October 2005 and gave evidence to the Select Committee for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in November in which he described the purpose of the surveys. In its recent report the Committee welcomed ODPM's commitment to consulting its personnel on their experience of work and congratulated it on its success in encouraging participation in the staff survey undertaken in May 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.2385W.2/3">The Permanent Secretary has subsequently said:</p>
	<p pid="c.2385W.2/4" class="indent">It is clear that the Office has achieved a huge amount since it was created in 2002. But we are not complacent. We have taken very seriously the views expressed in our stakeholder and staff surveys and put in place robust measures to address these concerns. We can demonstrate considerable strides forward over the past four years, but we all recognise we have more to do.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.2385W.2/5">Responses to the 2005 survey showed that 65 per cent. of staff were satisfied overall with their experience of working in ODPM. This is in line with experience across Government. In responses to the statement</p>
	<p pid="c.2385W.2/6" class="indent">I believe that this company/organisation is an equal opportunities employer,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.2385W.2/7">ODPM is in the second quartile of central Government organisations (and slightly above the central Government benchmark) according to the company that undertook the survey. In response to the statement</p>
	<p pid="c.2385W.2/8" class="indent">I am treated with fairness and respect in this organisation,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.2385W.2/9">ODPM is close to the top quartile of central Government organisations, also slightly above the central Government benchmark.</p>
	<p pid="c.2385W.2/10">In relation to bullying, responses in ODPM were in line with experience elsewhere in Government and in the second quartile of central Government organisations. Nonetheless the Permanent Secretary and Board take the issue extremely seriously and have instituted a wide range of activity to address the issues directly. The Permanent Secretary has confirmed:</p>
	<p pid="c.2385W.2/11" class="indent">The ODPM does not tolerate bullying or discrimination. A programme of skills and awareness training is being put in place for all senior and middle managers, to ensure the organisation creates a positive climate for all staff and has the right procedures in place to deal with cases where staff are not treated with dignity and respect.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.2387W.11/1">Evidence from the Census shows that between 1991 and 2001 net out-migration from the English core cities (Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield) declined dramatically and Birmingham, Bristol and Leeds all gained rather than lost population. In all cases, the population of city centres has risen as people have started to move back in response to the urban renaissance and new housing and job opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="c.2387W.11/2">Preliminary findings from the state of the cities report show that many smaller towns and cities in England, particularly in the south and east, gained population over this period largely as a result of in-migration.</p>
	<p pid="c.2387W.11/3">Further information on demographic trends including patterns of migration out of, into and between English towns and cities will be available from the state of cities report, due for publication in spring 2006. A full thematic report on demographic trends in urban England will be published later.</p>

	<p pid="c.2388W.6/2">Whether a benefit is payable to people who are not resident or present in the United Kingdom depends in the first instance on the entitlement conditions for each individual benefit. These conditions may be modified for EU nationals moving within the EU by the EU Regulations on Social Security for Migrant Workers, and in other cases by reciprocal social security agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries.</p>

The customer's signature must be witnessed by a person of standing in their community, for example a minister of religion, a civil servant, a police officer or a doctor. The purpose of Life Certificates is to uncover unreported deaths, and to provide an acceptable level of assurance that benefit is paid correctly.</p>
	<p pid="c.2388W.6/5">Life Certificates are issued to a specific group of people chosen by, among other criteria, country, marital status, age and dependents. This allows for a manageable sample of customers to be chosen. The sample will, over time, reflect the customer variety. Customers are not selected on the basis of how they are paid.</p>

	<p pid="c.2397W.2/1">DFID understands that life in Fallujah is slowly returning to normal. A functioning local government exists and the population has voted in both the October 2005 constitutional referendum and December 2005 general election. The US now estimates the city's population to be at 239,000, compared to 300,000 before 2004. The US Government reports that there is currently no-one officially classified as a displaced person in the vicinity of Fallujah; many of those displaced by the conflict moved to stay with relatives or relocated to surrounding cities. A UN survey showed that 17 per cent. of former Fallujan residents (approximately 50,000) did not expect to return to the city.</p>
	<p pid="c.2397W.2/2">The United Kingdom has provided advice but not financial aid for the reconstruction of Fallujah. In the aftermath of military operations in Fallujah, DFID staff and consultants made assessment visits to Fallujah and provided advice to the Iraqi Government on the management of health, humanitarian and co-ordination issues. The Iraqi Ministry of Industry and Minerals continues to lead on the reconstruction effort, with support from the US. Financial aid came from the Iraqi Government and the US. We have made no detailed assessment of the ways in which aid disbursed to Fallujah has been spent. However, the following information, drawn from US assessments, may be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="c.2397W.2/3">The Iraqi Government has allocated US$100 million for Fallujah's reconstruction and US$178 million in housing compensation for Fallujah's citizens. Shortly after military operations in Fallujah ended, the Government initially estimated the damage to housing to be in the region of US$500 million. Fallujah residents have so far received US$103 million in housing compensation. The Government recently announced a further US$75 million which will be paid to citizens over the next month, bringing the total to US$178 million. It is unclear whether any additional funds will be made available.</p>
	<p pid="c.2397W.2/4">The United States is funding 81 reconstruction projects in Fallujah worth over US$100 million. Of these, 14 have been completed, 25 are underway, 22 have contracts awarded but have not yet started and one is being evaluated. Major projects include:</p>
	<p pid="c.2397W.2/5" class="indent">electrical system improvement&mdash;over US$40 million. Electrical distribution lines are now connected to about 80 per cent. of homes and businesses in Fallujah;</p>
	<p pid="c.2397W.2/6" class="indent">a new waste water treatment plant and collection system&mdash;US$28 million. The Fallujah Water Department reports that 98 per cent. of residences in Fallujah are now supplied with safe drinking water;</p>
	<p pid="c.2397W.2/7" class="indent">new police facilities&mdash;US$7.6 million. Two new police stations are due to be completed in April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.2397W.2/8">Smaller projects include reconstruction of the Fallujah railway station, renovating the court house and constructing new health care facilities. Four new health clinics are due to be completed between February and August 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.2397W.2/9">No official data exist on the repair and construction of homes in Fallujah. Anecdotal evidence from those working in Iraq suggests that around 15 per cent. of homes have been restored. This is expected to increase with the distribution of the extra US$75 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.2398W.5/1">DFID is currently providing budgetary support to Sierra Leone, Ghana, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. The DFID report 'Financial support to the water sector 2002 to 2004' includes (page 22) an assessment of the percentage of public expenditure (including budgetary support) allocated to water and sanitation by partner countries. In the African countries receiving UK budgetary support, this varies between 0.3 per cent. and 4.8 per cent. No country allocates as much as 12 per cent. from central Government funds to water and sanitation services. Copies of the report are available in the Libraries of the House and also on the DFID website <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-01-26c.44848.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-01-26c.2399W.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="2399W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060126/text/60126w43.htm#60126w43.html_spnew2">
	<p pid="c.2399W.0/1">DFID recognises that the World Trade Organisation talks held in Hong Kong in December made only modest progress towards a pro development outcome to the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). We remain committed to work towards a successful conclusion to the round by the end of this year. A good deal that promotes the interests of the poor would include improved market access, particularly in agriculture, and significant reductions in trade distorting domestic support.</p>
	<p pid="c.2399W.0/2">DFID places paramount importance on ensuring that the voices of developing countries are heard in trade negotiations. For some time DFID has provided advisory support and financial resources to help developing countries formulate their own trade policies and negotiate and participate in trade deals, including the Hong Kong talks; we will continue to provide similar support. Over the coming weeks we will remain in contact with the LDCs on their post-Hong Kong priorities. This will help focus our efforts on promoting the interests of poor countries where they want our support.</p>
	<p pid="c.2399W.0/3">DFID believes that greater market access won't in itself enable the poorest countries to benefit more from trade; developing countries have to also overcome significant supply side capacity constraints, such as lack of investment in physical infrastructure and human capital. The international community has committed development assistance to support this so called aid for trade, pioneered by the UK during our twin presidencies of the G8 and EU. We have pledged to increase our own aid for trade to &pound;100 million per annum by 2010. While this is not a substitute for significant changes to WTO trade rules, DFID believes it will assist poor countries to engage in and benefit from the international trading system. DFID will also focus its efforts over coming months on ensuring pledges on aid for trade are honoured.</p>
