	<p pid="b.623W.12/2">Incinerator bottom ash aggregates were being used as a secondary construction material in the Tesco construction site of Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire under an exemption from waste management licensing. The Environment Agency does not normally carry out a risk assessment itself on exempted activities as they are considered low risk, but does check whether the information provided by the operators of the activity meets the terms and conditions of the exemption.</p>
	<p pid="b.623W.12/3">Jacksons Civil Engineering Ltd. notified the Environment Agency of the use of this material in construction of the Tesco site, Gerrards Cross, as an exempt activity under the Regulations. The notification included a risk assessment provided by the producers of the aggregate. In accordance with Environment Agency policy, this document has been placed on the public register at their Hatfield Office (North East Area Office, Apollo Court, 2 Bishops Square Business Park, St. Albans Road West, Hatfield, Hertfordshire.

	<p pid="b.624W.2/2">The two key bodies funded by Defra to combat climate change are the Energy Saving Trust and the Carbon Trust. Total expenditure in 2003&ndash;04 by the Department on the Carbon Trust was &pound;52.4 million and on Energy Saving Trust &pound;29.8 million (including the Community Energy Programme).</p>
	<p pid="b.624W.2/3">The Department also funds a number of research contracts relating to climate change. The total value of these in 2003&ndash;04 was &pound;13.5 million.

	<p pid="b.624W.2/4">In addition the Environment Agency contributes to mitigation of greenhouse gases through its regulation of emissions and to society's adaptation to the impacts of climate change, notably by flood risk management. However, it is not possible to assess the proportion of the Agency's &pound;1 billion per annum budget (60 per cent. of which is funded by Grant-in-Aid from Defra) that can specifically be attributed to climate change work.</p>

Recent staff survey data shows that 83 percent. of staff believe they are encouraged to work flexibly. Whilst these approaches are designed to improve the way we do business and deliver more efficiently, data from the same survey shows that 67 percent. of staff said they were able to achieve the optimum work/life balance.</p>

	<p pid="b.633W.2/2">As a part of DFID's overall response to the Pakistan earthquake, we have provided in-kind assistance in the form of 5,500 winterised tents, as well as plastic sheeting, blankets and ropes which are an integral part of the International Organisation for Migration's (IOM) tent winterisation package. In addition, we are providing financial support as well as staff secondments to the IOM, the lead international agency managing shelter issues, as well as financial support to six non governmental organisations that are implementing shelter programmes. This support is helping relocated North West Frontier and Kashmir populations in camps at lower altitude as well as those villagers living in remote locations above 5,000 feet. It has enabled the construction of temporary warm rooms&quot; made of galvanised iron sheets to assist those affected by the earthquake to survive the Himalayan winter.</p>
	<p pid="b.633W.2/3">DFID has been working actively with a range of donor partners, the Government of Pakistan, as well as beneficiaries, to gauge the appropriateness of the shelter assistance provided. When it became clear that a high proportion of the shelters distributed (excluding the DFID-provided tents) was not winterised, DFID provided an additional &pound;2,000,000 of in-kind assistance to support the activities of the responding international community. We are currently discussing whether additional financial or in-kind support is required. DFID support through the financing of transport aircraft provided by NATO and in-country helicopter operations includes the delivery of shelter materials for the UN and humanitarian agencies.</p>

I am advised that only 541 suitably qualified non-Catholic candidates, from the first eight campaigns, will be rejected as a result of 50/50.

	<p pid="b.635W.5/1">Accident and emergency ambulance services in Derry city are commissioned by the western health and social services board from the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) on the basis of historical patterns of demand. Levels of cover therefore vary to meet demand but there are usually three to five vehicles on duty during the day and two to three at night crewed by a total complement of 46 operational staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.5/2">During the recent Christmas period, NIAS experienced an unusually high level of staff sickness absence. In addition to six Altnagelvin station staff already absent, a further seven reported sick at short notice. As a result, of 58 planned shifts over the period 24 to <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-29">29 December</phrase>, it was possible to cover only 41. However, full cover was resumed on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-30">30 December 2005</phrase> and was maintained over the rest of the period including new year's eve.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.5/3">Immediate action taken to reduce the impact of the sickness absence included redeploying staff from other stations, offering overtime to ambulance staff throughout Northern Ireland, assigning day shift staff to night-time cover, redeploying rapid response vehicles and introducing additional non-emergency vehicles to minimise the need for emergency crews to undertake non- emergency work.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.5/4">In the longer term NIAS plans to review its procedures for allocating leave and overtime, and shift rotas to ensure effective staff cover. NIAS will incorporate its findings into a review of its absence management procedures.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.5/5">While there was considerable additional pressure placed on ambulance personnel in NIAS's western division, I am pleased to say that the ambulance service's response to life threatening calls in the area and, in particular within Derry city itself, remained on a par with its performance across Northern Ireland performance during the period.</p>

The specific ACPO guidance states:</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.2/3" class="indent">a period of two years in a 'live, searchable system' incorporating 'a controlled access environment' after 90 days. This period of retention is to facilitate the searching of that data on a case-by-case basis, should a crime committed during the deployment come to light during that two-year period. It would be expected that after the initial 90 days period, the data will be 'partitioned' for the rest of its retention period. In the period of 91 days to two years, the data will only be accessed for a justified policing need. Access to this data will be 'controlled and documented' to ensure its compliance with the proportionality, justification and use. In exceptional circumstances there may be operational grounds to justify retention of ANPR data beyond the two-year period. Should this occur a record of the grounds should be retained&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.642W.5/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-01">1 January 1999</phrase> the United Kingdom has been required to implement EU Directive 89/460/EC, which allows the use of road vehicles with 11.5 tonne axle loads and plated vehicle weights of 40 tonnes. These vehicles are more demanding in loading terms than a 44 tonne vehicle on six axles. The Directive applies to principal routes&quot; used in international traffic, and in the UK these have been assumed to be motorways, all purpose trunk roads and the primary route network.</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.5/2">Under The Railway Bridges (Load Bearing Standards) Regulations (England and Wales) Order 1972 (SI 1705/1972) bridges carrying highways over railways are required to take a 24 tonne rigid lorry or a 32 tonne articulated lorry. So any strengthening to take 40 tonne (or 44 tonne) lorries is the sole responsibility of the relevant highway authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.642W.5/3">When the Directive came into force, all bridges on the motorway and trunk road network were able to accommodate 40 tonne vehicles. In the six years from 2001&ndash;02 to 2006&ndash;07 &pound;205 million has been provided to strengthen bridges on the local authority primary route network to take 40 tonne lorries. In the same period &pound;703 million has been provided to strengthen local authority bridges not on the primary route network, but not all of these bridges are required to take the 40 tonne loading.</p>

	<p pid="b.648W.2/2">In addition, the deemed planning permission for the CTRL development at Stratford (granted in 2001 to Union Railways North, a subsidiary of LCR), requires a 'mechanised link1 such as a travelator to be constructed between Stratford Regional and International Stations. Also, the outline planning consent for the Stratford City development, granted in 2004, requires the developer to make physical provision for the mechanised link, provided that LB Newham agree the procurement date and design of the travelator by January 2006. Discussions on how this requirement might be fulfilled are underway between LCR and London borough of Newham, who as local planning authority are responsible for the enforcement of these conditions.</p>

	<p pid="b.652W.12/5" class="indent">The Learning and Skills Council provides funding for Prince's Trust activities to Milton Keynes College through two separate methods.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.12/6" class="indent">Firstly, Milton Keynes College directly provides Prince's Trust provision and this is funded from the College's mainstream Further Education budget, as provided by the LSC. This funding is used for activities chiefly in Milton Keynes and Aylesbury, although we do not have a breakdown of the information into specific constituencies or wards for Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.12/7" class="indent">Secondly, the Learning and Skills Council in the South East has decided, on a regional basis, to continue to support Prince's Trust activity via a conduit college; in this case, Milton Keynes College. The College occupies an important place in this process and acts as the 'conduit college' to enable other non-FE providers to undertake Prince's Trust activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.12/8" class="indent">The South East, as an LSC region, has committed to continue to fund Prince's Trust activity within the region for the coming year. This academic year (2005/06) the budget allocated for the South East region is &pound;1.3 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.12/9" class="indent">Milton Keynes College is the conduit college for Prince's Trust Volunteers funding within the South East region. Funding is channelled through the college out to 12 partner deliverers of Prince's Trust programmes across the 6 South East LSC areas. Target learners are 16&ndash;25 and from groups, such as disaffected, care leavers, drug abusers, ex-offenders, etc. They follow the Prince's Trust Team Programme through which they aim to achieve the customised City &amp; Guilds Profile of Achievement. In the period August 01 to Dec 04, 1,687 learners participated in programmes in the southeast. Milton Keynes College record learners as part of the college's Individual Learner Record and Prince's Trust activity is included within the college Final Claim and Audit</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.12/10" class="indent">For 2004/05 the amount spent on Prince's Trust activities by the team within Milton Keynes College operating within the Milton Keynes area totalled &pound;63,515.70. The amount projected by the College for 2005/06 is &pound;109,112.75.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.12/11" class="indent">In 2004/05 the schemes benefited 15 learners under the age of nineteen and 10 learners over the age of nineteen.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.12/12" class="indent">In 2005/06, it is anticipated that the schemes will benefit 18 under nineteen-year-olds and .18 learners over the age of nineteen.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.12/13" class="indent">From these figures there would not appear to be an adverse impact on the learner numbers for either age group.</p>

	<p pid="b.655W.2/1">We recognise the work of the Prince's Trust, particularly through their team programme, in helping hard to reach young people back into learning. We acknowledge that the Trust have had some difficulties getting funding to support this programme. However, the LSC has indicated that more than &pound;11 million will be available to support the programme in 2005/06. The LSC has set up a taskforce to allow the Prince's Trust to continue to deliver this programme. The taskforce will be looking at how the programme can be nationally accredited as well as the future planning, quality and funding arrangements to ensure sustainability. I have already met with the Prince's Trust to discuss these issues and will be meeting with them and the LSC to discuss progress shortly. We have not had any representations from Learning and Skills Councils regarding this. As the allocation of funding in local areas relates to the LSC's operational responsibilities, Mark Haysom the LSC's Chief Executive has written to the hon. Member with the information requested for Greater Manchester and London. A copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-19">19 December 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/3" class="indent">I write in response to your recent Parliamentary Questions to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/4" class="indent">Firstly, you asked what representations she has received on the funding of Prince's Trust schemes by Learning and Skills Councils (LSC). The LSC has been working with the Trust for many years, supporting and funding the Team Programme through our local offices and colleges. As you may be aware, the LSC's funding priorities are decided at regional and local level, and the total amount of funding for the Team Programme therefore varies from region to region. The discussions between the LSC and our providers and the Prince's Trust are currently ongoing, with support already identified and finalised for this funding year in the majority of LSC regions. Across the LSC our funding support for this academic year will total approximately &pound;11 million, which I hope demonstrates our ongoing commitment to the Team Programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/5" class="indent">We are working closely with The Prince's Trust to establish the contribution of the programme towards LSC priorities and to identify additional sources of funding, outside of the LSC. We have also created a task force between the LSC and the Prince's Trust who are working together to establish how our joint planning cycles can support this aim. Our shared ambition is for a secure future for the Team Programme that is not dependent on a single LSC funding source.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/6" class="indent">In your further question to the Secretary of State you asked what assessment she has made of the effects of prioritising 14 to 19 education on the funding of Prince's Trust schemes in Greater Manchester. LSC Funding is currently channelled through a lead college out to other partners delivering Prince's Trust programmes across the LSC areas in the region. Each learner joins the Prince's Trust Team Programme through which they aim to achieve the customised City &amp; Guilds Profile of Achievement.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/7" class="indent">The LSC in Greater Manchester currently spends approximately &pound;265m on provision for young people, much of which supports learners from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our commitment to this group of learners remains a key priority for the LSC both locally and nationally. The Prince's Trust provision is one of the many routes we are supporting for young people, and the LSC has to make some difficult funding decisions this year in order to balance a range of priorities for the area. This has therefore affected the level of funding support available to the Prince's Trust provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/8" class="indent">However, the funding earmarked for Prince's Trust in Greater Manchester for this year will total at least &pound;750,000, a considerable investment in the Team Programme. I understand my colleagues in the local office are working with key partners and providers to identify potential further funding to support this provision. We are also working closely with the Prince's Trust locally and nationally to ensure that we plan together effectively to meet our shared priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.2/9" class="indent">Trust this is helpful.</p>

Stability trials are the responsibility of the Department of Health (as the licence holder) and the manufacturer. These are performed in compliance with current regulatory requirements. The licensed shelf-life has recently been extended by the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency from two to three years. The MOD holds sufficient doses of Anthrax vaccine to meet its projected requirements; the precise numbers held cannot be released as this would be prejudicial to defence activities.

	<p pid="b.663W.2/1">The birthlink&quot; criterion is used to determine eligibility for the civilian element of the ex-gratia payment scheme for former far east prisoners of war and civilian internees; it is based on the place of birth (in the UK) of the individual or one of his or her parents or grandparents and not on a specific racial or bloodlink&quot; criterion. The question of whether use of this criterion resulted in racial discrimination is currently the subject of appeals by both the Secretary of State and the claimant (Mrs. D Elias) against a High Court decision on a case brought by a former civilian internee. The outcome of the legal proceedings will determine whether use of the criterion amounts to racial discrimination. The review that I outlined in my statement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-12">12 December 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2005-12-12.1119"><i>Official Report,</i> column 1119</phrase>, will examine whether consistent eligibility criteria were used to determine eligibility for civilian internees; it will not address whether the scheme was discriminatory. The Department has accepted, however, that it should have reviewed the operation of the scheme under the terms of section 71 (1) of the Race Relations Act 1976; we are currently considering the appropriate timescale for undertaking this review but do not consider that it could sensibly be completed until the legal proceedings referred to above have been completed.</p>

	<p pid="b.663W.5/1">Attrition reserve aircraft are held to allow the required fleet size to be maintained throughout the service-life of the platform. This policy is designed to avoid the prohibitive costs that would be incurred if orders for single aircraft were to be made after the main production run was complete. Once a platform enters Service, fleet sizes may be changed and thus the numbers of aircraft classified as attrition reserve&quot; may also change.</p>

	<p pid="b.668W.0/1">As at December 2005 the number of available service families accommodation (SFA) in Great Britain was some 52,000. These are allocated on a tri-service basis and not by single service arrangements. The following self explanatory table provides as much of the information requested as is available.</p>
	<p pid="b.668W.0/2">The majority of the SFA in England and Wales was sold to Annington Homes</p>
	<p pid="b.668W.0/3">Ltd. (AHL) under the terms of the November 1996 sale agreement and are leased back from AHL, for use by the Ministry of Defence (MOD). Properties owned by AHL, for which the Department has no long-term service requirement, are released to AHL who then make a commercial judgment (in which the Department has no involvement) as to the disposal route. Housing stock for Scotland and Northern Ireland remains in MOD ownership.</p>

	<p pid="b.668W.0/5">Since May 1997, around 13,000 properties have been released back to AHL. A profit share agreement is currently in place as part of the AHL sale agreement, which allows Government participation in any profit AHL may make over certain agreed levels. Since 1996, &pound;126 million has been paid to HM Treasury under this arrangement.</p>

Foreign and Commonwealth Office Ministers and officials are in frequent and regular dialogue with OT Government Ministers and officials on a broad range of issues, including matters related to monetary and fiscal policy. However, in the case of Gibraltar, some parts of the EC Treaty apply to Gibraltar by virtue of Article 299(4) of that Treaty, and therefore the Government of Gibraltar (GoG) has an obligation to transpose EU legislation in domestic law including in financial areas, where appropriate. The Government liases with GoG to help them undertake this transposition. But policy remains in the hands of GoG.</p>

However, the UK is responsible for the international relations of the CDs and the OTs. As far as possible, we encourage OT and CD Governments to participate as part of the UK delegation at relevant international meetings. Where appropriate, OTs and CDs may attend international meetings in their own right. The OTs and CDs are not members of the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as they are not independent countries, and so do not attend World Bank or IMF meetings. In the case of Gibraltar, which is a part of the European Community, it is the responsibility of the UK to represent Gibraltar's interests there.</p>

	<p pid="b.680W.11/1">The international community, including the UK, has resisted formal definition of what constitutes severe physical or mental pain or suffering, as used in the UN Convention Against Torture's definition of torture. Whether any particular treatment would cause an individual severe mental or physical pain or suffering depends on the specific circumstances of a case. A definition could not be exhaustive, leaving the possibility for argument that some types of clearly torturous behaviour were not in fact forbidden as torture. Section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that a public official commits torture if he intentionally inflicts severe pain or suffering on another in the performance of his duties, and does not define severe pain or suffering&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.680W.11/2">As the UN Human Rights Committee noted in 1992, with regard to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: The Covenant does not contain any definition of the concepts covered by article 7 [prohibiting torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment], nor does the Committee consider it necessary to draw up a list of prohibited acts to establish sharp distinctions between different kinds of punishment or treatment; the distinctions depend on the nature, purpose and severity of the treatment applied.&quot;</p>

This provided that as a rule no further action would be taken where vehicles were clearly displaying their emergency blue lights. General guidance is also given in the revised version of their Code of Practice for Operational Use of Road Policing Enforcement Technology, issued in November 2004.

	<p pid="b.684W.11/1">Home Office funding for the POPPY scheme since March 2003 stands at around &pound;1.5 million. The grant funding agreement with Eaves Housing for Women, the current service provider, was due to end in September 2005 but was extended to the end of March this year to enable completion of work on the formal evaluation of the scheme and consideration of the evaluation findings, we propose to increase the geographical coverage of support services for victims and introduce support at varying levels of intensity according to individual need. We are currently running a competitive exercise to test the extent to which the current Home Office grant to Eaves Housing represents value for money, and to select a provider for support services to this group of victims from April 2006 until March 2008. Eaves Housing is amongst the organisations invited to submit a bid for Home Office funding for services for this group. The selection exercise commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-20">20 December</phrase> and will conclude in mid-late February 2006 with the award of a two year grant funding agreement. Further information about the UK strategy on human trafficking, including plans for support for victims of trafficking are contained in the document Tackling Human Trafficking&mdash;Consultation on Proposals for the UK Action Plan&quot;.

	<p pid="b.685W.2/1">The provision of safe houses&quot; for victims of trafficking is a long-standing concern of voluntary organisations and practitioners working in this field. A safe house for minors was set up by West Sussex social services in 1995 following a number of disappearances of West African girls in local authority care. Voluntary organisations welcomed the provision but unfortunately 50 percent. of the girls went missing, with fears that the safe house had been infiltrated by traffickers. West Sussex social services department took the decision to close the house and provide foster placements instead. A further safe house was set up by Integrated Care in West Sussex, but was closed shortly after it opened in early June 2005 following a lack of referrals by local authorities. It is recognised that child victims of trafficking will be in need of welfare services and protection under the provisions of Child Care Legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.685W.2/2">Local authorities have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in need or at risk of harm by providing a range and level of service appropriate to each child's needs. Government funding is allocated to local authorities with Children's Services responsibilities on the basis of the needs of their populations. A supplement is paid to children's services authorities which accommodate unaccompanied asylum seeking children, some of whom may have been victims of trafficking. Home Office officials are giving further consideration to ways in which the options available to safeguard and support child victims of trafficking might be extended. This includes re-examining the potential value of providing dedicated and secure accommodation and specialist professional foster care placements.</p>

	<p pid="b.686W.2/1">Information is not available in the form requested. Receipts from recovered criminal assets are allocated to a range of initiatives. The Recovered Assets Incentive Fund was set up in 2003&ndash;04 to incentivise asset recovery by asset recovery agencies. &pound;15.5 million a year for three years was allocated to the Fund. From the Fund, four new multi-agency Regional Asset Recovery Teas (RARTs) were set up to disrupt criminal groups, confiscate more criminal assets and to tackle money laundering. The London Regional Asset Recovery Team was allocated &pound;4.3 million over three years</p>

	<p pid="b.686W.2/3">In addition a new police incentivisation scheme introduced in 2004&ndash;05 has enabled police forces in England and Wales, and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, to receive a share of the criminal assets they recover locally. Under the scheme the Metropolitan Police Service received over &pound;4 million this financial year based on its performance in 2004&ndash;05.</p>

	<p pid="b.686W.5/1">As agreed with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), under the police incentivisation scheme the police service receive one-third of the total assets recovered over and above &pound;40 million in 2004&ndash;05, increasing to one half in 2005&ndash;06. The Government are spending more than the first &pound;40 million to support existing spending commitments in the asset recovery field. It was also agreed with ACPO that incentive payments would be based on each force's annual performance in the recovery of criminal assets. There are no plans to change this agreement. However, the Home Secretary announced last November that Home Office funding of &pound;2.6 million per year for financial investigators in police forces, which was due to end in March, would be extended for a further year. From 2006&ndash;07 a new incentive scheme will operate under which all agencies involved in asset recovery, including the police service, will get back 50 per cent. of what they recover. There are at present no plans to increase this share.</p>

	<p pid="b.691W.9/15">1. These figures are as reported by Rossendale borough council on the revenue out-turn (RO) returns submitted to ODPM.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.9/16">2. Central Government funding is defined here as the sum of specific grants inside aggregate external finance (AEF) and formula grant (revenue support grant, redistributed business rates and police grant). Specific grants inside AEF are those revenue grants paid for councils' core services (such as waste collection), excluding funding for local authorities' housing management.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.9/17">3. The information provided excludes capital funding and funding for local authorities' housing management responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.9/18">4. The information excludes those grant programmes, such as European funding, where authorities are simply one of the recipients of funding paid towards an area.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.9/19">5. Comparisons across years may not be valid because the figures shown are not adjusted for changes in local authority responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.9/20">The increase in central Government funding in 2003&ndash;04 is in part due to housing benefit and council tax benefit administration specific grant doubling from &pound;243,000 in 2002&ndash;03 to &pound;493,000 in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.9/21">The large increase in total central Government funding 2004&ndash;05 is principally due to a &pound;2.2 million grant for a Housing Stock Options Appraisal Project.</p>
	<p pid="b.691W.9/22">The decrease in formula grant between 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 is due largely to the removal, with effect from 2004&ndash;05, of local authorities' responsibility for paying part of the costs of council tax benefit and housing benefit.</p>

	<p pid="b.695W.11/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many cases are currently with the Child Support Agency's specialist enforcement teams; and what action he is taking to reduce that number.</p>
	<p pid="b.695W.11/5" class="indent">There are currently 15,784 cases with the Child Support Agency's specialist debt enforcement teams who are responsible for recovery of debt by means of civil debt recovery through the courts.

	<p pid="b.695W.11/6" class="indent">The enforcement teams are becoming much more successful in utilising their enforcement powers.

	<p pid="b.695W.11/7" class="indent">In addition, the enforcement teams are closely monitoring the times taken to drive cases forward for both old scheme cases and new scheme cases and these times are improving.

The above includes those old scheme cases with a full maintenance assessment and those new scheme cases with either a full maintenance calculation, or a default maintenance decision.

	<p pid="b.696W.2/31">4. The proportion of compliant cases is calculated by expressing cases which are currently open and have paid any of the maintenance due via the collection service over the preceding quarter expressed as a percentage of all those (currently open) cases charged maintenance via the collection service (either regular maintenance and/or arrears) over the same quarter.</p>
	<p pid="b.696W.2/32">5. The table excludes maintenance direct cases (of which there were 99,000 in August 2005), in which the CSA have carried out a maintenance calculation or assessment, and the non resident parent then pays his/her maintenance liability directly to the parent with care. As the CSA is no longer directly involved in the case, it is not possible to say how much, if any of the original CSA maintenance liability is being paid.</p>

	<p pid="b.703W.2/4" class="indent">In 1997 the then Employment Service was given the opportunity to compete to deliver the Employment Zone in Tower Hamlets, but decided not to submit an in-house bid. Instead, it formed a consortium with Manpower and Ernst &amp; Young called Working Links' to provide a public/private partnership.

	<p pid="b.703W.5/1">Currently, the only benefit for which lone parent&quot; is a category for entitlement is income support.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.5/2">The criteria allowing lone parents to qualify for income support have principally remained unchanged since 1988 in that the customer would, in addition to being a lone parent, also have to satisfy other conditions of entitlement common to all claimants. The criteria for claiming income support as a lone parent did see substantial change when Work Focused Interviews were introduced in August 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.5/3">The Work Focused Interview for Lone Parent (LPWFI) regulations require lone parents to participate in a Work Focused Interview at the outset of their claim. From October 2005 lone parents are also required to attend a Work Focused Interview once every three months when their youngest child is aged 14 or over, to help them prepare for the transition to JSA once their child reaches 16 years and avoid drift onto incapacity Benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.5/4">While the introduction of LPWFI presented a major change to the criteria for claiming the benefit, income support has continued to evolve to meet the needs of all the people it provides for. Many changes introduced on income support have not been exclusive to lone parents, though along with other client groups they have continued to benefit from the enhancements made to the benefit; such as Mortgage Interest Run-On (MIRO) or the recent introduction of Child Maintenance Premium (CMP).</p>

The partial regulatory impact assessment recognised that this would seriously affect a number of charities and helped to inform United Kingdom policy.

	<p pid="b.723W.2/1">The proposed European Parliament and Council regulation on the addition of vitamins and minerals and other substances to foods has completed its first reading under the co-decision procedures and is due to begin its second reading in the European Parliament. The United Kingdom has achieved key objectives during the first reading phase of protecting traditional products and of introducing harmonised European Commission arrangements for assessment and possible action concerning the safety of substances other than vitamins and minerals. Our objective is to help steer this proposal to adoption to ensure consumer protection and harmonised rules within the single market.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.2/2">The proposal provides for the setting of maximum amounts for vitamins and minerals in foods, not food supplements, which must take into account a scientific risk assessment and intakes from other dietary sources, including food supplements. Article 5 of EC Directive 2002/46/EC on food supplements already contains a similar provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.2/3">There are, as yet, no EC proposals for the setting of maximum levels for vitamins and minerals, and the Government have made no assessment in relation to their application to food supplements or the fortification of foods. Once proposals come forward, a regulatory impact assessment will be prepared and published for consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.725W.2/1">The terms of authorisation for national health service foundation trusts (NHSFTs) sets out the limitation on the level of income that can be derived from private patient charges in any financial year. This limitation is underpinned by section 15 of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003. Each of the current 32 NHSFTs is therefore required under primary legislation and their terms of authorisation to limit the percentage of private patient income to the same level as it was when the organisation was an NHS trust in 2002&ndash;03, and cannot increase its income from private patients at the expense of NHS patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.725W.2/2">Monitor (the statutory name of which is the Independent Regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts) assesses whether NHSFTs are complying with their terms of authorisation using its compliance framework, which is available at <a href="http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk">www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk</a>. Compliance with the restriction on private patient activity is measured on an annual basis, I am informed by the chairman of Monitor that no NHSFT has so far exceeded its 'private patient cap'. To do so would mean breaching a statutory duty and the terms of authorisation, where Monitor could use its powers to intervene. Further details on the restriction of private patient income for NHSFTs can be found in Monitor's Review and Consolidated Accounts of NHS Foundation Trusts 2004&ndash;05, which was recently laid before Parliament and is also available on Monitor's website.</p>

	<p pid="b.727W.0/1">Qualitative research of hepatitis C awareness among general practitioners and practice nurses has been carried out this year. This research, which repeats a baseline study carried out in 2001, indicates that awareness of hepatitis C is much improved compared to 2001 and that hepatitis C testing is being offered to those known to be at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.727W.0/2">The Health Protection Agency has been monitoring the number of reported laboratory diagnoses of hepatitis C, which is a national outcome indicator for implementation of the Hepatitis C Action Plan for England&quot;. There has been a noticeable upward trend in hepatitis C diagnoses since 2000 from just under 5,000 reports to around 8,000 in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.727W.0/3">Injecting drug users are the group currently at greatest risk of hepatitis C infection in this country. The unlinked anonymous prevalence monitoring programme's survey of injecting drug users in contact with specialist services showed that 67 per cent. had had a voluntary confidential test for hepatitis C in 2004 compared to 49 per cent. in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.727W.0/4">There has also been qualitative research this year into format and design of the hepatitis C Face Your Past&quot; leaflet, which is being widely distributed as the hepatitis C awareness photography exhibition tours regional cities. This research suggested that the design, content and tone were effective at gaining attention and giving a clear message without causing panic.</p>
	<p pid="b.727W.0/5">Research into public awareness of hepatitis C will be carried out in 2006. This will repeat a survey of awareness among the general public and groups at increased risk of infection in 2003.</p>
