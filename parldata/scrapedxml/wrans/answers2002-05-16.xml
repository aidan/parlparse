	<p pid=".752W.9/1">The trade and poverty programme (TPP) aims to build capacity in sub-Saharan African countries and regional organisations for trade reforms which support poverty reduction. Detailed proposals for capacity building projects have been prepared in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Botswana and the East African community. The project design process has itself been contributing in these countries to better co-ordination between trade policy and poverty reduction and to building the national understanding and ownership of the projects which is vital for their success. Full implementation of these projects is expected to start in July 2002. DFID is also working on possible TPP projects with Lesotho, Mozambique, Zambia and the Southern African trade network and plans to make visits to assess interest in Nigeria in June and with the West African Economic and Monetary Union shortly after.</p>

	<p pid=".752W.12/1">The UNGASS helped to raise the profile of child poverty and child rights issues. It provided an opportunity for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister for Children and Young People and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development to advocate UK views and network with others. But negotiations on the outcomes document were difficult. The outcomes document is good on HIV/AIDS, gender equality and education. But we were not able to secure optimal language on reproductive health and child rights in the face of strong American opposition. The language on reproductive health and child rights is acceptable and the best that could be agreed by all UN member states, but is not as strong as we would ideally have liked.</p>

	<p pid=".753W.2/1">DFID has been supporting the development of National Strategies for sustainable development (NSSDs) initially through working with colleagues at the OECD/DAC to produce policy guidance on this topic. This work has been taken up by the United Nations who have now developed their own policy guidance. This will be a priority issue at the World Summit on sustainable development later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.2/2">One conclusion of work so far is that developing strategies is more of a process than preparing a document that sits on a shelf. Moreover, the label does not matter. If a national strategy adheres to an agreed set of principles or characteristics of strategic processes for sustainability, then that strategy in effect becomes a NSSD. In this way, poverty reduction strategies that exhibit these characteristics (such as the integration of environmental, economic and social considerations) can be considered NSSDs.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.2/3">As a consequence, it is not easy to quantify how many NSSDs are in place because they are identified by characteristics not labels.</p>

	<p pid=".761W.6/1">In November 2001 the Government launched a consultation on the future role of learning partnerships. In the light of that consultation, I wrote to chairs of learning partnerships on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-29">29 April 2002</phrase> setting out our future vision for partnerships and new funding and support arrangements. The Government believe learning partnerships have a key role in promoting provider collaboration to deliver better lifelong learning in local areas, and in working with a wide range of partners to maximise the contribution of learning to local regeneration. The Government also wish to see better links between learning partnerships and the Learning and Skills Council. From April 2003 funding for learning partnerships, currently channelled through Government Offices, will be directed through the Learning and Skills Council. I have placed a copy of my letter to chairs in the Libraries.</p>

	<p pid=".763W.13/1">The National Lottery has raised approximately &pound;12.65 billion for good causes since its launch in November 1994, around &pound;9.1 billion of which has been spent by the National Lottery distributing bodies. This leaves a balance of about &pound;3.55 billion which distributors have not yet drawn down from the National Lottery Distribution Fund, although at the end of March 2002 distributors' total commitments stood at over &pound;4.12 billion, some &pound;570 million more than the balance held in the fund.</p>
	<p pid=".763W.13/2">Government accounting rules, and the financial directions issued to the distributing bodies by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, prevent distributors from drawing down money from the Distribution Fund before it is needed to cover expenditure incurred by grant recipients. We will, however, examine how the financial directions might be modified to allow distributors a greater flexibility in managing the funds allocated to them, to enable more funds to be committed and to allow funds which are already committed to be transferred more quickly to grant recipients.</p>

(the X factor is the additional element added to basic pay to reflect the differences between conditions of service in the Army and United Kingdom civilian life). The lower levels of X factor for the Regiment reflects the reduced liability for service of its members. Members of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment may also be eligible for United Kingdom service allowances provided they meet the relevant criteria.</p>

	<p pid=".780W.5/1">In our first term, our priority was to establish a platform of macro economic stability. That we have achieved. We now need to build upon this foundation to improve the productivity and competitiveness of our economy.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/2">As part of this programme, I am publishing today a report setting out the Government's strategy for the manufacturing sector; a report by the Automotive Innovation and Growth Team; and a Value-Added Scoreboard. Copies of each publication are being placed in the Libraries of the House. I have also established a new Innovation and Growth Team, on the aerospace industry.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/3">UK manufacturing matters. It creates a fifth of our national output, employs 4 million people and produces the majority of our exports. It supports well paid jobs in all regions. It can make a very substantial contribution to improvements in our economy's productivity. The success of United Kingdom manufacturing is crucial to our country's prosperity, now and in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/4">I recognise that the sector has been facing difficult conditions. There is intense competition in every market, compounded within the euro zone by the persistent weakness of that currency. In recent times, manufacturers around the world have all faced very difficult trading conditions, as a result of the global downturn in manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/5">Looking to the future, however, the potential of the sector is strong. The United Kingdom is part of the world's largest single market as well as being one of the world's most open trading nations. This brings extra competition, but also extra opportunity. Recent surveys of industrial confidence have been positive, and there is evidence of improved global conditions.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/6" class="italic">Manufacturing strategy</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/7">Many UK manufacturers are world leaders. We excel in sectors such as car manufacturing, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, the electronics industry and food production. But despite its many strengths, UK manufacturing also suffers from long-standing weaknesses&mdash;lower levels of skill, investment, R and D and innovation&mdash;that contribute to lower levels of productivity than in France, Germany and the US.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/8">The document I am publishing sets out the Government's strategy for helping manufacturing companies fulfil their potential in the UK, moving up the value chain to high skilled, knowledge intensive operations. The strategy builds on the TUC/CBI work on productivity, the dialogue at the manufacturing summit I hosted last December, and a careful analysis of the evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/9">A first requirement is that Government must create a sound market-oriented, stable business environment. But this is not enough. We must also encourage companies to innovate, to invest, to improve skills and use best business practice. On this basis we identify seven manufacturing pillars for our strategy:</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/10" class="indent">Macro-economic stability</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/11" class="indent">Investment</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/12" class="indent">Innovation</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/13" class="indent">Best practice</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/14" class="indent">Raising skills and education levels</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/15" class="indent">Modern infrastructure</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/16" class="indent">The right market framework.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/17">Within each pillar, there are objectives and actions for Government and industry to develop. The strategy is neither a hard and fast prescription, nor a formula for instant initiatives. Instead, we offer it as the basis for continuing to develop a robust partnership with management, employees and their unions&mdash;a manufacturing partnership based on best practice that must be effective at the national, regional and sectoral level.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/18" class="italic">AIGT report</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/19">The Automotive Innovation and Growth Team report that I am also publishing today provides an excellent example of Government working in partnership with industry to produce a practical strategy which will bring real benefits to a critical manufacturing sector.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/20">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is discussing the strategy later this afternoon with Sir Ian Gibson, Chairman of the AIGT, and other senior automotive leaders. I am delighted to accept the recommendations of the report and to confirm that the Government are committed to delivering on the report's conclusions in partnership with the automotive industry. Government funding of around &pound;45 million will be invested over five years to implement the recommendations to establish an Automotive Academy, Supply Chain Groups, and two automotive centres of excellence.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/21" class="italic">Value-Added Scoreboard</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/22">I am also publishing today the first ever company wealth creation league table&mdash;the Value-Added Scoreboard, which measures value added, that is sales less the cost of bought-in materials, components and services. It provides a unique tool which enables all companies, including those not currently in the Scoreboard, easily to calculate their value added from their annual report and benchmark themselves against UK and European companies in their sector that are in the Scoreboard.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/23">The Scoreboard, put together by the DTI Innovation Group, contains real success stories of British manufacturing and other sectors and will help companies to learn from the record of Britain's and Europe's most successful businesses. There are five UK companies in the top 15 wealth creators in Europe&mdash;Shell, BP, HSBC, GlaxoSmithKline and BT&mdash;and 24 in the top 100, all highly successful companies that create high value added for the UK economy.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/24" class="italic">Next steps</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/25">The work of the Automotive Innovation and Growth Team, and our response to its report, underlines our commitment to effective action to support manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/26">Three other innovation and growth teams have already been established, in the chemicals, environmental equipment, and software sectors. In the textiles and clothing sector, we are implementing the recommendations of the Industry Strategy Group. The aerospace industry in the UK has been very successful, but it is facing increasing competition from other parts of the world. I am, therefore, delighted to be able to announce today the formation of an innovation and growth team for the sector, led by Sir Richard Evans of BAE Systems.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/27">On the wider aspects of our manufacturing strategy:</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/28" class="indent">We will work with industry to develop firmer benchmarks against which to measure and report on progress, in order to focus our activities more effectively,</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/29" class="indent">We will publish competitiveness studies on a sectoral basis to provide a basis for further action to improve productivity and performance,</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/30" class="indent">The English regional development agencies have been asked to reflect the importance of manufacturing in their regional economic strategies and plans.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.5/31">Our aim is to deepen and broaden the consensus around the actions required to achieve manufacturing success in the UK. In partnership with industry and other stakeholders, we are determined to deliver results.</p>

	<p pid=".793W.0/2">London Underground is responsible for the PPP contracts for the modernisation of the underground's infrastructure. Under these contracts, the performance of the private sector infrastructure companies will be measured in terms of the capacity, reliability and ambience of the travelling environment they deliver on the tube network. Payments will increase as performance improves.</p>
	<p pid=".793W.0/3">There is no cap on the maximum annual penalty that can be levied under the tube modernisation contracts. Indeed, if performance deteriorates below set levels, the rate at which the contractor is penalised increases. Ultimately, poor performance could result in the contractor defaulting on the contract.</p>

The research identified and evaluated the initiatives being adopted by social landlords in England to assist under-occupiers to move to a smaller home when they want to.

The research showed that a combination of positive inducements and the personal approach was the most effective for encouraging moves. Specialist staff who engage with tenants on a one to one basis, discussing their requirements in detail, explaining what help and properties are available can be particularly effective at facilitating moves.</p>

The international community is committed to working with the parties to build on these initiatives.

	<p pid=".813W.9/2">The Water Bill aims to ensure improved management of our water resources; place consumers at the heart of a more open and accountable regulatory process and increase the powers of courts and the Regulators to level appropriate financial penalties on water companies. In addition, the Bill will contain provisions for extending competition for users of large amounts of water.</p>
	<p pid=".813W.9/3">The consultation response considered in detail more than 150 responses and following this, a number of amendments will be made to the draft Water Bill. The main changes are; firstly that Ofwat will be governed by a Regulatory Board rather than an individual Director General, along similar lines to other economic regulators. This is instead of the Advisory Panel proposed in the Draft Bill. Secondly, the Director General's duties to ensure that companies can secure &quot;reasonable returns on their capital&quot; will not be altered. And thirdly the Director General of Water Services will be given a sustainable development duty. While this will not alter the Director General's purpose or aims, it will oblige him to be mindful of social and environmental concerns, when exercising his functions as economic regulator of the industry. The Director General supports these changes.</p>

This followed the G8 summit earlier in July 2000, where in response to a UK led initiative members agreed to consider how public purchasing could help reduce illegal logging. Prior to the policy becoming a binding commitment it had been part of the model policy for greening government operations since 1997.</p>

	<p pid=".817W.3/1">The current low price of milk has undoubtedly reduced the income of many dairy farmers to levels that appear unsustainable in the long term. However, this low price has largely been caused by factors that are temporary in nature, most notably, oversupply of raw milk in the UK and the weakness of EU and world markets for dairy products.</p>
	<p pid=".817W.3/2">For the longer term, it is likely that the next round of WTO agriculture negotiations will further restrict the use of export subsidies and the increasing exposure of EU markets to world markets. In addition, enlargement of the EU is likely to lead to pressure on the Community budget, if the CAP is not reformed.</p>
	<p pid=".817W.3/3">In order to produce a sustainable dairy industry that can compete successfully on the growing world market for dairy products, the industry must be given the opportunity to trade free of artificial constraints imposed by the WTO, as well as by the EU dairy regime. The EU price support system is focused on butter and skimmed milk powder, both in clear surplus, hampering the development of the most efficient farmers and represent significant financial burden to most farmers.</p>
	<p pid=".817W.3/4">The Government therefore favour the orderly phasing out of milk quotas in combination with a reduction in EU support prices to world prices, and direct but degressive aid to help farmers adjust to the new regime. During the forthcoming review of the milk quota system, due to start in June, the UK will be pressing to achieve confirmation that quotas will not continue after they lapse on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase>. These changes are intended to provide longer-term direction within the framework of the dairy regime, which farmers need in order to plan their businesses effectively.</p>

We consulted on the early retirement provisions of the EU Rural Development Regulation when drawing up plans for implementation of the regulation, but in the light of responses to that consultation we decided that the limited funds available for implementation would be better directed towards other measures to assist the industry. This is because the type of early retirement scheme available under the regulation could not be targeted effectively towards those who should benefit, such as tenant farmers.</p>

	<p pid=".826W.5/2">The figure was based on early estimates of the costs that local authorities would face in the period January to March 2002. These estimates were made on the basis of the best information to hand at the time. It was assumed that: 2.5 million fridges would be disposed of each year; treatment costs would be around &pound;15 per unit; and up to 40 per cent. of units might continue to be taken back by retailers and manufacturers. However, Government accepted that additional payments might be needed once the actual costs and consequences of the regulation were clearer.</p>

The CERRIE meetings are intended to provide an opportunity for those differences of opinion to be debated, at length, in an environment that will encourage consensus to be reached, as far as that is possible. Holding the meetings in private will aid the uninhibited expression of views and the ability, where appropriate, for individuals to change their minds in the light of the evidence before them. However, in order to be transparent about their discussions, CERRIE are preparing their own website which will include, among other things, summary minutes of their meetings. CERRIE's final report to the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) will also be published.</p>

	<p pid=".831W.5/1">A risk assessment has been commissioned by DEFRA to quantify the probability of an outbreak of exotic disease linked to illegal imports. The work will seek to identify the pathways virus might travel and what are the critical control points along those pathways.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.5/2">The risk assessment is being carried out by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) and will facilitate the identification of effective control strategies and efficient and effective resource allocation to reduce risks to animal health from exotic diseases.

	<p pid=".831W.8/1">Draft regulations have been laid in both Houses, together with a regulatory impact assessment and an analysis of the responses made to the draft regulations circulated in July 2001. The Government's objective has been to strike a fair balance between the owners of common land, and those who have, for many years, driven across the land to get to their homes.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.8/2">The major change in the regulations is in relation to the compensation payable. This reflects the Government's view that the compensation payable in respect of older premises, already in existence when it became an offence to drive on common land, should be a relatively small amount. Owners of premises in existence on or before <phrase class="date" code="1905-12-31">31 December 1905</phrase> will pay 0.25 per cent. of the value of the premises. Owners of those built between <phrase class="date" code="1906-01-01">1 January 1906</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="1930-11-30">30 November 1930</phrase> will pay 0.5 per cent. Compensation in respect of all other premises remains at 2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.8/3">We hope that the regulations will be considered by both Houses before the summer recess, and will then come into force as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".832W.2/1">While we have received no recent representations, we have recognised for some time that increased flood risk is one of the significant issues arising from climate change. Indeed the Government have issued guidance on expected sea level rise since the 1980's. Last year we published an assessment that showed that without present adaptation policies, such as formal defences, managed realignment, wetland creation etc., average annual flood damage from rivers could increase by some 60 per cent. and on the coast by around 400 per cent. This emphasised the need for an appropriate precautionary response.</p>
	<p pid=".832W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-26">26 April 2002</phrase> DEFRA published &quot;Climate Change Scenarios for the United Kingdom&quot;, a new set of scenarios prepared by the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, Tyndell Centre for Climate Change Research and University of East Anglia. These largely confirm the general trend of previous predictions but provide additional detail and increased spatial resolution.</p>
	<p pid=".832W.2/3">We will be reviewing all policy areas, including flood management, in the light of these scenarios over the coming months and will consider carefully the need for any consequent adjustment to our guidance.</p>

As the Lord Chancellor has stated publicly, the Government are now considering the report's recommendations in detail, and hope to publish a White Paper announcing their conclusions before the summer recess.

	<p pid=".842W.11/1">Details of the numbers of domestic violence incidents in Wales and Lancashire, obtained from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary Annual Statistical Return from police forces, are given. The definition of domestic violence incidents used for the figures up to 1998&ndash;99 was as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".842W.11/2" class="indent">Any form of physical, sexual or emotional abuse which takes place within the context of a close relationship. In most cases, the relationship will be between partners, married, cohabiting or otherwise; or ex-partners.</p>
	<p pid=".842W.11/3">The figures for 1999&ndash;2000 and 2000&ndash;01 used the following definition:</p>
	<p pid=".842W.11/4" class="indent">Any violence between current or former partners in an intimate relationship, wherever and whenever the violence occurs. The violence may include physical, sexual, emotional or financial abuse.</p>
	<p pid=".842W.11/5">The figures up to 1998&ndash;99 are therefore not directly comparable with those for 1999&ndash;2000 and 2000&ndash;01. Changes in numbers of domestic violence incidents recorded may be due to increased willingness on the part of victims to report these crimes, and to changes in force policy in how to handle and record such incidents. In particular, Lancashire changed their recording and reporting procedures in the 2000&ndash;01 financial year, resulting in a higher figure for that year.</p>

	<p pid=".844W.2/14">It should be noted that recorded violent crime is subject to changes in reporting and recording. The 2000&ndash;01 figure for Lancashire may have been affected by new recording practices introduced by the force in April 2000. Also, for example, the 2001 British Crime Survey found that, over England and Wales as a whole, reporting to the police of common assault rose from 29 per cent. in 1999 to 39 per cent. in the year 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".844W.2/15">The British Crime Survey has shown that, in England and Wales as a whole, the number of common assaults recorded in the survey decreased by 14 per cent. between the 1999 and 2000 calendar years, whereas common assaults recorded by the police increased by an estimated 9 per cent. Common assaults recorded by the police may therefore not necessarily be a reflection of the real level of this offence.</p>

The behaviour of the young offenders was measured before and after by looking at the number of minor and Governor reports. The results were independently reviewed by the Home Office's Research, Development and Statistics Directorate (RDSD) who concluded that the results demonstrated a positive effect of nutritional supplements on behaviour.

	<p pid=".846W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June</phrase> last year the provision of &pound;15 million over three years from the Capital Modernisation Fund to assist small retailers in deprived areas to improve the security of their businesses. &pound;3 million was available in the 2001&ndash;02 financial year, with a further &pound;6 million in both 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".846W.2/2">This money, which is being spent on schemes identified by Regional Crime Reduction Directors, in conjunction with Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships, is being used to help small retailers to improve security. This is being achieved by employing a variety of interventions, including enhancing the security of individual premises and improving the environment of shopping centres. Nearly 3,000 shops in 114 retail schemes in some of the most deprived areas in England and Wales benefited from first year funds. More shops will be assisted in the next two years.</p>
	<p pid=".846W.2/3">The Home Office has also supported work undertaken to establish retail crime partnerships by funding a consultant post for the past two years. The consultant has worked closely with the British Retail Consortium to produce a definitive guide on how to establish and run a retail crime partnership and encouraged retailers and other stakeholders in main shopping centre areas to establish partnerships to tackle retail and related crime.</p>
	<p pid=".846W.2/4">Funding totalling &pound;223,000 was also given to aid retail crime reduction initiatives under various programmes administered by regional crime reduction directors in the financial year ending <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-31">31 March 2002</phrase> and a further &pound;86,500 is expected to be disbursed through regional crime reduction directors specifically for retail crime reduction initiatives in the current financial year.</p>
	<p pid=".846W.2/5">Other funding under the Crime Reduction Programme, such as the &pound;170 million for schemes for the installation of closed circuit television, particularly in town centres, will help to reduce shop theft as well as other types of crime.

	<p pid=".847W.2/1">Our extradition law currently provides that we cannot extradite for offences which are purely military offences and have no equivalent under general criminal law. We intend to replicate that provision in the new law. However, we have always been prepared to extradite in cases where an individual has committed a military offence which has a counterpart under criminal law. It is therefore legally possible under present arrangements, although exceptionally rare, for an extradition partner to seek the return of an individual to appear before a military court.</p>
	<p pid=".847W.2/2">Under the terms of Article 6 of the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant, it is the responsibility of each member state to designate its issuing judicial authorities. In principle, it would therefore be possible for a European Arrest Warrant to be issued by a military tribunal, although such instances are likely to be rare.</p>

	<p pid=".849W.0/24">1. All figures rounded to nearest &pound; billion.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.0/25">2. Figures are based on the ONS MQ5 publication. They have been recalculated in light of the reissue of the MQ5 publication on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-16">16 May 2002</phrase>. The MQ5 publication is subject to change because it is under constant review. Since the figures above are dependent on MQ5, they are similarly subject to change.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.0/26">3. The figures shown in cash terms are the sum of the series RKDL and RKAF in the ONS MQ5 publication.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.0/27">4. The figures shown in 1997 prices are the sum of the same series after adjustment for price changes using the RPI index.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.0/28">5. There is a small discontinuity in the series between 1998 and 1999. For further information see ONS's pension fund surveys technical article of <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-16">16 May 2002</phrase>, available at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/products/p502.asp">www.statistics.gov.uk/ products/p502.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.0/29">6. The data in the above table may include some transfers from one insured pension provider to another. ONS, who produce the underlying data, look out for this possible problem and, where identified, correct for it. Information on the amount of these transfers is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.0/30">7. Investment of existing assets of self-administered pension funds in managed funds and annuity contracts operated by insurance companies have not been excluded.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.0/31">The figures in 1997 price terms in the table represent an update to the DWP's indicator 'Amount contributed to non-state pensions&mdash;real terms (United Kingdom)'. This indicator is one of the set monitored in the Government's annual poverty and social exclusion report, &quot;Opportunity for All&quot;. The latest report, &quot;Opportunity for All&mdash;Making Progress&quot; (Cm 5260) was published in September 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.0/32">The breakdown of these figures between different types of contributions is set out in table 2 in cash terms and then in 1997 price terms.</p>

	<p pid=".854W.5/2">The main purpose of such reciprocal agreements is to protect the social security position of workers moving between the two countries during their working lives. They prevent employees, their employers and the self-employed from having to pay social security contributions to both the home state and the state of employment at the same time and ensure that such workers' rights to certain benefits are maintained. They vary to some extent from country to country depending on the nature and scope of the other country's social security scheme. Generally, they cover contributory benefits in respect of the following contingencies: sickness, invalidity, unemployment, retirement, bereavement and industrial injuries. Workers who have contributed to both countries' schemes during their working lives can usually receive an old age pension from each country which reflects the proportionate amount or their insurance in, or contributions to, each country's scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".856W.5/1">When people claim incapacity benefits they are normally required to undergo a Personal Capability Assessment carried out by SchlumbergerSema Medical Services on behalf of the DWP. Currently, around 25 per cent. of customers nationally do not attend their appointment, which are arranged by correspondence.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.5/2">A telephone appointment booking service has been piloted in Derby and Stoke (from October 2001) and in Liverpool (Bootle and Mann Island), Acton and Euston (from February 2002). This has proved very successful in reducing non-attendance, reducing waiting time for customers at medical centres and allowing customers to discuss the PCA process with staff prior to their appointment. As well as providing a better customer service, the new process has improved administration and made better use of doctors' time. We therefore intend to adopt the process nationally by the end of June 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".856W.8/1">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's report on Derby city council was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/2">The report finds that there are inconsistencies in the way that Derby city council administers benefit. On the one hand, the council gives a high priority to promoting and paying benefit and is commended for these activities. However, local authorities also have a duty to safeguard their activities against fraud, irregularity and corrupt practices. At Derby, BFI finds that the council has neglected counter fraud activity, detecting error and recovering overpaid benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/3">The BFI commends the council for its work on benefits take-up and social policies which support the high level of importance that elected members give to promoting and paying benefit and to providing a high quality customer service. However, the BFI is extremely concerned that this has been prioritised to the detriment of other responsibilities. Inspectors found the council has created an environment where benefits, overpayments and counter fraud sections have been hindered from focusing on reducing fraud and error.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/4">Management checking was abandoned in August 1999 due to IT problems and as a result there is no assurance on the security on access to benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/5">The report finds that the council has carried out counter fraud activities simply to achieve Weekly Benefits Savings targets, with little commitment to reducing, deterring or eradicating fraud and error. The fraud team has been managed on a part-time basis since September 2000 and little effort has been made to prosecute fraudsters.</p>
	<p pid=".856W.8/6">The report makes a great number of recommendations to the council to help to raise the standard of both benefits administration and counter fraud work.</p>

	<p pid=".861W.5/1">The NHS Local Improvement Finance Trust (NHS LIFT) initiative was announced in the NHS Plan. The initiative aims to deliver a step change in the quality of the primary care estate. LIFT's initial focus has been to encourage investment in those parts of the country&mdash;such as inner cities&mdash;where primary care services are in most need of improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.5/2">In February 2001, the Department prioritised an initial six LIFT schemes, and in January 2002 a further 12 LIFT schemes were identified. We anticipate approving a third wave of schemes later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.5/3">The Department has earmarked a total of &pound;195 million (over the current spending review period) to support localities develop their LIFT schemes. All LIFT localities will receive significant levels of financial assistance. The level of this funding is dependent on a number of local factors such as size of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.5/4">The Department is also providing technical assistance to help PCTs develop their investment proposals, and is confident that all localities will attract private partners offering affordable solutions.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.5/5">Two of the first wave LIFT schemes (east London and the City and Camden and Islington) recently issued tender documentation. The value of the initial investment requirement in east London and the City is &pound;62.5 million, and in Camden and Islington is &pound;17 million.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.5/6">Once fully established locally, LIFT will help deliver quicker across the piece solutions for primary care. The LIFT approach enables the needs of the whole locality to be considered in a systematic manner, and aims to deliver speedier solutions by using a standardised approach to procurement.</p>

	<p pid=".865W.2/1">Over the last 18 months we have spent &pound;100 million on modernising national health service dentistry. &pound;10 million of this was for the dental care development fund and the dentistry action plan fund to support local plans to improve access. This money enables health authorities to assist dentists seeking to set up new practices and to expand and modernise existing ones. Furthermore, the &pound;35 million modernisation fund provided grants for dentists to improve facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".865W.2/2">Additionally, the commitment payment scheme, introduced from April 1999, provides incentive payments to dentists, depending on how much NHS work they undertake. From April 2002, the scheme was extended to include dentists who have five years or more service in the NHS. Officials continue to work with the profession to see how the scheme might be strengthened in the future. The Department is also undertaking work with the profession and other stakeholders through the modernising project &quot;Options for Change&quot;, to test out new methods of providing NHS dentistry.</p>

	<p pid=".869W.11/1">Currently a consultant on a maximum part-time contract foregoes one eleventh of national health service salary in return for the lifting of restriction on private practice earnings.</p>
	<p pid=".869W.11/2">The Department does not collect data on the amount of time consultants spend undertaking operations or supervising others in doing that work. The annual job planning review provides the basis for the framework of contractual obligations. Job plans cover all aspects of a consultant's practice in the NHS and set out clearly the consultant's time and service commitments. Within the consultant contract negotiations we are seeking to provide a clearer framework in which decisions can be made and agreement reached between consultants and employers about the time to be spent on different categories of activity.</p>

This includes a project on food additives and child behaviour that has been submitted for publication and is currently undergoing peer review. In July 2000, the Independent Expert Committee, the committee on toxicity which advises the FSA, published its review of the scientific evidence on adverse reactions to food. It concluded that most adverse reactions are to natural foods rather than synthetic additives. It noted that there has been weak but conflicting evidence for an association between particular food additives and a specific condition known as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. The committee concluded that in general</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/2" class="indent">&quot;some dietary changes, not necessarily the same for all children, could reduce problem behaviour in at least a few children with ADHD&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".872W.0/3">Independent experts agree that the link between food additives and adverse effects on behaviour is not conclusive and that a lot more research is required in this area. The FSA will review new information on the subject of ADHD and any links it may have with food supplements, food colouring and mineral deficiencies.</p>

	<p pid=".873W.2/1">The independent expert group on mobile phones (the Stewart Group) was set up to investigate the public health implications of mobile phone technologies. Their report was published in May 2000 and included a recommendation to set up a substantial research programme. This programme, jointly funded by government and industry, was announced in December 2000 and was launched at a public meeting in February 2001. The research is being undertaken under the direction of an independent programme management committee under the chairmanship of Sir William Stewart. The selection and management of studies is solely in the hands of this committee with additional scientific advice from other experts in the relevant field.</p>
	<p pid=".873W.2/2">There have been two invitations for research applications, in February and December 2001, and research is now under way in the first tranche of projects. Details of this research are given on the mobile telecommunications health research programme's (MTHR) website at <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a> Shortlisted proposals submitted to the second invitation are currently under consideration by the programme management committee.</p>
	<p pid=".873W.2/3">The aim of the second call was to extend the range of research being carried out under the aegis of the MTHR programme and some of the proposals are of direct relevance to exposures to radio frequency (RF) radiation from mobile phone masts. However the emphasis of the research, both funded and submitted, has been on mobile phone handsets rather than masts because localised exposures of people using phones are in general appreciably higher than exposures to the whole body from masts. In practice many of the experimental studies on hand sets will also be valuable in providing evidence on any possible effects on people of exposures to RF radiation from masts.</p>
