	<p pid=".1500W.9/3"><i>(a)</i> The UK's energy projections take account of the effect of increasing temperatures on energy demand, although we have not identified the impact separately. We are not aware of any detailed studies of the potential for higher temperatures to reduce energy usage globally, although space heating and cooling are both key users of energy, so rising temperatures, whilst reducing winter heating requirements, will lead to increased use of air conditioning, which will counteract and possibly outweigh any gains.</p>
	<p pid=".1500W.9/4"><i>(b)</i> A study entitled Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture was carried out for Defra in 2004 by the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research (IGER). Among its findings, the study demonstrated that warmer temperatures resulting from climate change will increase the potential growing season of arable and other crops, earlier sowings will be possible, and crops will grow and ripen faster. In particular, maize will have a higher yield potential in an extended growing season.</p>

	<p pid=".1505W.3/1">Funding for village halls has traditionally come from local and charitable sources, with only a relatively small amount of support from central Government. Indeed, the amount of central funding assisting village halls now is very much higher than it was in the seventies, eighties and nineties. Since its inception in 1995, the Community Fund of the National Lottery has provided grants to the value of more than &pound;138 million to around 4,500 village hall projects and the Millennium Fund supported over 500 village halls and urban community centres to the value of nearly &pound;100 million. National funding sources including the Big Lottery Fund will continue to make an important contribution; but this must supplement and not be seen as a substitute for local leadership and fund-raising.</p>
	<p pid=".1505W.3/2">The variety of public funding includes the following:</p>
	<p pid=".1505W.3/3" class="indent">Defra: Rural Enterprise Scheme; Village Halls Loan Fund; Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund; Landfill Tax Credit Scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1505W.3/4" class="indent">National Lottery Funds: Big Lottery Fund; Awards for All.</p>
	<p pid=".1505W.3/5" class="indent">Local authorities provide grants in addition to the Parish Council precept and the access available from Parish Council to the Public Works Loan Board.</p>
	<p pid=".1505W.3/6">The above information refers only to the public funding which is available to supplement local fund-raising and donations which have always been the main source of finance for village halls.</p>
	<p pid=".1505W.3/7">Indirect sources of public funds to supplement private donations include Gift Aid, and some limited VAT reduction.</p>

	<p pid=".1507W.2/1">The information so far available on the relationship between problem gambling and use of fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) is contained in the draft of an independent report undertaken for the Association of British Bookmakers by Europe Economics, who are currently considering comments on it by two independent experts who reviewed it at the Department's request. The report does not provide a firm basis for estimating the percentage sought, but it indicates that, on the basis of a sample of 7,845 people who bet or gamed (excluding bingo) at least once a month, 48 used FOBTs at least once a month. It also notes that 29 people (0.4 per cent. of the total sample) could be classified as problem gamblers, but concludes that while nearly all participated in more than one form of gambling the numbers involved were too small to permit meaningful further analysis.</p>

	<p pid=".1507W.5/1">The Department's aim is to improve the quality of life for everyone through cultural and sporting activities, to support the pursuit of excellence and to champion the tourism, creative and leisure industries. The Department's policies and actions have had a significant impact on Coventry, South since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/2">In 2002 we launched the first ever comprehensive national physical education, school sport and club links strategy with an investment of &pound;459 million. One school sport partnership involving three School Sport Co-ordinators and 15 Primary Link teachers is based in Coventry, South. It has received a Sport England grant of &pound;327,310. To achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities. Sports facilities in Coventry, South have benefited from two Sport England Community Capital Lottery grants totalling &pound;562,787, two Sport England Active Sports Lottery grants totalling &pound;1,665,612 and a further two awards worth &pound;905,655 in total from the &pound;108 million investment in innovative sports facilities through the Active England programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/3">We have increased our national funding to the arts in real terms by 60 per cent. from &pound;199 million in 1998&ndash;99 to &pound;367 million in 2004&ndash;05. Between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04 funding to Arts Council England, West Midlands increased from &pound;5.6 million to &pound;32.5 million, including from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, funding to major national arts organisations in the West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/4">In 2005&ndash;06 the total Arts Council England, West Midlands investment in regularly funded organisations will be &pound;35.4 million. Coventry, South has benefited from grants to arts organisations and individuals, including the Belgrade Theatre and Arts and Media Training which is based in Coventry.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/5">Since September 2004, schools in Coventry, South have been included in the second phase of the Creative Partnerships programme which began in 2002. Creative Partnerships aims to give school children and their teachers the opportunity to explore their creativity by working on sustained projects with creative organisations and individuals, including artists, theatre companies, dance studios, museums, orchestras, film-makers and historic buildings. Funding of &pound;65 million was allocated for the period 2002&ndash;05 to develop Creative Partnerships, and the programme will receive at least a further &pound;86 million in 2005&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/6">Culture Online was launched in 2002 to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. Many of its projects are aimed at children of school age and at audiences that might not otherwise participate in arts and culture, including those who do not easily have access to arts and culture, people from deprived communities and people with particular educational or physical needs. People in Coventry, South will be among those who benefit from Culture Online. Between 2002 and 2004, &pound;13 million was allocated to fund 20 Culture Online projects.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/7">Coventry, South also benefits in the museum sector from Renaissance in the Regions.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/8">Coventry Arts and Heritage is a partner in the West Midlands regional hub, which, as a Phase 1 hub, received priority funding; it received &pound;0.8 million in the 2003&ndash;04 financial year for Renaissance, with a further &pound;0.62 million from the Education Strategy Fund. The total grant for the period 2003&ndash;06 will be &pound;7.11 million from Renaissance and &pound;3.14 million from the Education Strategy Fund, totalling &pound;10.25 million. Of this money, Coventry Arts and Heritage has been allocated &pound;1,068,075 to deliver Coventry's contribution to the West Midlands Hub's two-year plan.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/9">In addition, the collections of the Coventry Transport Museum have been designated by Museums, Libraries and Archives Council as being a pre-eminent collection of national or international importance. The museum has received &pound;445,000 through the Designated Challenge Fund, which is financed by DCMS, to improve interpretation and displays levering a substantial amount of investment from European funds and a huge commitment from the council to support the museum's work.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/10">Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/11">Our support for, and promotion of, the film and broadcasting industries have contributed to the general success of film-making and television activity in the Coventry, South area. Screen West Midlands has provided lottery funding to a number of film-related activities in the constituency including the Warwick Arts Centre and the Blink Film Festival Coventry.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/12">In November 2000 we introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available. However, according to Department for Work and Pensions records, the number of households in the Coventry, South constituency with at least one person aged 75 or over claiming the winter fuel payment in 2003&ndash;04 was 5,715.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/13">We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on new year's eve to 11 am on new year's day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/14">The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Coventry, South, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/15">Tourism in Coventry, South has benefited from Government-funded marketing activity. In April 2003 we established VisitBritain with a new domestic marketing remit for England, and we gave strategic responsibility for tourism development to the Regional Development Agencies, including Advantage West Midlands. These changes, together with VisitBritain's successful marketing activities in promoting Britain abroad as an attractive tourist destination, benefit all parts of the country, including Coventry, South.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/16">English Heritage has awarded grants worth &pound;265,168 to Coventry, South since May 1997, including &pound;100,000 to 119&ndash;123 Spon Street and &pound;97,414 to 123a/123b Upper Spon Street in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/17">In common with all those in the United Kingdom, the public library branches in Coventry, South are connected to the internet through the People's Network which was funded through a &pound;120 million lottery grant and which has put all the United Kingdom's public libraries on-line. In addition, the Department is funding the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council with &pound;5 million over three years to implement the Framework for the Future Action Plan and Library Improvement Programme, which is designed to encourage improvement across the public libraries sector in England.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/18">The Department has been an energetic advocate of the community and informal learning value of public libraries. Councils within the West Midlands area including Coventry city council have recognised this value and as part of a consortium took part in an initiative called Multinet, the result of which was to enable the participating public library authorities to enjoy the benefits of high bandwidth networking technology. Coventry's central library, which resides in the Coventry, South constituency, was one of the beneficiaries of the project's overall award of &pound;324,439 from the DCMS/Wolfson Public Libraries Challenge Fund in 1999&ndash;2000.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/19">The DCMS/Wolfson Public Libraries Challenge Fund has also supplied an award of &pound;124,761 in 2001&ndash;02 towards the Caring with Books initiative in the West Midlands. This entailed building relationships with books and reading between foster families, public care institutes and many of the 7,000 children currently in public care across the West Midlands, including the Coventry area.</p>
	<p pid=".1507W.5/20">Information from the national lottery distributors indicates that since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> Coventry, South has benefited from over 347 awards totalling over &pound;55 million. Of these, 43 awards worth just under &pound;5 million were made by the New Opportunities Fund which was established by the Government in 1999. The New Opportunities Fund merged with the Community Fund in June 2004 to form the Big Lottery Fund.</p>

We considered the views expressed to us by all respondents including those of sports clubs. On balance we concluded from the evidence that we had underestimated costs of the new regime and that it would be necessary to increase the fee levels generally.

	<p pid=".1525W.2/1">We are committed to improving recruitment and retention of teachers. Nationally, there are around 29,000 more qualified teachers working in schools than there were in 1997. In Wandsworth, the latest statistics show that teacher vacancies have fallen from 3.8 per cent. in 2002 to 2.1 per cent. in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1525W.2/2">We have put in place a number of measures nationally to improve recruitment and retention. For example, graduates training to teach receive bursaries of up to &pound;6,000; and new teachers of shortage subjects receive golden hellos of up to &pound;4,000 on starting teaching.</p>
	<p pid=".1525W.2/3">In London, the London Challenge seeks to make London a world leader for secondary education, including making London one of the most attractive places to teach. Significant changes have been made, including the introduction of a new inner London pay scale. For example, an experienced classroom teacher at the start of the upper pay scale in London now earns &pound;34,851, compared to &pound;29,385 outside London. From April 2004, teachers working in London have been able to apply for interest-free equity loans of up to &pound;100,000, through the London Challenge Key Teacher Homebuy scheme, in order to be able to afford a home in London.</p>
	<p pid=".1525W.2/4">The Chartered London Teacher status is now available to teachers working in London. It rewards the skills and expertise of London teachers and provides a one-off payment of &pound;1,000 for those who achieve the status, and provides recognition of professional achievement that teachers will carry with them throughout their careers. And a new 'Preferred Supply Agency' list has been established to make it easier for Headteachers to access agencies which endeavour to provide better trained teachers and better value for money.</p>
	<p pid=".1525W.2/5">Furthermore, London Challenge is funding a teacher recruitment project, to offer a free teacher recruitment service to London schools in challenging circumstances for September 2005. Through this project, GOL are working with Battersea Technology College. GOL has already met with the head teacher to discuss staffing needs and is creating a pool of candidates for vacant posts. Currently, the staffing picture across Battersea in both primary and secondary schools is stable.</p>

	<p pid=".1527W.5/2">At the 2002 Spending Review a record funding increase for the FE sector was delivered. The increased funding enabled the Learning and Skills Council to deliver a 4.5 per cent. increase in funding rates in 2003/04 for all colleges that agreed development plans. In the same year, school sixth form funding rates increased by 3 per cent.&mdash;resulting in a narrowing of the funding gap to 9 per cent. FE colleges that delivered against their plans received a further 5 per cent. increase in funding rates for 2004/05 compared with a 4 per cent. increase for schools&mdash;a further narrowing of the gap to 8 per cent.

	<p pid=".1531W.2/1">The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 require every school to have a room appropriate and readily available for use for medical and dental examination and treatment and for the caring of sick or injured pupils. How these are staffed is a matter for local determination. For example, medical and dental examination and treatment will be done by local health professionals under local NHS arrangements, while school staff (such as a first aider) may care for a sick or injured pupil. Further Education sector institutions, as independent corporations, are responsible for the health and safety of their learners and they are responsible for determining what medical facilities or accommodation they need to have in place. The Learning and Skills Council is accountable for ensuring that FE institutions with which it contracts have in place effective arrangements for ensuring the health and safety of learners.</p>

It is not unusual for non-infantry units to deploy in an infantry role as every soldier in the British Army is trained as infanteer first, and as a specialist second. Such units would not, however, primarily be deployed in an infantry role during war fighting operations. My hon. Friend may be assured that there is assessed to be no increased risk in deploying such units in this role and that they receive the same pre-deployment training as Infantry Battalions. All units, upon return from an 'out of role' operational tour, will undertake a routinely planned training programme designed to bring it back up to competency in its specialism. The duration of such a training programme will vary according to an individual unit's specialism.</p>

	<p pid=".1546W.0/1">Routine independent sampling for radioactive contamination around HM Naval Base Clyde is carried out annually by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and involves a wide range of tests on air and land samples at numerous sites up to five miles from the naval base. These tests are environmentally diverse and involve rigorous scientific testing of the entire terrain. The results are published annually in SEPA's Radioactivity in Food and Environment Report, which is available on their website at <a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk">www.sepa.org.uk</a>. The latest available report, which was published in 2003, verifies that existing discharge arrangements between SEPA and the Ministry of Defence provide effective control over the levels of radioactivity that are discharged into the environment. No tests are carried out of water samples, as this source would not yield a reliable indication of the impact of contamination.</p>
	<p pid=".1546W.0/2">As an additional measure, the MOD carries out its own annual routine air and land samples, the results of which are published in the Marine Environmental Radioactivity Surveys at Nuclear Submarine Berths report (ISBN 11773019X). The latest version was published in December 2004 and is available from <a href="http://www.tso.co.uk">www.tso.co.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".1549W.2/1">The main indicators used in the Formula Spending Share formulae are the population estimates. The population estimates from mid-2001 onwards have been based on the 2001 Census. They are then adjusted for births, deaths and both internal and external migration. The population estimates used in the Local Government Finance Settlements from 2003&ndash;04 onwards have been based on the 2001 Census.</p>
	<p pid=".1549W.2/2">The formulae also use other socio-demographic indicators derived from the Census, for example population sparsity and population density. 1991 Census data is used for these other indicators in the 2005&ndash;06 Formula Spending Share formulae for Education, Personal Social Services, Police, Highway Maintenance and Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services. This Census data is not used in either the Fire or the Capital Financing Formula Spending Share formulae, and is therefore not used in the calculation of RSG for single service fire authorities only, i.e. LFEPA, metropolitan fire authorities and combined shire fire authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".1549W.2/3">I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-21">21 July 2004</phrase> that we would not be amending the other socio-demographic indicators to incorporate 2001 Census data in the 2005&ndash;06 settlement (<phrase class="date" code="2004-07-21">21 July 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-07-21.30WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 30WS</phrase>). This is because it would have been technically incorrect to have simply introduced the data without first amending the statistical models underlying the Formula Spending Share formulae. Changing the formulae in this way would have broken the formula freeze that we have introduced to provide funding stability for authorities. Further research is being undertaken on the formula changes needed to incorporate the 2001 Census data into the Formula Spending Share formulae.</p>
	<p pid=".1549W.2/4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be consulting local authorities during the summer of 2005 on the formulae for the 2006&ndash;07 settlement.</p>

	<p pid=".1564W.5/3">The Department of Health makes no direct financial allocations for housing adaptations.

	<p pid=".1565W.2/1">The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) having considered all the available evidence, including the results of a public request for information, has advised that co-proxamol should be withdrawn from the market on the grounds that the benefits of co-proxamol are not considered to outweigh the risks. The Licensing Authority has accepted this advice and a public announcement on the decision to withdraw co-proxamol was made on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">Monday 31 January</phrase>. The Marketing Authorisation holders have agreed to withdraw co-proxamol over an extended period of time in order to allow long term users an opportunity to adopt suitable alternative pain management strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".1565W.2/2">There are a number of alternatives to co-proxamol for managing pain and the CSM has issued advice on pain management options to assist prescribers together with their individual patients, in choosing appropriate pain management strategies. This guidance also refers to a number of sources of additional advice including the British National Formulary, which is sent to all doctors and pharmacists.</p>
	<p pid=".1565W.2/3">The CSM's overview of alternative analgesic options was communicated though the Chief Medical Officer's public health link to all health care professionals, accompanying the communication on the withdrawal of co-proxamol and is available on the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's website (<a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>).

As part of the process of testing the robustness of the OBC, the Department questioned the overall value for money of the land transaction. This challenge resulted in a counter proposal being put forward, which involved Westminster city council undertaking land swaps with the private sector property developer, Paddington Development Corporation Ltd. This counter offer is currently being evaluated by the Paddington Health Campus project team. The result of this evaluation is scheduled to be with the Department by the middle of March.</p>

This is made up of 835 national health service in-patient beds and 88 private beds. This figure compares with an earlier estimate of 1,088 in-patient beds made in 2003. In the intervening time, the Paddington Health Campus has been subjected to a major review of the clinical needs. This review had a major focus on activity that could be redistributed into the community in line with recent NHS policy. It is a reflection on the success of that review, and the commitment of local primary care trusts to take on the activity, that bed numbers have reduced.</p>

	<p pid=".1570W.5/1">Funding for cancer services is included in primary care trust (PCT) baselines. It is for PCTs, in partnership with strategic health authorities and other local stakeholders, to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities. Their decisions need to be based on the specialised knowledge they have of the local community, this includes the need for treatment of prostate cancer in their area. 80 per cent., of funding is devolved to PCT level.</p>
	<p pid=".1570W.5/2">There are a number of initiatives under way to improve treatment of prostate cancers as set out in &quot;Making Progress on Prostate Cancer&quot;, published in November 2004. PCTs will need to take any funding implications of these initiatives into account. Copies of &quot;Making Progress on Prostate Cancer&quot; are available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".1573W.2/1">The United Kingdom is a signatory to several international conventions for the cross-border recovery of maintenance, including the recognition and enforcement of existing maintenance decisions made by courts in the UK. Trinidad and Tobago is not a signatory to any of these conventions.</p>
	<p pid=".1573W.2/2">The UK's arrangement with Trinidad and Tobago in this field is based on what is often referred to as the &quot;Commonwealth scheme&quot;, which dates back to 1920 and effectively operates on the basis that the judicial systems of Commonwealth countries are&mdash;in general&mdash;sufficiently similar to allow maintenance orders made in the courts of one jurisdiction to be registered and enforced in the courts of another jurisdiction. Since there is no treaty regulating these arrangements, however, there is no formal mechanism by which the authorities of the initiating jurisdiction can put pressure on the authorities of the receiving jurisdiction if things go wrong or if a lengthy delay occurs.</p>
	<p pid=".1573W.2/3">This particular application was to register and enforce an English maintenance order in Trinidad and Tobago, and the application was first made in February 2002. The Trinidad and Tobago authorities acknowledged the application in October 2002, and the Department has forwarded correspondence and sent follow-up letters and email reminders to the authorities in Trinidad and Tobago at approximately two-month intervals ever since.</p>
	<p pid=".1573W.2/4">The Trinidad and Tobago authorities have responded at various times with hearing dates that were subsequently adjourned, and&mdash;in June 2003&mdash;with news that the respondent had lodged an appeal against the English order being registered and enforced in Trinidad and Tobago. The last information received from the Trinidad and Tobago authorities was that a date was awaited for the matter to come before the Court of Appeal.</p>
	<p pid=".1573W.2/5">The Office of the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago is aware of our concern at the significant delays that have occurred in this case, but my Department is unable to intervene in the affairs of Trinidad and Tobago, nor to insist on a timeframe in which this matter should be resolved.</p>
	<p pid=".1573W.2/6">Officials in my Department do continue, however, to seek clarification from the Trinidad and Tobago authorities of the present state of the matter, and in particular the grounds of the respondent's appeal and whether a date has been set for the appeal hearing.</p>
	<p pid=".1573W.2/7">More generally, efforts are under way internationally to improve the system of dealing with cross-border maintenance claims. The UK is taking an active part in this work, and we would hope that as many countries as possible are able to join in the new treaty arrangements in this area, once they are established.</p>
	<p pid=".1573W.2/8">In the meantime, I shall be happy to write to the hon. Member with further details of my Department's efforts on behalf of his constituent.</p>

	<p pid=".1574W.6/2">The EU embargo on the sale of arms to China reflects a political commitment by member states. It sets a high common standard for all member states' assessment of applications to export all items on the EU Common Military List. All EU member states have incorporated the Code of Conduct into their export licensing procedures, according to their national laws. There is no common interpretation of this commitment among member states. In the UK, exporters are required to seek a licence before exporting controlled goods or technology. A licence will not be issued if approval would be inconsistent with, inter alia, the UK's interpretation of the China embargo. The UK's interpretation of the embargo was set out by the then Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the late Derek Fatchett, in a reply on <phrase class="date" code="1998-06-03">3 June 1998</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1998-06-03.240"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 240&ndash;41</phrase> to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/808" name="Vernon Coaker">my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker)</phrase>. The legal penalty under the Export Control Act 2002 for exporting controlled goods or technology without a licence may be imprisonment for up to 10 years. I am sending the information the right hon. Gentleman requested on penalties which apply in other member states and placing a copy in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".1575W.2/2">The EU Code of Conduct sets a high standard for all member states' assessment of applications to export all item on the EU Common Military List. All EU member states have incorporated the Code of Conduct into their export licensing procedures, according to their national laws. The list includes all the items listed in the question, although some helicopters and logistics management systems may be purely for civil use, and therefore not licensable. To ask what specific equipment the code 'forbids' is to misunderstand the way it functions. The code obliges member states to refuse to license the export of any item on the list if, inter alia, there is a clear risk that it might be used for internal repression, aggressively against another country, or to assert by force a territorial claim. There is also a provision in the code which provides for denial of export licences for equipment which may affect &quot;the national security of the UK, of territories whose external relations are the UK's responsibility, and of allies, EU member states and other friendly countries&quot;. The code applies to exports to China and all other countries, and has proved effective since its inception in 1998. It is the criteria in the Code of Conduct, rather than the Arms Embargo on China, which have formed the basis for the clear majority of the licence refusals made by EU member states in respect of China.</p>

We welcome Prime Minister Sharon's commitment in the Roadmap to freeze construction in settlements and to dismantle settlement outposts that are illegal even under Israeli law. We expect to see these commitments met. The Israeli Government are currently working on both mapping the outposts and investigating the legal framework for evacuating them. We are monitoring their work closely.</p>

	<p pid=".1583W.6/2">The Government regularly discusses export control and counter-proliferation issues with the Chinese Government. In January 2005 officials participated in an EU-China export controls seminar, and later this month a Chinese delegation will travel to the UK to continue this cooperation. These talks stress the importance of taking account of the use to which strategic exports are to be put in the country of final destination and the importance of refusing exports where there is a clear risk that they might be used for internal repression. The Government has not to date raised with China the specific shipment that the right hon. and learned Gentleman refers to. But the Government would not approve export of goods which might be used for internal repression or external aggression, or where we were concerned that equipment would be re-exported and used for these purposes. We have serious concerns about the export of arms to Zimbabwe, a country with a track record of armed internal repression. It is also a further indictment of the skewed priorities of the Mugabe regime if they believe arms purchases of this kind matter more than relieving the woeful humanitarian situation.</p>

	<p pid=".1584W.0/4" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> the scheme then calculates how much this would be if the scheme had been funded to the level of the statutory minimum funding requirement;</p>

	<p pid=".1584W.0/6">In order to take advantage of the Deemed Buyback process, the full amount of scheme rights that are actually available in respect of the member held by the scheme must be paid over to the Inland Revenue before the member is restored into State Earnings Related Pension Scheme/State Second Pension. This includes voluntary contributions which are held by the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1584W.0/7">The full amount of cash in the scheme should be paid to the Inland Revenue because Deemed Buyback works by giving a member more SERPS than the payment represents. It would not be appropriate for a scheme member to keep some of the funds held in the scheme and thus give them a larger subsidy than needed at the expense of the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid=".1584W.0/8">Alternatively, as Deemed Buyback is one of a number of options available to a member for securing their accrued rights, they may decide it is in their best interest to keep their voluntary contributions and scheme rights and, for example, use them to secure an annuity.</p>

	<p pid=".1586W.0/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid=".1586W.0/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many risk mitigation plans the Child Support Agency has prepared in each of the last four years.</p>
	<p pid=".1586W.0/6" class="indent">The Child Support Agency's approach to risk management supports that recommended by the Department for Work and Pensions. This has entailed building the systematic consideration and management of risks into existing core business functions whilst managing risks at all levels within the business. To this end both the volume and content of the mitigation plans held within the Agency remain fluid. Plans are subject to regular review and updating as the business changes and risks are identified, managed or eventually closed. The Agency's high level risk process are referred to within both our externally published Business Plan and our Annual Report and Accounts. Agency high level risks are monitored/reviewed monthly through the Agency's Business Information Bulletin. We will arrange for the Agency's Business Information Bulletins to be made available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".1586W.3/1">We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.</p>
	<p pid=".1586W.3/2">Since 2001, the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Coventry, South will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly, families with severely disabled 3 and 4-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, while older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".1586W.3/3">In 2002&ndash;03 we estimate there were around 10 million adults (22 per cent.) and 0.7 million children (5 per cent.) in Great Britain likely to be covered by the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).</p>
	<p pid=".1586W.3/4">The figures can be broken down to regional level which shows that 21 per cent. of adults and 6 per cent. of children in the West Midlands region are likely to be covered by the provisions of the DDA.</p>
	<p pid=".1586W.3/5">Information on the numbers of customers in Coventry, South who are in receipt of disability living allowance (DLA) and attendance allowance (AA) is in the table.</p>

	<p pid=".1586W.3/20">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.5 million; in Coventry, South, the proportion in employment has risen to 68.4 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1586W.3/21">Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.2 million people have been helped into work by the new deals, with 1,970 in Coventry, South alone.</p>
	<p pid=".1586W.3/22">Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures (for 2002&ndash;03) show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&ndash;97. Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18-years-old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 2,400 families in Coventry, South.</p>
	<p pid=".1586W.3/23">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners. The Government will be spending nearly &pound;10 billion more in 2004&ndash;05 (in 2004&ndash;05 prices) on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997, with around half going to the poorest third.</p>
	<p pid=".1586W.3/24">Our reforms include the State second pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. Pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, those over aged 65 and over may be rewarded for savings and income. As of December 2004, around 4,690 pensioners in Coventry, South are receiving pension credit, with an average award of &pound;44.55 per week.</p>
	<p pid=".1586W.3/25">We know that older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2004&ndash;05) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 to those with someone aged 80 or over to help with their fuel bills. Additionally, for this year, eligible households with someone aged 70 or over will receive the one-off 70+ payment of &pound;100 to help with living expenses including council tax bills. It is paid with the winter fuel payment.</p>
	<p pid=".1586W.3/26">The constituency data on winter fuel payments and the additional 80+ annual payment is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".1586W.3/27">Since 1997 single pensioners and pensioner couples have seen a real terms increase in their basic state pension of 7 per cent. and 8 per cent., respectively. Some 16.1 thousand pensioners in Coventry, South have benefited from this increase.</p>

	<p pid=".1591W.2/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is continuously reviewing arrangements for service delivery in order to ensure that we provide value for money and take account of the new ways customers access our services. The need for face-to-face facilities for jobsearch and other aspects of our business has been superseded in many instances by new business processes and the use of information technology. For example, over the last 12 months we have seen an increase of over 40 per cent. in the number of hits on our jobsearch website. Encouraging our customers to use these new channels enables us to focus on those customers who need greatest help, through the intervention of personal advisers.</p>
	<p pid=".1591W.2/6" class="indent">It would be inappropriate to speculate on any future review of delivery sites. However, I can assure you that should local managers determine that changes are required to local service delivery arrangements then local stakeholders would be fully consulted before any changes take place.</p>

The Scottish Refugee Council works to bring asylum seekers, refugees and local people together to improve their communities and this work has been commended in an independent report by the Scottish Centre for Research on Social Justice entitled &quot;Building Bridges: Local Responses to the Resettlement of Asylum Seekers in Glasgow&quot;. I would commend its contents to him. I would like to mention as well, the work undertaken by Glasgow city council since 2000 and I very much hope the partnership between MASS and the council will continue. Partnership working to provide an effective system of support for asylum seekers is essential, not only for asylum seekers but also to ensure continued community cohesion.</p>

	<p pid=".1597W.3/2">As we made clear in our five year strategy for asylum and immigration 'Controlling our borders: Making migration work for Britain' (Cm 6472), our approach to the prevention of the communication of diseases through migration is based on expert advice on protecting the nation's health. We will accordingly target health screening for tuberculosis in high-risk areas at the entry clearance stage; those who are diagnosed with it would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".1597W.3/3">HIV, unlike tuberculosis, is not airborne, so the public health issues it raises are different. However, the case for extending routine health checks to diseases other than tuberculosis is kept under review.</p>

	<p pid=".1600W.0/1">The available information is given in the tables. Tables 1 and 2 give the number of offences recorded by the police in the Essex police force area and the Southend Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) area. Recorded crime data is published on a financial year basis and data at CDRP level is only available for six key offences for 1999&ndash;2000 and 2000&ndash;01 but for all offences from 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid=".1600W.0/2">Tables 3 and 4 give the number of defendants proceeded against and found guilty in the Essex police force area and South East Essex petty sessional area. Court proceedings data is published on a calendar year basis. Data for 2004 will not be available until the autumn.</p>
	<p pid=".1600W.0/3">Because recorded crime deals with offences and court proceedings deals with defendants, the two data sets are not directly comparable.</p>

	<p pid=".1606W.11/3">The Metropolitan Police Service (MRS) will receive &pound;1,927.8 million in general grants for 2005&ndash;06, an increase of 5.81 per cent. (&pound;105.8 million) over 2004&ndash;05. The MPS also gains around &pound;4.2 million from the Amending Report for 2003&ndash;04, bringing the overall increase to 6.04 per cent. General grants funding to the MPS has increased by 28 per cent. between 1997&ndash;98 and 2005&ndash;06. In addition to general grants, the MPS will also receive around &pound;207 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives and capital provision in 2005&ndash;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the Police Authority and the chief constable.</p>
	<p pid=".1606W.11/4">As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area has had a local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".1606W.11/5">The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a pioneering Government intervention programme which ran for three years from April 1999 in England and Wales and took an evidence-based approach to crime reduction. Grants of over &pound;340 million were allocated to over 1,470 projects, including CCTV, under 20 initiatives that formed part of the programme. Five CCTV projects in the Croydon CDRP area received a total of &pound;964,986 from the CRP.</p>
	<p pid=".1606W.11/6">Since 2001, successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in England and Wales. These initiatives include Communities Against Drugs, the Safer Communities Initiative, the Small Retailers in Deprived Areas scheme and the Building Safer Communities Fund. Since 2001, a total of &pound;2.16 million has been allocated to Croydon CDRP under these initiatives. A further &pound;2.5 million has been provided over the two years 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 to the Home Office Regional Director in London for CDRP capacity building across the region.</p>
	<p pid=".1606W.11/7">It is estimated that out of a million active offenders, 100,000 have three or more convictions and are responsible for half of all crime. There is a Prolific and other Priority Offenders (PPO) scheme in Croydon set up to target those offenders who cause a disproportionate amount of crime, disorder and antisocial behaviour in the community.</p>
	<p pid=".1606W.11/8">The Government's Crime Reduction Website provides further information on the work being done to reduce crime across the country, including information about action and results in local areas. It is available at <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1606W.11/9">New legislation has given local agencies a raft of powers, from antisocial behaviour orders to local dispersal orders and crack house closure powers, to work with local people to tackle antisocial behaviour and nuisance. In Croydon a total of 27 antisocial behaviour orders have been issued as of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-01">1 March 2005</phrase>. Local contacts for tackling antisocial behaviour can be found on <a href="http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp">http://www.together.gov.uk/authority.asp</a></p>
	<p pid=".1606W.11/10">Tackling Drug Misuse is a priority of this Government and its policy is set out in the 10 year National Drug Strategy launched in 1998 and updated in December 2002. (A copy of the Updated Drug Strategy 2002 is held in the Library.) Under this, the Government has invested substantially in measures to reduce the harms caused by illegal drugs, focusing on the four strands of:</p>
	<p pid=".1606W.11/11" class="indent">reducing the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid=".1606W.11/12" class="indent">preventing young people from becoming problematic drug users;</p>
	<p pid=".1606W.11/13" class="indent">providing effective treatment to all who need it; and</p>
	<p pid=".1606W.11/14" class="indent">reducing drug-related crime.</p>
	<p pid=".1606W.11/15">Direct annual funding nationally to tackle drug misuse amounted to &pound;1,244 million in 2003&ndash;04, rising to &pound;1,344 million in 2004&ndash;05. Croydon has seen a significant increase in direct funding for tackling drugs, in particular for drug treatment services and the throughcare and aftercare elements of the Drug Interventions Programme. In 2003&ndash;04 the allocation for Croydon Drug Action Team amounted to &pound;2.11 million, rising to &pound;3.44 million in 2004&ndash;05. Details of action taken to tackle drugs in the Croydon central constituency can be obtained from the Croydon Drugs Action Team, for contact details see <a href="http://www.drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams">http://www. drugs.gov.uk/Links/DrugActionTeams</a></p>
	<p pid=".1606W.11/16">The Government is working to ensure that citizens, communities and the voluntary sector are more fully engaged in tackling social problems, and there is more equality of opportunity and respect for people of all races and religions. Active community participation in England has increased by 1.5 million people between 2001 and 2003. Charities have been supported more effectively, and &pound;125 million is being invested across the country through the futurebuilders fund in voluntary and community organisations that help provide valuable public services. Advice on ways to engage local people in helping their communities is available on the Active Citizenship Centre website <a href="http://www.active-citizen.org.uk">http://www.active-citizen.org.uk</a></p>
	<p pid=".1606W.11/17">This year, 2005, is the year of the Volunteer which is being delivered by the Home Office in partnership with Community Service Volunteers and Volunteering England. This will include a whole range of events in local communities across the country that aim to celebrate the contribution which volunteers make to the quality of people's lives, and encourage more people to volunteer.

	<p pid=".1609W.0/1">The Government have put in place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the Haltemprice and Howden constituency, as well as for all parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".1609W.0/2">For example, between March 1997 and March 2004, the number of police officers in the Humberside police force increased by 186 from 2,045 to 2,231. Following the Government's introduction of Community Support Officers (CSOs) in 2002, Humberside is in the process of recruiting 22 CSOs to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour on Humberside streets. Between 1997 and 2003&ndash;04, Humberside has seen a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 27 per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 18 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1609W.0/3">Humberside Police Force will receive &pound;118.9 million in general grants for 2005&ndash;06, an increase of 3.75 per cent. (&pound;4.3 million) over 2004&ndash;05. Humberside benefits from the decision to provide a funding floor of 3.75 per cent. If the funding formula had been strictly applied, the Force would have received &pound;0.7 million less. Humberside also gains around &pound;0.2 million from the Amending Report for 2003&ndash;04, bringing the overall increase to 3.95 per cent. General grants funding to Humberside has increased by 27 per cent. between 1997&ndash;98 and 2005&ndash;06. In addition to general grants, Humberside will also receive around &pound;8 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives and capital provision in 2005&ndash;06.

These links are focused on sectors that have significant labour shortages nationally and regionally, such as construction, catering, industrial cleaning, utilities, sports and fitness, driving and distribution. Opportunities are also being explored in horticulture and information communication technology. These sectors were identified following consultation with the Confederation of British Industry, Jobcentre Plus and Sector Skills Council.</p>
	<p pid=".1615W.0/2">The Prison Service is taking the lead on a cross Government work programme for engaging with employers which has been agreed by the Employment, Training and Education Sub-Board of the Reducing Re-offending Programme Board. This work programme includes officials from the National Offender Management Service (NOMS), the Probation Service, Jobcentre Plus, the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and the Learning and Skills Council. National and local employers will be invited to be involved as the work programme develops. Its aim is to build on existing work to encourage employers to contribute to the training of offenders and to commit to the recruitment of those who achieve an agreed level of skills.</p>
	<p pid=".1615W.0/3">At a local level, employer links are being developed and maintained through the Heads of Learning and Skills and Resettlement Managers in establishments. They work closely with Jobcentre Plus, Learning and Skills Councils and voluntary organisations to involve employers in work and training programmes for prisoners and to encourage them to recruit prisoners on their release. From April 2005 the Learning and Skills Councils will assume responsibility for the skills training of all offenders, and will be seeking to meet local labour market needs. This will increase opportunities for linking with employers at a local level.</p>
	<p pid=".1615W.0/4">The Prison Service is currently developing an employer database, holding information on employers who are willing and able to offer work to ex-offenders. This will enable prison to access information about employment opportunities in their local area, and also nationally to assist prisoners who are held at establishments outside their home areas.</p>

	<p pid=".1615W.3/1">Activities being undertaken by arts organisations in prisons and the community are well documented for all key stakeholders in the Directory of Arts Activities in Prisons, which has been produced annually by the Unit for Arts and Offenders with financial support from the Department for Education and Skills. The Unit also produces a regular e-mail newsletter for arts organisations working with offenders, hosts a Forum for Arts and Offenders and provides training to artists wanting to work with prisoners. The Unit for Arts and Offenders will be members of the newly formed National Offender Management Service (NOMS) Voluntary and Community Sector Advisory Group.</p>
	<p pid=".1615W.3/2">Arts for offenders are supported through the curriculum in prisons and through financial support provided centrally to several national arts organisations to actively promote arts activities in prisons. Most prisons now have a Head of Learning and Skills, funded by the Department for Education and Skills, and they will determine the part that arts activities and arts organisations can play within the establishment. At a major prison Arts conference last year to celebrate and promote arts activities for offenders, a guide was launched for Heads of Learning and Skills and Managers in the Voluntary Sectors on provision of voluntary sector activities in prisons. This includes a consistent and joint approach to joint working on setting up, monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of provision.</p>

	<p pid=".1619W.5/1">The Government are doing a great deal to ensure that offenders with mental health problems are not sent to prison inappropriately. The operation of court diversion schemes and the development of wider sentencing options, coupled with the further development of other mental health services, are closing gaps in community care and reducing the number of such offenders who reach the courts.</p>
	<p pid=".1619W.5/2">Mental health services within prisons are improving significantly as a result of new investment that has been put into the development of NHS mental health in-reach services. The NHS Plan (2000) commitments for 2004 have been successfully met. No prisoner with a serious mental illness now leaves prison without a care plan, and 300 additional staff have been employed. NHS mental health in-reach investment will reach &pound;20 million a year by 2005&ndash;06 so that in-reach type services are available to every prison in England and Wales, currently 94 in-reach teams are in operation.</p>
	<p pid=".1619W.5/3">There is a firm commitment to ensure that people who are too ill to remain in prison are transferred to hospital. Tighter regular monitoring has been introduced to identify prisoners who have been waiting unacceptably long periods for transfer to hospital. A protocol has been issued setting out what must be done when a prisoner has been waiting for a hospital place for more than three months following acceptance by the NHS. Both have brought about an improvement. 721 prisoners were transferred to hospital in 2003, an increase of 12 per cent. on the 2002 figure of 644. The Prison Service, the joint Prison Health team, the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIHME), and the commissioners and providers of NHS hospital services are working together to establish a national waiting time limit for transfers between custodial settings and hospitals.</p>
	<p pid=".1619W.5/4">The Mental Health Bill includes provisions to enable more flexible use to be made of mental health services for offenders. Community disposals are permitted for offenders who can safely be treated without detention and secure beds are released for those who need them. Public protection has also been improved by the development of assessment and treatment services for dangerous offenders with severe personality disorders.</p>

In 2004, the Government issued a consultation paper on fraud law reform. Under the Government's proposals, this behaviour would constitute a fraud by false representation. The Government plans to take forward these proposals when parliamentary time permits.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-03-07.218791.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-03-07.1624W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/917" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="1624W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050307/text/50307w34.htm#50307w34.html_spnew4">
	<p pid=".1624W.2/1">British Crime Survey figures&mdash;the most reliable long-term indicator of underlying trends in violence&mdash;indicate that the level of violent crime has fallen by 36 per cent. since 1995, when there was a peak of over 4 million violent incidents, and by 26 per cent. since 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".1624W.2/2">The Government have taken action to ensure better policing and better prevention and protection against crime. At the end of August 2004, there were nearly 140,000 police officers in service, an all-time record. The Street Crime Initiative, launched in 2002 in 10 police force areas to tackle robbery, secured a 17 per cent. reduction in robberies in those areas in the first year. The levels of robbery have continued to fall, with the number of recorded robberies in the year to September 2004 down by 18 per cent. compared to the previous 12 month period.</p>
	<p pid=".1624W.2/3">Nevertheless, the Government continue to take the issue of violent crime and the impact it has on people's lives very seriously. That is why we have introduced a number of measures to tackle violent crime, and will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".1624W.2/4">Almost half of all violent crime is alcohol-related and the Home Office, jointly with the Department of Health, are tackling this through the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy which was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-15">15 March 2004</phrase>. There have since been two Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaigns led by the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers, the first in 92 police areas in the summer of 2004 and the second in 180 police areas during the Christmas and new year period.</p>
	<p pid=".1624W.2/5">The two campaigns focused on tackling violent and disorderly behaviour by drunken troublemakers and the illegal sale and consumption of alcohol by under-18s. During the most recent campaign, the police and their partners visited over 31,000 licensed premises, carried out &quot;sting&quot; operations in nearly 1,000 of these, issued over 4,000 fixed penalty notices for alcohol-related offences, made over 6,000 arrests and confiscated alcohol from over 2,800 adults and juveniles. Further campaigns of this kind will be held.</p>
	<p pid=".1624W.2/6">We are also running the Tackling Violent Crime Programme in six police force areas. This programme aims to help local areas reduce violent crime and improve local partnership working.</p>
	<p pid=".1624W.2/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-21">21 January</phrase> we published a number of proposals in a consultation document, &quot;Drinking Responsibly&quot;. These include the introduction of:</p>
	<p pid=".1624W.2/8" class="indent">&quot;Alcohol Disorder Zones&quot;, with costs recovered from the pubs and bars which cause the most disorder;</p>
	<p pid=".1624W.2/9" class="indent">an immediate 24-hour banning order on the sale of alcohol for premises found to be persistently selling alcohol to underage drinkers; and</p>
	<p pid=".1624W.2/10" class="indent">&quot;Drinking Banning Orders&quot; for persons issued with three fixed penalty notices or three alcohol or disorder-related convictions, excluding them from pubs and bars within a specified period for a fixed period of time.</p>
	<p pid=".1624W.2/11">We are also taking action against other types of violent crime. The fight against domestic violence will be reinforced in July 2005 when the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 takes effect. Courts will have greater powers to protect victims of domestic violence against further harassment by being able to issue restraining orders, even when a defendant has not been convicted.</p>
	<p pid=".1624W.2/12">Finally, we recognise the damaging impact of hate crime on community cohesion and public perceptions of safety. We have introduced proposals to make incitement to religious hatred a criminal offence under the Serious and Organised Crime and Police Bill.</p>

	<p pid=".1626W.2/1">Most young people who are sentenced to custody receive a detention and training order (DTO). The DTO is a two-part sentence, the first half spent in custody and the second in the community. The intention is to work with the young people during their time in custody to tackle their offending behaviour and to prepare them for life after release. The second (community) part of the order seeks to build on what has been begun, particularly by providing educational, training or employment opportunities. Youth offending teams (YOTs) are involved in both parts of the order and are responsible for putting in place the interventions during the community part.</p>
	<p pid=".1626W.2/2">The Youth Justice Board (YJB) is working to enhance community interventions and to strengthen continuity between the two parts of the order. Young people who receive custodial sentences tend to be those with a high risk of reoffending, but the integrated approach embodied in the DTO seeks to give them the best chance of turning away from offending and making a positive contribution to the community.</p>

	<p pid=".1626W.5/1">The Youth Justice Board (YJB) oversees the operation of the youth justice system, including ensuring that Youth Offending Teams (YOTs) understand their role and how best to carry it out. It has established a performance management framework, designed to ensure local services work together to prevent children and young people from offending in the first place and to reduce the risk of further re-offending by existing offenders. It has introduced effective practice principles based on research evidence of what works in reducing offending and this is being rolled out across England and Wales. This is being supported and underpinned by the development of a National Qualification Justice professionals. The YJB is committed to ensuring that 80 per cent. of the youth justice workforce has benefited from professional training by March 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".1626W.5/2">The YJB has also been working worked closely with the antisocial behaviour unit in the Home Office to ensure that YOTS along with their local authority partners and the police put in place targeted prevention programmes aimed at diverting children and young people from antisocial and sub criminal activity. The YJB has developed guidance for YOTS for dealing with antisocial behaviour issues, which is due to be published shortly. Also the forthcoming draft Youth Justice Bill proposes to clarify the YOTS' role in supporting Antisocial behaviour initiatives.</p>
