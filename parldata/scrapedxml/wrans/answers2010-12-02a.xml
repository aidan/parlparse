These products contain active substances that are still being reviewed under the BPD for their potential future inclusion in annex I. Once these reviews are completed, individual products will be assessed and authorised; however, whilst the reviews are taking place the products can continue to be placed onto the market without the need for an authorisation under the directive.

The main tranche of active substances required to be withdrawn under the BPD had to be taken off the market by <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-01">1 September 2006</phrase>, though since then a number of other active substances have been subject to non-inclusion decisions where companies have failed to support them. The latest of these was voted on in February 2010, and requires 14 substance/product type combinations to be taken off the market by <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-01">1 November 2011</phrase>.</p>

The health care professionals who carry out the assessments are trained to take account of fluctuating conditions.</p>

In addition, Professor Harrington published an independent review of the WCA on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-23">23 November 2010</phrase>, and the Government have accepted his recommendations to make the assessment process more empathetic and less mechanistic. The next independent review, which is also being led by Professor Harrington, will look specifically at further improvements to the assessment in relation to fluctuating conditions.</p>

	<p pid="a.943W.2/1">The Work Programme will be a black-box, outcome funded programme rewarding delivery partners from the benefit savings generated. Payments to delivery partners will be made for moving customers into work and keeping customers in work. As we will be paying by results after they have occurred, from the savings generated, the cost to the public purse will be driven by the level of performance achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.943W.2/2">At this time we are in competitive tendering process for the Work Programme. We expect organisations bidding for the Work Programme to state in their bids the level of performance they expect to achieve and compete on the price they require. This will enable us to let contracts on the most advantageous economic terms. Until this process is complete indicating Government expectations of Work Programme performance and so cost would prejudice our ability to generate optimum value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="a.947W.2/1">Prior to November 2008 lone parents could claim Income Support until their youngest child reached 16. This age has been progressively reduced, and currently lone parents with a youngest child aged seven and over wishing to claim benefit have to claim jobseeker's allowance if they are capable of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.947W.2/2">Lone parents who are in receipt of income support and are full-time students or undertaking a full-time course on the new deal for lone parents programme (or as part of an approved scheme) prior to the change can remain entitled to income support until they finish their course or their youngest child reaches the relevant age in force at the time they started the course, whichever happens first.</p>
	<p pid="a.947W.2/3">Lone parents who decide to undertake a full-time course after the income support entitlement change came into force will not be able to claim jobseeker's allowance but may be able to access support from the educational maintenance system which, unlike the social security system, is designed for their needs. Lone parents studying part-time can claim jobseeker's allowance but need to demonstrate they are available for and actively seeking work.</p>

	<p pid="a.957W.10/1">None. The World Trade Organisation's (WTO) Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement only allows controls on food safety, plant and animal health grounds. While we are totally committed to improving animal welfare standards the situation is that unanimous agreement of the WTO's membership would be needed to change this to include production standards such as those relating to animal welfare. Such agreement is unlikely to be forthcoming because many of the WTO's members would regard such standards as likely to facilitate protectionism rather than trade.</p>

The Animal Welfare Act 2006 already makes it an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to any animal and to treat an animal in a way that fails to meet its welfare needs. It also provides additional powers to prohibit the use of any such equipment through secondary legislation if considered necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.961W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-18">18 March 2010</phrase>, DEFRA launched a consultation seeking views on the most effective combination of policies to ensure that England reduces the amount of biodegradable waste sent to landfill and meets its EU landfill diversion targets. As part of the consultation, DEFRA asked for views on the future of the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme (LATS).</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.2/2">The vast majority of respondents considered that the scheme had been an important driver in diverting waste from landfill. The Government announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-08">8 September</phrase> that the UK will meet the 2010 landfill directive target, and the scheme has played an important role in delivering that outcome. However, the majority of respondents thought that the landfill tax was now a greater driver. There was a range of views about the future of LATS, with a number of respondents considering that LATS should be abandoned immediately, others wanting this to happen after the 2013 target year and others wanting LATS to be retained till 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.961W.2/3">DEFRA is assessing policy options in the context of the Government's current wider review of waste policies, taking these views into account. We do not have a recent assessment of the administrative cost to local authorities of the LATS. However, a primary goal of the policy assessment is to achieve a set of policies delivering the required reduction in the amount of waste sent to landfill without placing unnecessary burdens on those involved, including local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.962W.5/1">I have received many letters on this subject from MPs and individual farmers recently. The UK Government remains entirely committed to the conventional cage ban coming into force on <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-01">1 January 2012</phrase> and to supporting industry throughout the transition. DEFRA officials are continuing to work with the European Commission and industry to ensure that everything is done to protect UK producers who have already made significant investment to comply with the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.5/2">The UK has suggested the introduction of a Code '4' for eggs produced by hens housed in enriched systems with the Commission, to ensure they can be distinguished from those housed in conventional cages after the ban is introduced. However, the Commission has made it clear that it views the introduction of an additional Code as confusing to consumers. It is not an option it is willing to consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.962W.5/3">We have therefore, along with some member states, asked the Commission to provide sufficient enforcement controls across the European Union. This will help protect compliant producers and ensure that they are not disadvantaged if there was any delay to the ban, or any member states fail to meet the 2012 deadline. One way of achieving this might be an intra-community ban on the trade in eggs produced by hens still housed in conventional cages after <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-01">1 January 2012</phrase>. In practice this would mean that such eggs may only be sold in the member state of production for a limited period only.</p>

	<p pid="a.964W.5/1">During such discussions, the UK advised the Council that it favoured providing a mandate that would have obliged the Commission to seek a significant reduction in the level of total allowable catch (TAC). This did not prove to be possible, as member states with fishing possibilities opposed this, and pressed for a mandate that would have sought retention of the TAC at last year's levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.964W.5/2">Following extensive negotiations, a presidency compromise was adopted, which sought to achieve a level of TAC that would provide between 60 and 77% probability of achieving maximum sustainable yields by 2022. The UK abstained, because opposing would have meant that the EU had no mandate to negotiate on bluefin tuna, and this could have resulted in contracting parties seeking an increase to the TAC, which would have made the situation worse.</p>

	<p pid="a.966W.2/1">The policy on the use of all pesticide products is that they are authorised only if they can be used without unacceptable risk to human health and the environment. Aminopyralid and clopyralid products are used for the control of weeds in crops, turf and pasture land.</p>
	<p pid="a.966W.2/2">The persistence of aminopyralid and clopyralid herbicides in manure from livestock which feed on pasture land treated with these is considered as part of the risk assessment in the authorisation process. Conditions are imposed on the way the products can be used to minimise manure containing residues of these pesticides being used to cultivate susceptible crops.</p>
	<p pid="a.966W.2/3">Following incidents of crop damage attributed to manure containing residues of aminopyralid in spring 2008, authorisations for this herbicide were suspended. Some users had not complied with conditions of use designed to prevent the use of manure containing aminopyralid.</p>
	<p pid="a.966W.2/4">The Advisory Committee on Pesticides considered this issue at a number of meetings in 2008 and 2009. At its September 2009 meeting it recommended that authorisations be granted to new aminopyralid products. This was subject to additional conditions on the way products could be used and the authorisation holder continuing with a stewardship campaign to highlight the risk of treating susceptible crops.</p>
	<p pid="a.966W.2/5">There are still reports of damage to crops but these have reduced in number this year and relate to aminopyralid use before the new conditions were imposed. Reports of damage to crops from the use of clopyralid occur infrequently. A recent review identified the need to further improve the labelling of some products and this is being done.</p>

The UK operates a single generic Youth Mobility Scheme (YMS) to enhance cultural exchanges between young people.

The only exception to this is where a medical practitioner believes a detainee's health is likely to be injuriously affected by continued detention.

	<p pid="a.978W.8/1">When estimating changes to marginal deduction rates, it is reform to the tax and benefit system as a whole that is important to households, rather than certain subsets of the system. Annex A of the June Budget sets out estimates of the numbers of families subject to varying marginal deduction rates in 2010-11, and in 2011-12 following the implementation of planned measures included in the March Budget (e.g. the increase in national insurance rates of 1%), and the June 2010 Budget (e.g. the increase of 2% in the taper rate of tax credits).</p>
	<p pid="a.978W.8/2">At spending review, the Government announced the new universal credit, introduced over two Parliaments, which will replace the current complex system of means-tested working-age benefits with a simple streamlined payment. The universal credit will improve financial work incentives by ensuring that support is reduced at a consistent and managed marginal deduction rate (generally at no more than around 76 pence in the pound as compared with 96 pence currently) as people return to work and increase their working hours and earnings.</p>

	<p pid="a.981W.5/2">It is difficult to give a precise answer to this question as the CFC inquiry is often part of a wider investigation and a settlement of a CFC dispute may have been included in an overall settlement figure. There is also a danger that providing the information in the format requested could lead to the identification of specific taxpayers. Our best estimate of the total yield and the number of settlements falling within the following bands are:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.981W.5/5"> <td></td> <td><i> 2007-08</i></td> <td><i> 2008-09</i></td> <td><i> 2009-10</i></td> </tr>

			<tr pid="a.981W.5/8"> <td>Number settlements yield &gt; &#163;10 million</td> <td>4</td> <td>3</td> <td>6</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.981W.5/11">The total recorded yield from all the identified CFC settlements in the last three financial years (2007-08 to 2009-10), is &#163;719,446,086.</p>
	<p pid="a.981W.5/12">The amount of tax at risk in respect of any UK company with a holding in a CFC depends on the facts and until an inquiry is completed cannot be more than an estimate. As the facts are established during the course of an inquiry, the tax at risk in any case fluctuates as the inquiry proceeds. Consequently it is not possible to provide an answer to this question.</p>
	<p pid="a.981W.5/13">In every case where a CFC inquiry has been settled in each of the last three financial years, the CFC rules have been applied in full to establish the extent of any liability, or in some cases that there is no liability.</p>

	<p pid="a.983W.8/19">These estimates provided here have been calculated from HM Treasury's tax and benefit static micro-simulation model using Expenditure and Food Survey 2005 to 2008 data uprated to 2011-12 levels of prices and earnings. The model does not take into account behavioural changes in response to changes to the tax and benefit system or economic conditions and so there is significant uncertainty around the true impact of the value added tax change on retired households.</p>

	<p pid="a.993W.2/1">The Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) had implications for the entire Defence Estate. Changes to the Royal Air Force force structure mean that RAF Kinloss and two other bases will not be required by the RAF; re-basing of forces in Germany is being accelerated; and greater efficiencies need to be made through estate rationalisation. The Ministry of Defence is now addressing the full range of defence estate issues involved so as to identify and subsequently deliver a long term cost effective solution for defence basing and the estate as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.993W.2/2">This is inevitably a complex piece of work going beyond the bases directly affected by the SDSR. No decisions have yet been made, including on the potential future use of those bases affected, and we do not expect to be in a position to make those decisions until spring 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.993W.8/1">A breakdown of Defence Medical Services (DMS) reserve medical personnel manning levels are provided in the following tables. While shortfalls exist in some specialties the DMS continue to meet all operational requirements placed on them. Medical support to deployed operations is absolutely vital and there is no question of British forces deploying on military operations without the appropriate medical support.</p>
	<p pid="a.993W.8/2">The reserve forces play a vital role in both overseas operations and in the defence of the UK. Their primary role is to provide additional capability, particularly when our regular forces are operating at maximum effort. The reserve forces are an integral part of the UK's military capability for a wide variety of different types of operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.993W.8/3">The total number of reserve personnel required by the DMS is neither calculated nor held by rank; therefore shortfall is shown by specialty only, as at <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-01">1 June 2010</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.996W.6/1">The question has been interpreted to refer to the required number (&quot;establishment&quot;) and the actual number (&quot;strength&quot;) of personnel in the Infantry battalions. The figures provided are peacetime establishment numbers but it should be noted that a battalion deploying on operations will be augmented by further Infantry and specialist personnel, as required, to ensure that it has the strength required for its operational role. Such adjustments are not included in the table because of their temporary nature.</p>

They do not include Infantry-trained personnel in other posts-for instance, those serving in higher headquarters, in Ministry of Defence Centre, in Defence Equipment and Support, or in other non-Regimental posts. The strength numbers will fluctuate up and down on a daily basis as, for example, personnel move from training into the battalions or as personnel complete their service and leave.</p>

	<p pid="a.1003W.2/1">The Coalition Government are committed to improving the quality of careers advice for students making decisions about education and training. We will establish an all-age careers service in England from April 2012. Careers advisers in the service will have access to clear information about higher education courses and sources of funding. We are also working with the Careers Profession Alliance to ensure that careers advisers have the up to date knowledge and skills they need to advise on career prospects, including for STEM subjects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.2/2">Schools will be under a legal duty to secure independent, impartial licensed careers guidance for their students, either from the all-age careers service or from the open market. Higher Education Institutions will continue to provide careers guidance for their students through in-house arrangements. But we will encourage use of the all-age service, and that its quality standards should be widely applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003W.2/3">Improving information for prospective students is also a key part of our future plans for higher education. The Higher Education Funding Council for England is consulting on proposals that higher education institutions should publish, from September 2012, a standard set of 16 key information items, for each course, on their websites. The information is based on what research shows that students want: information about costs, previous student satisfaction, employment outcomes and number of contact hours.</p>

For 2003-04 to 2008-09 the figures are prepared under UK GAAP and the finance costs (interest) associated with the PR schemes are not separately identifiable.

	<p pid="a.1016W.6/1">This is a matter for the Charity Commission. I have, therefore, asked the chief executive of the Commission to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Sam Young, dated <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-30">30 November 2010</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.6/3" class="indent">As the Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, I have been asked to respond to your written Parliamentary Questions on whether any students' unions were not registered as charities in the latest period for which figures are available, and which students' unions are registered as charities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.6/4" class="indent">As you may know, the Charities Act 2006 aimed to ensure that all organisations with charitable status are subject to the same accountability requirements. This entails some changes to the way that &quot;exempt charities&quot; will be regulated. Exempt charities for which no suitable principal regulator can be identified will lose their exempt status and become excepted. This means they will fall fully within the supervision of the Charity Commission, but initially only those charities with an annual income of over &#163;100,000 will have to register. Students' unions which are capable of being charitable fall within this category.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.6/5" class="indent">This part of the Charities Act 2006 came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-01">1 June 2010</phrase>. There is a large volume of work involved for all concerned and we recognise that it is not practical for all the charities affected to register immediately. We have worked with the National Union of Students to produce a model governing document for students' unions, which helps to simplify and streamline the registration process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.6/6" class="indent">In answer to your first question on whether any students' unions were not registered as charities in the latest period for which figures are available, I should be clear that we have not refused any applications for charitable registrations from students' unions. However there will be some unions which are not required to register with us, and others which are not yet ready to apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016W.6/7" class="indent">In answer to your second question on which students' unions are registered as charities, since <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-01">1 June 2010</phrase> we have registered 24 students' unions, as follows:</p>

	<p pid="a.1018W.5/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics' (ONS) preferred source of statistics for public sector employment is the Quarterly Public Sector Employment Survey (QPSES) and external sources, however, figures from this source are not available for local authority and parliamentary constituencies.</p>

Individuals in the APS are classified to the public or private sector according to their responses to the survey. Consequently, the classification of an individual's sector may differ from how they would be classified in QPSES statistics. Therefore the estimates for the North East, England, London and the South East are not consistent with those published in the Public Sector Employment Statistical Bulletin, but are consistent with the estimates for North Tyneside.</p>

	<p pid="a.1021W.8/4" class="indent">The ONS produces annual estimates of the resident population of England and Wales by local authority, as at <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-30">30 June</phrase> each year. The latest available estimate of the resident population of the London Borough of Newham is for mid-2009 and is 241,200 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021W.8/5" class="indent">The resident population is defined by the standard United Nations definition for population estimates, and includes people who reside in an area for a period of at least 12 months whatever their nationality. The number of long-term international migrants (people who move into or out of the UK for at least 12 months) is estimated and included in the resident population. Visitors and short-term migrants (people who enter or leave the UK for less than 12 months) are not included as part of the resident population.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021W.8/6" class="indent">ONS Mid-Year Population Estimates are calculated using the cohort component method, which is an internationally recognised demographic method. The method takes the previous year's population estimate, ages the population by one year, adds in the number of births and takes away the number of deaths that have taken place during the year. The method also incorporates estimates of both international migration (moves to and from the UK for a period of at least one year) and internal moves within the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021W.8/7" class="indent">A copy of the annotated flow-chart &quot;Mid-year Population Estimates: England &amp; Wales&quot; providing a detailed summary of the cohort component method as used by ONS, is available in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021W.8/8" class="indent">The local authority mid-year population estimates are published on the ONS website along with details of each of the estimated components of population change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021W.8/9" class="indent">ONS is leading the cross-government Migration Statistics Improvement Programme which is developing improved methods for population estimation. Initial methodological improvements were incorporated in the population statistics that were published in May 2010. These represent a real improvement in the quality of the migration and population estimates. They are the result of extensive research by ONS and a large scale engagement programme with users.</p>

	<p pid="a.1032W.0/1">Reducing the attainment gap between pupils from affluent and poor backgrounds is at the heart of our policy for school improvement, in South Thanet as elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032W.0/2">We have made a clear commitment to narrowing attainment gaps between children from disadvantaged backgrounds and their peers through our recently announced &#163;7.2 billion fairness premium. The fairness premium includes a &#163;2.5 billion pupil premium for schools which will target extra funding at the most disadvantaged pupils wherever they live, reducing educational inequalities and ensuring that poorer students receive the support they need to reach their potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032W.0/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-03">3 November</phrase>, we also announced a new &#163;110 million education endowment fund which will fund new and innovative ways of raising the attainment of disadvantaged pupils in underperforming schools. Lessons learned about what works to raise the attainment of disadvantaged children will be made available to all schools on an ongoing basis, to help inform their pupil premium funding decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1033W.2/1">The Government are clear that schools should, wherever possible, avoid excluding permanently any pupil with a statement of special educational needs (SEN). Where SEN, including autism, contribute to behavioural difficulties, those needs should be addressed, wherever possible, before problems arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.1033W.2/2">The decision to exclude is one for head teachers to make and head teachers should not be prevented from excluding a child with SEN where that is the necessary and appropriate course of action. In making these difficult decisions, children with SEN should be treated sensitively by schools and the judgment of professionals should be trusted in this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1033W.2/3">We are also considering options for changing the arrangements for reviewing permanent exclusions and will announce our decisions in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1033W.2/4">Exclusion from school does not mean exclusion from education and local authorities have the duty to provide suitable full-time alternative education for any permanently excluded pupil of compulsory school age from the sixth day of the exclusion. The Government are currently developing policies to improve the environment in which excluded pupils are educated and to ensure that those organisations with a proven track record in turning young lives round are given the opportunity to expand their provision.</p>
