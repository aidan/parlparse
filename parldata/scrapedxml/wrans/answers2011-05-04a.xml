	<p pid="a.737W.6/1">The Treasury Solicitor's Department (TSol), Attorney-General's Office (AGO) and HM Crown Prosecution Service (HMCPSI) do not currently operate any general intern, voluntary or work experience placement schemes. Anyone making inquiries about such types of working is advised of this position and would be routinely directed to the civil service website:</p>

	<p pid="a.737W.6/5">TSol also recruit some legal trainees via the Government Legal Service legal trainee scheme and at any given time has about 18 people on the scheme. In advance of commencing their training contracts, TSol also offers work experience to the trainees so that they have some familiarity with the organisation and the wider GLS.</p>
	<p pid="a.737W.6/6">In the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) work experience placements and volunteer work are devolved and thus managed by individual CPS Areas. Each area advises applicants according to their own local arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.737W.6/7">The CPS does not have an intern scheme, but refers those wishing to work as interns to websites with details of Government internship schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.737W.6/9">When appropriate the SFO also provides some work experience and work shadowing placements, however due to operational constraints the SFO are unable to provide resources to accede to every request received.</p>

The use of live rounds and disproportionate force to quell demonstrations is not acceptable. I, along with the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">the Member for Richmond (Yorks)</phrase> (Mr Hague), and our ambassador in Yemen, have impressed upon senior Yemeni officials the urgent need to respect the right to peaceful protest, to act with restraint and to urgently engage in dialogue to find a lasting political settlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.748W.5/2">Our embassy officials have been in frequent contact with senior members of the Government of Yemen and their Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) and EU counterparts. Regular meetings have been held with members of the official opposition, civil society and various youth movements, and we continue to monitor the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.748W.5/3">Intensive political negotiations have been undertaken by the international community during April to help facilitate a lasting agreement between stakeholders in Yemen. An UN envoy, Jamal Benomar, visited Yemen as part of an observation mission. This resulted in the UN Security Council discussing the situation in Yemen for the first time in a closed session on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-19">19 April 2011</phrase>. Following this, the GCC then brokered a revised transition deal between the ruling party and the official opposition group. I welcome reports that agreement is close and stated my strong support for the proposed settlement in a press release on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-25">25 April 2011</phrase>. Only through the formal signing of a political transition plan will further violence and continuing instability be avoided.</p>

	<p pid="a.755W.6/1">The roll-out of smart meters will facilitate more innovative energy tariffs in a variety of ways, including tariffs which vary by time-of-use. Many more such tariffs will be technically feasible with smart meters. Smart meters will also make it easier for consumers to switch, which over time will reward companies who make new tariff offerings that are attractive to consumers. Ofgem, the energy market regulator, will continue to monitor and regulate energy suppliers in order to promote competition and innovation, and to protect the interests of energy consumers. DECC and Ofgem are working closely together on smart meter roll-out, to ensure that suppliers have appropriate incentives and obligations to deliver smart meters and drive innovation.</p>

	<p pid="a.756W.5/2">Assuming one measure per household, the &#8220;maximum feasible potential&#8221; could see 16.4m households receiving a measure, or around 60% of the housing stock. Under the low and high illustrative scenarios 7.1m and 11.5m households could receive a measure, or around 30% and 40% of the housing stock respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.756W.5/3">The illustrative scenarios present the number of measures installed over the period to 2020 taking into consideration a range of demand and supply-side barriers to rollout. For example, the &#8220;maximum feasible potential&#8221; scenario considers a world with no demand barriers and limited supply-side barriers, in which around 90% of the remaining loft and cavity walls are insulated and around 45% of the technical potential for solid wall insulation is installed by the end of 2020; additional feasible potential would be expected to be available after this date.</p>
	<p pid="a.756W.5/4">The scenarios limit the range of insulation measures (loft, cavity wall, solid wall, party wall and door insulation, and glazing). Other measures may well be available under the Green Deal.</p>

	<p pid="a.757W.5/1">The UK operates within an international market for petroleum products. Levels of imports and exports have fluctuated over the past decade; a significant proportion of the products consumed in the UK are imported and a similar level of UK production is exported. We recognise that the UK&#8217;s demand for oil products has changed over the last 10 to 15 years, driven by growth in the aviation sector, the increasing numbers of diesel vehicles and a reduction in the use of oil for power generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.757W.5/2">Work conducted for the Department by Wood Mackenzie<sup>(1)</sup> concluded that the position of UK refineries is middle to low relative to their European competition. This is due to structural factors (e.g. central European markets are landlocked and hence less open to imports and competition) and the fact that UK refineries process higher quality (and hence higher cost) North sea crude feedstock than is the case in much of Europe. Further work to assess the competitiveness of the sector in more detail is currently under way.</p>
	<p pid="a.757W.5/3">The Government recognise that the retention of a refining sector in the UK offers benefits in terms of security of supply (balancing the risks between crude oil and refined product markets) as well as wider socio-economic benefits. Recent investment in several UK refineries demonstrates the continuing importance of this sector the UK. It is Government&#8217;s role to create the best conditions to ensure that the UK&#8217;s demand for petroleum products continues to be met; we are seeking to do this through ensuring that the legislative and regulatory framework provides an appropriate balance between meeting wider policy objectives such as environmental protection, ensuring that the international trade in petroleum products can continue and seeking to ensure that the legislative and regulatory framework does not place undue burdens upon domestic industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.759W.0/1">The Department is aware of the potential of thorium fuelled nuclear reactor designs and is in the process of assessing claims regarding its suitability as an alternative to uranium based reactors in the longer-term.</p>
	<p pid="a.759W.0/2">The Government's chief scientific adviser, Sir John Beddington, with input from a number of sources, recently co-ordinated an assessment of the prospects for research into advanced thorium reactors. Additionally, the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) undertook a recent independent assessment, in which it assessed a number of claims made by proponents of thorium fuel. The report can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.759W.0/3"><a href="http://www.nnl.co.uk/positionpapers">www.nnl.co.uk/positionpapers</a></p>
	<p pid="a.759W.0/4">The conclusion was that, while the science is reasonably sound, developing reactors based on a thorium fuel cycle would carry major commercial risks. The resources required to develop these technologies to the point at which they might be deployed successfully at a commercial scale are also very significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.759W.0/5">To date, both in the UK and elsewhere in the world, this has prevented private industry and Government from investing in the development of the technology. No thorium reactor design has been implemented beyond relatively small, experimental systems, while many either exist only on paper or have only had specific subsystems demonstrated. As an indicator of the challenge of taking this technology further, the Chinese Academy of Sciences estimates a development period of at least 20 years will be required before a demonstration thorium molten salt breeder reactor might be available.</p>
	<p pid="a.759W.0/6">While thorium does not appear to have a part to play in the UK's near to mid-term energy market, we do maintain an interest in its development. The Secretary of State has asked the NNL to look further into the wider benefits of next generation reactor designs and to compare the use of thorium and uranium fuels in them. We are expecting the findings to be available by the end of the summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.769W.9/1">Under the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) governments are able to issue compulsory licenses on patented technologies. For Least Developed Countries (LDCs) this flexibility may have limited impact because they lack domestic manufacturing capability. Whilst TRIPS has been amended to enable compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical products for export to these countries, there is currently insufficient evidence that extending this to environmentally sound technologies would bring significant benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.769W.9/2">Compulsory licensing of pharmaceuticals for export has been used only once to date so it is not clear that this procedure encourages technology transfer. Compulsory licensing is also likely to be a strong disincentive to investment in technology innovation and is unlikely to encourage the transfer of know-how and tacit knowledge which is required to maintain and adapt technologies for local use. By contrast, voluntary licensing arrangements are more likely to foster longer term partnerships and bring about sustainable technology transfer. The UK is committed to providing incentives for business to promote technology transfer to LDCs as required by TRIPS Article 66.2.</p>

	<p pid="a.770W.2/1">The UK policy is to take a case-by-case approach to intellectual property rights within Free Trade Agreements between the European Union and developing countries. The level of intellectual property protection should be tailored to the trading partner's level of development. We stated in the recently published &#8220;Trade and Investment for Growth&#8221; White Paper that we would seek to ensure that provisions on intellectual property rights in EU free trade agreements did not have negative impacts on the ability of the poorest to access low cost medicines. We would consider any proposals made regarding data exclusivity in the EU-India agreement in the light of the available evidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.771W.11/1">The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has recently taken enforcement action against a number of companies that offer to buy gold from consumers by post.</p>
	<p pid="a.771W.11/2">Following an OFT investigation, which concluded in February 2011, a number of companies signed undertakings to make changes to their business practices. The undertakings related to alleged breaches of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.771W.11/3">The OFT investigation raised concerns that the business practices of these companies were not sufficiently transparent and people were being locked into accepting the offer made for their gold. The OFT was particularly concerned with the practice of sending consumers a payment, which if not rejected and returned within restrictive time periods, meant their 'silence' was taken as consent to the payment and their gold melted down. Gold buying companies are under a duty to trade fairly with consumers and should not seek to use unfair terms in their standard contracts with consumers. This enforcement action provided a clear signal to industry on acceptable trading practices in this area.</p>

Many of these institutions receive additional funding from the Funding Council to account for their small size or specialist nature, which are not recognised through the current mainstream funding formula. Whilst it is for the Funding Council to make decisions on grant allocations the Government will set out its priorities for continuing grant in the forthcoming higher education white paper. It will be our priority that in putting the new funding system in place we do not damage in the process those institutions with a world class reputation for the arts and music.</p>

	<p pid="a.779W.11/1">Yes, for the purposes of the Education (Student Support) Regulations an &#8220;end-on course&#8221; is a degree course taken immediately&#8212;that is to say without any break other than a vacation&#8212;after a foundation degree or other lower level qualification designated for support under those regulations. Students seeking top up qualifications in this way are treated as continuing their studies, and retain the support package and tuition charge arrangements that applied on their initial course.</p>
	<p pid="a.779W.11/2">We will regulate to ensure that the new support and fee charging arrangements to be introduced from 2012/13 do not apply to students taking &#8220;end-on courses&#8221;. This will be subject to the conditions that the student keeps the same mode of study (principally whether the course is part-time or full-time) in the second course as he or she followed in the initial course and takes the second course immediately after the initial course has completed.</p>

	<p pid="a.780W.2/1">The Student Loans Company (SLC) undertook a study of identity fraud during the financial year 2009-10. This estimated that 1.6% of applications had some element of fraud. The company subsequently introduced new income and identity fraud prevention and detection checks, using a commercial provider to deliver electronic income and identity validation services during the application cycle. This work is linked to checks currently undertaken with HM Revenue and Customs to enable enhanced verification of household income against tax payer returns.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.2/2">The SLC and NHS Counter Fraud Service have both carried out fraud measurement exercises. The most recent estimates suggest that student finance related fraud, including in relation to NHS bursaries, costs &#163;31 million a year.</p>

	<p pid="a.780W.8/1">The level of repayment of student loans taken out to fund university tuition fees, as well as loan for living costs, will depend on many factors such as: length of course, distribution of average fee, tuition fee loan take-up, maintenance loan take-up, terms of office for fair access agreements and economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.8/2">The main factors affecting (non-)repayment are the total debt on leaving higher education coupled with real earnings growth. Given these uncertainties, we estimate that the likely level of non-repayment of student loans will be around 30% of the total loan amount. The higher average loan amounts will have a slightly higher non-repayment percentage.</p>

	<p pid="a.782W.3/2">The forthcoming revision of the UNECE Gothenburg Protocol provides an opportunity to highlight the importance of reducing black carbon as a component of particulate matter (PM) for both health and climate reasons. The proposal for an emissions ceiling for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the revised protocol will help to deliver reductions in black carbon out to 2020 while further work is carried out to develop emission inventories, ambient air quality monitoring and improve our understanding of control techniques for black carbon.</p>
	<p pid="a.782W.3/3">To date, no assessment has been made of the likely effect of a revised protocol on the combustion of biomass in the UK. However, emissions from biomass combustion have the potential to adversely impact ambient air quality. Therefore, as announced in the Government's March 2011 document on the renewable heat incentive (RHI), emission limits for particulate matter (PM10) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) will be introduced in 2012 for biomass installations below 20MWth as eligibility criteria for RHI support.

The UK is working with its EU partners to develop a robust line to be taken in future discussions, as well as calling for an early start to the development of a precautionary mechanism. I hope that line can be agreed as soon as possible to signal the precautionary line that the EU intends to take.</p>

	<p pid="a.791W.5/1">There are many organisations in the public sector which hold and manage information. Not all organisations holding significant public sector information will be suitable for inclusion within the Public Data Corporation. Important considerations will be how and to what extent the information is made available to its customers (other parts of Government, businesses and citizens), and whether products and services form part of the organisation&#8217;s &#8216;public task&#8217; or whether they are a by product in the organisation&#8217;s business model. Final decisions on inclusion of bodies and datasets will be taken in light of this work. Until decisions are taken it would be premature to announce which bodies may be involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.791W.5/2">While the majority of public sector information will be available under the Open Government License (OGL), there are some instances where this is not possible e.g. where third party intellectual property rights are present, or where charges are required to ensure the sustainability and quality of the data. Work over the coming months will focus on harmonising and simplifying licensing arrangements that can be used as a basis for licensing where the OGL is not appropriate.</p>

Since the SDSR was announced the Ministry of Defence has been addressing the full range of basing and estate issues arising from the re-basing from Germany; restructuring of the Army's non-deployable regional and administrative structure; and the future requirement for RAF bases. Once we have drawn up a comprehensive basing and estates rationalisation plan the Army will be able to draw up its detailed proposals for the rebasing of forces from Germany.

	<p pid="a.823W.2/1">This information is not held in the format requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.2/2">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has two primary contracting arrangements for feeding armed forces personnel; the first is a number of outsourced pay as you dine/catering retail and leisure contracts covering most armed forces personnel 'in UK barracks'. Contractors appointed under this arrangement are free to source on the open market consistent with meeting EU competition rules and quality standards. We will be calling for data next month from our catering retail and leisure suppliers, in order to provide a report to Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on our status against the proposed Government buying standards for food and catering.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.2/3">The second arrangement is a single food supply contract for armed forces personnel serving on operations, exercises, in submarines and ships worldwide as well as the remainder of armed forces personnel 'in barracks'. The food supply contract has been placed on Purple Food Service Solutions who procure meat and dairy proteins in the UK that meet all UK animal welfare standards. Proteins purchased outside of the UK comply with the EU animal welfare standards. 100% of bacon sourced since May 2010 meets these standards. 100% of eggs sourced since May 2010 meets the Lion Standard, an internationally recognised quality code of practice. All food purchased through the MOD food supply contract is subject to stringent quality standards, encompassing farm assurance, animal welfare and health and nutrition. These meet or exceed all current legislative standards.</p>

This was particularly marked for patients with a mental health condition or a learning disability. Non-heterosexual patients reported less positive experience, especially in relation to communication and being treated with respect and dignity.</p>

	<p pid="a.845W.2/1">The Department has not made any such assessment. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network (CRN) provides health service infrastructure to support clinical trials and other well designed studies in the national health service in England. Currently 97% of NHS trusts are recruiting into NIHR CRN studies.</p>
	<p pid="a.845W.2/2">The Government are committed to opening up information about clinical trials so that patients can find out about trials that may be relevant to their condition. The NIHR is developing a web-based UK Clinical Trials Gateway. It will present, in accessible form, information about trials conducted in the United Kingdom. By 2012, the Gateway will make it easy for patients, their doctors and carers, friends and families to see what a trial is about, where it is taking place, and who is running it. It will help patients to join in clinical trials if they are suitable and choose to do so with full information and advice.</p>

	<p pid="a.845W.5/1">Data on recurrences of <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection are not collected centrally. The symptoms of initial infection, recurrence of infection and re-infection is similar. Differentiation between recurrence of infection and re-infection requires culture and characterization of the causative strain(s) of <i>Clostridium difficile</i>. This is not routinely undertaken, as diagnoses are often based on the detection of <i>Clostridium difficile</i> toxins, rather than microbiological culture. However, studies typically show that approximately a quarter of individuals with <i>Clostridium difficile</i> Infection experience a recurrence of their symptoms. In about half of these recurrences a different strain (ie re-infection) is the cause, with the others due to relapse from the original strain. The best solution is to prevent these infections by adhering to the Department of Health/Health Protection Agency guidance on managing this infection <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection: How to deal with the problem. A copy of the guidance has already been placed in the Library and is available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.848W.2/1">&#8216;Reducing cancer inequality: evidence, progress and making it happen&#8217;, the March 2010 report of the National Cancer Equality Initiative (NCEI), said that it would be good practice for multi-disciplinary teams (MDTs) to undertake equality audits, reflecting annually on their practice and documenting their findings. It set out plans to support this. &#8216;Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer&#8217; (January 2011) said that patient characteristic profiles would be made available to MDTs and that, in future, MDT health equality audits would form part of the National Cancer Peer Review Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/2">The annual self-assessment for peer review, introduced this year, requires that MDTs answer the question &#8220;How many patients by equality characteristic (race, age and gender) were diagnosed/treated in the previous year?&#8221; as one of the MDT key themes covering the structure and function of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/3">Working with the National Cancer Intelligence Network and the National Cancer Action Team, NCEI is investigating what support might be provided to MDTs to undertake patient-level equality audits.</p>

Headcount totals are unlikely to equal the sum of components. Further information on the headcount methodology is available in the Census publication here: http://www.ic.nhs.uk/statistics-and-data-collections/workforce/nhs-staff-numbers Headcount numbers in 2010 have also for some trusts been affected by clarification of the hosting arrangements for medical and dental staff. 2. Data Quality: The NHS Information Centre for health and social care seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant analyses. <i>Source:</i> The NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care Non-Medical Workforce Census</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.851W.3/4">Under the proposals currently set out in the Health and Social Care Bill, commissioners would remain responsible for securing continued provision of NHS services to meet the needs of their populations.

	<p pid="a.851W.3/5">Commissioners would consult with local communities and apply for local services to be &#8216;designated&#8217;, as subject to additional regulation, where the withdrawal of those services would impact adversely on health and where there are no alternative providers. This would ensure patients in England have continued access to designated services, wherever they happen to live.</p>

Prior to 1995 the NHS workforce was monitored on an entirely different basis relating to pay scales which would result in the information captured for Medical and Dental and Non-Medical Hospital and Community Health Services staff (the majority of NHS) not being comparable to the data collected since then.</p>
	<p pid="a.854W.8/2">Because of this step change in the way in which the data was recorded and collected it has been standard practice not to provide time series on the NHS workforce that predate the 1995 improvements to methodology as these figures are confusing and do not represent a fair or accurate figure.</p>

Data quality: The number of episodes where this diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record.

Assessing growth through time: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. 4. Activity included: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. 5.
