	<p pid=".669W.10/1">The UK Climate Change Programme, published in 2000, sets out the policy framework for delivering the UK's Kyoto commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. below base year levels by 2008&ndash;12 and to move towards the domestic goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.10/2">Policies in the Climate Change Programme include the following:</p>
	<p pid=".669W.10/3" class="indent">the Climate Change Levy, which applies to energy used in the business and public sectors, is helping to fund measures to promote better energy efficiency in business and the public sector;</p>
	<p pid=".669W.10/4" class="indent">Climate Change Agreements which allow energy intensive business users to receive 80 per cent. discount from the Climate Change Levy, in return for meeting challenging energy efficiency or carbon saving targets;</p>
	<p pid=".669W.10/5" class="indent">the Carbon Trust, which is recycling about &pound;100 million of climate change levy receipts to boost the take-up of cost-effective, low-carbon technologies;</p>
	<p pid=".669W.10/6" class="indent">a UK-wide Emissions Trading Scheme, with Government support of &pound;215 million over five years;</p>
	<p pid=".669W.10/7" class="indent">targets to provide 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity from renewable sources of energy by 2010;</p>
	<p pid=".669W.10/8" class="indent">the Energy Efficiency Commitment, which requires electricity and gas suppliers to help domestic customers to save energy and cut fuel bills;</p>
	<p pid=".669W.10/9" class="indent">European Union voluntary agreements with car manufacturers to improve fuel efficiency by at least 25 per cent., backed up by changes to vehicle excise duty and company car taxation, and the 10 Year Plan for Transport.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.10/10">Data for emissions of the basket of six greenhouse gases for 2001, submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in April 2003, show that emissions fell by 12.3 per cent. between the base year and 2001. Emissions of carbon dioxide for 2002 are provisionally estimated at 8 to 9 per cent. below 1990 levels.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.10/11">Latest projections suggest we are well on course to meet our Kyoto commitment, a conclusion that is also supported by a recent independent assessment by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.10/12">The Government's policies on improving air quality are set out in detail in the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, published in January 2000. The Strategy explains the measures that are in place to reduce emissions of harmful pollutants from all sectors, including road transport and industry. Copies are available via the Department's website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/airquality">www.defra.gov.uk/environment/airquality</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.10/13">Air quality in urban areas has improved significantly over the last decade, as a result largely of the progressively tighter European Union standards for new vehicles and fuels, and of the continuing reduction in total emissions from industry. The air quality headline indicator, published annually, shows that the average number of days of moderate or poor air quality in urban areas of the UK has reduced from 59 days in 1993 to 20 days in 2002 and, in rural areas, from 50 days in 1990 to 30 days in 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".672W.8/2">The Directive gives examples of materials suitable for environmental enrichment, rather than a prescriptive list. In terms of enrichment, the choice of material is secondary to whether it achieves the aim of enabling the pig to satisfy its need to manipulate and to investigate and thus help to reduce aggressive behaviour. Our new pig welfare code, which provides guidance on the Regulations, stresses that straw is an excellent material, but also gives advice to those farmers where straw is not a practical solution. Objects such as chains or footballs can only be used in conjunction with other manipulable materials or when changed on a weekly basis. When tail biting occurs the code requires that a full investigation is made and also recommends that the provision of environmental enrichment is reviewed and an action plan developed which should be incorporated into the farm animal health and welfare plan. This plan should in any case be revised annually by the farmer and his veterinary surgeon or other advisers.</p>
	<p pid=".672W.8/3">It is the welfare of the pig that matters. If it is found that the material used does not allow the pigs to investigate and manipulate and the pigs are tail biting, then the farmer will need to find an alternative material.</p>

	<p pid=".676W.5/1">For 2003/04, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has allocated &pound;265 million to higher education institutions in their block grants to recognise the additional costs of recruiting and supporting students from disadvantaged or non-traditional backgrounds. There are around 4,300 medical students who attract additional funding because they come from low-participation areas, and around 2,900 who attract additional funding either because they are mature students or because their pre-entry qualifications are lower than the equivalent of three Cs at 'A' Level.</p>
	<p pid=".676W.5/2">Details of how much of this funding has been spent by institutions on their medical schools is not held centrally, except for St. George's hospital medical school, which will receive &pound;126,704 from the widening access and improving retention pot in 2003/04.</p>

	<p pid=".686W.6/2">Identity documents have been sent to DVLA since 1999. More recently, customers are now able to take applications and passports to DVLA's local offices and some 750 Post Offices, enabling them to be examined and returned immediately. 12 per cent. of all applications are made in this way. Drivers are advised that responsibility for the delivery of passports rests with the Royal Mail. No records are kept by DVLA of the non-receipt of passports.</p>

	<p pid=".687W.0/1">Enforcement is a matter for the police. However, the Department published a partial Regulatory Impact Assessment last year when it consulted on the proposal for a new offence of using a hand-held mobile phone while driving. Based on prosecutions for failure to wear a seat belt, the assessment suggested that perhaps up to 100,000 fixed penalty notices at &pound;30 each might be issued a year. Fines could therefore total &pound;3 million a year, depending on the level of enforcement.</p>

	<p pid=".689W.10/1">DFID, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and others agree that the most effective strategy to reduce maternal mortality is to ensure that all women are attended at birth by a skilled attendant backed by timely access to emergency obstetric care in the event of a life threatening complication. There is consensus on the content of antenatal, natal and post natal care 'packages' and these are considered cost-effective. The global failure to address the high burden of maternal mortality in developing countries does not reflect a lack of available cost-effective interventions but rather the lack of sustained political commitment to act on the scale necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".694W.12/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-20">20 June 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/2">The Crown Prosecution Service has made considerable progress on the implementation of their Race Equality Scheme to comply with the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/3">The Crown Prosecution Service Race Equality Scheme was published and launched on May 2002. It is a three-year plan, which applies to all existing and future functions and policies developed by the Crown Prosecution Service. To comply with the Act, and action plans must be reviewed within three years. However, the Crown Prosecution Service has decided to review and publish updates on its Race Equality Scheme progress annually. The first update (Year One&mdash;Crown Prosecution Service Update 2002&ndash;03) is to be published shortly and will be available on the Crown Prosecution internet and internal intranet.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/4">An impact assessment form has been produced in consultation with the Commission for Racial Equality. The impact assessment form will be used to evaluate all policies and functions.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/5">The Equality and Diversity Unit has overseen the day-to-day delivery of the scheme, which has been reviewed on a regular basis by the Senior Managers Advisory Group on Diversity. The Crown Prosecution Service Board has also assessed progress annually.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/6">Training on the Race Equality Scheme for policy makers and key staff is due to be rolled out in July 2003. This will ensure that staff are aware of the Racial Equality Scheme and their duty under it. Training will also be given in how to complete the impact assessment forms to ensure that all local policies that do not fall under the banner of national policies comply with the Act and the Crown Prosecution Service Racial Equality Scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/7">In relation to monitoring as stated by the Act, the Crown Prosecution Service is continuing to monitor employment statistics. These are available publicly in the Year One review.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/8">With regards to the monitoring of prosecutions, the Crown Prosecution Service has made a good start with a view to extending monitoring via the forthcoming new IT system. All national policies and functions have been reviewed and new policies have been written. A Public Policy Statement on Racially and Religiously Aggravated Crime has been written which has set up monitoring systems. It is due to be launched on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-14">14 July 2003</phrase> by the Attorney-General.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/9">The Serious Fraud Office has made significant efforts to meet the requirements of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, especially in encouraging a positive approach to diversity issues and other employment practices. Its full Race Equality Scheme has yet to be published and it is working with the Commission for Racial Equality to complete this task as fully and as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/10">HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate attaches considerable importance to the principles of equality and diversity, both in relation to the inspection process and the management of HM Crown Prosecution Service itself.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/11">Under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, the Inspectorate has a general duty to promote race equality and the specific duty to set out and publish a Race Equality Scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/12">In May 2002, the Inspectorate published its Race Equality Scheme drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. The Scheme sets out the steps to be taken to ensure that its functions, policies and employment systems eliminate unlawful racial discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and promote good relations between persons of different racial groups.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/13">The Scheme also includes the specific duty in relation to employment issues which require HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate to monitor the staff in post and applications for employment, promoting and training by their racial group. In fact, the Inspectorate has gone further by including gender, disability and age.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/14">The statistics are currently being compiled for the period ending <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase> and will be available shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/15">HM Crown Prosecution Service has worked closely with the Commission for Racial Equality and other inspectorates in developing an inspection framework to underpin consistent and effective scrutiny of how inspected bodies are discharging their statutory functions under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. It has been incorporated with appropriate adaptations into the HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate methodology.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/16">The Treasury Solicitor's Department, including the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers, published its Scheme to Promote Racial Equality in May 2002, in accordance with the requirements of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. The Scheme is overseen by the Department's Diversity Group, which ensures equal opportunities good practice is upheld and monitored in the Agency, and which is currently in the process of carrying out a review of the Scheme one year after its launch, including employment targets.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.12/17">As a result of the Scheme so far, training in telephone technique has been undertaken by Bona Vacantia Division, to ensure race equality in dealing with public callers, some of whom do not speak English as a first language or understand English law or customs. The Diversity Group has also overseen an audit of external administrative recruitment since 2001 and made recommendations on monitoring. Details of employment monitoring will be published shortly, and thereafter each April and October.</p>

	<p pid=".696W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence complies with Deduction from Earnings Requests in full, in all but exceptional cases. Such exceptions might include an appeal by the individual on the grounds of a change in circumstances, or where the deduction would breach the regulations on minimum rates of pay. Minimum rates of pay were introduced around 50 years ago as a result of experience in the second world war to ensure that Service families could meet essential financial commitments. The Army regulations allow for up to 50 per cent. deductions from pay, where there are no other children or dependants. However, in circumstances where the soldier is legally married and living with his or her spouse, or where the soldier is widowed, divorced or separated and has care of the children, or the soldier does not have care of the children but is providing voluntary financial support, there is a limit of 25 per cent. deduction on pay. The amounts deducted are paid to the Child Support Agency for maintenance payments to be made.</p>
	<p pid=".696W.6/2">Service personnel were excluded from the law relating to deduction of earnings orders when the Child Support (Collection and Enforcement) Regulations 1992 were drawn up as there was already provision for deductions from Service pay under Armed Forces' legislation.</p>

	<p pid=".699W.9/1">Members of the Territorial Army (TA) have been deployed to the Gulf either as members of formed TA units and sub units or as Individual Reinforcements augmenting Regular Army units. Working alongside their Regular counterparts, they played a full and vital role during the war in Combat, Combat Support and Combat Service Support roles. In all, the Reserves (TA and Regular Reserves) formed just over 10 per cent. of the deployed Land element of our forces; a figure which is in keeping with the level of TA and Reserve participation in other Operations such as Kosovo, Bosnia and Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid=".699W.9/2">Of the first tranche of TA mobilised for service relating to the Gulf conflict, some 1,825 members have been demobilised so far. Approximately 1,700 remain in the Gulf and the vast majority of these will be returning home shortly. They will be replaced in the coming weeks by a second tranche of approximately 2,050 TA personnel who will have, on average, a deployment period in theatre of six months.</p>

These sums are likely to be significant. However, excluding costs of war-fighting (essentially those described above), the latest estimate is that the net additional cost of operations in Iraq for 2002&ndash;03 will not exceed &pound;1 billion; the amount set aside at Spring Supplementary Estimates 2002&ndash;03.</p>

We appealed this decision because the overwhelming consensus of medical and scientific opinion is that the symptoms reported by some Gulf veterans do not constitute a discrete disorder. It is too early to say what the cost of contesting the case has been.</p>

However, in view of the strength of concern on this issue and the fact that only indicative figures are available on the cost of remedying the position, my predecessor agreed that he would put work in hand to provide a more exact estimate of the cost of remedying the trough that occurred between 1976 and 1978.

	<p pid=".707W.2/1">Revised Regulatory Impact Assessment guidance, &quot;Better Policy Making: A Guide to Regulatory Impact Assessment&quot;, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-28">28 January 2003</phrase>. It advises policy officials to consider time limiting or sunsetting at an early stage of policy development and gives specific examples of where sunsetting may be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.2/2">Most Ministry of Defence legislation relates to the armed forces, and it would be unusual for sunset clauses to be appropriate. Nevertheless, the periodic Armed Forces Acts, which extend the life of the Army and Air Force Acts 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957, do so for only five years at a time and, thus, may be regarded as having a form of inbuilt sunsetting. However, where new primary or delegated legislation that may have an effect on business is introduced, the MOD will consider whether a sunset clause or other arrangements are appropriate on a case by case basis.</p>

	<p pid=".711W.8/2">The Elite Sports Funding Review chaired by Dr. Cunningham made over 50 recommendations, the large majority of which are for the Sports Councils and National Governing Bodies of sport to take forward. The Review was discussed at the Sports Cabinet on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-31">31 October 2001</phrase>, chaired by the Secretary of State. The Cabinet brings together the Sports Ministers and Chairmen of the Sports Councils from each of the Devolved Administrations. At the Cabinet, the Sports Councils accepted and are now implementing the overwhelming majority of the recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".711W.8/3">Following the recent Spending Review a ring fenced allocation of &pound;4.7 million for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 has been provided to UK Sport to enable them to take forward some of the outstanding recommendations that involved an increase in expenditure. Some of the recommendations relate to the World Class Plans and cannot be implemented until the current four year plans have been completed. This Department will continue to works with UK Sport, the Devolved Administrations and Sport England to ensure that implementation of the recommendations is effective and continues to remain relevant to the changing environment of high performance sport.</p>

	<p pid=".717W.2/1">The Halliday report 'Making Punishments Work' advocated maintaining the principle of equal treatment and that there should be no preferential treatment between men and women offenders in sentencing. However, this does not mean the same sentences are necessarily right for different groups who may be differently affected. It is legitimate for a court to take into account the impact of a sentence on other people&mdash;including dependent children&mdash;as one part of the overall picture. The report recommended the establishment of a body with the power to issue guidelines on sentencing issues. The Government accepted this recommendation by proposing the setting up of the Sentencing Guidelines Council, which forms part of the Criminal Justice Bill at present before Parliament. The sentencing of mothers with dependent children is likely to be an issue which the Council will consider as part of its overall work.</p>

	<p pid=".723W.6/2">In early 2003 the UK Passport Service (UKPS) completed a &quot;Review of Alternative Delivery Mechanisms&quot; in the wake of continuing problems with passports being reported as lost in the post and the concern that these lost passports might subsequently be used for the purposes of identity fraud. As a result of this review UKPS have determined that in future all valid UK passports will be delivered by secure delivery to the customers home address. A tender exercise is currently under way to select a suitable supplier and UKPS expect to announce a chosen supplier in August. Implementation is currently planned for early 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".723W.6/3">The UK Passport Service rarely use private postal and courier companies as the bulk of passports are delivered to customers by Royal Mail Group. Private couriers are occasionally used in 'emergency situations', however there have been no reported instances of any passports lost by such couriers.</p>
	<p pid=".723W.6/4">For each passport reported lost in the post UKPS receive compensation of &pound;26.00 from Royal Mail Group. Between 1999 and 2002 there were 11,733 passports reported lost in the post and compensation has therefore totalled &pound;305,058.</p>
	<p pid=".723W.6/5">There is no specific guidance provided to Post Office Ltd. with regard to the secure delivery of passports to customers. UKPS do however regularly meet with Royal Mail Group to discuss security arrangements within the postal system and measures have been put in place to anonomise envelopes and maximise the secure transmission of passports from UKPS sites to customers.</p>

	<p pid=".725W.2/1">The current misconduct regulations were introduced on <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-01">1 April 1999</phrase>. These are the Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999 and the Police (Conduct) (Senior Officers) Regulations 1999, which replaced the existing Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 and the Police (Discipline) (Senior Officers) Regulations 1985. The new Regulations represent a change in emphasis from a discipline code of specific offences to a code of conduct against which an officer's behaviour can be assessed to see whether or not it matches up to the standards expected of a police officer.</p>
	<p pid=".725W.2/2">Regulations and Guidance on police misconduct procedures are kept under review by the Police Personnel Procedures (PPP) Working Group, which was set up by, and is a sub-group of, the Police Advisory Board for England and Wales. All police interests are represented on the PPP Working Group, which includes a member of the Association of Chief Police Officers. Since the current misconduct regulations were introduced in April 1999 the following amendments have been made:</p>

	<p pid=".725W.2/4" class="indent">The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 (Consequential Amendments) (Police Ranks) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/3888) inserted in the Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999 various references to chief superintendents, consequential on section 125 of the 2001 Act, and inserted in the Police (Conduct) (Senior Officers) Regulations 1999 a reference to a deputy chief constable, consequential on section 123 of the 2001 Act. Regulation 5(4) amended regulation 18(3) of the Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999 to provide that at a disciplinary hearing, the two officers who assist the presiding officer need not come from the same force as the officer concerned.</p>

	<p pid=".726W.6/2">Two-year 'un-adjusted' reconviction rates for prisoners discharged from custody are available for 1994 to 1998. These were 56 per cent. in 1994, 58 per cent. in 1995, 57 per cent. in 1996, 58 per cent. in 1997 and 59 per cent. in 1998. These rates are published in 'Prison Statistics-England and Wales 2001'.</p>
	<p pid=".726W.6/3">Reconviction rates for offenders discharged from custody have also been published according to the requirements of the Governments Public Service Agreement (PSA) 10 target. These are adjusted to take out convictions for offences committed prior to discharge, giving a reconviction rate of 55.3 per cent. for the first quarter of 1999. The equivalent figures for the first quarter of 1997 and 1998 are 56.8 per cent. and 55.7 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".726W.6/4">Neither set of rates indicate trends in rates over time, as they make no allowance for changes in the characteristics and criminal histories of offenders given custodial sentences. To do this a predicted rate is used. Comparisons between the actual and predicted reconviction rates for 1999 show that the actual rate was 1.9 per cent. lower than predicted, equating to 3.3 per cent. fewer offenders reconvicted, as set out in the Home Office On Line Report 16/02.</p>

	<p pid=".732W.3/1">Magistrates' Courts Committees (MCCs) have a responsibility for the collection of a range of debts imposed by both the magistrates courts and the Crown court.

It is not yet possible to separate out only fines from the total so the figures provided here include all the elements above.</p>
	<p pid=".732W.3/2">Data are collected centrally at MCC level, rather than at court level. The payment rate for the Thames Valley MCC in 2002&ndash;03, that is the percentage of the total amount collected over the amount imposed, was 69 per cent. On that basis, the percentage of fines unpaid was 31 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".732W.3/3">In addition, the Thames Valley MCC accounting system is unable to identify the percentage of fines unpaid in the Chesham and Amersham satellite magistrates court. Information from the Thames Valley MCC indicated that the payment rate in 2002&ndash;03 for the Central Buckinghamshire Petty Session Area, which includes Amersham, was 65 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".733W.6/1">The Government have received many representations on the Convention's proposals. We look forward to receiving many more once the final text of the Convention's draft is published in the next few days. More QMV is essential to push through our solutions to Europe-wide problems in key areas, such as asylum and immigration. But there are areas on which we would not be prepared to move from unanimity. We would not agree to any changes on foreign policy, defence, taxation or social security which threatened the national interest.</p>

	<p pid=".734W.2/1">The political and economic situation in Zimbabwe remains serious. The state continues to use violence and intimidation against its opponents. Formal dialogue between the ruling ZANU (PF) and opposition MDC has not started. The leader of the opposition, Morgan Tsvangirai, now faces two treason charges. The economy continues to spiral downwards. The World Food Programme estimates that nearly half the population, 5.5 million Zimbabweans, will depend on food aid this year.</p>

Together with the rest of the international community, we will continue to provide humanitarian relief, will work to sustain Mugabe's isolation and highlight his abuses of fundamental human rights and will continue to promote a prosperous and democratic future for the people of Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid=".734W.5/1">The situation in Zimbabwe continues to have a negative impact on other countries in southern Africa. The crisis there is damaging regional economies and has adversely affected their interest rates, inflation, foreign direct investment and tourism. A study by the Zimbabwe Research Initiative in May estimated the total cost to the combined Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries to have been at least US$1.88 billion at the end of 2002. Zimbabwe's neighbours are also suffering damage to local production from the influx of cheap Zimbabwean goods, unpaid Zimbabwean debts, an increase in largely unskilled migrants, and the cross border spread of foot and mouth disease.</p>

	<p pid=".737W.9/2">The package includes 9 million euros of financial assistance to boost economic development, through developing infrastructure in the north, introducing grant schemes for Small and Medium Enterprises and conducting feasibility studies on the economic integration of the north of Cyprus into the EU, after a political settlement. The package further includes 3 million euros to bring the north closer to the EU, through information activities on the EU and the acquis. Finally, the package includes proposals on trade, in particular that the Turkish Cypriot Chamber of Commerce could be given the authority to issue movement certificates for goods going from the north of Cyprus to the south.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.9/3">Technical talks on the implementation and administration of these proposals are ongoing in Brussels. However, we are urging both sides to work closely with the Commission to implement these measures and deliver the best possible results for Turkish Cypriots.</p>

	<p pid=".741W.0/1">In line with commitments made to the Republic of Cyprus in the 1960 Treaty of establishment, provided they have entered the island of Cyprus through an internationally recognised port of entry, British nationals have freedom of access and communication to and through the Eastern Sovereign Base Areas (ESBA) from the north. No action is being or will be taken to prevent them from doing so. However, any person who has entered the island of Cyprus through an unrecognised port of entry is considered to be an illegal immigrant by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus. It has been Government policy since 1974 to respect the Republic of Cyprus' immigration policy. The relaxing of restrictions on freedom of movement across the Green Line has required SBA authorities to check and monitor people and vehicles entering and leaving the ESBA. Therefore, some people who might have previously crossed in contravention of SBA law are now no longer able to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".744W.0/2">The Government's support to forest sector reform in Indonesia is primarily through the Multi-stakeholder Forestry Programme. This started in July 2000. It helps build capacity within civil society and government to promote reforms. Associated with this programme is a Memorandum of Understanding signed in April 2002 between the Governments of Indonesia and the UK to address the serious problem of illegal logging and associated trade.</p>
	<p pid=".744W.0/3">Some other donor-supported programmes in Indonesia have similar aims. China, Norway and Japan have recently signed co-operation agreements with Indonesia that are similar to the Indonesia-UK Memorandum of Understanding. An agreement between Indonesia and the EU is in preparation.</p>
	<p pid=".744W.0/4">We recognise that actions under these agreements need to be co-ordinated. A Donor Forest Forum provides policy guidance. It reports to the broader Consultative Group on Indonesia.</p>
	<p pid=".744W.0/5">At an operational level we work with other donors to identify gaps, overlaps and opportunities for collaboration. Those involved, in addition to the UK, include local managers of programmes supported by the Asian Development Bank, Canada, the European Union, Germany, the International Tropical Timber Organisation, the Netherlands, Norway, the United States and the World Bank. One example of joint action is UK co-operation with a US-funded programme to design a system for tracking legally harvested logs. We foresee further opportunities as the plans supported by other donors are implemented.</p>

	<p pid=".745W.6/1">Animal welfare issues have long been included among the EU's WTO negotiating priorities. At Doha, the EU was successful in ensuring that the issue of farm animal welfare could be taken into account as part of the current Agreement on Agriculture negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".745W.6/2">Reaching agreement on changes to WTO rules explicitly to allow countries to limit imports of goods based only on the way in which a product was made (for instance whether the production method took account of animal welfare standards) remains extremely difficult. Many WTO members, developing countries in particular, are highly suspicious of the EU's motives and fear that animal welfare production standards will be used as an excuse for covert protectionism. The EU continues to raise this issue in all relevant WTO for in order to try and build trust and understanding for the EU's position. We see discussions on farm animal welfare in the current Doha trade round as a helpful step to building trust and understanding for the EU's position on broader animal welfare standards.</p>

A specific concern at present is changing the effect of TRIPs to enable countries with insufficient manufacturing capacity to make effective use of compulsory licenses for needed pharmaceuticals. All WTO members committed to solving this problem at the Ministerial Conference in Doha in 2001. This change would not require the UK to change its own laws, and the Government has made no commitment to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".748W.3/1">The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (&quot;the Guidelines&quot;) are recommendations addressed by adhering countries to multi-national enterprises. They represent a framework of principles of good conduct for multi-national companies in their business activities, designed to help ensure that they act in harmony with the policies of the countries in which they operate and that they consider the views of other stakeholders (for example in respect of social and environmental issues). The Guidelines aim to promote and develop a sustainable approach to business conduct and to build an atmosphere of confidence and predictability between business, labour, governments and society as a whole. It is intended that companies use the Guidelines as a benchmark when developing their own codes of conduct and should be seen as a minimum required standard of behaviour. Further information can be obtained from <a href="http://www.oecd.org">www.oecd.org</a></p>
	<p pid=".748W.3/2">The Government supports the OECD Guidelines, which are an integral part of the Government's policy towards Corporate Social Responsibility. There are expectations of business, in respect of environmental and social responsibility and in high standards of corporate governance, wherever they operate. The Guidelines can have a positive impact on the contribution by businesses in these areas.</p>

	<p pid=".754W.9/1">The new attendance allowance claim form was piloted in one section of Bristol Disability Benefits Centre from March 2002 and extended in September 2002 to all those requesting a claim form from the Disability and Carers Service in the area covered by Bristol DBC. The pilot was further extended to Glasgow DBC in March 2003. The average clearance time <sup>1</sup> for attendance allowance claims processed by Bristol DBC in the period October to December 2002 was 22.6 days. For the same period, the national average clearance time for attendance allowance claims was 24.1 days. The evaluation results of the Glasgow test are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid=".754W.9/2">For the period October to December 2002, the breakdown of new claims awards at Bristol was: higher rate&mdash;3,160 (35.9 per cent.); lower rate: 3,917 (44.5 per cent.); and disallowed&mdash;1,722 (19.6 per cent.). For the corresponding period in 2001, the award rate was: higher rate&mdash;3,142 (33.7 per cent.); lower rate&mdash;4,500 (48.2 per cent.); and disallowed&mdash;1,691 (18.1 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid=".754W.9/3">For the period October to December 2002, there were 323 applications for a reconsideration and 124 appeals at Bristol Disability Benefit Centre <sup>2</sup> . For the corresponding period in 2001, the figures were: 352 applications for a reconsideration and 178 appeals.</p>
	<p pid=".754W.9/4">A representative sample of customers (374) was contacted to obtain their views about the new claim form. Results show that 75 per cent. found the form easy to complete and that 25 per cent. did not. Of those that found the form easy to complete (282), 57 had no help to complete the form; 123 had help from family and friends; and 123 received help from various external agencies. Of the 25 per cent. (92) who experienced difficulty, 15 completed the form unaided; 46 were assisted by family and friends; and 31 received help from various external agencies. There is no comparable data for customer perception of the previous claim form. We will ensure that a copy of the final analysis of the pilot is placed in the Library when the evaluation is complete.</p>
	<p pid=".754W.9/5" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> We are unable to provide separate data for claims decided using the new claim form, as they are not treated separately from the rest of the new claims upon receipt. From September 2002, approximately 96 per cent. of new claims were made using the new claim form. The figures reflect all new claims in areas using the new claim pack as well as the old one, which remains available externally.</p>
	<p pid=".754W.9/6" class="indent"><sup>2</sup> Reconsiderations reduced by 8.2 per cent. in the test and appeals by 33.3 per cent. National comparisons for the same period showed a marginal increase in reconsiderations by 1.8 per cent. and a decrease in appeals of 3.8 per cent.</p>

This enables customers to receive fuller information about the basis of the decisions made.

	<p pid=".759W.2/1">We are ensuring that the benefit system encourages and promotes work where possible, and provides greater security for those for whom work is not an option.

	<p pid=".759W.2/2">The new permitted work rules, introduced from April 2002, provide a stepping stone to full-time work for people receiving incapacity benefit (IB). Anyone claiming IB can now work for up to and including &pound;20 a week for an unlimited period, or work for less than 16 hours a week and earn up to and including &pound;67.50 a week for 26 weeks. People with conditions that may be unlikely to improve over time, such as those with severe mental health problems, will continue to be able to work and earn up to &pound;67.50 a week for as long as they are receiving IB. People on incapacity benefits can also do as much voluntary work as they like without affecting their benefit entitlement.</p>
	<p pid=".759W.2/3">These arrangements have enabled people with many different disability-related barriers to work, including those with mental illness, to move successfully into jobs. However, there are a number of initiatives and pilots taking place looking at improving access to employment and job retention for people with a range of health conditions, including mental health.</p>
	<p pid=".759W.2/4">The Incapacity Benefit Reform Pilots, due to start in October 2003, aim to provide a range of help to people with health conditions to move off benefits through achieving sustained employment. An independent evaluation of each pilot will be conducted using a range of methodologies. Each evaluation will assess the overall impact of each pilot, and will also provide a range of quantitative and qualitative data on the success of each pilot in helping those with mental health conditions to gain and retain employment.</p>

	<p pid=".761W.8/1">The Government wants all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement. The Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG), introduced in April 1999, has boosted the income of the poorest pensioners. Since April 2003 a single pensioner is nearly &pound;18 a week better off in real terms than in 1997 from the MIG rises. A pensioner couple is nearly &pound;28 a week better off. We also want everyone who is entitled to this help to get it now, and as a result of our national MIG take up campaign over 150,000 pensioners are &pound;20 a week better off.</p>
	<p pid=".761W.8/2">Pension Credit when it is introduced in October 2003 will go even further and for the first time reward, not penalise, those pensioners who have saved for their retirement. Pensioner households entitled to Pension Credit will be &pound;400 a year better off on average. Following the introduction of Pension Credit the average pensioner household will be over &pound;1,250 a year better off than in 1997 due to the Governments personal tax and benefit changes. To ensure maximum take up of Pension Credit we are writing to pensioner households to explain Pension Credit and invite applications. In addition around 1.8 million people in receipt of the Minimum Income Guarantee have been advised they will be transferred automatically to Pension Credit. There will also be regional and national TV and press advertising.</p>

	<p pid=".762W.5/1">We estimate that around 350,000 employers are required to provide their staff with access to a stakeholder pension scheme. Latest data from the Association of British Insurers show that 344,983 employers had designated a stakeholder pension scheme by the end of March 2003. This indicates a compliance rate in excess of 90 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".762W.5/2">The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA) is responsible for regulating compliance with the workplace access requirements for stakeholder pension schemes. OPRA follows up all reports to it of non-compliance and will take action where compliance has not been achieved. OPRA also takes action to seek out non-compliance through surveys of employers, and by following up any employers that it knows, through its general pension duties, have closed down their company scheme and may therefore become required to offer staff access to a stakeholder pension scheme.</p>

On the strength of this evidence we have not felt it necessary to commission additional research. We do recognise, however, that factors such as condom failure mean that condoms do not provide 100 per cent. protection from infection, but when used correctly, they can substantially reduce the risk. Advice on the effective use of condoms is, therefore, provided through our national sexual health promotion and HIV prevention activities.</p>

The DSP test is approved as the standard reference method and is widely used in Europe.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.3/2">Temporary Prohibition Orders (TPOs), are placed on beds where tests for shellfish biotoxins are positive. Affected areas remain closed until two consecutive negative test results taken a week apart are observed.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.3/3">Atypical results in tests for DSP have been observed in some samples of cockles and mussels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since 2001. The FSA has put in place a programme of research work to investigate the cause of the atypical response to the DSP test and to assess its implications for human health. In the meantime, on the basis that the affected shellfish produce neurological symptoms that lead to death in mice within a few minutes, the FSA considers that the shellfish could be harmful and recommends the placing of TPOs on the affected beds in line with standard practice for known biotoxins. The FSA is keeping this policy under review and will use findings from the research work to determine whether its existing policy should be maintained. It expects most of the research to be completed later this summer.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.3/4">The majority of harvesting areas are open most of the time. In order to reduce the impact of the temporary cockle-bed closures on fishermen, while still protecting public health, the FSA has divided harvesting areas into zones, so that harvesting can continue from beds where tests results are negative.</p>

	<p pid=".778W.5/1">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has issued guidance on the anti-obesity drugs orlistat and sibutramine, treatment with which should be accompanied by specific concomitant advice, support and counselling on diet, physical activity and behavioural strategies. In July 2002 NICE also issued guidance which confirmed that surgical intervention was an appropriate treatment in some cases for the treatment of morbid obesity, when other options have proved unsuccessful. There are also 10 national health service obesity clinics in England.</p>
	<p pid=".778W.5/2">In 2001, the Department of Health published a National Quality Assurance Framework on Exercise Referral Systems. The document offers guidance to primary care and fitness professionals, who work together to offer tailored exercise and physical activity programmes to patients whose health would benefit from increased exercise.</p>
	<p pid=".778W.5/3">National service frameworks (NSFs) have been introduced&mdash;for example, for coronary heart disease (CHD), cancer, older people, diabetes and mental health&mdash;which set out the national standards that should be expected for treatment and services. The forthcoming NSF for children will address the health and social care needs of all children and will include the promotion of healthy eating and physical activity. Under the new arrangements for the NHS as outlined in &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power&quot;, primary care trusts (PCTs) allocate funding from their own devolved budgets to deliver national targets and milestones and to meet local priorities.</p>
	<p pid=".778W.5/4">The NHS Priorities and Planning Framework for 2003&ndash;06 includes targets on reducing CHD and diabetes. One of these targets requires practice-based registers and systematic treatment regimes, including appropriate advice on diet, physical activity and smoking, to cover the majority of patients at high risk of coronary heart disease, particularly those with hypertension, diabetes and a body mass index greater than 30 (i.e. people who are obese).</p>
	<p pid=".778W.5/5">NICE and the Health Development Agency are also undertaking collaborative work to develop guidance on the identification, prevention and management of obesity and maintenance of weight reduction.</p>

	<p pid=".779W.2/1">An evidence-based approach is being taken to tackle the prevention and management of obesity.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.2/2">The Health Development Agency (HDA) will publish its review of effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of obesity later this year. A systematic review carried out by the University of York in 1997 indicated that effective interventions for obesity include diet, physical activity and behavioural strategies for adults in combination where possible. The health technology assessment programme, a national programme of research established and funded by the Department of Health research and development programme, currently includes a systematic review of obesity treatments which will update the 1997 review, publication of which is expected in January 2004. Commercial programmes which meet the inclusion criteria of these reviews will be assessed.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.2/3">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), collaborating with the HDA, have been tasked by the Department to develop guidance on the identification, prevention and management of obesity and maintenance of weight reduction.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.2/4">Novel diets can be a variation of a &quot;very low calorie diet&quot; (VLCD): one which provides approximately less than 800 calories per day. A Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA 1987) report on VLCDs highlighted that a major criticism of them is that individuals frequently re-gain any weight lost after the diet has ended. A 1998 report by the Royal College of Physicians on the &quot;Clinical management of overweight and obese patients&quot; supported the findings of the COMA panel.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.2/5">Primary care has a particularly important role in the prevention and management of obesity. Local action is being delivered through the national service frameworks, which aim to improve standards of care, and the Priorities and Planning Framework.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.2/6">The Department has also funded the British Dietetic Association, as part of their &quot;Weight Wise&quot; campaign, to undertake project work on consumer messages and communication methods relating to weight management. The Department also contributed to the funding of the charity Weight Concern (through a Section 64 grant) to develop a &quot;toolkit&quot; on obesity for health professionals to use with patients in a group setting.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.2/7">The Food Standards Agency supports projects relating to diet and nutrition and promoting the uptake of a healthy balanced diet in order to maintain a healthy weight throughout life and have an important role in providing consumers with information on healthy eating.</p>

	<p pid=".782W.6/2">General practice plays a crucial role in the delivery of sexual health services. The new general medical services contract includes a new patient services guarantee to ensure patients have full access to all the range of services they currently enjoy, backed-up by a gross investment guarantee that will see investment in primary care increase by one-third by 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".782W.6/3">Patients will therefore not only continue to obtain contraceptive services and screening for sexually transmitted infections where appropriate, but primary care trusts will also be able to commission more specialised sexual health services that deliver services in line with the national strategy for sexual health and HIV.</p>

	<p pid=".782W.9/1">A new sun awareness initiative, &quot;SunSmart&quot; was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-27">27 March</phrase> by Cancer Research UK to make the public aware of the dangers of exposure to the sun. The campaign is based on the successful SunSmart campaign in Australia. The campaign has received funding of &pound;120,000 from the United Kingdom Health Departments this year. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign later in the year, with a view to deciding on future funding and campaigns.</p>
	<p pid=".782W.9/2">The SunSmart campaign consists of: a poster and leaflet for the public; Cancer Research UK website redesign and links to other stakeholders; branding and design of SunSmart; Cancer Research UK commissioned research at Centre for Social Marketing; and a part-time health promotion consultant at Cancer Research UK for the duration of the campaign.</p>
	<p pid=".782W.9/3">The campaign's aim is to increase the profile of the issue of skin cancer and methods of effective sun protection.</p>
	<p pid=".782W.9/4">The key objectives are to increase knowledge of the causes of skin cancer, to increase awareness of actions that can be taken to prevent skin cancer and to influence positively attitudes to sun protection.</p>
	<p pid=".782W.9/5">Subject to further funding, longer-term aims are to reduce sunlight exposure through changes in behaviour and environment, to increase the proportion of people reporting with early stage disease and decrease the proportion of people presenting with late tumours.</p>
	<p pid=".782W.9/6">The campaign's key messages have been disseminated by way of an alert to the campaign and mailshot pack of posters and leaflets to all GP surgeries and health promotion units nationally, an alert to the campaign and mailshot to secondary schools with 3,500 leaflets and posters; and a series of press events over summer 2003 with leaflets and posters targeted in cities and seaside resorts.</p>
	<p pid=".782W.9/7">We developed the &quot;SunSafe&quot; web pages last year, which were designed with children in mind, on the Department of Health website at <a href="http://www.doh.qov.uk/sunsafe">www.doh.qov.uk/sunsafe</a>. These will continue. Sun awareness information is also contained on the Wired For Health website at <a href="http://www.wiredforhealth.qov.uk/teaching/sun/intro.html">www.wiredforhealth.qov.uk/teaching/sun/intro.html</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".785W.2/1">The decision as to whether a particular product is a medicinal product is made by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, using the definition of that term in Article 1 of Directive 2001/83, relevant legal precedent and its own published guidance. Products, which are presented to the consumer for treating or preventing disease, would be classified as medicinal products. Sunburn is an adverse medical condition and direct or implied product claims to treat or prevent sunburn would bring the product within the definition of a medicinal product, regardless of the product's level of sun protection factor. Products that modify physiological function could also be classified as medicinal products.</p>
	<p pid=".785W.2/2">Certain creams or lotions with a sun protection factor of 15 or above, which are not licensed or marketed as medicines, may be assessed by the Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS) as being regarded as drugs for the management of specific conditions. Products so recommended by the ACBS may be prescribed under the National Health Service.</p>

	<p pid=".786W.2/1">The United Kingdom Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority (UKXIRA) advises my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, on issues about xenotransplantation (transplantation of live animal organs and cells into humans). The Department of Health commissioned a series of three reviews on different aspects of xenotransplantation on behalf of the UKXIRA between 1999 and 2001. The first two&mdash;on infection and on physiology&mdash;were published 2001 and 2002. A third review, on the legal and ethical aspects of xenotransplantation, was commissioned from Professor Sheila McLean, of the University of Glasgow, who was also a member of the UKXIRA from 1997 to 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".786W.2/2">The UKXIRA has considered the review and concluded that it made some useful discussion points and that the summary of the research papers should be placed on the UKXIRA website. While there are no plans to publish Professor McLean's whole review as a Department of Health/UKXIRA document, Professor McLean is free to publish it if she wishes.</p>
