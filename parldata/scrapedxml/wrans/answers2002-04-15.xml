	<p pid=".693W.6/1">We welcome the fact that many employers continue to provide occupational pensions on a voluntary basis to their employees. Final salary and money purchase schemes can both provide good incomes in retirement as long as sufficient contributions are made. When deciding what type of scheme to offer, an employer must take into account the costs of doing so and the long-term impact on their business. The Government want to create an environment in which employers can continue to provide occupational pension schemes. We want to remove unnecessary burdens on schemes. As part of this we have announced the replacement of the Minimum Funding Requirement. We have already introduced interim changes to the MFR designed to enable it to operate more effectively. We have commissioned Alan Pickering to report in summer 2002 on ways to simplify the overall burden of regulation on schemes and will be publishing proposals later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".694W.11/1">Poverty and social exclusion are complex concepts, affecting many aspects of people's lives; including their living standards, health, housing and quality of environment. The third &quot;Opportunity for all&quot; report sets out the Governments strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and presents the latest information on the indicators used to monitor progress against this strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.11/2">The Government's first priority was to address the immediate problem of pensioner poverty today. That is why we introduced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in April 1999 to provide money for the poorest pensioners as quickly as possible. 2,200 pensioners in the Cotswold constituency are receiving the MIG and over 2 million pensioners nationally benefit from the MIG.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.11/3">This Government has also introduced measures to ensure that all pensioners share in rising prosperity. From this April the basic state pension has risen by &pound;3 a week for single pensioners and &pound;4.80 for couples above inflation increases last year.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.11/4">This is in addition to the introduction of winter fuel payments, currently &pound;200, made to over 11 million pensioners and free TV licences for the over 75s which benefit some 3 million pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.11/5">From 2003 the pension credit will reward those who have worked hard and saved hard.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.11/6">We are also committed to tackling the longer term issues by helping people build up good second pensions. To this end we have introduced stakeholder pensions and improved the state earnings related pension scheme through the introduction of the state second pension. This will boost the additional state pension entitlement of &pound;14 million low and moderate earners. Additionally, for the first time 2 million carers and 2 million people whose working lives are disrupted by long-term illness or disability will also be able to build up entitlement to the state second pension.</p>

	<p pid=".695W.2/1">Restoring the earnings link does nothing to help poorer pensioners. We will be spending an extra &pound;6 billion a year in real terms on pensioners as a result of policies introduced since 1997. This includes &pound;2.5 billion more on the poorest third of pensioners. This is three times more than an earnings link since 1998 would have given them.</p>

Those making new or repeat claims to incapacity benefit in integrated Jobcentre Plus offices are required to attend a work-focused meeting.

By the end of October 2001 disabled person's tax credit was boosting the incomes of over 32,000 working people. From this month we have abolished the earnings limits in the independent living funds&mdash;both for these severely disabled people and their partners. At the same time we have extended help to people with savings of up to &pound;18,500 by increasing capital limits in the funds.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.9/4">We are also providing security for those who cannot work. The disability income guarantee helps around 130,000 of the poorest severely disabled people under 60 and some 34,000 families with severely disabled children. We have extended the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance to severely disabled three and three-year-olds benefiting an estimated 6,000 severely disabled children every year. And from this month we have raised the disabled child premium in the income-related benefits to &pound;35.50 a week giving an additional &pound;5 on top of normal uprating. This will benefit around 80,000 children in the neediest families.</p>

	<p pid=".706W.3/1">The Army Estates's Division is responsible for managing UK training areas only. Part of the Army's Land Warfare Centre (LWC) (formerly Training Support Command (Land)) has responsibility for the conduct of some overseas training. The LWC conducts training at four overseas facilities. These are in Germany, Canada, Belize and Kenya. In addition, the Field Army maintains a facility in Brunei, though this is not part of the LWC training estate. I should point out that the arrangements under which we use these facilities are different in every country and we are not responsible for the &quot;running&quot; of all the facilities in question.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.3/2">Since 1997 large numbers of British units have trained at these facilities but details are not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Foreign military personnel on attachment to British units and foreign observers have also participated in British exercises, but once again, details are not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.3/3">The LWC does offer jungle warfare training to members of foreign forces at its facilities in Belize. Since 1997 a total of 18 students have participated in this training, 12 from the Netherlands and six from the Ukraine.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.3/4">In terms of formed foreign units that use the overseas facilities, certain NATO countries are permitted to conduct training at the facilities that the LWC operate in Germany under arrangements contained within the NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). This agreement in itself authorises the UK to manage facilities which are owned by the German Federal Government. In summary, the countries whose forces are permitted to train at these UK managed facilities are Belgium, Canada, France, the Netherlands, the USA and of course Germany itself. Since 1997, the formed foreign units that have trained here are Bundeswehr Units (31 Airborne Brigade, 313 Infantry Parachute Battalion, 272 Airborne Attack Defence Battalion, Seven Armoured Recognisance Battalion, 270 Airborne Supplies Company); German Specialist Units (GSG and SEK (German Civil Police Special Operations)); Belgian Units (two (BE) Commando Battalion, Regiment Beveijing&mdash;five Linie, Regiment De Chasseurs Ardennais and one BE Parachute); Dutch Units (108 Company (Special Forces) and HQ 11 Air Mobile Brigade); United States Units (75th Rangers) and multinational formations conducting Allied Rapid Reaction Corps training.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.3/5">Because of the different arrangements that prevail, if forces from foreign nations wish to use the facilities that LWC use in Canada, Belize and Kenya, that would be matter for agreement between that country and the respective host nation. This would also apply if a country other than those specified in the SOFA wished to train on the British managed facilities in Germany.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.3/6">The Ministry of Defence continues to play a role in fostering human rights through the Defence Diplomacy Mission which aims to dispel hostility, build and maintain trust and assist in the development of democratically accountable armed forces thereby making a significant contribution to conflict prevention. A key contribution to the fulfilment of this mission is provided by military training. Details of the Defence Diplomacy Mission including its objectives and scope is published in the MOD Policy Paper No 1; Defence Diplomacy (2001) a copy of which is in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".708W.5/1">Information regarding the number of deployments undertaken by UK regular forces is not available in the format requested.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.5/2">As regards lengths of tours, tours in Bosnia, Kosovo and the Falkland Islands are considered as operational deployments. In the main, Royal Air Force operational deployments are four months in duration, whereas Army and Navy operational deployments are usually for six months. There are exceptions, however, such as those posts identified as continuity posts that require a deployment of 12 months duration. For service personnel posted to Cyprus and Gibraltar, which are garrison deployments, a tour length of 24 months is the norm.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.5/3">The costs for operational deployments are recorded differently from those for garrison deployments. For costing purposes, the Falkland Islands are treated as a garrison.</p>

It remains our intention to man the Army to achieve this, although the overall manpower requirement is dynamic and subject to continuing review in light of evolving doctrine, new technology and equipment and possible changes to the operating environment.</p>

	<p pid=".711W.8/1">The Defence Vetting Agency is the largest government organisation carrying out national security checks on people to allow them to be employed in jobs involving access to sensitive information or assets. These jobs range throughout the Ministry of Defence and armed services, a number of other Government Departments, and defence contractor companies. This year will see the Agency emerge from a challenging modernisation and rationalisation programme that started soon after it was created in 1997. The completion of the programme will create a much more responsive, integrated organisation, able to exploit the capabilities of modern information technology to the benefit of its customers. The chief executive has been set the following key targets.</p>

	<p pid=".713W.8/1">On current plans, HMS Albion will be available for operational tasking early in 2003, and she is expected to be fully operational by mid 2003. HMS Fearless would have needed to undergo and assisted maintenance period at an estimated cost of about &pound;1.5 million to allow her to continue in service for a year beyond her decommissioning date. The assisted maintenance period represented the minimum package of work required to keep HMS Fearless in service. Given the age of the vessel, the possibility of additional unplanned repair during this period could not be ruled out. The cost of re-commissioning HMS Intrepid, the sister ship of HMS Fearless, which last put to sea in 1994, would greatly exceed the cost of HMS Fearless's foregone assisted maintenance period. It would not therefore make financial sense to re-commission HMS Intrepid.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.8/2">The requirement for a docking and heavy lift capability needs to be considered in the prevailing operational context at any particular time. Our assessment is that until HMS Albion enters service, the circumstances in which it is most likely that the UK wold be involved in an operation requiring a dedicated amphibious assault capability would be where we were acting as part of a coalition force. In such a scenario, depending on the requirements of the operation, a docking and heavy lift capability could be provided from within the forces of our coalition partners to enhance the UK's specialist amphibious capabilities of HMS Ocean and the five landing ships logistic. HMS Ocean is available for amphibious force tasking until October this year when she is due, on current plans, to commence a docking period before she again becomes available for tasking early in 2003. However until HMS Albion enters service, the amphibious assault capability will, if operational imperatives dictate, be filled in part by other platforms.</p>

Historical information on the type of school staff attended is held only in some cases, hence the data are incomplete. The recruitment section monitors ethnicity, gender and disability statistics at each stage of the recruitment process. Since 1995, the recruitment section records have identified the type of school attended for those candidates at policy and operational entry points who successfully gain entrance to the diplomatic service. Before 1995, recruitment data on the type of school were collected only on policy entrants. These figures are published annually in the departmental report.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-04-15.48965.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-04-15.727W.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1223" speakername="Clare Short" colnum="727W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020415/text/20415w10.htm#20415w10.html_spnew1">
	<p pid=".727W.3/1">There are approximately three million Palestinians living in the West Bank Gaza Strip, nearly half of whom are registered refugees. Following three consecutive years of rising real per capita income from 1997 to 2000, the Palestinian economy has been hit hard by the conflict. Surveys have barely been able to keep up with the level of damage inflicted on the Palestinian economy since the start of the Intifada in 2000. Damage to infrastructure, loss of life and strict closure activities has led to a dramatic decline in economic activity, particularly as Palestinians have been denied access to their jobs over the Israeli border. During 2001, it is estimated that GNI had declined by 12&ndash;15 per cent., unemployment risen by up to 50 per cent., and the numbers of people living below of the poverty (US$2 a day) increased to 50 per cent..</p>
	<p pid=".727W.3/2">The damage inflicted during the recent escalation of violence, in terms of destruction of infrastructure (including basic services), damage to private property and government buildings will take some time to quantify. But it has further desecrated livelihoods, disrupted the delivery of water and sanitation, health and education services, and undermined the institutions of government.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.3/3">We are working with others to try to determine the full extent of the damage and the humanitarian consequences. But international efforts remain hampered by restricted access. It is clear that there will be no improvements in the situation without an end to violence and a return to negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.3/4">I have kept our programme of development assistance under close review. The long-term goal remains unchanged&mdash;the establishment of a viable Palestinian State, which can co-exist peacefully with Israel. The strategy also remains valid: to provide help for immediate and emergency needs while at the same time working for longer-term sustainable and institutional development.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.3/5">The economic and social decline over the past 18 months has required a review of the balance between longer-term goals and urgent needs. We have sought to provide emergency assistance in ways that can contribute to sustainable development. As soon as possible we will work for a rapid assessment of the current situation and set priorities for action so that all agencies can respond in a co-ordinated and effective manner.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.3/6">DFID is committed to support the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA) in meeting the needs of Palestinian refugees. We have steadily increased our financial and technical support to UNRWA, from &pound;6 million in 1997 to &pound;35 million in 2001, in response to the rising needs. I am in contact with Commissioner General Peter Hansen about the impact of the Israeli Defence Force incursions to many UNRWA camps, and what additional support is required for urgent actions. We have provided &pound;5 million for the 2002 Emergency Appeal and will consider urgently what further support we can give, on top of our planned contribution for this year to UNRWA's core activities.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.3/7">It is hard to quantify the impact of violence on UK development assistance. Closures and violence have adversely affected all programmes. It has proved difficult for international staff to travel to the region. In addition, closures and violence have hindered the movement of project staff. Prior to the recent incursions, we were confident that projects would meet their goals, albeit in a longer time period. We will need to look afresh at the impact on our programmes of recent intense incursions.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.3/8">The UK does not provide any development assistance to Israel.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.3/9">The Government has serious concerns for the safety of civilians and the access of medical, humanitarian and consular aid. We have made clear to Israel at the highest level that we expect them to ensure that medical and humanitarian organisations and Consular staff have uninterrupted access to those in need. The Foreign Secretary stressed these concerns to Israeli Foreign Minister Peres in a telephone call on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-10">10 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.3/10">The Government has repeatedly called on the Palestinian authority to take determined action to prevent terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.3/11">We have called on both Israel and the Palestinian Authority to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1402, including the establishment of a meaningful ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from palestinian towns and the implementation of the Tenet plan and Mitchell recommendations, with the aim of resuming negotiations on a political settlement.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.3/12">We have tried and trusted mechanisms in place to provide security requirements for UK aid workers. DFID currently employs three people in the Consulate General in Jerusalem, and one secondee to the local EC office. UK and other nationals are also contracted under DFID- funded projects.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.3/13">Those who work in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are aware they are operating in an unstable environment. All who travel to the area are fully briefed on the security situation and travel restrictions. UK nationals based permanently in the WBGS appear on the Consulate General Register, and the Consulate General is in regular contact, especially in times of crisis.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.3/14">There are no aid-funded workers in Israel.</p>
	<p pid=".727W.3/15">We judge that the risks posed to aid personnel in other Middle Eastern countries&mdash;Jordan, Egypt, Yemen and Iraq in DFID's context&mdash;are less acute. However, we, and the Foreign Office, continue to monitor the safety of people in the region closely.</p>

	<p pid=".733W.6/1">DOE circular 18/84 makes it clear that the method of written representations will be suitable for most cases. But where there is evidence of interest by other parties the dispute may be resolved by either a meeting of the representatives of the local planning authority and the developing Department or through a non-statutory public local inquiry. Planning inquiries for cases decided by the Secretary of State follow the Town and Country Planning (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2000. But an inquiry held under the arrangements set out in DOE circular 18/84 is non-statutory and so it is not bound by these rules. However, it is expected that any such inquiry would follow the spirit of these rules so far as practicable and that interested parties would be given an opportunity to express their views.</p>

Each year, we conduct a survey of quarrying known as the Annual Minerals Raised Inquiry, which is sent to all quarries having extant planning permission, for the purpose of determining the amount of material being quarried. Over the period 1990 to 2000, the number of such quarries dealing with either stone or sand and gravel declined slightly from around 1,780 to around 1,710. However, over the same period, the number of people present within quarries and covered by the provisions of the Mines and Quarries Acts 1954 and 1969 declined in these quarries by some 40 per cent. from around 31,500 to around 18,000.</p>

	<p pid=".756W.5/2" class="indent">European Community directive 95&ndash;46 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data was implemented by the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

	<p pid=".756W.5/4">The Home Office also has responsibility for the following European Community measures which have been formally adopted but which have not required any specific implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".756W.5/5" class="indent">Council decision establishing a European Refugee Fund for the financing of projects relating to conditions for reception of displaced persons; integration for recognised refugees and others with stable and lasting forms of international protection; and voluntary repatriation for persons who have applied for asylum or some other form of international protection and been refused. Formally adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-28">28 September 2000</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".756W.5/6" class="indent">Council regulation concerning the establishment of &quot;EURODAC&quot; for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention. Formally adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-11">11 December 2000</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".757W.5/1">We are committed to ensuring that violent offenders are punished effectively. Severe penalties are available to the courts to deal with offenders who carry knives. For instance, any person who has an article with a blade or point in a public place or on school premises can be sent to prison for up to two years. It is also an offence for any person to have an offensive weapon in a public place or on school premises, or for any person to sell knives to people under 16.</p>
	<p pid=".757W.5/2">The police give high priority to action against knife crime. For example, the Metropolitan police are using an intelligence-led approach in exercising their powers to stop and search people who they believe may be carrying knives, and are working with door staff to tackle the problem at licensed premises. Largely as a result of these initiatives, the Metropolitan police have arrested and charged 17.8 per cent. more people for carrying knives and offensive weapons over the year to February 2002 than in the previous year.</p>

	<p pid=".758W.2/1">Powers are already available to individual transport operators and the criminal justice system to ban those convicted of violence while using public transport systems from using public transport. Transport operators can take action in respect of preventing violent individuals from using the transport system by taking out civil injunctions. Football Banning Orders against individuals can also be applied for through the Crown Prosecution Service. Under proposals in the Police Reform Bill, the British Transport police will be able to apply directly to the courts for Anti Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) in order for them to deal more effectively with particular problems of anti-social behaviour. It is also proposed to give criminal courts powers to place restrictions through ASBOs on the actions of offenders imprisoned for anti-social behaviour related offences once they are back in the community.</p>

	<p pid=".759W.2/1">The recently published White Paper &quot;Policing a New Century: A Blueprint for Reform&quot;, reaffirmed the Government's view that one of the priorities for the police service is to manage ill-health retirement effectively. The Police Negotiating Board are considering ways to deliver a fair and more consistent approach towards early retirement due to ill health. This should enable forces to reduce the level of ill-health retirement and match the performance of the best quartile of forces by 2005. The measures under consideration include the Police Negotiating Board issuing joint guidance to police authorities and senior management to ensure that wherever possible officers continue in employment where they are capable of performing sufficient duties to make their retention operationally justifiable.</p>
	<p pid=".759W.2/2">In the White Paper the Government also announced that they will establish a national occupational health strategy for the police service, which should assist forces to manage cases of ill health more effectively at the outset.</p>

	<p pid=".762W.11/1">Forming an accurate estimate of the levels of trafficking in people is problematic due to the hidden nature of the act. There is currently no accurate, reliable data in existence with the United Kingdom or the European Union. A Home Office research study &quot;Stopping Traffic&quot; published in 2000, indicated that the number of women and children trafficked into the United Kingdom for the purposes of sexual exploitation was likely to be in the range of 140 to 1,400 per annum.</p>
	<p pid=".762W.11/2">As there is at present no specific offence of trafficking, the police and other law enforcement agencies are not able to say how many organisers and beneficiaries of trafficking have been investigated, arrested or prosecuted. However, we are introducing a new stopgap offence of trafficking for prostitution in the forthcoming Nationality Immigration and Asylum Bill, which will carry a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. We will follow the stopgap offence with further legislation to cover those being trafficked for both labour and sexual exploitation. These offences will go wider than is possible in the immigration legislation and will cover people who are trafficked within the United Kingdom, as well as those who are brought here from abroad. The Government's aim is to tackle the organised criminal groups who are behind the trafficking, not the victims of this heinous trade.</p>

	<p pid=".763W.0/1">The Home Department has set out its strategy on trafficking in the recently published White Paper &quot;Secure Borders, Safe Haven&quot;, comprising our plans on legislation, enforcement, international co-operation and prevention and support for victims. Trafficking of people involves arranging their movement for the purposes of exploitation. The exploitation may take the form of bonded labour or servitude, or commercial sexual exploitation. It is often accompanied by violence, or threats of violence, against the victim, or their family. Trafficking is often associated with illegal immigration but does not necessarily involve crossing a frontier. Our strategy takes account of those who are trafficked into and throughout the United Kingdom, as well as those trafficked within the country.</p>
	<p pid=".763W.0/2">We recognise the need to offer the victims of trafficking particular support to help them escape their circumstances, and facilitate them to assist law enforcement to tackle organised criminal gangs behind the trafficking. We will make special arrangements for their protection and support. Where victims are not entitled to remain in the United Kingdom, we will consider whether it is appropriate to allow them to stay here. If they wish to return home, we will work with the voluntary sector to help them do so, provide initial counselling and ensure they have suitable accommodation to return to and to help them reintegrate in to their own community. The White Paper also sets out our intention to develop a best practice &quot;toolkit&quot; on victims of trafficking, which will act as a guide for immigration officers, police and others potentially dealing with victims of this heinous crime.</p>

	<p pid=".777W.15/1">A structural and cultural reform of the national health service is currently taking place with the aim of shifting the balance of power towards frontline organisations, and within organisations to patients and staff. From <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, primary care trusts, local organisations run by clinicians and local people, are responsible for improving health, securing services and integrating health and social care locally. By 2004, these organisations will receive 75 per cent. of the NHS budget to enable them to do so effectively, which constitutes considerable devolution in the running of the NHS. As responsibility is devolved to the frontline, the Department will develop new ways of working and step back from operational issues.</p>
	<p pid=".777W.15/2">A package of earned autonomy freedoms and the potential to achieve foundation status will also become available for the best performing primary care and NHS trusts. This will be another way in which the Government devolves decision-making and operational management in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".780W.0/3">The complexity of the analysis and the need for additional work led to a longer timescale than anticipated. The Health Departments and the FSA held a joint stakeholders meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-18">18 March 2002</phrase> to discuss the issue and help inform policy. The policy options will be considered by the FSA Board as well as Health Ministers.</p>

	<p pid=".780W.3/1">The &quot;in vitro&quot; diagnostic medical device (IVD) regulations (SI2000 No. 1315) ensure that IVDs that have a specific medical purpose meet relevant essential safety, quality and performance requirements before being placed on the market with a CE mark. The regulations came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-07">7 June 2000</phrase> with a transition period until December 2003. During this time, manufacturers may choose on which basis to place their device on the market. The regulations require that manufacturers of IVDs bearing the CE mark must be able to demonstrate that the device will achieve the manufacturer's claimed performance.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.3/2">The Department has published two voluntary codes of practice and guidance for genetic tests being sold directly to the public. These set out broad requirements in areas such as: peer-reviewed evidence of value, accreditation and quality assurance in testing laboratories, consent, confidentiality, sample and information storage, and customer information. Under the &quot;Code of Practice and Guidance on Human Genetic Testing Services Supplied Direct to the Public&quot; (September 1997) suppliers notify the Human Genetics Commission (HGC) of their proposed service and HGC publishes a statement of conformance with the Code. In addition, those supplying genetic paternity testing services are expected to comply with the Code of Practice and Guidance on Genetic Paternity Testing Services&quot; (March 2001). All Government and public bodies commissioning paternity testing services are expected, so far as is practical, to ensure that those supplying services comply with this code.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.3/3">Ministers have asked HGC to conduct a review of the provision of genetic tests offered directly to the public, and to report by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.3/4">Accreditation for UK laboratories providing diagnostic testing for patients is voluntary. It is mostly overseen by Clinical Pathology Accreditation (UK) Ltd. (CPA). CPA standards are compatible with international standards (ISO). Laboratories registered with CPA are subject to on-site peer inspection to ensure compliance with these standards.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.3/5">Laboratory accreditation is now part of the quality standards compiled by the Genetics Commissioning Advisory Group (GenCAG) and endorsed by the Joint Medical Genetics Committee of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Pathologists and the British Society for Human Genetics. Commissioners and NHS trusts purchasing genetic testing services are recommended to purchase from accredited laboratories.</p>
	<p pid=".780W.3/6">NHS Commissioners may evaluate new service developments before agreeing to fund them. As part of the national NHS genetic testing network, consideration is being given to mechanisms to evaluate genetic tests before being considered for NHS funding. There is further scope for evaluation through the Health Technology Assessment programme which produces research information on the clinical and cost-effectiveness and broader impact of health technologies including diagnostic techniques.</p>

	<p pid=".781W.2/1">Patients may seek advice from their General Practitioner, other health care workers or NHS Direct. Specialist NHS services for genetics are concentrated in Regional Genetic Centres (RGCs), to which patients may be referred as appropriate. Those receiving genetic tests as part of NHS clinical genetic services normally receive counselling and advice before and, where appropriate, after testing.</p>
	<p pid=".781W.2/2">The Government response to the 3rd Report of the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology 1994&ndash;5, stated that: 'The Government agrees with the Committee.. that people who seek diagnosis of a genetic condition of late onset, i.e in adult life, should be given adequate information about the medical and social implications of the findings and offered sufficient counselling, in advance of any testing, and subsequently if the result of a test is positive'.</p>
	<p pid=".781W.2/3">The Secretary of State announced in January 2002 how part of the &pound;30 million investment in genetics would be used to pump-prime additional capacity within existing genetics services. This will enable more people concerned about familial disease to receive advice, testing and counselling.</p>
	<p pid=".781W.2/4">Patients have a fundamental legal and ethical right to determine what happens to their own bodies. Valid consent to treatment is therefore central to all forms of healthcare, from providing personal care to undertaking major surgery. Patients may indicate consent non-verbally (for example by presenting their arm for their pulse to be taken), orally, or in writing. For the consent to be valid, the patient must: be competent to take the particular decision; have received sufficient information to take it; and not be acting under duress.</p>
	<p pid=".781W.2/5">The Department has issued guidance on consent, and this should be consulted for advice on the current law and good practice requirements in seeking consent. This includes what to do when a patient lacks the capacity to give consent to an intervention. The relevant documents are available at &quot;<a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/consent">www.doh.gov.uk/consent</a>&quot;. Health professionals should also be aware of any guidance on consent issued by their own regulatory bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".781W.2/6">Genetic information, like most other patient information, is held in confidence by health professionals and is also subject to the requirements of Data Protection legislation. This means that, unless exceptional circumstances apply, individuals should be informed about how the information will be used and that the information should only be disclosed to a third party with the consent of the person to whom it refers.</p>
	<p pid=".781W.2/7">The Department published a national confidentiality strategy for the NHS &quot;(&quot;Building the Information Core: Protecting &amp; Using Patient Information: A Strategy for the NHS&quot;)&quot; in December 2001. The development of systems and processes to record and respect patient preferences including objections to disclosures is a key element of the strategy. In addition, the Human Genetics Commission (HGC) has been considering issues associated with the storage, protection and use of personal genetic information and will be reporting to Ministers later this spring.</p>

	<p pid=".786W.2/2">The Department has no plans to ask the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) to carry out research specifically into illnesses possibly caused by exposure to depleted uranium. However, NRPB does undertake research that is relevant to the assessment of the risks to health from such exposures. In particular NRPB has carried out extensive research into the distribution of uranium in body organs, its retention and excretion, following inhalation of a wide range of uranium compounds. It has also developed computer models that enable the concentration of uranium in the various organs and resulting radiation doses to be calculated. Depleted uranium is mildly radioactive, and NRPB's research programme on the effects of ionising radiation in general is therefore relevant to assessment of the radiological risks from exposure to depleted uranium.</p>

There would be labelling costs falling on manufacturers of all food supplements, but these would be substantially offset by a two-year transitional period.

	<p pid=".787W.8/2">A very small increase in the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for women who take oral contraceptives (OCs) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been recognised for many years. Accordingly, OCs and HRT are contraindicated in women who have a personal or family history of DVT and who are therefore most at risk.</p>
	<p pid=".787W.8/3">In 1995 several new studies suggested that a slightly increased risk of DVT was associated with newer OCs (the so-called third generation pills that contain desogestrel or gestodene as progestogen) compared to older ones (so-called second generation pills that contain levonorgestrel as progestogen). This issue was considered by the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) in 1995, 1996 and 2001 and by the Medicines Commission in 1998 as more data became available. They have advised that for every 100,000 women who use OCs for a year, 10&ndash;20 more cases of DVT may be expected to occur relative to healthy non-users. This increase in risk is less than the risk of DVT associated with pregnancy (an extra 55 cases of DVT for every 100,000 pregnancies).</p>
	<p pid=".787W.8/4">Warnings about the risk of DVT in women who take OCs have been in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPCs) for health professionals and the patient information leaflet (PIL) for women for many years. These warnings were updated with respect to the increased risk of DVT in women who use third, as opposed to second, generation pills in early 1999 and were included in the BNF (British National Formulary). In 2001, product information for all combined oral contraceptives was further updated to inform women and their health professionals that their risk of DVT is greatest in the first year they ever use an OC. Comprehensive information about the risk of DVT with use of oral contraceptives was provided to health professionals and women in a Dear Doctor letter in 1995, in an article in the Medicine Control Agency's (MCA) safety bulletin &quot;Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance&quot; in 1999 and on the MCA's website in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".787W.8/5">With respect to HRT, evidence suggesting an increased risk for DVT was considered by CSM in 1996. They advised that an additional 10&ndash;20 women may experience a DVT out of every 100,000 women who use HRT compared with healthy non-HRT users of a similar age. The SPCs and PILs for HRT products and the BNF were updated in line with this advice in 1998. Health professionals were informed of the risk of DVT in association with use of HRT in an article in &quot;Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance&quot; which contained a pull-out sheet with information specifically for women.</p>
	<p pid=".787W.8/6">In addition to targeted information, every pack of oral contraceptives and HRT contains a PIL for women. These clearly inform women that they should not use OCs or HRT if they have a personal or family history of DVT. They also inform women of their additional risk of DVT compared with non-users. PILs for the second and third generation OCs describe what DVT is and how it is caused, its potential severity and possible outcome. They also list the symptoms of DVT and advise women to stop taking their pills immediately and seek medical help in the event of their occurrence. In addition, they advise women to stop taking their pills prior to periods of prolonged immobilisation, especially surgery and to re-start only when fully re-mobilised. Any woman wishing to take OCs is encouraged to discuss the risks of DVT with her doctor and, provided she understands and accepts those risks, to jointly choose the treatment that is best suited to her in light of her individual medical history.</p>

	<p pid=".792W.0/2">We do not collect waiting times for an MRI scan. The Government acknowledges the importance of diagnostic procedures, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and is encouraging hospitals to streamline their services so that tests are carried out, and a diagnosis made, as quickly as possible. The length of time that a patient may have to wait for any scan is dependent on their clinical condition. Emergency cases need to be seen immediately. Other cases will be carried out as quickly as possible, however this is dependent on the clinical priority of all the remaining patients waiting to be scanned. To increase the capacity of diagnostic services, funding has been made available for the provision of new and replacement scanners. By 2004, approximately 100 MRI scanners and 200 CT scanners will be provided through central purchasing programmes. In addition to this, workforce initiatives are underway that aim to improve recruitment and retention of staff.</p>
