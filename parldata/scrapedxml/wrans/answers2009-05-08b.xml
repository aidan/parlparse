	<p pid="b.437W.9/16">The Department's exclusions guidance sets out those governing bodies must review all permanent exclusions from their school, and fixed period exclusions that would result in a pupil missing a public examination. It also states that the governing body should try to meet before the date of the examination, or if exceptionally this is not practical, that the chair of governors&mdash;using his or her powers to act in an emergency&mdash;may consider the exclusion and decide whether or not to reinstate the pupil. Where a pupil is excluded, depending on the nature and seriousness of the exclusion, the governing body/management committee may exercise its discretion to allow an excluded pupil on the premises for the sole purpose of taking a public examination.</p>

	<p pid="b.439W.3/1">Local authorities are responsible for planning the creation of new school places and are under a duty to ensure sufficient school places are available to meet local needs. The Department allocates Basic Need funding to enable local authorities to provide the additional places needed in response to a growth in pupil numbers. Allocations are based on each authority's own pupil projections which they provide to the Department annually through the Surplus Places Survey. To enable authorities to plan deployment of their resources, these allocations are set for three years at the start of each spending review period. In addition, in 2008 the Department operated a &quot;safety-valve&quot; mechanism for funding new pupil places, to deliver additional funding for authorities facing exceptional circumstances because of the rate of growth of pupil numbers.</p>

The scheme is one part of a comprehensive package of measures to help households at risk of repossession.</p>
	<p pid="b.451W.8/2">Based on the January-March 2009 monitoring returns, 452 households had applied for and were being actively considered for Mortgage Rescue assistance during this period, of which 57 cases were in the final stage of the process (referral to the Registered Social Landlord) as at the end of March. It can take between three and four months for a household to complete the process from the time they approach a local authority because it is similar to that of selling a property, involving procedures such as property valuation and negotiations between the parties involved. As at the end of March, one household in the Government Office East region had completed the process, whereby a housing association had agreed to purchase their property and enable the household to remain in their own home as tenants.</p>
	<p pid="b.451W.8/3">Headline data from the first monitoring returns submitted by local authorities implementing the scheme were published on the CLG website on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-30">30 April 2009</phrase>:</p>

	<p pid="b.452W.5/1">To be eligible for Homeowners Mortgage Support, households need to have been making regular payments, but not necessarily in full, in agreement with their lender for at least five months. This demonstrates that the borrower is able to continue to make ongoing payments at a reduced level before entering the scheme, and provides an opportunity for other forbearance options to be considered first. If a household has missed a payment or payments without the agreement of their lender, they can still become eligible by making regular payments in agreement with their lender for five months. These arrangements reflect the fact that Homeowners Mortgage Support is designed to help households experiencing a temporary reduction in their income. Other forms of assistance, such as Support for Mortgage Interest or the Mortgage Rescue Scheme, are available for households who have experienced a complete loss of income.</p>

	<p pid="b.457W.0/1">From time to time, the Department receives representations about the mental health services provided for members of the armed forces. I am not aware of any recent representations specifically on psychometric testing of personnel prior to deployment. The Department's evidence-based view is that such selection processes do not work and would be counter-productive.</p>
	<p pid="b.457W.0/2">Recent research is summarised in the King's Centre for Military Health Research &quot;Ten Year Report&quot; published in 2006 by the University of London and covering a decade's worth of research concerning the health of UK service personnel and veterans. This explains that selecting out individuals who might be at increased risk of developing mental health difficulties prior to recruitment or deployment is a flawed strategy because, whether one uses clinical interviews or questionnaire-based methods, it is impossible to distinguish reliably between those who will go on to experience psychological difficulties and those who will not. An ineffective selection programme would not just be costly and labour intensive but is likely to have adverse consequences both for individuals who would unnecessarily be prevented from deploying when doing so is part of their job, and for the operational efficiency of the armed forces by unnecessarily reducing the numbers of personnel available to carry out operational tasks.</p>

In 2003 the MRC carried out a review of published research into UK Gulf veterans' illness and the main recommendation was that research aimed at improving the long term health and well-being of Gulf veterans with persistent symptoms should take priority. A copy of the report is published on the MRC web site found at the following link;</p>

	<p pid="b.458W.8/2">The &quot;existing use&quot; value of the asset for Defence purposes was last estimated as &pound;17 million in 2005. The current market value of the asset is different, but difficult to assess, given current market conditions. However, it is not Ministry of Defence practice to release assessments of market value, as to do so could influence the market and not serve the interests of taxpayers generally.</p>
	<p pid="b.458W.8/3">If the Haslar site were to be &quot;mothballed&quot; the estimated annual maintenance cost would be less than &pound;1 million. However, the Department is planning a marketing campaign for this summer and is committed to finding a purchaser who can deliver a viable and sustainable future for the Haslar site.</p>
	<p pid="b.458W.8/4">To this end Defence Estates is working closely with Gosport borough council. In particular, we are keen to ensure that plans for the re-use of the site have regard to the historical setting of the listed buildings and grounds. An inquiry led by the Prince's Regeneration Trust last November examined the opportunities and potential. All proposals to acquire the site will be carefully evaluated, particularly as regards their approach towards conservation and heritage issues.</p>

The Energy Networks Association, working with the Government and the electricity industry, has produced a report on the steps that can be taken to further safeguard electricity substations.

All companies have considered resilience in their draft business plans, which were submitted to Ofwat in August. The plans vary, as expected, reflecting the size of the company and the specific challenges presented by their locations. In total, almost &pound;1 billion of investment has been proposed to increase resilience.</p>

	<p pid="b.460W.5/1">It is impossible to quantify leakage in this way. Where leaks occur, they can be potentially very serious and lead to breaches. British Waterways therefore acts quickly to plug any leaks when they are identified. Some seepage is, however, natural on both canals and rivers. With regard to erosion, canals are by definition man-made, engineered structures which do not suffer from erosion&mdash;as opposed to wear and tear&mdash;in the same way as rivers. This is in part due to the materials used in their construction, the slower flow of water and the strict speed limit imposed on waterway craft.</p>

	<p pid="b.473W.3/1">For reasons of cost, I am only able to answer this question on behalf of the Home Office. It is Home Office policy to ensure that all recruits satisfy identity, background, right to work and unspent criminal conviction record checks including, for UK nationals, details of criminal convictions for recordable offences which have been notified to the UK authorities by either EU member states or through Interpol channels. This fully complies with the Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS) issued by the Cabinet Office. In addition, using Home Office records, details are verified to ensure that any applicant has the right to work and that there are no integrity concerns. In addition, enhanced disclosures provided by the Criminal Records Bureau or Disclosure Scotland are required for those Home Office staff who work with children or vulnerable adults. We require information about both spent and unspent convictions for staff that are employed in a National Security Vetting (NSV) post.</p>
	<p pid="b.473W.3/2">When a foreign national seeks employment with the Home Office we seek to establish whether the individual has a criminal record in the UK as well as in their country of origin. It is not always possible to obtain this information from overseas. As set out in the Government Response to Sir Ian Magee's Review of Criminality Information published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-04">4 December 2008</phrase>, we aim to improve the sharing of electronic information and to prioritise agreements on the sharing of criminality information for employment vetting and barring purposes with other EU countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.473W.3/3">Outside the EU we are taking a risk based approach to identify those countries that need to be a priority for information exchange for this purpose. However, in most cases where individuals have lived abroad during the preceding three years, if we cannot obtain a confident assessment about the absence of criminal records, the individual concerned will not be permitted to work in the Home Office and will be rejected on residency grounds.</p>

The &quot;Learning Revolution&quot; sets out proposals that will help achieve this goal, including increasing the availability of free and low cost spaces for learning, launching a &pound;20 million transformation fund to reach out to new and different learners through partnership and innovation, setting up a support package for local learning champions and harnessing the potential of broadcasting and technology to support and enhance learning.</p>

Post-19, a new Skills Funding Agency will take up the challenge of delivering on our 2020 skills ambitions (as set out in the Leitch Review) by leading a demand-led system delivering a range of skills training at a time and place that suits both learners and employers.</p>

The status of a prisoner as a smoker or non-smoker should be established as part of reception procedures. Thereafter, arrangements must be made to place non-smokers and smokers in separate accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.3/2">Occasionally it may be necessary to locate a smoker and a non-smoker together temporarily when there is no other accommodation available. The smoker should not be actively smoking in the cell and will be offered aids to help them refrain. There are no formal arrangements for recording this centrally, although it would normally be recorded on the individual prisoner's history sheet. Information as to the number of smokers and non-smokers sharing cells on any given date could be obtained only by examining the record of every prisoner in custody at the time, at disproportionate cost.</p>
