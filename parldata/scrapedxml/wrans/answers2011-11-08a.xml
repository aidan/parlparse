The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has so far received, and replied to, over 2000 emails expressing concern for the closure of the Baha'i Institute of Higher Education. The closure of the Baha'i Institute of Higher Education and arrest of members of its staff form part of a wider pattern of harassment of Baha'is in Iran, including the imprisonment of Baha'i leaders. We regularly raise these issues with the Iranian authorities, including when I met the Iranian charg&#233; d'affaires in August this year. We will continue to press the Iranian Government to accord all their people the right to freedom of religion. With our EU partners, the UK has taken co-ordinated action to address Iran's human rights record, imposing travel bans and asset freezes on over 60 Iranians responsible for human rights violations, including Government Ministers and members of the judiciary.</p>

The British ambassador to Tel Aviv most recently raised the issue on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-26">26 October</phrase> during his visit to the Israel Prison Service complex, at the invitation of the Public Security Minister, where there are around 4,500 security detainees.

	<p pid="a.164W.2/1">As in many parts of the Middle East and North Africa, Yemenis have been energised by popular protests starting in Tunisia which have pressed for democratic change. From late January 2011 we have witnessed the growth of widespread protest movements across Yemen. On the anti-Government side these have been largely made up of students, some politically affiliated and civil society and have received the support of the official opposition grouping JMP, and elements of the armed forces. At the same time we have also seen large pro-Government demonstrations in support of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.2/2">The anti-Government protest movement across Yemen has made plain its principal demand, that President Saleh step down. The Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) Initiative meets this demand in its outline of a staged plan for a formal transfer of power leading to the formation of a National Unity Government and early presidential elections. The Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) supports the aims of the Initiative and has already signed the GCC Initiative, as have representatives of the ruling party (GPC). The protest movement, representative of large numbers of Yemen's students and civil society, is diverse and lacks a single voice. In meetings with its members British embassy officials have seen a range of views, some aligned with the JMP and its support of the GCC Initiative, others not. A major theme is concern with accountability and justice for those suspected of human rights abuses and corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.2/3">The highly volatile security situation in Sana'a, the capital, and across Yemen constrains the ability of our embassy staff to travel widely in the country and interact freely with as many Yemenis as we would like. But our ambassador reports a continued desire for change among many Yemenis.</p>

	<p pid="a.164W.5/1">In meetings with the leaders of the official opposition and judging from public statements by leaders of the protest movements there is widespread support for the UN in maintaining, through its adoption of Resolution 2014, pressure on president Saleh and his government. The Yemeni regime has also welcomed the resolution and undertaken to respond positively to it. Tawakkol Karman, Nobel prize winner and civil right activist, referred to it as a &#8220;good start&#8221;. There is a sense among protestors that the UN can do more, but the resolution with its clause on reviewing the situation after 30 days sends a strong message to the Yemeni leadership and opposition of global concern about the deteriorating situation in Yemen and the urgent need for a political settlement. In particular it sends a clear message to President Saleh that he should sign the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative without delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.5/2">The general public, specifically those involved in anti-government protests and on the receiving end of lethal force by government security forces, should be encouraged by the resolution's clear condemnation of human rights abuses by all sides and the call for those responsible to be held accountable. Protestors from all camps are vocal on the issues of justice and accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.164W.5/3">The will for concerted international action to urge president Saleh to follow through with his promises to transfer power is strong and growing. We are making clear our concern over the economic, humanitarian and security situation in Yemen. All our efforts are focused on achieving a peaceful political settlement. But ultimately that choice rests in Yemeni hands.</p>

	<p pid="a.170W.8/1">The UK Border Agency does not routinely collect statistics relating to the number of asylum applicants who are given permission to work. This is because an application for permission to work is not recorded as a separate case type on the agency's case information database. Any application of this nature is instead dealt with by the case owner as part of the application for asylum with the outcome being recorded within the case notes. To provide the complete set of data requested it would be necessary to look at each individual application for asylum that has exceeded the 12 month point in the last five years and record whether an application for permission to work has been made and if so granted. The cost of doing so would be disproportionate.</p>

Our systems record payments to not for profit organisations which includes charities but also other philanthropic institutions and social enterprises.

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" name="Theresa May">the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)</phrase>, to carry out their duties and to exercise powers, one of the conditions of which is that they have undergone training on restraint techniques approved by the National Offender Management Service. Officers receive refresher training every 12 months. Separate training is provided for those involved in the overseas escorting of children, using non-pain compliant techniques, Physical Control in Care (PCC).</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.0/2">Any use of restraint is a matter of last resort when all other avenues of persuasion have failed and there is no other option to effect the person's co-operation. Its use must be justified, proportionate and for the shortest possible period to achieve the objective. Officers must report in detail where it has been used.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.0/3">Restraint on a child is only ever used where it is strictly necessary to prevent self-harm or to protect others and property. In very exceptional circumstances officers may be given authority to physically intervene to enforce a child's removal where, despite attempts to persuade them to comply, they refuse to do so. Interventions may start with guiding or shepherding, before PCC techniques are used.</p>

	<p pid="a.177W.0/1">Risk of harm to the public is an important consideration when deciding whether or not to detain under immigration powers a foreign national offender who is liable to deportation, but it is not the only consideration. There will be circumstances in which it will be legitimate to detain even where there is no identified risk of re-offending, for example where there is a significant risk of the individual absconding or where the individual's own lack of co-operation is a determinative factor preventing removal.</p>
	<p pid="a.177W.0/2">Risk assessments provided by the National Offender Management Service will always be taken into account, where they are available, when deciding whether or not to detain a foreign national offender under immigration powers. Where such assessments are not available (for example, where the person is not subject to monitoring by the Probation Service) managers will make a decision based on the specific facts of the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.177W.0/3">The UK Border Agency accept the need to ensure that detention is used appropriately and lawfully and have already put in place a package of measures to improve the quality of detention decisions and documentation. For example the detention review template and guidance have been revised to better support caseworkers in making evidence-based detention decisions and demonstrating progress since the last 28 day review. The UK Border Agency will also review the template and guidance for making the initial detention decision to ensure that all detention decisions are based on a sound consideration of the evidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.184W.3/1">The PAYE system collects tax on account of an individual's liability for the year using code numbers based on the information available at the start of the tax year. For those who move in and out of work, have fluctuating income, or have expenses and benefits, in year PAYE deductions do not always equal the tax due. For this reason at the end of each tax year, HMRC checks that customers have paid the right amount of tax&#8212;usually around 85% of people have paid the right amount. This is part of the normal PAYE cycle of work and has happened each year since PAYE was introduced in 1944.</p>

	<p pid="a.185W.8/2">I am aware of a number of trade campaigns to reduce the rate of VAT on the tourism and hospitality sectors, including the hotel sector. Generally, these advocate an immediate permanent cut in VAT because other EU member states have reduced rates of VAT for hospitality, and on the basis of some economic modelling. Therefore, they take no account of the significant benefit to the hotel industry of the holding the Olympics in London in 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.189W.3/2">As part of this we considered that if fares increases disproportionately affected non-season (peak) tickets, then women could be disproportionately affected (as they are more likely to work part time than men). However, in practice, we expect that percentage price changes for non-season tickets will be broadly the same as for season tickets. Therefore in proportionate terms, part time workers are likely to be affected in a similar way to full time workers.</p>

	<p pid="a.206W.2/15">Under the employment support allowance regime, new claimants have to undergo the work capability assessment. From April 2011 incapacity benefit recipients will begin also to undertake this assessment. The medical condition recorded on the claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefit or employment support allowance. So, for example, a decision on entitlement for a customer claiming incapacity benefit on the basis of alcoholism would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities related to physical and mental function, assessed by the personal/work capability assessment.</p>

	<p pid="a.211W.2/1">When providing advice for personal independence payment, trained independent assessors will consider individuals' ability to carry out a series of key everyday activities, set out in regulations. This advice will inform decisions on benefit entitlement, taken by departmental decision makers who are ultimately responsible for ensuring appropriate evidence has been obtained and taken into consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.211W.2/2">Assessors will need to ensure that they have sufficient evidence on which to base their advice. This evidence will be gathered from a range of sources, partly provided by the claimant and the remainder requested by the assessor. In most cases we envisage that this will also involve information gathered from a face-to-face consultation between the claimant and the assessor. However, such consultations may not always be necessary or appropriate&#8212;especially where there is already sufficient evidence available, such as from the claimant themselves or from individuals involved in supporting the claimant, such as their GP, specialist or social worker. Decisions on whether sufficient evidence has been gathered will be based on the circumstances of the case and guidance will be provided to support such decisions. The assessment criteria for the benefit are still being developed.</p>

	<p pid="a.213W.5/3">1. The Family Resources Survey (FRS) is a nationally representative sample of approximately 25,000 UK private households. Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining non-response error. The FRS is known to under-record benefit receipt so the estimates presented should be treated with caution.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.5/4">2. Figures have been rounded to the nearest 100,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.5/5">3. A benefit unit is defined as a single adult or a married or cohabiting couple and dependent children.</p>
	<p pid="a.213W.5/6">4. Housing benefit receipt is recorded at a benefit unit level on the FRS. This analysis is therefore only possible at a benefit unit level.</p>

	<p pid="a.224W.8/1">The recent closure of the important Area VII scallop fishery to UK vessels over 15 metres in length has clearly created problems for the sector. We are working with industry to avoid a situation where it causes permanent damage to these businesses and the markets they have worked hard to develop over the years. To reopen the fishery this year the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) is seeking to source additional effort from other member states by agreeing international swaps.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.8/2">Following a preliminary assessment of the likely impact of the closure on the scallop fishing industry, the MMO decided to close the fishery in October as the industry's preference was for an early closure to allow the possibility of them being able to supply scallops to the lucrative French Christmas market.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.8/3">DEFRA officials and the MMO have been in regular contact with the Scallop Association and other parts of the industry throughout this process. These discussions began prior to the closure, firstly at the UK Scallop Group in June, followed by a dedicated meeting in late August and have been continuing on an almost daily basis as MMO sought to agree the best possible deal for the wider UK fishing industry via international swaps.</p>

	<p pid="a.229W.0/3">The Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my noble Friend Lord Astor of Hever, has met Mr Steven Crouch, a director of IRG Ltd, socially on no more than five occasions over several years. The Minister for International Security Strategy, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40039" name="Gerald Howarth">the Member for Aldershot (Mr Howarth)</phrase>, has had one meeting with Mr Crouch. Records of any other meetings between officials or military personnel with representatives of IRG Ltd are not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.0/4">Mr Howarth's meeting with Mr Crouch, which is referred to in the Cabinet Secretary's report, was at the suggestion of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40445" name="Liam Fox">the Member for North Somerset (Dr Fox)</phrase> and took place on <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-27">27 September 2011</phrase> in the House of Commons. No officials were present and no note of the meeting was taken. No substantive issues were raised, no confidential information was disclosed, and there was no follow-up to the meeting. After the meeting had taken place Mr Howarth informed his office in accordance with the Cabinet Secretary's guidelines. The two social events that both Mr Howarth and Mr Werritty attended took place in Wiltshire on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-16">16 July</phrase> and in London on <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-24">24 September 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.0/5">Lord Astor acknowledged Mr Werritty as they passed in a hotel reception area in Bahrain in December 2010. It was not a meeting, either official or unofficial, and Lord Astor had no further contact with Mr Werritty while in Bahrain. There was, therefore, no requirement to inform the Ministry of Defence about the contact but the incident was referred to in the Cabinet Secretary's report for completeness.</p>

These include the Army Suicide Vulnerability Risk Management (SVRM) policy which is aimed at helping the chain of command to identify those who may be vulnerable and, once identified, how to manage their care with the appropriate welfare and medical services.</p>
	<p pid="a.231W.6/4">All staff at recruiting and training establishments are trained to recognise and identify vulnerable trainees who may be having problems. Commanding officers undertake risk assessments in accordance with the supervisory care directive which takes account of the particular factors of the environment, the age of the trainee population, and the type of training being undertaken. Welfare support is available to recruits 24 hours a day through unit welfare officers, padres and others such as the Women's Royal Voluntary Service. They also have access to confidential helplines and free counselling.</p>

	<p pid="a.238W.8/2">A person who was entitled to carer's allowance immediately before the death of the person cared for continues to be entitled to it for up to eight weeks afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.8/3">Depending on their personal circumstances, the ex-carer may claim or continue to claim other benefits such as jobseeker's allowance if they are actively seeking and available for work; employment and support allowance if they have a disability or incapacity which limits their capability for work; or, in other circumstances, income support. These benefits include a carer premium for people who are entitled to carer's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.8/4">Regardless of which benefit carers or ex-carers claim, Jobcentre Plus provides personalised and flexible practical assistance for those seeking work, either directly or through Work Programme providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.8/5">The level of support offered by Jobcentre Plus; how quickly a person is referred to the Work Programme; and whether engagement is voluntary or mandatory depends on which benefit is being claimed. So for example an ex-carer claiming jobseeker's allowance could volunteer to enter the Work Programme three months into their claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.8/6">Local Jobcentre Plus offices are empowered to decide when and how to support customers, tailoring that support to their individual need, although support may be subject to mandatory participation depending on the benefit being claimed. Jobcentre Plus District Managers and advisers have access to a comprehensive flexible menu of options to enable them to make the cost effective choices and provide the right support to individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.8/7">The support available directly through Jobcentre Plus may include:</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.8/8">mandatory adviser interviews and jobsearch reviews</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.8/9">flexible interviews, the frequency and duration of which are decided by a personal adviser</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.8/10">work preparation, including help with CV writing or interview skills</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.8/11">referral to approved training</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.8/12">work trials, work experience, access to help if considering self-employment and work clubs</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.8/13">access to funds to help with the costs of training and returning to work</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.8/14">help to calculate whether the person would be better off in work when considering a job, and</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.8/15">advice about in-work benefits and adviser support during the early weeks in work.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.8/16">When determining the level of support ex-carers receive, they are treated as though they were still carers for eight weeks following the end of their caring responsibilities. Once a carer or ex-carer has started receiving this support, they can continue accessing it until they start full time work or are mandated to participate in the Work Programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.8/17">Jobcentre Plus works in partnership in local communities with service providers, Local authorities, the NHS, voluntary and community sector and employers to find ways to support carers and ex-carers back to work.</p>

Around half of them will have personal health budgets; the remainder are in a control group. The evaluation does not include a specific cohort of people with learning disabilities. So, although it is likely that many people with learning disabilities are involved in the pilot, we do not yet know how many, or to what extent their needs are being supported through a personal health budget.</p>

Pension membership rates are estimated by considering the proportion of ESR's, across staff groups, with recorded employer pension contributions. Aggregate estimates are then produced using published NHS Information Centre work force census data collected annually each September. Data cleaning processes are also applied to the ESR extracts before use. 3. For non-medical staff, estimates are generated by Agenda for Change (AfC) pay band. Medical staff are not employed on AfC terms so estimates are provideo1 by broad staff groups.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.251W.2/1">Allocating funding for adult social care is the responsibility of local authorities, who receive funding from central Government through the local government formula grant and raise money locally through council tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.251W.2/2">The latest local authority budget data for 2011-12 show that local authorities have budgeted &#163;7.0 billion towards social care for those over 65. We also estimate that around &#163;300 million has been transferred to local authorities for older people's services from primary care trusts this year, as part of the additional support for social care provided through the health system. Budgeted expenditure for older people will therefore be around &#163;7.3 billion this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.257W.2/2">Relevant information readily available is, however, provided as follows. The Ministry of Justice publishes on its website quarterly and annual statistics on freedom of information requests received by over 40 central Government bodies, and it is from these publications that the following statistics are taken. The available statistics cover the period April 2010 to June 2011. Under the Official Statistics Code of Practice, we cannot release statistics for a time period prior to their appearance in a regular statistical report. Statistics for the remainder of 2011 will be collated and published in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.257W.2/3">Between April 2010 and June 2011 the Ministry of Justice provided the full information requested 844 times. This statistic, and the quarterly breakdown as follows, includes only first requests, it does not include information provided at internal review or subsequent appeal stages available under the Freedom of Information Act ('the Act').

	<p pid="a.263W.9/1">DECC-supported the &#163;2.5 million Local Carbon Frameworks pilot in 2010-11, which involved 30 local authorities. Its aim was to identify the best ways to reduce carbon emissions at a local level. An evaluation of the pilot and toolkit for the benefit of all local authorities will be published later this year. There are no plans to run further local carbon framework pilots but DECC will continue to support local authorities cut carbon, and I have recently asked the Committee on Climate Change to provide advice on this.</p>

	<p pid="a.264W.8/1">The Government's current consultation on feed-in tariffs for solar photovoltaics (PV) sets out two options for strengthening the link between energy efficiency and FITs. The first option is that only buildings with an energy performance certificate (EPC) rating of level C would be eligible for the standard FITs rates for solar PV.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.8/2">The costs of reaching level C will vary depending on the base-level energy performance of the building in question.

	<p pid="a.278W.2/1">In 2008-09 (the last year for which the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has published figures), Equatorial Guinea received $11 million in multilateral aid, comprising $5 million from the Global Fund to prevent malaria and treat HIV/AIDS, $4 million from EU institutions to improve governance, $1 million from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for HIV/AIDS education and clean water, and $1 million from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for reproductive health. The UK's imputed share of multilateral aid to Equatorial Guinea was &#163;278,000 in 2008-09. Information on the imputed UK share of multilateral aid is published each year in Statistics on International Development.</p>
	<p pid="a.278W.2/2">The Global Fund's grant to Equatorial Guinea for anti-retroviral treatments for HIV/AIDS has now closed and its grant for the provision of anti-malaria bed-nets is nearly closed. Equatorial Guinea does not currently have access to the 10th allocation of the European Development Fund, because it has not ratified the 1st revision of the Cotonou agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.278W.2/3">Along with other donors, the UK makes voluntary or assessed contributions to a range of multilateral development organisations which are not tied to a particular project, sector, or country and can be spent against any activity that relates to the organisation's mandate. It is for the organisations themselves, with approval from their management boards, to decide how best to allocate funding to meet their mandates.</p>
	<p pid="a.278W.2/4">Following the Multilateral Aid Review, the UK is pressing to improve performance, results, value for money and fiduciary control in the multilateral development organisations to which we contribute. We do this through technical discussions, high-level meetings between DFID Ministers and senior officials of the organisations concerned, and our membership of the management boards.</p>

	<p pid="a.279W.5/1">The business case for the St Helena airport agreed by Ministers has rigorously reviewed the value for money case for an airport. The value for money case builds on a number of economic and financial assessments which have been completed since 2005. All of these reports have come to the same conclusion, namely that the best long-term solution from an economic and financial perspective for both HMG and St Helena is to construct an airport. Building and running a new ship for St Helena would consign the island to long-term isolation, increase the island's dependence on UK aid indefinitely and therefore would cost the UK taxpayer more in the long run.</p>

In 2009 a formal public consultation was held. The outcome of this consultation mirrored the 2002 referendum, with very strong majority support for an airport.</p>

These studies show that an airport provides the best chance to reduce St Helena's dependence on UK aid. St Helena Government is currently reviewing its tax, investment, immigration and land policies and is enacting reforms in these and other areas. This is being done to encourage investment and private sector activity so that St Helena can take full advantage of the opportunities an airport will bring.</p>

These views are underlined by the results of recent referenda on the island which showed a clear majority in support of an airport. Many others connected with St. Helena have campaigned for opportunities for economic growth and development that only an airport can bring to the island.</p>

The decision to fund an airport in St Helena is entirely consistent with the Government's vision for the overseas territories as vibrant and flourishing communities, generating wider opportunities for their people so they become less dependent on UK aid. It also brings to a close the uncertainty the British citizens of St Helena have been experiencing over their future since the airport project was approved in 2005 and 'paused' in 2008.</p>

We are carrying out an internal review of PSHE, which is not part of the national curriculum. The purpose of this review is to identify ways in which schools can improve the quality of teaching of PSHE.</p>
	<p pid="a.286W.9/3">We aim to reform the national curriculum so that it properly reflects the body of essential knowledge in key subjects and does not absorb the overwhelming majority of teaching time in schools. A less prescriptive national curriculum will also give teachers greater flexibility to use their professional judgement to design wider school curricula that best meet the needs of their pupils. Our proposals for the new scope of the national curriculum will be announced next year, following which there will be consultation before final decisions are made.</p>

	<p pid="a.287W.2/2">Pupil funding for each free school is based on the Academy Trust's estimate of pupil numbers at the opening date following the enrolment process. The Young People's Learning Agency (YPLA) then compares each trust's estimate of pupil numbers for the current academic year against actual pupil numbers in census returns. This comparison is used to make adjustments (either additional or clawed back grant) to pupil funding in subsequent years if any shortfall or increase in pupil numbers exceeds the threshold percentage set out in the funding agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.287W.2/3">We estimate that over 3000 pupils have enrolled during the first intake for the 24 free schools that opened in September 2011. This means that these schools are on course to reach their full capacity in the coming years. Further information about the number of children on roll at each school will be collected in the school census and published in due course.</p>

It is compulsory for all pupils in maintained primary schools, at key stages 1 and 2. Although it is not currently a compulsory part of the secondary curriculum, most secondary schools in England are teaching practical cooking to 11 to 14-year-olds, including food education, at key stage 3, as it is one of two topics within the design and technology curriculum that must be taught. The National Curriculum Review which is currently under way will advise the Government as to which subjects should remain in the national curriculum and at what key stages they should feature. Our proposals for the content of the new national curriculum will be published early in 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.290W.0/1">There is a range of evidence suggesting that young people like to access advice in a variety of ways including face-to-face, in groups or online. Schools are best placed to know what support their pupils need. The Government recognises that many young people can benefit from a face-to-face discussion of their skills, abilities and interests to help them think through future education and career options. We will highlight this important issue to schools through statutory guidance in advance of the new duty to secure access to independent careers guidance commencing in September 2012, subject to the passage of the Education Bill. The guidance will place a clear expectation on schools that they should secure face-to-face careers guidance where it is the most suitable support, particularly for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Schools may choose to work in partnership with providers engaged in delivering the National Careers Service, or with other providers, as they see fit. The National Careers Service will be required to meet a robust, high quality standard and all providers involved in the service will be expected to be accredited to the standard by April 2013. It was recently announced that this quality standard will be the revised matrix standard. The standard will assist schools in making well-informed decisions about which providers to work with.</p>

	<p pid="a.291W.5/1">The Government put valuations of the public service pension schemes on hold while the consultation on the discount rate used to calculate contribution rates was taking place. The outcome of the consultation was announced in Budget 2011, but valuations remain on hold. Valuations are dependent on assumptions about the value of future costs, design of benefits and other factors. Many of these are currently under review as part of the Government's proposed reforms of the public sector pension schemes. A decision on when to undertake the next valuation of the Teachers' Pension Scheme will be taken in due course.</p>

When companies fail to file accounts at all, Companies House contacts the company to investigate if it is still in operation; if it is not they will take action to remove the company from the register, and in the financial year ending <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase> 53,550 companies were removed for this reason. If the company is still required Companies House will, as a last resort, prosecute the company directors for failing to file the accounts. During the financial year ending <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase> Companies House prosecuted over 3,000 directors for this reason.</p>

	<p pid="a.298W.3/1">Departmental officials would normally determine whether exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act 2000 should apply to responses to requests for information under the Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.298W.3/2">However, the exemption under section 36 (prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs) can only apply if it is the reasonable opinion of a qualified person (QP) that the exemption applies.

	<p pid="a.302W.2/2">The 2010 spending review committed the Department to a 25% real-terms reduction in our budgets by 2014-15 to make our contribution to the Government's deficit reduction targets&#8212;a challenge BIS is already meeting through significant reductions in staff and the streamlining of our partner organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.302W.2/3">During 2010-11 BIS and its partner organisations implemented the spending controls established by the Cabinet Office and Treasury in May 2010. These included tight controls over pay and recruitment, advertising and marketing spend, consultancy, ICT, estates and procurement. In particular the Department:</p>
	<p pid="a.302W.2/4">delivered &#163;836 million of in-year savings as a contribution to the Emergency Budget announcement in June;</p>
	<p pid="a.302W.2/5">undertook work on public bodies reform&#8212;in particular the transition of responsibilities from the regional development agencies (RDAs) to successor bodies;</p>
	<p pid="a.302W.2/6">implemented new controls on marketing and consultancy spending, and a freeze on public sector pay in line with Cabinet Office guidance;</p>
	<p pid="a.302W.2/7">significantly reduced the administration budget for the Department, including partner organisations, with an 11% reduction in 2010-11;</p>
	<p pid="a.302W.2/8">reduced the number of staff within the core Department by 576 during 2010-11; and</p>
	<p pid="a.302W.2/9">as our Annual Report and Resource Accounts of 2010-11 show, staff costs were &#163;12.7 million lower in 2010-11 than 2009-10 and other administration costs were &#163;47.5 million lower in 2010-11 than 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="a.302W.2/10">Cabinet Office guidance for the pay freeze was that there should be no pay increases for staff earning more than &#163;21,000. The exception to this was cases where Departments had any legally-binding contractual commitments. BIS has been unable to create a single pay system as a result of the freeze and the pay arrangements of the legacy Departments apply. Staff on former BERR terms have a contractual pay arrangement and so received an award during the pay freeze. Staff on former DIUS terms did not.</p>

We are working closely with the European Commission, EU member states and other WTO members to ensure that there is a clear way forward for the Doha Round in 2012 which delivers trade liberalisation, strengthens the multilateral system and advances the interests of poor countries.</p>

We also continue to press for agreement for countries to live up to commitments made to advance the interests of poor countries, including by providing duty-free, quota-free access for least developed country exports.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.3/4">The UK is supporting the poorest countries to achieve more balanced outcomes in international trade negotiations through the Trade Advocacy Fund.
