I made clear that without the release and participation of all political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma's elections will not be free and fair. The subsequent summit statement reflected the EU's concern. To mark Aung San Suu Kyi's 65th birthday, my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and I called on the military regime to end her detention. Our ambassador in Rangoon repeatedly raises the need for the release of prisoners of conscience, including Aung San Suu Kyi, with Ministers in the Burmese military government. We will continue to raise the plight of Burma's political prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi through the EU, with Burma's neighbours, and we will highlight the issue in the UN Security Council and UN's human rights bodies. We endorse the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention's recent observation that the ongoing detention of Aung San Suu Kyi is illegal and in violation of international human rights law.</p>

	<p pid="b.219W.9/2">Currently, same-sex couples can enter a civil partnership under the Civil Partnership Act 2004 which gives them the opportunity to obtain legal recognition of their relationship. Couples who register their civil partnerships gain vital rights and protections, similar to married couples. Civil partnership registrations are entirely secular in nature and, as with civil marriage, prohibited from taking place on religious premises, or containing any religious language. An amendment made to the Equality Act 2010 removed the express prohibition on civil partnerships taking place on religious premises.</p>
	<p pid="b.219W.9/3">This Government are committed to supporting civil partnerships. This week, the Prime Minister launched Working for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Equality, an ambitious programme of work to tackle outdated prejudices and ensure equal chances for everyone, whatever their sexual orientation or gender identity. It contains a commitment to talk to those with a key interest in this issue about what the next stage should be for civil partnerships, including how some religious organisations can allow same-sex couples the opportunity to register their relationship in a religious setting if they wish to do so.</p>

Consequently, the figures provided in Table 1 under-represent the overall contribution of DNA matches to the detection of serious crimes such as murder and rape. It is also important to note that convictions are obtained through integrated criminal investigation, not through DNA evidence alone.</p>

	<p pid="b.223W.2/2">UK drug laws already provide the opportunity for criminal justice interventions with problem drug misusers to contribute to reducing drug misuse and drug-related crime. We will conduct a full review of sentencing policy to ensure that it is effective in deterring crime, protecting the public, punishing offenders and cutting reoffending. In particular, we will ensure that sentencing for drug use helps offenders come off drugs. In addition, we will explore alternative forms of secure, treatment-based accommodation for drugs offenders.</p>

In particular, the Government set out six specific commitments. The Government will:</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.2/4" class="indent">overhaul the Licensing Act to give local authorities and the police much stronger powers to remove licences from, or refuse to grant licences to, any premises that are causing problems;</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.2/5" class="indent">allow councils and the police to shut down permanently any shop or bar found to be persistently selling alcohol to children;</p>

	<p pid="b.223W.2/7" class="indent">permit local councils to charge more for late-night licences to pay for additional policing;</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.2/8" class="indent">ban the sale of alcohol below cost price;</p>

The majority of these reductions were made to the cost of the Home Office and its agencies but there was also some impact on the police, which should be met by efficiency savings and savings found from within discretionary non-frontline spend. We are confident that forces can manage these reductions whilst leaving the frontline of policing strong and secure.</p>

	<p pid="b.244W.2/1">As an operator of local bus services, Arriva is eligible for Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG). BSOG is paid on the basis of fuel used by an operator on eligible services.

	<p pid="b.245W.0/2">The relevant section of the written ministerial statement concerned a small number of schemes being developed by local authorities at various stages of their statutory procedures. Officials have written to the relevant authorities stating that due to the urgent priority to tackle the UK's record budget deficit, the Secretary of State intends to defer various aspects of the statutory order process, unless the authority can provide evidence that alternative funding is available which would allow him to continue to make his decision. Such alternative funding would need to cover the total amount of Government funding sought by the authority for the scheme in question.</p>

However, healthcare spend will also be looked at as part of the next spending review. This will inform the speed at which primary care trusts move towards their target revenue allocations.</p>

	<p pid="b.256W.5/1">The Government's review of spending decisions taken since <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January</phrase> this year was to ensure that all the schemes considered were affordable, good value for money and consistent with the Government's priorities. This was in the context of the most urgent task facing the Government which was to tackle the record levels of debt inherited from the last government.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.5/2">As part of the statement given by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-17">17 June</phrase> to the House, the cancellation of the proposed new &#163;450 million hospital scheme for North Tees and Hartlepool was announced.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.5/3">Where major national health service changes are proposed, they must meet the strengthened criteria for such decisions as set out in a letter from the NHS Chief Executive Sir David Nicholson of <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-20">20 May</phrase> to Monitor and all NHS chief executives. This is to ensure that, in future, all service changes must be led by clinicians and patients and not be driven from the top down.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.5/4">In these tough economic times it is essential that all major hospital building-whether private finance initiatives or public capital-must be affordable and provide value for money for the taxpayer. For foundation trusts, proposals must be consistent with their independent status in relation to reduced reliance on Departmental support. As a foundation trust with independent status, North Tees and Hartlepool has borrowing powers and other mechanisms available to it to fund alternative capital investment requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.5/5">The trust will have incurred costs in working up the proposals, in developing the business case and in performing the feasibility studies behind it. As an independent foundation trust this information is a matter for Monitor (the statutory name for the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts) and may be obtained by writing to the Chairman of Monitor.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.5/6">The business case approved in March 2010 anticipated a request from the trust to the Department for &#163;8 million to buy the land on the Wynyard Park site for the new hospital. This request was received and met by the Department. If the trust has no further use for the land then it can be sold to recover the funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.5/7">The local strategic health authority and primary care trust have both pledged to continue working closely with all local NHS organisations to plan and develop the best possible health services for the population of Hartlepool and North Tees and to ensure that the wider 'Momentum Project'-involving bringing healthcare services closer to communities-will continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.256W.5/8">The NHS capital investment schemes which were approved to go ahead as a result of the Government review of spending commitments made under the last administration since <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-01">1 January 2010</phrase> are those for Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospitals NHS Trust, the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust and Epsom and St Helier NHS Trust.</p>

	<p pid="b.258W.3/1">The National Stroke Strategy was published in 2007 in order to provide advice, guidance and support for commissioners, strategic health authorities, the voluntary sector and social care to improve services across the whole stroke pathway.</p>
	<p pid="b.258W.3/2">To support implementation of that strategy, &#163;45 million additional central funding was made available from 2008-09 to 2010-11 as grants to local authorities for support to stroke services survivors and their carers. This funding was over and above the general funding local authorities receive to provide social care support for people in their areas. Funding for the period 2011-15 is subject to the spending review.</p>
	<p pid="b.258W.3/3">The NAO revisited stroke services in 2009 and in its report &quot;Progress in improving stroke care&quot; (February 2010) it found that, views on the quality of longer term care were variable, ranging from very good to very poor. They also reported that many local authorities had used the stroke grants to commission support from the voluntary sector for stroke survivors, their families and carers identifying 268 such contracts in 2009 compared with 164 in 2005. However, we have no information on the impact of such services on hospital admissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.258W.3/4">When assessing people for support, local authorities generally provide services on the basis of an assessment of the degree of disability a person has rather than on a medical diagnosis. We therefore do not have information on the overall amount of money they have spent on support for stroke survivors, many of whom will also have other contributing causes to their disabilities.

	<p pid="b.264W.3/1">The UK has not undertaken a specific cost benefit analysis with respect to extending the UK competence to manage an exclusive UK inshore fishing effort. We are, however, working with others across the EU to shape the European Commission's proposals on Common Fisheries Policy reform. We will wish to examine carefully the Commission's emerging options, which we expect to see over the next few months. It is not yet clear how these will affect member states' control over inshore fishing effort but I am keen to promote decentralisation of fisheries management away from the current centralised regime. Of course, any reassessment of member state competence would need to safeguard historic access rights and the benefits of relative stability in member states' shares of fishing opportunities, including rights that UK fishers currently benefit from in other member states' territorial waters.</p>

DEFRA provides grant in aid to the Environment Agency for flood and coastal erosion risk management, which may include land drainage maintenance, where this is the most effective means of reducing flood risk. The Environment Agency considers the environmental effects of its decisions on a case by case basis when deciding how to get best value for money from DEFRA's investment.</p>

We are in regular contact with the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross locally and at HQ level. As of <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-18">18 June</phrase>, the United Nations estimates that 191 people are dead and 400,000 people have been displaced. The Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs has estimated that 100,000 refugees have crossed the border to Uzbekistan.</p>

	<p pid="b.269W.6/1">The UK does not send aid directly to Gaza. However, we do fund the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) which provides basic services to Gazan refugees such as education, health care and food aid.</p>
	<p pid="b.269W.6/2">Due to restrictions on access UNRWA and other aid organisations have found it difficult to import into Gaza all the items they need to carry out their work effectively. DFID is therefore funding a United Nations team to work with the Government of Israel and aid agencies to facilitate the transfer of goods into Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="b.269W.6/3">The announcement by the Government of Israel of an easing of restrictions, including a move from a list of permitted items to a list of banned goods, is a step in the right direction. We will continue to press the Government of Israel to ensure they deliver on their commitments.</p>

	<p pid="b.274W.3/1">An element of the BIS overall pay award for staff below the SCS is allocated to non-consolidated variable pay related to performance. These payments are used to drive high performance and form part of the pay award. There are two types of award:</p>
	<p pid="b.274W.3/2" class="indent">1. In-year payments, which consist of special individual performance awards and non-pay rewards that recognise strong performance in particularly demanding tasks or situations.</p>
	<p pid="b.274W.3/3" class="indent">2. Annual performance awards that are paid to members of staff who receive a highly successful performance rating.</p>
	<p pid="b.274W.3/4">Non-consolidated variable pay awards are funded from within existing pay bill controls, and have to be re-earned each year against pre-determined targets and, as such, do not add to future pay bill costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.274W.3/5">Performance awards for the SCS are part of the pay system across the whole senior civil service, and are used to reward high performance sustained throughout the year, based on judgments of how well an individual has performed relative to their peers. The performance related pay scheme is designed to help drive high performance and support better public service delivery. Performance awards are non-consolidated and non pensionable. The percentage of the pay bill set aside for performance-related awards for the SCS is based on recommendations from the independent Senior Salaries Review Body. For the year 2009-10 the Senior Salaries Review Body has confirmed that up to 8.6% of the BIS SCS pay bill may be used for non-consolidated performance awards for the SCS. No payments have yet been made, but BIS does not intend to use the full amount available.</p>
	<p pid="b.274W.3/6">BIS was formed through a machinery of government change that occurred in June 2009. The Department was created by merging the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS). The following information provides combined details for the performance payments made to staff below the SCS from each of the former Departments.</p>
