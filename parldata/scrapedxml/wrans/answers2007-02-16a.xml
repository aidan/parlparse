	<p pid="a.20W.8/1">The African Union (AU) Mission in Sudan (AMIS) carries out vital work to protect civilians and monitor the ceasefire in Darfur. But to cover such a vast area effectively AMIS needs reinforcement and this needs to come from the UN. A phased approach to increasing UN support to peacekeeping in Darfur was agreed in Addis Ababa on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-16">16 November 2006</phrase> and is now being implemented. It will culminate in a hybrid AU and UN force, the details of which are currently being finalised. In the meantime, it is vital that AMIS can continue its work and the UK is committed to supporting this. We have pledged a further &pound;15 million to this end, bringing our total contribution for this financial year to &pound;35 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.25W.8/2">Table 1 shows that, between 1998 and 2004, binge drinking by this age group changed very little.</p>

At the time the Department had already allocated considerably more than &pound;1.5 million to establishing the NHS cord blood bank, therefore Sir Richard's offer did not materialise.

	<p pid="a.41W.0/1">Average waiting times for the treatment of cancer patients are not collected centrally. Cancer waiting times standards of a maximum wait of 31 days from diagnosis to first cancer treatment and a maximum wait of 62 days from urgent referral to first cancer treatment were introduced for all cancer patients from December 2005. Data showing performance against these standards for the period July to September 2006 shows that patients at the Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre NHS Trust achieved 99.7 per cent. and 96.5 per cent. respectively. For the same period Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust achieved 100 per cent. and 97.6 per cent. respectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.45W.0/1">We have no plans to set national targets for the diagnosis of individuals infected with hepatitis C. In the 'Hepatitis C Action Plan for England', there are two national outcome indicators, drawn from epidemiological surveillance by the Health Protection Agency (HPA), intended to track increased testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.45W.0/2">The first indicator is the total number of laboratory confirmed hepatitis C infection reports. There has been a significant increase in hepatitis C diagnoses in England reported to the HPA through national surveillance from around 4,700 in 2001 before initial hepatitis C awareness-raising activities begun, to around 7,600 in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.45W.0/3">The second indicator is the proportion of those attending treatment and support agencies for injecting drug users who are aware of their hepatitis C infection. This proportion has increased from 41 per cent. in 2001 to 52 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.45W.0/4">Other surveillance sources also indicate that hepatitis C testing and diagnosis is increasing. For example, in the unlinked anonymous prevalence monitoring programme, the proportion of injecting drug users attending specialist services who self-report a previous hepatitis C test has increased from 55 per cent. in 2001 to 71 per cent. in 2005. Sentinel surveillance of hepatitis C testing in nine laboratories from 2002-2005 indicates that overall the number of individuals tested for hepatitis C increased by nearly 40 per cent. Testing by general practitioners and in genitor-urinary medicine services both increased by over 50 per cent. and in prisons by around 65 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.45W.3/1">From 1992, when national surveillance began to 2005, the latest year for which data are currently available, there have been around 54,000 laboratory diagnoses of hepatitis C reported to the Health Protection Agency (HPA). This means that 0.11 per cent. of the population of England has been diagnosed with hepatitis C and reported to the national surveillance system.</p>
	<p pid="a.45W.3/2">There is some indication from comparison of the number of hepatitis C diagnoses reported through sentinel surveillance in certain parts of the country against those reported to national surveillance that there may be significant under-reporting by laboratories. The HPA's view is that it may be possible that under-reporting of hepatitis C diagnoses to routine surveillance could be significant. This could mean that approximately 100,000 people in England might already have been diagnosed.</p>

	<p pid="a.46W.0/1">There are two suppliers of diamorphine injection to the national health service&mdash;Novartis and Wockhardt UK. Both companies are manufacturing to their full available capacity but they are unable to produce sufficient to meet historic levels of demand. We have been in close and ongoing discussions with the suppliers to increase the levels of the drug supplied to the NHS and believe that through careful prescribing and use of available stocks patient care is not being compromised. This is in part because we arranged for the increased production and availability of other alternative drugs such as morphine when the problem arose in December 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.53W.8/1">In October 2003, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published guidance on antenatal care. It recommended that a schedule of antenatal appointments should be determined by the function of the appointments. For women at a low risk of complications, a schedule of seven to 10 appointments should be appropriate. For those women who have particular needs and those have difficulty in accessing services, such as the socially excluded, additional antenatal appointments will be necessary. This will in turn improve the outcomes for both the woman and child.</p>

	<p pid="a.67W.13/1">An interim review of the microfinance sector was carried out between June and August of 2006. The review was commissioned by the Government of Afghanistan, microfinance donors, and the Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA) management to assess the current status of the Afghan microfinance sector and MISFA's role in developing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.13/2">The review found that the Afghanistan Government's MISFA has made significant progress in helping Afghans to invest in income generating activities. Rapidly increasing the number of people receiving loans over a short period has been successful in helping to build the microfinance sector. Nearly 75 per cent. of those receiving loans are women. So far, over &pound;83 million worth of small loans have been given to 234,000 families, shopkeepers, tailors, farmers, builders and others to invest and increase their savings. The review suggested that with continued support and an enabling environment, there is potential for many microfinance institutions (MFIs) to become financially sustainable over the next three years. To date, the role of the MISFA to support the sector has been successful, and justifies a clear need for its continuation to channel funds to the MFIs to improve their capacity, outreach and sustainability. The MISFA's design and implementation can serve as a good example for building microfinance sector in conflict affected countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.67W.13/3">A further review has been commissioned to look at the impact of microfinance on increasing legal livelihoods in opium poppy cultivating areas. The final report will be placed in the Library.</p>

The Government's position paper of March 2005 set out our view of an EPA designed to deliver benefits to ACP countries. It should provide duty and quota-free access into EU markets and simpler and more liberal rules of origin to ensure effective market access. It should allow ACP countries maximum flexibility as regards their own market opening and an effective safeguard mechanism for countries to use in the face of subsidised EU products. ACP regional groups should also be able to decide on the scope of the EPA they negotiate, and whether it includes rules on investment, competition and Government procurement.</p>

	<p pid="a.69W.0/1">DFID does not provide any direct assistance to Burmese refugees in China, Malaysia or Laos; assistance to Burmese refugees in these countries is provided by the European Commission (EC) and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), to which the UK contributes. In India, although DFID does not provide assistance to Burmese refugees directly, DFID supports the Government of India to provide health and education services through a number of centrally-sponsored schemes. These programmes are designed to target some of the poorest and most marginalised groups in India, including in the north-eastern states. In Bangladesh, although DFID does not provide assistance to Burmese refugees, such support is provided by development partners including the EC, the UNHCR and the Dutch, as well as a number of small non-governmental organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.71W.8/1">Since most water and sanitation services are provided by the public sector, public utilities are critical to achieving the water and sanitation MDG targets. DFID supports several international programmes that aim to strengthen public operators.</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.8/2">DFID supports the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET), an international network managed by the World Bank, that increases the transparency of utility performance and monitors their efficiency. Since 2002 DFID has provided &pound;1,055,000 in funding to IBNET. DFID has also funded Building Partnerships for Development (BPD), an informal network that demonstrates, through research, how public, private and civil society partnerships in the water sector can work effectively at the local level. The research is then used to promote further partnerships which help to increase the capacity of local level operators to increase service. DFID supported BPD with &pound;400,000 from 2002-06.</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.8/3">Sustainable improvements in utilities often require political and institutional changes, not simply improved hardware or technical skills. Ensuring that everyone, including the poorest and most marginalised, is served requires governments that are capable, responsive and accountable to poor people&mdash;ie good governance. In most, if not all, cases where we provide Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) it is accompanied by support for governance reforms, particularly improved public sector financial management. Where we support sector programmes (as in Ghana or Sierra Leone) support for utility reform is usually a significant component.</p>
	<p pid="a.71W.8/4">Finding better ways to strengthen public utilities is a high priority for DFID. We are looking both at how we can provide further support to programmes that are working successfully and at identifying new partnership that can make a difference.</p>

	<p pid="a.72W.2/1">Reliable data are difficult to obtain. Variations are due to differences in the definition of unemployment as well as the lack of a single, official data source.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.2/2">An International Labour Organisation (ILO) mission to Iraq in April/May 2000, estimated the unemployment rate as 50-60 per cent. The ILO, which is mandated to provide international definitions of employment, only considers as unemployed, those individuals who are actively seeking work but have not been successful in finding one hour's work in one week. The United Nations and World Bank social and economic needs assessments (carried out after the conflict in 2003) estimated that the unemployment rate before the 2003 war had been around 30 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.2/3">The most recent reliable unemployment data available for Iraq comes from the Iraq Living Conditions Survey carried out in 2004 by the Iraqi Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation/United Nations Development Programme. There is no other more recent comparable survey. The 2004 survey found that the core unemployment rate in Iraq was just over 10 per cent. (using the ILO definition).</p>
	<p pid="a.72W.2/4">In 2004, Iraq had a working age population of 16.4 million, but only 6.7 million (41 per cent.) were working or actively seeking work. 6 million of these were employed, leaving 700,000 (around 10 per cent.) unemployed. The majority of the 9.7 million people considered &quot;economically inactive&quot; (ie above 15 years but neither working nor actively seeking work) were women, who are significantly less likely to engage in paid employment than men (this is common to the region). In addition, young men constitute 15 per cent. of the economically inactive. The majority of young economically inactive men (68 per cent.) say they are studying and thus not available to work. 20 per cent. claim to be &quot;discouraged workers&quot; (ie believe that there are no jobs available and have therefore given up looking for work).</p>

Ending the violence&mdash;and rebuilding Iraq's economy and public services&mdash;is dependent on action from the Iraqi government itself. DFID is supporting these efforts by providing expert advice on reconciliation, economic reform and governance.</p>
	<p pid="a.73W.2/2" class="italic"> Progress against the MDGs</p>
	<p pid="a.73W.2/3">Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger&mdash;Poverty in Iraq was not measured under the regime of Saddam Hussein, and World Bank data on income and expenditure will not be available until 2008. We do, however, know that global malnutrition is roughly at the same level as in the early 1990s (after rising to much higher levels in the late 1990s).</p>
	<p pid="a.73W.2/4">Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education&mdash;Net enrolment in primary schools has not yet returned to the levels of 1991, after severe deterioration during the 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="a.73W.2/5">Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women&mdash;The gender ratio among primary and secondary students has not improved, and the proportion of women in parliament has decreased since the early 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="a.73W.2/6">Goals 4-6: Reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, and combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases&mdash;Because child mortality increased dramatically at the end of the 1990s, substantial improvements are now required if Iraqi is to meet this goal. Maternal mortality is believed to have increased in recent years. There are no data on HIV prevalence in Iraq, but levels are thought to be very low. Malaria is not a significant public health problem. TB rates are thought to be stable.</p>
	<p pid="a.73W.2/7">Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability&mdash;Access to safe drinking water did not improve between 1990 and 2004. There are no nationally representative data on trends in improved sanitation coverage. UNICEF is expected to provide updated estimates later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.73W.2/8">Significant investment in delivery of basic services is required to improve Iraq's performance against the MDGs. Iraq has the resources to fund much of this work itself (with estimated revenues for 2007 of $37.6 billion), but DFID support will help the government to plan and deliver investment in basic services, improve oil production levels, generate jobs and manage its own resources more effectively. DFID has already provided expert support to key Iraqi government ministries such as the Iraqi Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the World Bank and USAID, to mitigate the impact of economic reform on the poorest. DFID has also channelled &pound;70 million of funds through the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI) which has supported back-to-school campaigns, constructed 134 new schools, supplied 79 million new textbooks, rehabilitated 209 primary health centres (PHCs), added seven new mental health units, supported country-wide immunisation programmes, and supplied emergency medical drugs and supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.73W.2/9">On gender, DFID's Civil Society Fund has worked with women's civil society organisations to help them to engage more effectively with national decision-makers on key issues. And to improve water and sanitation facilities, DFID is funding repairs to water infrastructure in southern Iraq, which will double the volume of water supplied to around 100,000 homes in one of Basra's poorest areas, and boost the supply of drinking water for around half a million people. By late 2007, DFID projects will have improved access to water for around a million people in southern Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="a.74W.2/1">The Emergency Public Administration Programme (EPAP) ended in July 2005 and its impact was assessed in September 2005. DFID judged that it fulfilled its initial objective: to help the Iraq government set up key institutions at the centre of government. These included the Prime Minister's Office, the Council of Ministers Secretariat, and the Government Communications Directorate. The team of technical experts advised the Iraqi government on institutional structures and staff roles and responsibilities. They also provided targeted training to help key staff manage the machinery at the heart of government.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.2/2">At the same time, the programme also provided vital economic policy advice to the Ministry of Finance during a period when the international financial institutions had no formal presence in Baghdad. This focused on preparing the budget and also provided the government of Iraq with technical advice to help then negotiate an Emergency Post-Conflict Arrangement (EPCA) with the International Monetary Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.2/3">In late 2005, we launched a follow on programme to provide training and advice to the three central government institutions. Our 2006 assessment of the support to the centre of government project showed that despite changes in Government personnel, the project has met its objectives. The organisational structures set up under the Iraqi interim government were successfully built upon when Prime Minister Maliki took office in May 2006. In an environment beset by political and security challenges, efforts to build institutional capacity take time; now staff are more effectively trained and able to develop policy. We expect to continue our support to these institutions during the course of 2007, to consolidate the gains made in public sector management practices at the heart of government.</p>

	<p pid="a.75W.2/1">DFID last reviewed the Political Participation Fund (PPF) in July 2005 and is currently conducting a comprehensive project completion review. The aim of the PPF was to increase the participation of poor and marginalised Iraqis in the political process as the country underwent a major transition to a democratic political system.</p>
	<p pid="a.75W.2/2">Throughout 2005 and 2006, the PPF funded a range of Iraqi NGOs who have run a series of outreach activities. Grants of &pound;5,000 to &pound;300,000 were made to organisations for activities such as workshops to educate voters and written pamphlets to explain the functions and responsibilities of different parts of government. They also organised a series of public television debates with prominent Iraqi politicians.</p>
	<p pid="a.75W.2/3">Activities were timed to coincide with the two national elections in January and December 2005, as well as the national referendum on the new Iraqi constitution in October 2005. The UN reported that voter turnout increased from 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. between the two elections, including increased participation in poor localities and in Sunni areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.75W.2/4">The review also showed that the project successfully built the capacity of 25 Iraqi civil society organisations ranging from neighbourhood women's groups, media associations, and union organisations. Each civil society organisation received training in project development and management. Following this support, a number of the organisations have been identified by UN agencies as potential partners for future work.</p>

The WHO had a number of key objectives in implementing the WHO Jump Start Programme, which was designed to reinforce the Ministry of Health's ability to provide health services and to address the immediate health priorities during the humanitarian and reconstruction process. In addition, DFID has contributed &pound;70 million to the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI), of which &pound;30 million was used by the UN Trust Fund to provide funding to UN agencies, including the WHO's core programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.0/2">By March 2003, medical kits containing supplies for basic health care to cover half a million people for three months were available inside Iraq, in addition to the supplies in Government warehouses estimated to be the equivalent of three months of normal consumption. WHO also pre-positioned emergency health kits in neighbouring countries that could support primary health care for 240,000 people for three months. We are unable to provide the actual number of medical kits that were supplied with DFID funding. Since 2003, the WHO has provided consistent support to the Iraqi Ministry of Health (MOH). They have conducted many vital activities, such as rehabilitating key institutions, providing capacity building for MOH staff, together with giving high-level policy support and providing key disease surveillance assistance.</p>

	<p pid="a.76W.3/1">The UK has pledged &pound;644 million for development and reconstruction in Iraq since March 2003. This includes over &pound;120 million in humanitarian assistance to provide for immediate basic needs, a &pound;70 million contribution to United Nations and World Bank trust funds which carry out work on education and health, and &pound;100 million for reconstruction in southern Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.3/2">In water and sanitation, DFID emergency infrastructure repairs in 2003 increased water supply by up to 30 per cent. in some governorates in southern Iraq. We have replaced 200 kilometres of water mains in southern Iraq and repaired more than 5,000 leaks. Furthermore, we constructed a Water Training Centre in Basra to help Iraqi engineers to build the skills needed to maintain their infrastructure. We are also repairing a water plant which will supply drinking water to approximately half a million people in Basra. By summer 2007, we expect to have finished a &pound;7 million project to construct three water towers to provide tap water for a further 500,000 people. These projects have generated thousands of workdays for local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.76W.3/3">In education and health, DFID has channelled most of its assistance through financial contributions to international organisations and through the UN and World Bank trust funds. In education, over 5,000 schools have been rehabilitated; more than 100,000 primary and 40,000 secondary schools teachers have been trained; and over 70 million new textbooks distributed. In healthcare, over five million children have received life- saving vaccinations. More than 1,000 healthcare facilities have been rehabilitated or equipped, and more than 6,000 health workers trained. Through extensive disease control programmes, the prevalence of Leishmaniasis, measles, malaria and polio has declined.</p>

	<p pid="a.77W.2/15">We also provided &pound;18 million to International Red Cross, and &pound;4 million to a number of non-governmental organisations. These organisations all had experience of working in Iraq, and thus had well-established local networks and a capacity to quickly deliver assistance on the ground. They moved into Iraq soon after the major conflict ended and rapidly set up effective humanitarian operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.77W.2/16">Maintaining clean water supplies and effective sewage systems was a high priority. DFID's contribution to UNICEF helped repair water and sanitation facilities, and where necessary, supplied water by tanker while supplies were disrupted. Sewage removal in Baghdad was a major issue and given high priority by the coalition provisional authority. Similarly, with funding from DFID, UNDP bought essential equipment for hospitals and a water purification plant, and repaired water-pumping stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.77W.2/17">To improve the supply of electricity immediately after the conflict, UNDP undertook technical assessments of the problems and followed up with emergency repairs. The projects UNDP completed include essential repairs to overhead transmission lines and power generation plants to maintain Iraq's national electricity grid. It also repaired electricity substations and bought tools so that Iraqi engineers could maintain them.</p>

	<p pid="a.78W.2/18">A range of international agencies have been involved in constructing and rehabilitating schools since May 2003, with the United States as the major bilateral partner and the United Nations and World Bank providing support mainly through the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI). DFID has contributed &pound;70 million to IRFFI. Current plans are for 6,400 schools to be rehabilitated or constructed. 5,100 have already been completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.78W.2/19">Iraq's current higher education system comprises 20 universities and 47 technical institutes under the management of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MHESR). This includes 200 colleges, 800 departments, and 28 research centres. There are in addition 10 private colleges offering programmes in computer sciences, business administration, economics and management. The latest UNESCO survey of 2004 found a total student enrolment of 251,175, 42 per cent. of whom are women. Almost 50 per cent. of the students are enrolled at the five universities in Baghdad. Two universities have less than 2,000 students while Baghdad University enrols two thirds of all students.</p>

This involved a visit to Bolivia and Peru, and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including civil society, World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank colleagues. The evaluation concluded that to date, the DFID Andes office has had significant impact in strengthening the poverty focus of the International Financial Institutions, and in disseminating innovative approaches to development in the Andes region and beyond.</p>

	<p pid="a.83W.6/1">In October 2006, the Juba Initiative Fund was established by the UN to provide financial support to the peace talks between the Lords Resistance Army (LRA) and the Government of Uganda. The UN called for &pound;2.5 million in contributions and the UK made a contribution of &pound;250,000. Other donors have included Canada, Sweden, the Netherlands and Norway.</p>
	<p pid="a.83W.6/2">The fund has been used to help pay for the running costs of the Mediation Secretariat overseeing the talks and the team that was created to monitor the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement. It was also agreed that expenditures could cover the accommodation and food costs of all the delegates at the talks, including those representing the LRA. However all these costs have been paid by the UN directly to the hotels used and no delegates have received cash payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.83W.6/3">The UN has recently reported to us that by the end of December 2006, they had spent approximately &pound;1.4 million from the fund overall. We are awaiting a more detailed breakdown of expenditures which will include details on how much was spent on individual items including food and accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.83W.6/4">The LRA delegation left Juba in late December and they are currently refusing to return. They are demanding that the venue of the talks and the mediator be changed. Efforts are being made to try and persuade them to return and continue dialogue, led by UN Special Envoy Joaquim Chissano. A number of the LRA delegates are currently staying in Nairobi. The Juba Initiative Fund is not being used to finance their accommodation or living costs in Kenya.</p>

	<p pid="a.84W.2/1">Following the launch of the UK policy on conditionally, improving the use of conditions by multilateral institutions has been a high priority. The majority of these efforts have focused on the World Bank and IMF and some important progress has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.2/2">In 2005 the UK agreed to provide &pound;100 million in addition to our core funding of the World Bank if progress was made on harmonisation and conditionality. The first &pound;50 million was linked to the bank carrying out a thorough review of its practice and current thinking on conditionality. In September 2005 the bank's governors endorsed this review along with five new 'Good Practice Principles' for the use of conditions which accord well with the principles underlying the UK policy on conditionality.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.2/3">We also secured an agreement that the bank management would report to the board on progress after one year. The first report did not provide sufficient information and in September 2006, we told the bank that we would withhold our second contribution of &pound;50 million until we saw clear evidence that the principles were being applied. President Wolfowitz agreed to produce a fuller report, which was discussed by the bank's board in December. In our view, this thorough and candid report provided the evidence that the bank has made the satisfactory progress on conditionality that is required to release the second &pound;50 million contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.2/4">The report also reiterated bank management's strong commitment to make further improvements in its use of conditionality. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.2/5" class="indent">avoiding conditions on sensitive policy areas if government ownership is uncertain or the political environment is fragile;</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.2/6" class="indent">early and more proactive disclosure of the bank's analytic work;</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.2/7" class="indent">reducing the number of benchmarks;</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.2/8" class="indent">specifying the progress expected so that an assessment can be made of the impact of the programme on the poor and the bank's contribution to that programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.2/9">Going forward, further progress on conditionality will be a central consideration in our funding of the next replenishment of the World Bank, which begins in March. We asked the bank to produce their next report on conditionality later this year and to consult with developing country governments in order to hear their views on how things are changing.</p>
	<p pid="a.84W.2/10">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has a set of conditionality guidelines that are aligned with the principles adopted by the bank. The IMF's most recent internal review demonstrated an improved focus of conditions within its area of core competence on macroeconomics. In addition a detailed report by the fund's independent evaluation office is currently being finalised. This will examine the IMF's use of conditions in areas such as privatisation and trade liberalisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.90W.0/1">The Government's responses to the reports were placed in the Libraries of both Houses and can also be found on the Home Office website. The response sets out in some detail the steps which are being taken to maintain and improve, where necessary, the quality of decision making by officials scrutinising claims for asylum. The relevant time target for the period 2002 to 2006 was to ensure that by 2004 that 75 per cent. of substantive asylum applications were decided within two months; and that 75 per cent., including final appeal, are decided within six months. Under the new asylum processes, with effect from April 2007 the target is for 35 per cent. of new asylum applications to be concluded within six months, rising annually to 90 per cent. by 2011. These targets are set on the basis of the Government's assessment of the quality of service which can reasonably be expected in the light of the resources available.</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.0/2">Officials are expected to reach their decisions on the facts of each case, underpinned by objective country of origin information, supplied by the Country of Origin Information Service. Knowledge of patterns of abuse of the asylum process by people of particular nationalities may well be relevant to the overall assessment of a claim, but could not in itself be grounds for its refusal. External assessment of asylum decisions is taken by Treasury solicitors and UNHCR and used to inform our ongoing work on decision quality.</p>

Information about UK NHS patients is not shared with other European health administrations unless the patient has consented, and either has been referred for treatment to a provider in another European state or is seeking care from a provider in another European state (e.g. they are taken ill while abroad).

	<p pid="a.99W.5/1">The British Government seek to remove individuals to Algeria on the basis of assurances regarding treatment contained within an exchange of letters, signed by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister and President Bouteflika on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July 2006</phrase> (copies are in the Library), supplemented by specific assurances where necessary. This approach has recently been endorsed by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC).</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.5/2">The two individuals referred to voluntarily chose to withdraw their appeals against deportation and were returned to Algeria last month. The general assurances in the exchange of letters will apply to both individuals. Specific assurances were also sought in the case of the individual returned on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-24">24 January</phrase>. The individual who was returned on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-20">20 January</phrase> withdrew his appeal before the process of seeking assurances in his case. Officials from the British embassy in Algiers have remained in close contact with the Algerian authorities regarding the deported individuals. Both men were provided with full details of the British embassy's contact details and it was explained that they or a nominated contact point could maintain contact with the British embassy after their return. Neither of the men wished to make such a request.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.5/3">The British Government are confident we can deport terrorist suspects to Algeria without breaching the UK's domestic and international human rights obligations. We base this judgment on the changing circumstances in Algeria, on the rapidly developing relationship between the UK and Algeria and on the assurances given by the Algerian government on individual deportees.</p>

Taking such potentially lethal items off the streets contributes to community safety but an amnesty is just one aspect of the wider overall strategy. This includes enhancing already tough legislation through the Violent Crime Reduction Act, supporting community activity through the Connected Fund and other project funding, and working with the Association of Chief Police Officers Criminal Use of Firearms Group on a range of issues focusing on prevention, intelligence and enforcement.</p>

	<p pid="a.107W.3/1">Skilled workers currently in the UK under the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP) can apply to extend their leave. The rules for the HSMP extension applications have recently been amended to ensure that applicants already in the UK under the programme have been making, and can continue to make, a contribution to the UK economy. The changes were based on a thorough analysis of the HSMP criteria. Individuals applying to extend their leave to remain in the UK under the HSMP must now achieve a minimum of 75 points against robust points scoring criteria (qualifications, previous earnings, age and UK experience, with a provision for MBA graduates from selected institutions) and must also meet a mandatory English language requirement. The points scoring structure is flexible and is based on criteria that will indicate success in the labour market. If an applicant claims fewer points in one area, they can make up for it by claiming more points in another.</p>
	<p pid="a.107W.3/2">It is expected that the majority of migrants currently in the UK under the HSMP will qualify under the new points test. Transitional arrangements have been put in place to support those existing participants of the HSMP who will fail to satisfy the new points scoring assessment but who have been contributing to the UK economy.</p>

We have started to put in place a procedure for recording systematically how many malfunctions are caused by a technical fault rather than damage by the offender. However, technical faults are rare because all equipment types are rigorously tested before operational use.</p>

	<p pid="a.128W.5/1">The Crime Fighting Fund, introduced in April 2000, provided specific grant for police forces to recruit 9,650 additional police officers over and above their own recruitment plans in the four years to March 2004. There was a target for police numbers to reach 132,500 by March 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.128W.5/2">From April 2004 the rules of the Crime Fighting Fund worked in such a way as to require forces to maintain police numbers above an annually determined level. The following table sets out the Crime Fighting Fund threshold and actual strength achieved for England and Wales and for North Yorkshire police for each year from 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.128W.5/3">In December 2006 we announced that the system of penalties for falling below target strength was suspended following representations from the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.128W.5/4">North Yorkshire's share of the Crime Fighting Fund was sufficient to recruit an additional 72 police officers&mdash;four in 2000-01, 39 in 2001-02, 25 in 2002-03 and four in 2003-04. Since 2004 North Yorkshire has received &pound;1.95 million in continuation funding for these posts.</p>

	<p pid="a.143W.2/1">It is not possible to provide precise figures as so much prostitution is hidden from view. However published Home Office research has looked at the numbers involved who are drug addicted and has provided broad estimates of the numbers of people trafficked into the UK for the purposes of prostitution. Information on the proportion born outside the UK is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/2">A Home Office Research Study in 2004 profiled 228 women involved in street-based prostitution. It found 87 per cent. were using heroin and 64 per cent. crack cocaine. Anecdotal evidence from respondents to the Home Office led review of prostitution in 2004 suggested that a high proportion&mdash;in many areas, almost all&mdash;of those involved in street-based prostitution are Class A drug users. Home Office funded research in 2000 found that 71 women were known to have been trafficked into prostitution in the UK in 1998. Using this figure as a baseline the research estimated that there may have been between 142 and 1,420 women trafficked into the UK during the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.143W.2/3">A research paper on sizing UK organised crime markets and their associated harms will be published in early 2007. Emerging findings suggest that at any one moment in time in 2003 there were around 4,000 victims of trafficking for prostitution in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.146W.2/2">Penalty Notices for Disorder (PND) provide the police with a swift non-bureaucratic disposal option to deal with minor offences. They are fixed penalty. There is no means test as part of the process of issuing PNDs and it would be impractical and overly bureaucratic to seek means information before issuing a ticket. Payment must be made in full; the current PND computer processing system precludes payment by instalments. If the recipient does not pay the penalty or request a court hearing, a fine at one and a half times the penalty amount is registered against the recipient and enforced in the same way as any other fine. However, operational guidance to the police advises officers that PNDs may not be appropriate for a suspect who appears to be destitute.</p>

	<p pid="a.147W.2/1">The Home Office commissioned the pilot use of polygraph (lie detection) testing of sex offenders in 10 Probation Areas. The pilot lasted for two years, between September 2003 and September 2005. 347 offenders volunteered for testing, 33 per cent. of whom (116) were tested on two or more occasions. In total, 483 polygraph examinations were carried out. The majority of offenders tested had been convicted of offences against children: 166 (48 per cent.) of contact offences against children, 111 (32 per cent.) of internet related offences, with 70 (20 per cent.) for offences classified as other sex offences. Rapists were not separately classified but were among this 20 per cent. of the sample. The main aim of the study was to assist Offender Managers in risk assessment and risk management based on new disclosures made by offenders during the examination. Overall new disclosures relevant to treatment or supervision were made in 70 per cent. of tests. However, the report does not provide information on differences between offence types and, as the sample was of volunteers, no firm conclusions may be drawn from it as to whether the disclosures are attributable to the polygraph tests. The full report is available from the website of the National Probation Service.</p>

	<p pid="a.148W.6/1">The Government have invested &pound;5 million in the Crime Reduction Programme Restorative Justice pilots and their independent evaluation. The final research reports on victim and offender satisfaction, and on the impact of restorative justice on re-offending and cost-effectiveness, are expected to be published this year. This research will inform our longer term strategy for adult restorative justice. In the meantime, Best Practice Guidance for Restorative Practitioners was issued in December 2004, and this now forms the basis of National Occupational Standards. In March 2005, the National Criminal Justice Board provided guidance to Local Criminal Justice Boards to encourage the development of adult restorative justice schemes, particularly as a service to victims. The guidance included toolkits for local criminal justice agencies setting up schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.6/2">The Home Office Youth Justice and Children Unit is the sponsor of the Youth Justice Board (YJB). As part of the YJB's work overseeing the youth justice system to reduce offending and re-offending by children and young people under 18, the YJB has promoted restorative justice in the youth justice system since 2001, including the publication of the key elements of effective practice in restorative justice and setting performance targets for youth offending teams to develop restorative processes with high levels of victim satisfaction. The YJB is working to develop and broaden the practice of restorative justice and in December 2006 an Action Plan, 'Developing Restorative Justice', was published. The plan outlines details of projects which will improve the delivery of referral orders and youth offender panels, promote restorative justice in the secure estate and develop a long term restorative justice strategy.</p>

This will allow measurement of change in people's perception of respect at the local and the national level. We have also developed a 'basket of measures', agreed with all relevant Government Departments, which identifies change on a number of outcome and output measures that relate to respect, such as truancy and bullying. In addition to this, we conduct and publish a regular survey of local areas to learn more about their use of tools and powers to tackle antisocial behaviour. A number of commitments in the Respect Action Plan are subject to separate evaluations, including an evaluation of the schemes to establish new models for conditional cautions, parenting pathfinders and family intervention projects&mdash;the outcome of which will be published fully.</p>
	<p pid="a.149W.2/4">The Respect programme is a key Government priority and as such is reflected in performance frameworks for local agencies.

Together with the relevant Government Departments, we will continue to push forward activity in developing and fulfilling the commitments in the Respect Action Plan.</p>

General information for families and others can be accessed on HM Prison Service's website or requested from the local establishment. Prison Service Order 4950 is complemented by a service level agreement between the Youth Justice Board and the Prison Service, which contains a specific service specification for the service's five dedicated girls' units. The PSO requires that staff working with under-18s should receive specialist training as specified in the SLA. Training is currently provided through the Juvenile Awareness Staff Programme, which contains elements specific to young women. The SLA sets a level of at least 10 hours a day for time out of cell. The under-18 version of the Offender's Learning Journey (OLJ), the specification for the learning and skills delivery service, requires each learner to receive 25 hours learning a week. The SLA reinforces this with the requirement that young people in young offender institutions receive an average of 25 hours of education, training and personal development activity each week. The OLJ requires that every young person should have an Individual Learning Plan, which the learning provider is required to pass on as young people transfer between custodial institutions and, through the youth offending team, to the responsible learning provider following release.</p>

	<p pid="a.166W.6/1">The Government are committed to the elimination of trafficking and child labour in all countries and for all purposes&mdash;including the possible role of trafficked children in harvesting cocoa beans. Through our links with PROBA (EU Working Party on Commodities), we encourage the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) work on improving long-term and sustainable economies in cocoa-producing countries. This includes strengthening institutional capacity to address forced labour and the worst forms of child labour. It is critical that the underlying poverty that is at the root of trafficking and child labour is tackled. Stopping child labour without ensuring alternative income for the family or appropriate, good quality education opportunities for the children is likely to be ineffective and may drive children into more hidden and harmful jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.166W.6/2">The Government have a strong commitment to ratification and enforcement of international human rights standards: the UK has ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention 138 on the minimum age for employment and ILO Convention 182 on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, and encourages other countries to ratify and conform to these Conventions. DFID is a major supporter of the ILO, including its International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) and the Special Programme for the Elimination of Forced Labour (SAP-FL).</p>

	<p pid="a.169W.5/1">Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) is open to all farmers in England. HLS is a competitive scheme which aims to deliver significant environmental outcomes in high priority situations and areas. The key characteristics of the different parts of the English countryside have been outlined in over 150 Joint Character Areas. Each area has priority targets for the management of a variety of features and HLS applications are scored directly against these targets. Those applications which meet or exceed a pre-determined regional threshold may be offered an agreement. It therefore follows that applications which address the relevant priority targets for their area have the greatest likelihood of approval.</p>

	<p pid="a.172W.2/2">Local authorities (both trading standards and emergency planners) have close working relationships with LACORS and their local SVS offices on an ongoing basis, which provides mutual support and guidance where required.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.2/3">Local authorities regularly participate in animal disease contingency exercises led by the SVS, and LACORS provides guidance on their website including a local authority contingency plan template as well as extensive guidance on responsibilities during an outbreak.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.2/4">In addition, a range of guidance on preventative measures has been made available to local authorities, from Defra, including guidance on the national poultry register, biosecurity, bird gatherings and other relevant guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.2/5">These relationships have worked extremely well since the confirmed case of H5N1 near Lowestoft in Suffolk, and have ensured that local authorities' needs are recognised at a national level.</p>

	<p pid="a.173W.0/1">The UK does not accept uncooked meat or live birds from areas where H5N1 has been reported.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.0/2">We do not routinely screen all products imported into the UK for any disease. In the case of H5N1, it would not be practicable or proportionate to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.0/3">Veterinary checks are carried out on imported animals and animal products from approved establishments in approved countries outside the EU, to ensure that they meet the strict EU veterinary import conditions and do not pose a risk to public or animal health. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks. At least 50 per cent. of poultry meat consignments undergo physical checks, as do all consignments of live birds. These must come with an official health certificate guaranteeing compliance with EU rules and freedom from disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.0/4">The State Veterinary Service carries out checks of live animals at Border Inspection Points (BIP). Checks on meat products are carried out by local authorities. Consignments which do not comply with EU import conditions are either re-exported outside the EU or destroyed.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.0/5">If there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health, EU legislation permits us to take appropriate safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of meat from all, or parts, of an affected country. Should such an outbreak occur within another EU member state, EU law compels the authorities to introduce measures to protect animal health including movement bans, protection and surveillance zones.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.0/6">In addition, all frontline HMRC detection staff include products of animal origin (POAO) as part of their anti-smuggling responsibilities. Within these resources there are also dedicated teams deployed (currently totalling around 100 officers) with prime responsibility for detecting illegal POAO imports. HMRC controls are carried out on the basis of risk assessments and other intelligence, so that the routes considered to pose the greatest disease risk are targeted . HMRC's activities are supported by the use of detector dogs and baggage X-ray scanning equipment.</p>

	<p pid="a.176W.2/1">Targeted surveillance for high pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza and other avian influenza viruses in wild birds is in place throughout the UK and is ongoing. The targeted surveillance focuses on species of wild birds that experts believe to have a greater potential role in the spread of avian influenza viruses. There is a comprehensive list which generally includes ducks, geese, swans, gulls and waders. Sampling is targeted to high priority surveillance areas; these have been chosen on the basis of abundance of migratory waterbird species and domestic poultry. Members of the public can report dead swans, ducks, geese, waders and gulls by calling the DEFRA Helpline 08459 33 55 77.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.2/2">Within the area around the infected premises in Suffolk, there will be enhanced levels of surveillance of wild birds. We are aware of 30 key waterbird locations in Suffolk (such as estuaries and marshes). 12 of these locations are within 20 kilometres of the infected premises of which 10 are patrolled regularly as part of the programme. Within the protection, surveillance and restricted zones we are requiring keepers to house their birds or otherwise separate them from contact with wild birds.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.2/3">DEFRA has also issued extensive guidance to bird keepers on biosecurity measures to protect their birds from avian influenza, which is housing and available on the DEFRA website. It is crucial that keepers follow these measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.176W.8/1">Little is known of the Pashford pot beetle, other than it is associated with wetlands. During the last century it was recorded from various sites in the Norfolk Broads and Lincolnshire fens but, since 1910, it has been known from only a single site, Pashford Poors Fen in Suffolk. It has not been seen since 1986.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.8/2">Pashford Poors Fen is probably not an ideal location for this species, as it comprises a series of small wetlands in a matrix of dry Breckland grassland. The area has not been subject to the extensive sallow scrub invasion that the beetle needs, and may be too small to support a thriving population.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.8/3">A study in 2006 found that, in Britain, the Sussex Diving Beetle, <i> Laccophilus poecilus</i> (also called the Puzzled Skipper), has mainly been associated with grazing fen in richly vegetated ditch margins. However, this species can also occupy a wide range of stagnant habitats. Occasional captures of specimens in Yorkshire suggest that there is as yet an undiscovered colony.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.8/4">The RSPB has recently acquired a large area of land at Lewes Levels, which includes the last known recorded locality for this species. Over a year ago a site visit was undertaken by representatives from the RSPB, Natural England and the Aquatic Coleoptera Conservation Trust to determine what site management could be carried out for the species. The issue of water quality was also raised. It was considered that the construction of on-site water bodies (ponds) that were not linked to the main water system of ditches (and hence isolated from eutrophication) would be beneficial.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.8/5">Circumstance permitting, it is expected that the RSPB will undertake work to create suitable ponds in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.176W.8/6">Overall, however, the primary conservation goal is to establish the Sussex Diving Beetle's exact status and locality. This will help to inform decisions about the most suitable steps to be taken to conserve this species.</p>

However some information on the area of oilseed rape grown for use in biofuel production is available from the Energy Aid Scheme which started in 2004. In England there were 32,237 hectares of oilseed rape grown in 2004 and in 2005 this had increased to 92,727 hectares.</p>
	<p pid="a.177W.5/3">These figures may not capture all oilseed rape grown for biofuel production; only that declared under this particular scheme. Oilseed rape grown on other land and which may have been used for biofuel production is not known because there is no way of identifying the end use of the crop. From <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) will require a declaration of sustainability to help identify sources of biofuels.</p>

	<p pid="a.184W.3/2">Substantial investment by Government has helped British Waterways eliminate its safety backlog and reduce its long-term maintenance arrears from &pound;270 million (worth &pound;398 million today) in 1996-97, to &pound;97 million by end of March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.184W.3/3">British Waterways had anticipated spending around &pound;31 million in 2006-07 on its maintenance arrears programme. However following a reduction in its budget, the outturn expenditure is likely to be around &pound;26 million. Taken as a proportion of annual spend on statutory maintenance, this amounts to around two months expenditure. I will be discussing British Waterway's plans for management of its arrears in the context of the Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

It is for each local authority to decide what proportion of the block to invest in waste management services.

	<p pid="a.191W.5/1">A study published in May 2006 by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), on the environmental benefits of recycling, estimated that recycling certain key materials saves between 10 to 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents per year, compared to applying the current mix of landfill and incineration with energy recovery. This is the equivalent of taking around 3.5 million cars off UK roads for one year.</p>
	<p pid="a.191W.5/2">Another recent study carried out for DEFRA, to be published shortly, examined the lifecycle carbon impacts of principal waste streams. This is providing further information on the relative contributions of various waste management processes to climate change emissions. It is also informing he Government's revised Waste Strategy, which we intend to publish in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.191W.5/3">Recycling and composting biodegradable waste, that would otherwise go to landfill, also helps reduce landfill methane emissions, which account for three per cent of the UK's total greenhouse gas emissions and is 20 times more portent than CO2. The recycling of all materials saves energy, including through the reduced need for raw material extraction.</p>

	<p pid="a.194W.2/1">DEFRA has overall policy responsibility for flood risk management in England, funds most of the Environment Agency (EA)'s flood related work and grant aids individual capital improvement projects undertaken by local authorities and internal drainage boards. The programme to manage risk is driven by these operating authorities. DEFRA does not carry out works, nor direct the authorities on which specific projects to undertake.</p>
	<p pid="a.194W.2/2">The only budget reduction for flood risk management has been the reduction in the DEFRA-funded EA resource budget for 2006-07 from &pound;238 million to &pound;223 million. The EA capital budget (which delivers new and improved defences and flood warning systems) of &pound;190 million was not affected, nor were the capital budgets for the other authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.194W.2/3">The EA has maintained investment levels in 2006-07 in non-recurring maintenance&mdash;which improves the condition of defences&mdash;but has had to reduce the scale of routine maintenance in some regions. I understand the EA has managed the impact of the reduction so as to minimise the impact on flood risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.194W.2/4">The EA's allocation of DEFRA grant in aid for flood risk management in 2007-08 will be &pound;435.7 million. This is an increase compared to the 2006-07 original allocation and more than restores the in-year reduction in 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="a.198W.2/1">As part of the ongoing Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) site rationalisation plan all Dstl jobs were relocated from Glasgow and Dunfermline to Dstl Porton Down by <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.198W.2/2">Currently, Dstl only has two members of staff based in Scotland, both of whom are on secondment to the MOD. In the financial years 2004-05 and 2005-06 Dstl spent &pound;3,500 of its personnel budget in Scotland, this was 0.09 per cent. of the total Dstl personnel budget. This funding was spent on the participation of Dstl in recruitment fairs.</p>

	</table>
	<p pid="a.198W.5/12">It is policy that all personnel deploying on operations are issued with their personnel set of ECBA. In addition to this standard issue capability, two additional variants of body armour have been developed to meet different operational requirements known as Kestrel Osprey body armour. These different types of body armour allow force commanders to choose the appropriate balance between protection and mobility depending on the specific operational circumstances, threats and missions. There are enough sets of all types of body armour in Iraq and Afghanistan to supply all those that need them.</p>
	<p pid="a.198W.5/13">In the early stages of Telic, there was an acknowledged initial shortfall of ECBA in theatre. The allocation of ECBA was, therefore, decided locally by commanders on the ground, based on role: dismounted close combat soldiers, primarily infantry, were given the highest priority, followed by soldiers mounted in unarmoured vehicles, mounted armoured soldiers considered the lowest risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.199W.5/1">Currently, we have no plans to base the parental contribution for continuity of education allowance on the salaries of service personnel. I should also point out the contribution is not based on a service person's earnings.</p>
	<p pid="a.199W.5/2">We recognise that service parents may find it difficult to maintain the continuity of their children's education, due to the nature of their employment and the unique demands of military life. It is for this reason that there are various educational allowances available to eligible service personnel to help meet some of the costs of ensuring continuity of their children's education. Continuity of education for their children would not otherwise be possible in the state maintained day school sector if these children accompanied their parents to postings in both the UK and overseas. However, the Ministry of Defence does not reimburse the full cost of school fees and parents are required to pay a minimum 10 per cent. parental contribution for each child when they claim a service education allowance. Also, when assessing each claim, any grant or scholarship made by the school, official benefactors, local education authorities or other public bodies, and any discounts offered to the service parent by the school, is deducted from the fees before the 10 per cent. minimum parental contribution is calculated. It is a matter for the service parent to decide which state or private sector boarding school they wish their children to attend. In doing so, service parents will consider the full cost of their child's education, a significant part of which will be schools fees, for which all parents must pay a minimum 10 per cent.</p>

The Government will continue to do all that they can to explain and publicise the 15-day transfer rule to all schools to ensure that they meet this target and will continue to use Teachernet, Schoolsweb and Spectrum to do this.</p>

	<p pid="a.204W.11/3">The MOD also participates in the Government carbon offsetting fund by ensuring that flights by Ministers and Head Office civilian and service personnel, in non-operational posts, are carbon offset.</p>
	<p pid="a.204W.11/4">From January 2006 the Department also began to collate data on carbon dioxide emissions from all fuel purchased by MOD and the armed forces and, where practicable, other greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

	<p pid="a.205W.2/1">In addition to an extensive programme of general recruiting activity, all three Services have specialist ethnic minority recruiting and outreach teams which undertake many and varied initiatives aimed at encouraging more young people from our minority communities into joining the armed forces. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.205W.2/2" class="indent">The Royal Navy's Diversity Recruiting and Awareness Team give presentations in schools and colleges, to community and faith leaders; organising and operating five-day Personal Development Courses; attending careers events; and attending cultural and religious festivals and events.</p>
	<p pid="a.205W.2/3" class="indent">The Army's Diversity Action Recruiting Team (DART) provides role models to young people from ethnic minorities at recruiting events throughout the country. Within DART there are Community Liaison Officers who engage and develop relationships with key figures within the ethnic minority communities in their respective regions. DART attends some 650-700 events each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.205W.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-20">20 January</phrase>, the RN's Diversity Action Team invited a group of young people from the Small Heath (predominantly Muslim) area of Birmingham to take part in an RN Introduction Day. The Team has been working with a sub branch of the UK Islamic Mission called the Urban Development Foundation-part of a five month EM recruiting drive focusing on the Small Heath and Handsworth area of the city.</p>
	<p pid="a.205W.2/5">The Army's participation in Bid celebrations in Bradford and Nottingham and a visit to an East London Muslim community and Mosque.</p>

	<p pid="a.205W.2/7">The armed forces have for the past three years sponsored an award at the annual Muslim News Awards and will again sponsor this year's awards.</p>
	<p pid="a.205W.2/8">The RAF's Motivational Outreach Team is responsible for promoting the Service in major communities. Their work is augmented by Careers Liaison Officers, Community Careers Liaison Officers and a network of Youth Activity Liaison Officers across the UK.

	<p pid="a.219W.2/2">Detailed planning by Army and Navy staffs and the MOD for the attachment of a fourth manoeuvre unit to 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines has been on-going since May 2005. Following my announcement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-29">29 January 2007</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2007-01-29.4"><i> Official Report,</i> column 4WS</phrase>, a joint Army and Navy working group is taking forward the planning and implementation of the attachment of 1 Rifles to 3 Commando Brigade from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.2/3">1 Rifles will not undertake the Lead Commando Group role but will carry out the role of secondary assault wave manoeuvre unit in the same manner as other Commando Units.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.2/4">There is no requirement for 1 Rifles personnel to attend a pre-course or to undertake the full all arms commando course in order to carry out their role as the fourth manoeuvre unit for 3 Commando Brigade. Individuals may in the course of their individual career development, apply for and attend the all arms commando course.</p>
	<p pid="a.219W.2/5">The attachment of 1 Rifles to 3 Commando Brigade will enable the Brigade to be both on standby for contingent operations while simultaneously providing units to the Current Operational Commitments Plot. This will increase the overall delivery of military capability in line with Defence Strategic Guidance. The integration of an Infantry Battalion into a strong coalition amphibious structure that includes the US Marine Corps and the Royal Netherland Marine Corps units will have wider Defence benefits. In addition, the co-operation and co-ordination of effort between the Army and Navy will bring benefits in terms of resource and information sharing in the training and education of soldiers and single service tactics, techniques and procedures. Army understanding of operations in the littoral environment will also be broadened.</p>

	<p pid="a.224W.8/1">It is our policy that mental health issues should be properly recognised and appropriately handled and that every effort should be made to reduce the stigma associated with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.8/2">We have put measures in place to increase awareness at all levels and to mitigate against the development of PTSD and other stress-related health issues. These include pre-and post-deployment briefing and the availability of support, assessment and (if required) treatment, both during and after operational deployments. This is available to all personnel, whether regular or mobilised reservist.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.8/3">All significant operational deployments have mental health professionals as part of the deployed medical team. The team might comprise psychiatrists and/or mental health nurses. This team will continue the educational process during the operational tour and will also brief the chain of command about operational mental health issues detected. Individuals might be referred to the team for assessment and management and the therapeutic options will include psychological treatments, use of medication or aero-medical evacuation of the individual out of theatre back to further care at their home base.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.8/4">Back in the UK, treatment will normally be provided through one of the MOD's 15 Departments of Community Mental Health around the UK (with satellite centres based in Germany, Cyprus and Gibraltar). In the small number of cases when in-patient treatment is required, this will be provided in facilities run by the Priory Group, under the terms of a contract with MOD.</p>
	<p pid="a.224W.8/5">Finally, the MOD has recently launched a new initiative&mdash;the Reserves Mental Health Programme&mdash;which is open to reservists who have been demobilised since January 2003 following overseas operational deployment as a reservist and who have concerns that their mental health has suffered primarily as a result of their operational service leading up to their demobilisation. They will be invited to attend the Reserves Training and Mobilisation Centre at Chilwell, Nottinghamshire, where members of the Defence Medical Services will carry out an assessment of their mental health. If it is considered that they are eligible for out-patient treatment by the Defence Medical Services, this will be provided at one of the Departments of Community Mental Health, at the most convenient site to meet the individual's circumstances whenever possible.

	<p pid="a.225W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence has a broad spectrum of assessment, treatment and care available for Service personnel seeking assistance with any mental health condition. Service personnel have access to mental health professionals in the theatre of operations, in the United Kingdom, and other base areas overseas. In theatre, military Field Mental Health Teams provide assessment, treatment and support to Service personnel deployed on major operations. These teams are manned by qualified Registered Nurses and Community Mental Health Nurses who have access to theatre-based medical staff and support from United Kingdom-based specialists.</p>
	<p pid="a.225W.2/2">Some personnel will be referred direct from theatre to a military Department of Community Mental Health that is local to his or her home unit. Here the individual will have access to a multidisciplinary team made up of Psychiatrists, Nurses, Psychologists and Social Workers; the individual's specific needs will determine which discipline(s) will best suit the requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.225W.2/3">Those requiring inpatient assessment and treatment will, depending on their needs, be admitted to an Independent Service Provider hospital in the United Kingdom (or for some patients based in Germany, to the Military Mental Health Unit, Wegberg). If this is required, the individual is aeromedically evacuated under the care of specially trained clinicians. When treated in an ISP hospital, uniformed Service Liaison Officers act as a representative for the patient and liaise with the hospital and military authorities on relevant matters of the individual's care.</p>
	<p pid="a.225W.2/4">While the specific conditions mentioned in the question are rare in the military population, they do sometimes occur. Service personnel with suspected or confirmed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders have access to all the specialist assessment and treatment facilities that I have described. Where relevant, assessment and treatment are delivered in accordance with the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.225W.2/5">All military psychiatry and mental health services are occupational in nature and the aim is to return to full military functioning. When illness is chronic, demanding and debilitating and as such may prevent the individual from returning to service, the Service mental health, social work and resettlement specialities will work with the individual with a view to making the transition from Service to civilian life, and will liaise closely with NHS teams, social services and other authorities. The primary aim of all concerned is to provide a seamless transfer of the patient's care from the military to the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.226W.5/1">An unclassified report summarising the BW Defence Field Trials conducted by the MOD between 1940 and 1979 was published in February 1999. A copy is available in the Library of the House, reference DERA/CBD/CR990038. Many of the reports of the individual trials are now also available in the National Archive. By the late 1970's the programme was drawing to a close with a small number of trials involving <i> Bacillus globigi</i>, <i> E.coli</i> and killed <i> Serratia Marcesens</i> on restricted access MOD sites. In 1976, 77 and 78 these trials were undertaken on the range at Porton Down (no dates are given in the relevant technical reports). Also in 1976, trials were conducted at HMS Phoenix NBCD school Portsmouth on 5, 7, 9, 12, 14 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-15">15 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.226W.5/2">In subsequent years, some small scale trials involving chemicals or micro-organisms have taken place on MOD land, but the information requested is not collated centrally and there is no indication that the details required have been retained within the MOD. A review of the information held within MOD and the compilation of any information located would involve disproportionate cost.</p>

An impact of the Order is that the boundaries of the new Assembly Constituencies will differ from those of the parliamentary constituencies until coterminosity is restored at the date of the next General Election.

The amount of data produced from the 2001 Census for the new Welsh Assembly constituencies (that will share boundaries with parliamentary constituencies at the next general election), and the timing of its release, will depend on available resources and the priority of other Census outputs.</p>

I am replying in her absence. (119004)</p>
	<p pid="a.247W.2/4" class="indent">The Marriage Act 1949 provides for civil and religious marriages. Separate arrangements apply to marriages according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England, Jews and the Society of Friends. Marriages according to the rites and ceremonies of all other religions may take place in a registered building that is principally used by a congregation meeting for religious worship and is certified to the Registrar General as a place of religious worship. A building is registered for marriages by the Registrar General on application by the proprietor or trustee of the building.</p>
	<p pid="a.247W.2/5" class="indent">The application has to be accompanied by a certificate signed by at least twenty householders that the building is their usual place of public religious worship. When a building has been registered for marriages, it may be used for the solemnisation of marriages according to religious rites and ceremonies. For the first year, marriages are attended and registered by a registrar. After that first year, the trustees or governing body may authorise a person from within the congregation to act as registrar and notify the Registrar General, who will then issue that person with marriage registers and certificates, providing she is satisfied as to the safe custody of those registers.</p>
	<p pid="a.247W.2/6" class="indent">Provision is also made for a religious marriage by a person who is housebound, detained or seriously ill and not expected to recover.</p>
	<p pid="a.247W.2/7" class="indent">The Government does not consider the Marriage Act 1949 to be incompatible with the Human Rights Act. It is therefore not appropriate to take separate account of human rights legislation in this process. The Registrar General has occasionally received representations in respect of specific applications.</p>

	<p pid="a.250W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.250W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-08">8 February 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.250W.2/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent question asking what proportion of gross annual income was taken in tax and national insurance contributions for each decile of the taxable income distribution in (a) cash and (b) real terms in each year since 1997.1 am replying in her absence. (119388).</p>
	<p pid="a.250W.2/4" class="indent">Estimates of income tax and national insurance payments by income decile appear in the ONS analysis 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household income'. The latest analysis for 2004/05 was published on the National Statistics website on 12th May 2006 at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. The analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey, which is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.250W.2/5" class="indent">The tables below show the average annual payment of income tax and national insurance contributions expressed as a percentage of gross household income, for household in each income decile. The income deciles are based on a ranking of households using equivalised disposable household income (rather than taxable income). This is the standard measure of income used for distributional analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.250W.2/6" class="indent">The percentages are reasonably comparable over time. The figures in the annual analysis are not deflated or expressed in real terms because the main focus of interest is in the income distribution and how this distribution changes over time. However, even if the figures used to calculate the percentages appearing below were adjusted for average price changes using the Retail Prices Index, the percentages would be the same, since both gross household income, and tax payments would be adjusted by the same factor.</p>
	<p pid="a.250W.2/7" class="indent">There was a change to the way that tax credits were treated from 2003/04 onwards, which has some effect on the estimates of income tax payment. Up until 2002/03 tax credits were treated as cash benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.250W.2/8" class="indent">From 2003/04, they are classified as negative income tax, but only to the extent that income tax less tax credits, remains greater than or equal to zero for each family.</p>
	<p pid="a.250W.2/9" class="indent">So for households paying relatively little or no income tax, tax credit payments were still regarded either partially or wholly, as cash benefits. Based on figures for 2003/04, the effect of this change is to reduce the estimate of income tax as a proportion of gross income by 0.4%.</p>
	<p pid="a.250W.2/10" class="indent">The percentage payments reflect both the number of households paying each tax, and the size of the payments. Since the results are based on a sample survey, some of the year to year movement is due to sampling variability, however the tables do illustrate longer term trends in the distribution of tax payments.</p>

Access to mental health services is based on each patient's clinical need as determined by clinicians.

	<p pid="a.252W.9/1">The Government announced, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-08">8 December 2005</phrase>, their intention to implement a national index in 150 local authorities by the end of 2008. We are now nearing completion of the design phase which will include agreement of the proposed build and implementation plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.9/2">Section 12 of the Children Act 2004, and affirmative resolution regulations to be made under section 12, will set out the information that must or may be included on the index.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.9/3">The index will contain a limited and basic record for all children in England up to the age of 18 including basic identifying information&mdash;name, address, gender, data of birth, and a unique identifying number based on the existing child reference number/national insurance number; contact details for the child's parent of carer; contact details for services involved with the child; a means for practitioners to indicate that they have information to share, have taken action, or have undertaken a Common Assessment Framework in relation to the child; and other information, included solely for the purposes of identifying and managing the quality of data in the index, for example the date of the last update to the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.9/4">Section 12 and the supporting regulations specifically prohibit the inclusion of any case information on the index.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.9/5">To help support the transition to adult services, there is provision for records of young people who receive additional services&mdash;for example care leavers and those with learning disabilities&mdash;to remain on the index, with their consent, up to the age of 25.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.9/6">A recent public consultation, which concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-14">14 December 2006</phrase>, sought views on a number of additional data items for inclusion on the index including the addition of name and contact details of the child's health visitor, school nurse and named midwife and, where appropriate, the date of death. Inclusion of the date of death will help to ensure that practitioners who had been working with the child become aware that the child has died and, where approaching the family is necessary, can do so sensitively. It will also enable a timely closure of the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.9/7">The index will be populated from existing national and local data sources. Data sources are yet to be confirmed but officials are in discussions with a number of national organisations. Draft regulations set out those organisations and bodies who we expect to be required and those who we expect to be permitted to supply information to the index. Wherever it is possible, securing data from existing practitioner systems will avoid the need for double data entry on the part of practitioners. Where direct data feeds are not possible, practitioners may be required to enter the information directly into the index via a web browser or indirectly via an authorised index user.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.9/8">We see now the need to introduce penalties relating specifically to the index. There are already measures in criminal law which impose penalties for theft or misuse of data or unauthorised access to computer records. Mandatory training for all users and operators of the index will stipulate that section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998 makes it an offence to unlawfully obtain or disclose personal data without the consent of the data controller. The DCA are considering increasing the penalty for those who misuse personal data from a fine to imprisonment for up to two years. The Computer Misuse Act 1990 provides that unauthorised access, or attempted unauthorised access, to a program or data held on a computer may be punishable by imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.9/9">The draft regulations made under section 12 specify the types of practitioners in the children's work force whose role would make it appropriate for them to have access to the index including practitioners from health, education, social care and youth justice. Access will be granted according to the role of the practitioner. For example, in a school a small number of named designated staff, such as teachers of children with special educational needs or those with pastoral or child protection responsibilities will have access. Before being granted access to the index, all practitioners will have undergone an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check, any other relevant checks and relevant training in the safe and secure use of the index.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.9/10">The draft regulations will be laid before Parliament for debate under affirmative resolution procedures.</p>

	<p pid="a.259W.5/1">Two recent studies (undertaken in the past three years) have explored the risk factors associated with young people's likelihood of becoming involved in crime and antisocial behaviour (these include social and economic factors as well as factors relating to an individual child's psychological and emotional profile, such as cognitive and non-cognitive skills). First:</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.5/2" class="indent">Sutton, C., Utting, D., Farrington, D. (2004) eds, 'Support from the Start', DfES Research Report 524. This study looks at the risk factors (for later crime/ASB involvement) potentially encountered at four childhood life stages (pre-natal, 0-two, three-eight and nine-13) and at interventions found to be 'promising' in terms of their effectiveness in counteracting risk;</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.5/3">and a second, complementary report which looks at practical applications for our knowledge of the risk factors associated with young people's later offending:</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.5/4" class="indent">McCarthy, P., Laing, K. and Walker, J. (2004) 'Offenders of the Future? Assessing the Risk of Children and Young People Becoming Involved in Criminal or Antisocial Behaviour', DfES Research Report 545. The report is an evidence based manual designed to assist practitioners in identifying families with children aged between four and 12 who are at risk of becoming involved in criminal or antisocial behaviour and to facilitate effective targeting of interventions that aim to reduce such risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.5/5">Other relevant research studies are:</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.5/6" class="indent">Feinstein, L. and Sabates, R. (2005) 'Education and Youth Crime: Effects of Introducing the Education Maintenance Allowance', DfES Research Brief RCB01-05</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.5/7" class="indent">'Positive Activities for Young People' (2006)</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.5/8">both of which look at the crime-related outcomes associated with DfES programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.5/9">Current work includes:</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.5/10" class="indent">an academic study (to which the Department contributed a small amount of funding during its initial stage), which involves the academics responsible for the 'Support from the Start' report. These academics are collaborating with a leading academic/practitioner in the field, Dr. Leena Augimeri, to produce risk assessment tools for use by practitioners working with children and young people. This will refine and build on much of the knowledge/guidance derived from the two reports (Sutton <i> et al</i>, McCarthy <i> et al</i>) described above;</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.5/11" class="indent">two further studies currently being conducted which may be of interest. These are evaluations of preventative programmes (part of the Children's Fund) designed to offset/reduce the likelihood of young people's involvement in crime/ASB by addressing the risk factors associated with these behaviours: the national evaluation of 'On Track, Phase Two', being carried out by the Policy Research Bureau (final, synthetic report due to be published in June 2007); and the evaluation of the 'Youth Inclusion Support Panel' (YISP) pilot being conducted by the University of Newcastle (final report due May 2007).</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.5/12">Copies of the two published reports can be found on the DfES website:</p>

	<p pid="a.260W.2/2">The statutory responsibility for funding individual higher education institutions in England rests with the Higher Education Funding Council for England which uses funding formulae which take no account of the locations mentioned in this Question. The college currently receives core funding through recurrent grant of over &pound;4.1 million a year. On Objective One funding, it is unlikely that any substantive Darlington college project could be funded from the current Objective One programme as this funding is close to being already fully allocated. New EU structural fund programmes are still under development and so it is too early to say whether any project that comes forward would be able to access funding from these future programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.261W.3/2">The Gravesham and Tunbridge Wells constituencies fall within the local authority area of Kent and the information supplied is the level of funding which applies to all of Kent. In 2006-07 Kent local authority received a Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) allocation of &pound;718.2 million and revenue grants of &pound;177.4 million&mdash;a total of &pound;895.6 million to fund the education of nursery, primary and secondary school aged pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.3/3">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) took responsibility for funding of school sixth forms in April 2002. In 2006/07, the total funding allocation for schools sixth forms in Kent local authority was &pound;79 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.3/4">The LSC is responsible for funding post-16 education and training more widely and so in addition to the funding for school sixth forms the LSC also funds colleges and other providers to deliver further education and training to young people and adults in the Kent local authority area. This can include funding the local authority itself where they are offering FE provision in line with Government priorities. The Department does not hold information on individual providers1 funding allocations, however funding allocations for 2005/06 can be found at the following link</p>

	<p pid="a.262W.2/1">Information on the number of young people who have applied, enrolled and received Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) is available at local authority level, but not at constituency level.

Local authorities have responsibility for allocating that funding to children's centres in their area; securing value for money; and ensuring the overall quality of services in children's centres. We have appointed the &quot;Together for Children&quot; consortium who will support and challenge local authorities to plan a suitable range of services at each centre. The Government are undertaking a comprehensive spending review and decisions on funding for Sure Start Children's Centres beyond March 2008 will be taken in that context.</p>

It is designed to reform the supply of skills; to ensure we deliver economically valuable qualifications and skills which will enhance the UK's productivity and to raise demand for skills from employers and individuals. We have made good progress towards our skills PSA targets. Since the end of 2001, over 1.4 million learners have achieved first &quot;Skills for Life&quot; qualifications and there are 1.6 million more adults in the work force with level 2 or higher qualifications. The number of apprenticeships has risen from 76,000 in 1997 to 256,000 in 2006. Lord Leitch's final report &quot;Prosperity for all in the global economy&mdash;world class skills&quot; (December 2006) gave a clear analysis of the future skills needs of the UK. We have welcomed the report's ambitions and recommendations, and will publish an implementation plan to take forward this agenda in the context of the comprehensive spending review settlement.</p>

In order to bring consistency and an agreed set of standards to RE syllabi, the Secretary of State launched the non-statutory National Framework for Religious Education in 2004. The Framework was agreed by all the major religious communities and professional RE associations. The standards set out in the Framework are currently informing the reviews of local agreed syllabuses around the country and the shaping of RE programmes in faith schools. It also contained level descriptions for attainment targets against which pupil knowledge, skills and understanding can be assessed. The Framework, including the level descriptions for attainment targets, can be found in the Library and on the RE section of the National Curriculum online website <a href="http://www.nc.uk.net">www.nc.uk.net</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.274W.5/1">The &quot;Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners: Maintaining the Excellent Progress&quot; includes an overview of the key activities we are undertaking to raise standards in Secondary Schools, and the 2005 Schools White Paper&mdash;&quot;Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&quot;&mdash;sets out our vision for raising standards in Schools. I would also refer you to the annual departmental report. Some key facts are summarised as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.5/2" class="indent">In 2006, 85,000 more pupils obtained five or more GCSEs at A*-C than in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.5/3" class="indent">Spending per pupil since 1997 has doubled, and there are now 36,000 more teachers and 150,000 more support staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.5/4" class="indent">Since 1997, there has been a 15 percentage point increase in the number of 14-year-old pupils achieving level 5 or above in English, a 17 percentage point increase in mathematics and a 12 percentage point increase in science at Key Stage 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.5/5" class="indent">Through the Building Schools for the Future programme we are investing &pound;17.5 billion in schools capital between 2005-08, enabling most secondary schools to be refurbished or rebuilt.</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.5/6" class="indent">More than 2,600 secondary schools&mdash;85 per cent. of the total&mdash;have specialist school status and we are on track to achieve the target of every school achieving specialist status by next year. 70 schools are already working towards trust school status, enabling them to work with external partners to create a distinctive ethos and direction for their school, and we have over 100 academies open or in the pipeline in some of the most challenging parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.5/7" class="indent">There is more work still to do. In recent years, the number of children eligible for free school meals achieving five good GCSEs has improved faster than the national average, but we need to do more to tackle some of the gaps between economically disadvantaged pupils and their peers, and between boys and girls.</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.5/8" class="indent">The Government are investing over &pound;1 billion between 2005-08 in personalised learning and extended services&mdash;including &pound;621 million for secondary schools to help them tailor their teaching and learning to the needs of their pupils, including those who need support to help them catch up and those who have a particular gift or talent.</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.5/9" class="indent">The Secondary National Strategy for School Improvement is at the heart of our work to transform secondary education and spreads effective teaching and learning to all schools through training and materials, a comprehensive development programme for teachers, and support from local consultants who are experts in their field.</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.5/10" class="indent">The Key Stage 3 Behaviour and Attendance training programme for all secondary school staff involves training materials and resources to ensure consistent and effective policy and practice on behaviour and attendance and offers expert consultancy support to schools across the curriculum.</p>

This includes finance, governance and key management and personnel arrangements. The SSC standard forms part of the overall SSC Performance Management Framework, and engaging with employers in their sector is a key requirement of all SSCs.</p>
	<p pid="a.275W.2/3">In his recent report 'Prosperity for all in the global economy&mdash;world class skills' (December 2006) Lord Leitch provided a clear analysis of the future skills needs of the UK and made a series of proposals for change. These would include the reform and re-licensing of sector skills councils. We have welcomed the report and will consider, together with stakeholders and in the context of the Comprehensive Spending Review, how to take forward the challenging agenda it sets.</p>

	<p pid="a.278W.5/1">The Increased Flexibility programme has created approximately 290 partnerships of further education (FE) colleges, schools and other agents that provide enhanced vocational and work-related learning opportunities for local 14 to 16-years-olds. FE colleges also play a key role in the delivery of the Young Apprenticeship programme, enabling 14 to 16-year-olds to pursue industry-specific vocational programmes and qualifications outside school. FE colleges will be delivering diplomas, most often as part of consortia involving schools and employers, from September 2008. Colleges have been recognised as key stakeholders and are represented as members of the Diploma Development Partnerships.</p>

	<p pid="a.280W.2/1">Sunderland is one of 10 local authorities who have volunteered and been accepted for piloting the Youth Opportunity Card. The pilot authorities are making an invaluable contribution to the detailed design of the delivery arrangements for the Card. In particular they have each seconded a member of staff to work part-time with the Youth Opportunity Card Team in my Department. A project of this nature is complex as well as ambitious and it is important that we get it right. There are important aspects to the project that we are still working through. I expect to be in a position shortly to make an announcement.</p>
