	<p pid="d.1403W.6/1">The UK reports annually to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFGCC) estimates of emissions from UK sales of aviation fuels&mdash;known as &quot;bunker fuels&quot;&mdash;for domestic and international aviation. In doing so, the UK follows guidelines published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Estimates of emissions from fuel used for international aviation do not form part of the UK's national emissions inventory, as there has been no international agreement on how to allocate them to individual countries.</p>
	<p pid="d.1403W.6/2">The Government will continue to press internationally for an approach that would allocate responsibility for international aviation emissions, and therefore require action to be taken globally to address them. Such allocation may be, for example, to countries or to the international aviation sector as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="d.1403W.6/3">The inclusion of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) will not change directly international reporting arrangements. The Government do not believe that inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS will provide a suitable emissions allocation methodology. Responsibility for meeting the cap will be placed directly on airlines; responsibility for regulating airlines will be placed on member states, in a process designed to achieve administrative simplicity. As a result, the UK regulator will be responsible for administering airlines from the UK and other countries, some of whose flights will not pass through UK airspace or land at a UK airport.</p>
	<p pid="d.1403W.6/4">The EU ETS will cap emissions from flights arriving in, or departing from, the EU. Any growth in emissions above that cap will require airlines to pay for equivalent emissions reductions from elsewhere within the scheme, thereby maintaining total emissions below the cap. The UK's reports to the UNFCCC on emissions from bunker fuels would not reflect achievement of the EU ETS cap. The differences between the UNFCCC and EU regimes reflect the different purposes for which they were established.</p>

	<p pid="d.1404W.2/1">Currently, airlines compete for customers on a number of factors including price, route and passenger service. They must also comply with the EU regulation on denied boarding, cancellation or long delay of flights (Reg (EC) 261/2004) by providing passengers with the requisite refreshments, accommodation, re-routing or compensation.</p>

These areas were passage through airports, with particular reference to Terminal 5 at Heathrow, and the resilience of airports to recover from problems such as extreme weather conditions. Work by the CAA is under way.</p>

	<p pid="d.1405W.0/1">The Department for Transport is committed to achieving the published Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate (SOGE) targets, which include improving the energy efficiency of its estate by 15 per cent. by 2010 and by 30 per cent. by 2020. The target does not differentiate between rented and owned buildings.</p>
	<p pid="d.1405W.0/2">The Department for Transport can confirm that by 2006-07 its energy efficiency performance had not improved in comparison to our baseline year of 2002-03. However, we fully expect the 2007-08 figures to show an improvement of at least 10 per cent. against the baseline, in the next Sustainable Development Commission annual report. The Department for Transport was formed in its current format under Machinery of Government changes in 2002. We therefore do not have figures prior to financial year 2002-03.</p>
	<p pid="d.1405W.0/3">An initial step towards achieving the SOGE targets was the commissioning of a Carbon Management Energy Efficiency report by the Carbon Trust. This report centred on the five major areas of the Department which will give the highest reduction in Carbon emissions and subsequent improvement in energy efficiency. The Department is currently developing detailed implementation plans from the recommendations of this report.</p>

	<p pid="d.1421W.2/1">The preservation of important wildlife and landscape assets is one of the key criteria for new eco-towns. The Eco-town Challenge Panel is an independent group of people with expertise in various aspects of urban and sustainable development. The Panel exists to encourage bidders by challenging them to improve and develop their proposals to the point where they can be regarded as truly exemplary projects, which fit well within their surroundings, demonstrate innovative approaches to sustainable development and represent a 'step change' beyond what would currently be regarded as best practice. Of the members of the Challenge Panel, three are experts in environmental issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.1421W.2/2">Natural England, Government's agency working to conserve, enhance and manage the natural environment, was fully involved in the initial assessment and shortlisting of the eco-town proposals. Furthermore, there will shortly be a second Government consultation on a sustainability appraisal, which provides a more detailed assessment of locations, and a draft Planning Policy Statement, before we identify a final list. These locations will then need to go through the planning process and be subject to full public scrutiny, where impacts on biodiversity and natural assets will be key considerations at all stages.</p>
	<p pid="d.1421W.2/3">The sustainability appraisal will consider the environmental, economic and social impacts of eco-towns policy both nationally and in the proposed locations. This will take account of work that local authorities may have already undertaken to test development options in their area and as part of the testing process we will also consider the habitats directive.</p>

	<p pid="d.1426W.2/1">Accessible housing is already reflected in our current definition of a sustainable community which includes a place that is inclusive to all and meets the diverse needs of all residents. Our commitment to this is reflected in our national planning policy in Planning Policy Statement 3 (Housing) which is clear about creating places, streets and spaces which are inclusive and respect the diverse needs of communities and the special needs of particular sectors of the community.</p>
	<p pid="d.1426W.2/2">In February 2008, we published, &quot;Lifetime Homes. Lifetime Neighbourhoods: A National Strategy for Housing in an Ageing Society&quot;, which sets out a clear strategy for encouraging the development of 'Lifetime Homes Standards' (LHS). LHS aim to make housing accessible for all by making it more functional for everyone including families, disabled and older people and adaptable to peoples changing circumstances throughout the whole lifetime of the home. Our aspiration is to see all homes built to Lifetime Homes Standards by 2013 and we will ensure that all publicly funded housing is built to Lifetime Homes Standards by 2011. It is currently a mandatory element of the Code for Sustainable Homes at code level 6 and will become mandatory at code levels 4 and 5 from 2010 and code level 3 from 2013. We will continue to work with stakeholders to encourage take up of the standards across all sectors and progress will be reviewed in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="d.1440W.12/1">The armed forces provide assistance to the civil authorities at their request and primarily when the civil authorities lack the necessary capabilities. The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 has mandated that civil authorities should have contingency plans in place to deal with a range of civil crises. As a result civil authorities have developed their capabilities to deal with a wide range of challenges.</p>
	<p pid="d.1440W.12/2">In relation to strikes in the fire and rescue service, responsibility for contingency planning rests with the fire and rescue authority, and not the Secretary of State for Defence. Fire and rescue authorities are required to have in place a contingency plan which does not rely upon support from the armed forces. Accordingly the armed forces do not have any contingency plans in place, but Defence Ministers would consider any requests from the Department for Communities and Local Government, the lead Government Department responsible for the Fire and Rescue Service on a case by case basis.</p>
	<p pid="d.1440W.12/3">The Home Secretary is primarily responsible for the safety and security of the UK population including protecting the public against terrorism. The police and other first responders have a wide range of capabilities to deal with terrorist incidents. The armed forces do provide some niche capabilities, for example Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams, and have contingency plans in place to make specialist capabilities available should they be required by the police or other civil authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.1440W.12/4">Planning for the effects of an outbreak of pandemic influenza is ongoing and cross government plans are being developed. The magnitude of Defence assistance that could be provided during any outbreak would of course be dependent on how badly the armed forces have been affected by the outbreak.</p>

	<p pid="d.1441W.2/1" class="letterinlibrary">I will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.2/2" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Bob Ainsworth to Andrew Murrison:</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.2/3" class="indent">My colleague, the Under Secretary of State for Defence, undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Questions on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-02">2 June 2008</phrase>, (Official Report, column 669-670W) about Pay As You Dine (PAYD) for Service personnel. I am responding as the Duty Minister.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.2/4" class="indent">Prior to the introduction of PAYD, all Service personnel living in Single Living Accommodation paid a fixed food charge to cover three meals per day, irrespective of the number of meals that they actually ate. Inspection showed that on average 50 percent of meals or less were being taken. The Armed Forces Pay Review Body during their annual round of discussions with Service personnel identified strong support, particularly from amongst the junior ranks, for a replacement system which would enable personnel to pay only for food that they ate. In 2005, the MOD gave approval for each of the Services to implement PAYD and this they are now doing in a manner appropriate to meet their individual Service needs. PAYD is part of a concept of integrated catering, retail and leisure services that aims to improve the quality of life for Service personnel. It gives our Service personnel greater freedom by giving them the choice over when, where and how they eat and promotes fairness by ensuring that Service personnel pay only for the meals that they consume.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.2/5" class="indent">The PAYD scheme incorporates a core menu which conforms to the Tri Service Menu Policy. Indeed, the three core meals under PAYD are designed to be broadly to the same standard (ie to provide the required calories and nutritional balance if all three meals are taken) as those specified under the old regime with the cost of the core menu being exactly the same as the current Daily Food Charge. The MOD undertakes to provide a variety of healthy palatable food and beverages to all military personnel to enable them to adopt healthy eating habits, a balanced diet and to ensure optimal fitness and performance. Contract Caterers who deliver PAYD are required to provide food at the point of service that meets these requirements. In addition we continue to encourage all personnel to eat in a healthy and balanced manner. However, whether Service personnel are at a PAYD site or not, the ability to ensure that young serving personnel eat a healthy and balanced diet is somewhat limited. The menus at each meal offer healthy options but we do not have the ability to force people to choose that option. With the introduction of PAYD and choice there comes with it a certain degree of personal responsibility in terms of what they eat. There is also a mechanism in place to ensure that nobody is denied a meal if they run out of funds and special dietary and religious eating needs continue to be accommodated.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.2/6" class="indent">Your first question referred to the impact on young soldiers. Due to the special circumstances of the nutritional needs of young trainees (of all the Services), Phase one trainees and some Phase two trainees do not participate in PAYD, but continue to pay the Daily Food Charge and are entitled to the core menu to ensure they receive a balanced and nutritional diet which includes appropriate supplements to cater for high activity levels (although it is still the individual's choice as to what they put on their plate at meal times). Trainees receive specifically targeted booklets, lifestyle lectures and guidance during training to ensure that they appreciate the importance of adequate and appropriate eating habits in relation to their professional and personal activities. In addition new recruits are also taught how to budget for PAYD.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.2/7" class="indent">In terms of assessing whether or not the PAYD scheme has promoted healthy eating&mdash;all contract Caterers are required to provide healthy options at each core meal. Contracts provide for cereals, yoghurt and fruit as part of the breakfast menu and for lunch and dinner salads and fresh vegetables are available. Where concerns are raised, these are addressed directly with the Contractor and alternative healthier options to various meals are introduced. PAYD was introduced to give people choice; it does this by offering a wide variety of meals at varying prices. Healthy options (as part of the core meal) are available if chosen by the individual.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.2/8" class="indent">In addition, Defence Food Services has issued all Commanding Officers with a pan-Service booklet &quot;A Guide to Healthy Eating&quot; to complement and reinforce the policy. The Expert Panel of Armed Forces Feeding (EPAFF), in consultation with QinetiQ, has also produced and issued a Recruits Guide to Nutrition, a Servicewoman's Guide to Health and Performance, and an Armed Forces Personal Guide to Nutrition. All of these publications recognise the potential change to individual food choice as a result of the introduction of PAYD and are designed to provide individuals with the necessary guidance and advice to enable them to choose the right foods so that they can more easily cope with the physical demands of military training, operations and competitive sports. The single Services continue to reinforce the healthy eating message through various single Service publications.</p>
	<p pid="d.1441W.2/9" class="indent">The single Services monitor the PAYD scheme through a regular programme of meetings between the Services and Contractor both locally and at HQ level. For the Royal Navy, the contracts require that the contractors undertake regular Customer Surveys and provide returns for assessment by the Royal Navy commercial branch and the Catering Services subject matter experts. The Army has a survey under way which began in late April 2008, the responses to which are still being received. Over 4,000 questionnaires were distributed with the results becoming available over the next few months. The RAF which has only three PAYD sites has monitored feedback on its trial sites via customer feedback forms. However since the start of 2008, focus groups have been held and are currently being completed to indicate consumer views. In addition, a sample of RAF personnel has been completing food diaries over a period of a month to gauge eating patterns. A formal independent assessment by a Market Research company is currently being carried out at comparable PAYD and non PAYD units. Centrally, feedback is received via the various Continuous Attitude Surveys undertaken by the Single Services. The first UK Tri-Service Armed Forces Continuous Attitude Survey 2007 was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-09">9 July 2008</phrase> and is available at:</p>

	<p pid="d.1449W.9/2">We intend to spend in excess of &pound;8 billion on accommodation over the next decade, of which over &pound;3 billion will be on improvements and upgrades.</p>
	<p pid="d.1449W.9/3">Based on current funding levels, the MOD plans to upgrade at least 600 of the worst condition SFA properties in the United Kingdom to the highest Standard for Condition in 2008-09 and at least 800 properties each year until Financial Year 2012. The upgrade programme prioritises those properties identified as being in the greatest need.</p>
	<p pid="d.1449W.9/4">In addition, we will carry out routine works, on SFA, including maintenance and replacement of bathrooms, kitchens and boilers, which while not sufficient to upgrade a property to the next level or higher, will significantly improve the quality of life for the occupants.</p>

This figure was based on a costing model. More up-to-date information now available indicates, through this cost model, that the additional cost incurred by the Department over the period 2005-06 to 2007-08 through fuel price rises was some&pound;120-130M.</p>

	<p pid="d.1463W.8/16" class="indent">I would stress that these figures cannot be comprehensive, as local purchase arrangements are not always visible at higher levels of accounting: for example, while systems are in place to ensure propriety by recording local purchase of fuel for military vehicles at commercial petrol stations, these do not feed into higher financial management systems. Additionally, the figures do not include utilities (for example, natural gas and heating oil used to heat buildings), which are accounted for separately. There may also be other, smaller elements of fuel expenditure which Departmental financial management systems do not enable us to identify.</p>
	<p pid="d.1463W.8/17" class="indent">Assuming that volumes consumed in core Defence activity such as non-operational exercising have remained broadly constant or increased only marginally over the period, a large proportion&mdash;possibly around two-thirds&mdash;of the estimated outturn cost increase of &pound;120-130M is likely to be attributable to Request for Resources 2 (RfR2&mdash;the Department's claim against the Reserve for operations). I would stress that this is an estimate, not an absolute measure of the impact of fuel price increases on either Defence or the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="d.1463W.8/18" class="indent">Where fuel prices increase, there will naturally be an impact on the cost of operations, depending on the volume of consumption at the time and the extent to which any local purchasing arrangements reflect global $ price increases: a broad estimate suggests that this effect could be around &pound;1-2M for every US $1 increase in the price of crude oil.</p>

	<p pid="d.1465W.2/1" class="letterinlibrary">I will write to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="d.1465W.2/2" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Bob Ainsworth to Gordon Prentice:</p>
	<p pid="d.1465W.2/3" class="indent">I undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Question on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-03">3 July 2008</phrase> (Official Report, column 1040W), about the ownership of HMS ONTARIO, whose wreck has apparently been discovered by a Canadian dive group at the bottom of Lake Ontario on the US-Canada border.</p>
	<p pid="d.1465W.2/4" class="indent">HMS ONTARIO, a 22 gun sloop, foundered in a storm on Lake Ontario on October 31 1780 during the American Revolutionary War&mdash;it is uncertain how many lives were lost (estimates range from 88 to over a 120) as the ship may have been carrying some American prisoners of war in addition to British soldiers and her British and Canadian crew. There were no survivors. The dive group, who located the wreck using side-scanning sonar and an unmanned submersible, say that it is virtually intact, it is thought that the cold, fresh water of the lake has acted as a preservative with the lack of light and oxygen slowing decomposition of the ship's timbers. In addition to being effectively the last resting place of those who perished in the sinking, the remains of the ONTARIO undoubtedly represent an important item of underwater cultural heritage. The dive group apparently have no plans to attempt to raise the wreck or remove artefacts from it and have not publicised its position.</p>
	<p pid="d.1465W.2/5" class="indent">The ONTARIO was launched from Carleton Island shipyard on Lake Ontario in May 1780. A King's Ship, she was part of the Provincial Marine, a coastal protection service on the Great Lakes operated and staffed by the Royal Navy. This service with the Provincial Marine complicates the question of ownership as it is possible that rights to the wreck may have transferred to Canada when she became an independent nation and the assets of the Provincial Marine were made over to it. This issue is being investigated but as you can appreciate, it is likely to take some time to resolve.</p>
	<p pid="d.1465W.2/6" class="indent">That said, the issue of who actually owns the wreck may, in this case, be moot. The remains of HMS ONTARIO appear to lie in United States territorial waters and the United States have already indicated that they are willing to use US legislation to protect the wreck from unauthorised interference&mdash;a stance that the United Kingdom is entirely comfortable with. The United Kingdom is unlikely to object to appropriate archaeological investigation of the find&mdash;however, any such investigation would be a matter for the Canadian and United States authorities in the first instance given that these two countries control access to the site. We shall of course continue to monitor developments and liaise with our Canadian and United States counterparts, but it seems clear that all State parties involved are united in their wish to see the wreck of HMS ONTARIO properly protected.</p>

	<p pid="d.1466W.2/1">The decision to close the Horsea Island facility to regular commercial use is the result of an increased training requirement for both Army and Royal Navy personnel, and a security review of the site which concluded that an armed security presence was required.

	<p pid="d.1466W.5/1">UK forces trained and mentored the 10<sup>(th)</sup> Division of the Iraqi army from the establishment of its Headquarters in Basra in May 2005 until its move to Dhi Qar province in September 2007. Since then, our Coalition partners have performed a residual mentoring role with the 10<sup>(th)</sup> Division.</p>
	<p pid="d.1466W.5/2">The appropriate duration and shape of the training and mentoring support that the Coalition provides to the Iraqi army is determined by a range of factors specific to each Division. These factors include the previous military experience of the Division's recruits, the timing of the Division's formation, the security challenges it faces and the availability of equipment. The Coalition does not therefore seek to calculate an average period for the full training and mentoring of Iraqi army Divisions.</p>

	<p pid="d.1471W.5/1">The RAF has had a contract with HORIZON to market spare training capacity at RAF Halton since 2001. I am withholding the list of HORIZON'S customers as its release would, or would be likely to, prejudice commercial interests. Details of customers for spare capacity at RAF Halton prior to 2001 are not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.5/2">Since financial year 2004-05, approximately 1,500 customers have purchased spare resource capacity from RAF Halton. I will write to the hon. Member with the names of these customers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.5/3" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Bob Ainsworth to David Lidington:</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.5/4" class="indent">I undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Question on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-14">14 July 2008</phrase>, (Official Report, column 177W) that asked for a list of customers who purchased spare capacity training and spare capacity resources from RAF Halton in each year since1998.</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.5/5" class="indent">The list of customers who have purchased spare resource capacity is detailed below, as promised. RAF Halton holds records of these customers from the beginning of Financial Year 2001-02.</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.5/6" class="indent">However the IT system at the station was not working when I originally answered this question. Using this newly accessible information, officials have clarified that the number of different customers is in fact around 260 since 2001-02 rather than 1,500 since 2004-05 quoted previously. On further investigation, the information in the original answer turned out to be the number of enquiries the station received concerning spare resource capacity rather than the number of actual customers. I apologise for this error.</p>
	<p pid="d.1471W.5/7" class="indent">Included within these figures are some 80 individuals who have purchased spare resource capacity from RAF Halton whose names have been withheld from this list in accordance with the Data Protection Act.</p>

The three approaches are balanced, so that a single estimate of GDP is published in both cash (current prices) and real (constant prices) terms.

	<p pid="d.1479W.8/2">The Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) level 6 and zero carbon home standards are related but not identical. Therefore, while an EPC itself does not specify whether or not the home meets the standard for a zero carbon home, in many cases the information it contains may be sufficient to demonstrate that the zero carbon homes standard has been met. In this case a further inspection of the building is not required for the purpose of the zero carbon home certification.</p>

	<p pid="d.1480W.9/1">I assume the hon. Member means both wild birds and commercial poultry. It is extremely difficult to give an accurate estimate of birds that have died as a result of avian influenza infection. Although some birds tested positive for avian influenza by laboratory tests, they may not have died as a result of the disease (e.g. wild birds may have died as a result of predation, cold weather or a number of other natural causes).</p>
	<p pid="d.1480W.9/2">The following table shows the number of commercial poultry, by species, that were culled as a result of DEFRA's disease control policy, or, wild birds that were submitted as part of the Avian Influenza surveillance programme and that were positive for AI by laboratory testing. In both cases, not all birds would have died from AI infection. Many of the commercial poultry that were culled would have been infected but alive and many not infected at the time of culling, but killed to manage the risk of disease spread because they were part of the same epidemiological unit and had been clearly exposed to infection. Many wild bird and water fowl species may act as carriers for the virus but do not show clinical signs of illness so it is not possible to provide or estimate the number which may be killed by the virus in the wild.</p>
	<p pid="d.1480W.9/3">This information is based on the number of commercial poultry culled during outbreaks of Avian Influenza since July 2006 and the number of AI-positive wild birds submitted to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency for testing as part of the on-going AI surveillance programme.</p>

	<p pid="d.1480W.9/22">Although the data in this table give an indication of the number of birds killed by AI in the last two years, this number represents a relatively low proportion of the commercial poultry industry. Due to the current high level of vigilance in the poultry industry, suspect Avian Influenza cases are notified very quickly, enabling a rapid response by DEFRA and Animal Health, so we have been able to control this disease quickly and effectively where it is identified in commercial poultry flocks.</p>

	<p pid="d.1483W.3/2">We are currently consulting on changes to the European Union emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) in light of the European Commission's proposed climate and energy package. Credits from reforestation and afforestation projects require a robust monitoring system, an understanding of the potential impact on the EU ETS allowance price, and assurance that non-permanent credits would not damage the environmental integrity of the scheme, before they can be included in the EU ETS.</p>
	<p pid="d.1483W.3/3">It is not currently possible to credit projects that seek to avoid deforestation as this is not provided for within the scope of the Kyoto protocol. However, we recognise the importance of addressing this issue and we are working through the international climate negotiations for an agreement on reducing emissions from deforestation for post-2012. I welcome the provision contained in the European Commission's proposal for new crediting mechanisms under an international agreement which would give the flexibility to include credits from avoided deforestation and other land use activities in future phases of the EU ETS.</p>

	<p pid="d.1487W.2/1">An early draft of research report WR0601 was submitted in December 2005. The report was completed in January 2006 and was published as part of the new science information system which went live on the DEFRA website in February 2007. This scoping report provided suggestions for further research, one area being further investigation of any health-related implications of changes to waste collection routines.</p>
	<p pid="d.1487W.2/2">Further work was commissioned in 2006 by Wycombe district council with funding being provided by the DEFRA Waste Implementation Programme (WIP)<sup>(1)</sup>. This work reported in February 2007 and is available electronically on the contractor's website. It provides a review of the potential for health impacts to occur from alternate week waste collection schemes, principally in comparison with weekly collection schemes, using the scheme operated by Wycombe district council as a case study. The study was carried out to investigate any issues relating to odours, insects, rodents and the risks of disease. The research literature consulted provided no evidence that alternate week residual and biodegradable waste collection will cause any significant health impacts for residents, or that any health impacts are likely to be significantly greater than those associated with weekly collections. This is consistent with wider studies of the health effects of waste management, which indicate that all methods of waste management can have at most a minor effect on health<sup>(2)</sup>. The Wycombe study goes on to recommend some common-sense steps that can be taken to alleviate amenity issues (e.g. keeping containers clean, not shredding or chopping kitchen waste before disposal, keeping containers outdoors, avoiding shelter opportunities for rodents, waste wrapped or in containers etc.).</p>
	<p pid="d.1487W.2/3">Subsequently, in July 2007, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) published guidance for local authorities on the design and implementation of alternate weekly collection services, in order to provide practical advice for waste managers and elected members within local authorities<sup>(3)</sup>. This report references the Enviros 2007 report in commenting on health and amenity issues.</p>

	<p pid="d.1490W.2/1">Under the EU's cod recovery programme, the UK is trialling a real-time closure mechanism designed to ensure vessels avoid significant concentrations of the species, particularly of spawning and juvenile fish&mdash;and thus reduce the need to discard. In addition, commercial trials are being undertaken to identify how certain gears can be made more selective. We will provide encouragement for the widespread deployment of those found to be effective amongst our fleet&mdash;and will press the Commission for them to be applied Community-wide.</p>
	<p pid="d.1490W.2/2">The initial phase of the Irish Sea Data Enhancement Pilot was completed recently. Fisheries dependent data are being cross-checked against observer data collected from vessels in the same fishery. This validation process is essential to ensure that the estimates of discards that result from the project are both realistic and representative.</p>
	<p pid="d.1490W.2/3">I announced in February 2008 an environmentally responsible fishing pilot research project. The aim of the 12-month project is to quantify all components of the environmental footprint of commercial fishing vessels targeting quota stocks in inshore waters of the North sea off England. The project will collect data across a range of indicators associated with the fishing operation, marketing and ancillary services and will make an important contribution to the implementation of Fisheries 2027, DEFRA's long-term vision for sustainable fisheries. Around 30 fishing vessels from Hartlepool, Lowestoft and the Thames estuary have been invited to take part. Training and installation of vessel monitoring equipment and is expected to start in July with all participating vessels operating under the scheme from August.</p>

	<p pid="d.1494W.3/14" class="indent">The LSC makes annual allocations to schools and FE colleges on an academic year basis. Funding for schools is allocated through the parent local authority. I have enclosed two summary tables in response to your question. Table A sets out the academic year funding allocations for all local authorities with school sixth forms in London in 2008-09, and for the previous three years. Allocations are made on an annual basis, one year in advance, and so the allocations for 2009-10 will be made in February 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.1494W.3/15" class="indent">The LSC does not fund academies, which are funded by DCSF directly, and these figures do not include academy funding. You will note that funding for School sixth forms in London has increased by over 9 per cent. in 2008-09 and has allowed us to fund over 5 per cent. more places.</p>
	<p pid="d.1494W.3/16" class="indent">Table B sets out the funding that FE providers have received in 2008-09, and the three previous years.. It should be noted that this table classifies funding by provider borough: many FE providers operate across multiple boroughs and attract significant volumes of learners from other parts of London.</p>

	<p pid="d.1499W.2/1">Expanding provision and raising quality are integral to our ambitious plans set out in World-class Apprenticeships. We are establishing the National Apprenticeship Service from April 2009 to ensure the growth of high quality provision of apprenticeships in England. The service will have responsibility for broadening the flexibilities of the Apprenticeship programme to enable employers to develop new apprenticeship frameworks, and to improve and encourage the range of frameworks available.</p>
	<p pid="d.1499W.2/2">The Learning and Skills Council will assess performance against minimum levels of performance for apprenticeships; develop a new apprenticeship blueprint which defines the core elements of an apprenticeship and specific training requirements; and work with the new Learning and Skills Improvement Service to secure continuous improvement in the provision of apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="d.1499W.2/3">Last week the Government published a draft &quot;Apprenticeships Bill&quot; to underpin and help sustain the improvements in the quality of the programme. This draft Bill will ensure that apprenticeships are a badge of quality skills for young people and adults and for employers. It will drive forward the provision of sufficient apprenticeship places to meet the entitlement for our young people to have an offer of an apprenticeship place by 2013</p>
	<p pid="d.1499W.2/4">The Department and the Department for Children, Schools and Families look forward to receiving comments on the draft Bill from hon. and right hon. Members and all those committed to providing high quality skills for people and employers.</p>

	<p pid="d.1503W.6/1">Since 1997 the Government have implemented major change to simplify the further education landscape and streamline national agencies. This includes reducing numbers of staff managing the further education and skills system from 10,000 in the TEC era to 4,700 as the Learning and Skills Council was established and further to 3,600 currently. We responded quickly to recommendations in Realising the Potential: A review of the future role of further education colleges by merging two major inspectorates, Ofsted and the Adult Learning Inspectorate, thereby simplifying inspection processes. More recently, the merger of the Quality Improvement Agency and the Centre for Excellence in Leadership, to form the Learning and Skills Improvement Service, will streamline processes further and drive quality improvement in the FE service through more direct influence from sector-leaders and practitioners. An updated list of organisations with a monitoring, inspection or improvement role in further education colleges is set out in the following list on the same basis as originally in the review report. This shows a reduction in the number of organisations with a monitoring, inspection or improvement role.</p>

It has now engaged 97,000 employers, supported 488,480 employees to begin learning programmes, and delivered 203,370 full level 2 and 26,720 Skills for Life achievements.

The Pathfinders are now starting to fund truly demand-led proposals from HEIs and Further Education Colleges to develop HE-level provision attuned to workforce development needs.</p>

	<p pid="d.1512W.5/1">The Government's policy is that it is right that students should bear a fair share of the costs of higher education. The variable fees regime that we introduced in 2006 will provide an additional &pound;1.6 billion for higher education by 2010-11. At the same time we have ensured that there is strong support to meet students' personal financial needs. This has enabled us to make further progress in widening access to higher education, with the proportion of accepted applicants from England who are from the bottom four socio-economic groups has increased from 31.7 per cent. in 2006 to 32.1 per cent. in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.1512W.5/2">The maximum fee that can be charged each year is capped at &pound;3,000 (at 2006 prices) and no increase can be made to this until Parliament has considered an independent review of the first three years of the new system.</p>

	<p pid="d.1519W.0/1">There are no regulations that govern the use of ultra-sonic deterrent devices. However, the prolonged exposure to the noise emitted by a device may be a statutory nuisance. If an environmental health officer took the view that it affected the occupants of a property, action could be taken against the owner of the noise emitter. Inappropriate use of the device may also be classed as a harassment offence under the Public Order Act 1986 or the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.</p>

Knowingly making a false declaration can lead to a penalty of up to three months' imprisonment or a fine not exceeding &pound;5,000.</p>

	<p pid="d.1540W.5/1">All the quality control procedures at the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) are geared to achieving the highest levels of accuracy. In addition, the CRB carries out a post disclosure accuracy check that analyses all aspects of the disclosure application and its issue. This check was introduced in 2007 and is based on a statistical sample of disclosure applications and from that sample it can be ascertained that the accuracy rate for 2006-07 is 99.94 per cent. and for 2007-08 is 99.98 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.1540W.5/2">Over the past 12 months the CRB have issued 3,457,424 disclosures and have used applicants' fingerprints 358 times to distinguish them from records held on the police national computer (PNC) to which they had originally been matched. Of these, 115 applicants were found to have been correctly matched to the record held on PNC. The number found to be incorrectly matched to a record on PNC following fingerprints represents 0.007 per cent. of disclosures issued during the past 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="d.1540W.5/3">No comparative data are available on either of these issues prior to the dates referred to.</p>

	<p pid="d.1541W.2/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has issued over 16 million disclosures since inception and operates to a set of public service standards (PSS) which are to issue 90 per cent. of standard disclosures within 10 days and 90 per cent. of enhanced disclosures within 28 days.</p>
	<p pid="d.1541W.2/2">Data concerning the average time taken to complete a disclosure by police force area are not collated by the CRB.</p>
	<p pid="d.1541W.2/3">Average figures do not give an accurate indication of performance, since any forces' performance can be affected by a number of factors; the volume of cases sent to a force to process in any given month, the number of staff available to process the checks and the IT resources on hand to forces. With these variables, performance can fluctuate within individual forces from one month to the next.</p>
	<p pid="d.1541W.2/4">The CRB has been supporting those forces that have encountered problems in meeting their targets by a range of measures including the provision of additional resources, monitoring performance, providing demand forecasting data and assistance in introducing new IT initiatives.</p>

	<p pid="d.1541W.2/21">The CRB cannot provide figures broken down by police force area. This is because standard disclosures are processed without any requirement for the police forces to conduct checks and several different police forces may be required to conduct checks in order to produce one enhanced disclosure.</p>
	<p pid="d.1541W.2/22">An internal service level agreement between the CRB and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has been in place since April 2006. This SLA has been agreed by ACPO on behalf of the 43 local police forces in England and Wales and the time taken by each force to complete their part of the enhanced disclosure process is measured against targets of 10 days, 14 days, 25 days and 60 days. By meeting these targets the police forces directly affect the CRB's ability to meet the public service standard for enhanced disclosures.</p>
	<p pid="d.1541W.2/23">The following table illustrates the number of enhanced disclosure checks completed by each police force in 10 days, 14 days, 25 days, 60 days and over 60 days during 2006-07 and 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="d.1554W.8/1">The United Kingdom is signatory to the 1998 convention on driving disqualifications, which was signed by the then 15 member states of the European Union. The provisions of the convention were brought into the law of Great Britain by the Crime (International Cooperation) Act 2003 and for Northern Ireland by a corresponding Order in Council. The convention is intended to ensure that a driver resident in one country and disqualified in another country for a motoring offence committed there, should not escape the consequences of that disqualification when he or she returns home. The convention will take effect when all 15 signatory states have ratified it. So far as we are aware, only Spain of the original signatories has done so. As yet, no member state of the European Union has put this convention into practical effect.</p>
	<p pid="d.1554W.8/2">However, the convention provides that a member state may meanwhile declare formally to the European Union authorities that it will recognise the driving disqualifications of any other member state which has made the same declaration. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-26">26 June</phrase> this year the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport agreed with his Irish and Northern Ireland colleagues that the United Kingdom and Ireland should aim to make parallel formal declarations to this effect as soon as practicable, with a view to instituting mutual recognition of driving disqualifications between the United Kingdom and Ireland under the 1998 convention in the course of spring 2009.</p>

	<p pid="d.1555W.8/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-22">22 July 2008</phrase></p>
	<p pid="d.1555W.8/2"><i> </i>In February, the Government published the new 10-year drug strategy, Drugs: protecting families and communities, which sets out the action that will be taken to address the harms caused by drug misuse and to reduce levels of drug consumption. This strategy builds on the successes of the previous drug strategy, focusing action where it will generate the greatest benefit and extending the reach and effectiveness of our interventions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1555W.8/3">Since the introduction of the previous strategy in 1998, we have seen significant falls in the self-reported use of illegal drugs. Data from the British Crime Survey show that in 2007-08, compared to 1997, the proportion of respondents aged 16-59 reporting the use of any illegal drug in the year preceding the survey fell from 12.1 per cent. to 9.3 per cent., while the proportion reporting the use of class A drugs remained stable. The same data show us that, compared to the previous year, there have been significant reductions in the use of cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines and cannabis.</p>
	<p pid="d.1555W.8/4">This pattern is repeated among young people. Data from the survey show that, among young people aged 16-24, class A drug use has fallen from 8.6 per cent. in 1997 to 6.8 per cent. in 2007-08, while the use of any illegal drug has fallen from 31.8 per cent. to 21.3 per cent. over the same period. Again, there have been falls in the use of individual drugs compared to the previous year, including cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines and cannabis.</p>
	<p pid="d.1555W.8/5">The drug strategy takes a comprehensive approach to reducing the demand for, and consumption of, illegal drugs. This approach spans:</p>
	<p pid="d.1555W.8/6" class="indent">prevention activity through more effective drug education and information, and through early targeted interventions with the families and young people who are most at risk of developing problems; interventions through the criminal justice system where problematic drug misuse has led to offending, coupled with tough enforcement action to tackle the supply of illegal drugs;</p>
	<p pid="d.1555W.8/7" class="indent">effective treatment and support, to help people to overcome problems with drugs and to re-establish their lives; and</p>
	<p pid="d.1555W.8/8" class="indent">communications activity, to support parents in preventing drug use among their children, and to increase the confidence and resilience of communities.</p>
	<p pid="d.1555W.8/9">Copies of the drug strategy were placed in the Library at the time of its publication and I refer my hon. Friend to the actions in the strategy which are being taken to reduce the use of illegal drugs.</p>

	<p pid="d.1563W.6/2">Evidence from a recently published evaluation shows the effectiveness of Family Intervention Projects in improving the lives of families involved in persistent antisocial behaviour. Families are usually facing eviction due to their antisocial behaviour when a project begins to work with them. One of the first tasks the projects undertake is to improve behaviour to stabilise a families' tenancy. The recent evaluation data show reductions in housing enforcement action, so in the majority of cases the project helps them stay in their home.</p>
	<p pid="d.1563W.6/3">We do not collect data on the number of families evicted from their homes (either permanently or temporarily) white a Family Intervention Project works with them. We know from contact with the projects, however, that eviction happens very rarely. A small minority of families (5 per cent. were identified in the recent evaluation) disengage from the projects and it is possible in a small number of these cases the LA would proceed with an eviction. But these are families who were facing eviction before they became involved with the Family Intervention Project.</p>

The number of subject profiles is not the same as the number of individuals. It is currently estimated that 13.3 per cent. of profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, that is, that a profile for a person has been loaded on more than one occasion. The replication rate of 13.3 per cent. should, however, be applied only over the entire NDNAD, as the replication rate for individual police forces varies considerably. The table gives the number of subject profiles for each police force only, but gives a total estimated number of individuals for all English and Welsh police forces.</p>

	<p pid="d.1567W.8/2"><i> </i>Training given to police officers on the provisions of the Hunting Act is an operational matter for Chief Officers. The police have made it clear that they will enforce the hunting ban and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) issued guidance for police forces on the practical aspects of enforcing the Hunting Act in 2005. ACPO are currently doing further work to draw out and disseminate best practice on enforcement of the Hunting Act across the police service ahead of the start of the next hunting season.</p>

	<p pid="d.1568W.5/1">The Cost Report has set out those elements of the cost estimates that relate specifically to passports, those cost estimates specific to identity cards, and those cost estimates that are common to both. The cost of registering individuals for passports and ID cards is included in common costs because the same technology infrastructure and business processes will be used. In many cases, the same application will result in the issue of both a passport and an ID card.</p>
	<p pid="d.1568W.5/2">The May 2008 Cost Report is based upon the roll-out and phasing of the 2008 Delivery Plan, whereas the November 2007 Cost Report is based upon the 2006 Strategic Action Plan. Therefore, the two reports are not directly comparable.</p>
	<p pid="d.1568W.5/3">The estimated common costs are based upon a scale of operation that is delivering volumes of passports and identity cards. It would involve significant nugatory effort to define a split between these costs and it would be a largely theoretical exercise as current plans are for an integrated infrastructure. As such, it is not possible to identify the percentage of the cost of the identity card scheme that are associated with the minimum necessary upgrade for introducing biometric passports.</p>

	<p pid="d.1575W.8/3">The Home Secretary announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-13">13 July</phrase> tough measures to deal with those involved in knife crime through greater police enforcement, targeted action and earlier intervention and support for parents. These new measures complement the Government's launch of the new &pound;100 million Youth Crime Action Plan. The clampdown on knives reflects a triple-track approach of tough enforcement, intensive support and better prevention.</p>
	<p pid="d.1575W.8/4">The Tackling Knives Action Programme is a targeted approach to addressing knife crime in specific areas: Metropolitan Police Service, West Midlands police, Greater Manchester police, Merseyside police, Lancashire police, Essex police, West Yorkshire, Thames Valley police, Nottinghamshire police and South Wales police. The programme will build upon the Tackling Gangs Action Programme that helped deliver a 50 per cent. reduction in gun injuries in hotspot areas in four areas across the country. The Government have asked Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alf Hitchcock, the ACPO lead on knives, to take on the role of head of the Tackling Knives Action Programme alongside his existing role as Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.</p>
	<p pid="d.1575W.8/5">This programme will include youth forums to encourage young people to stay on the right track in the first place; knife referral projects to ensure that people convicted of carrying a knife are confronted with the dangers of carrying knives; support for parents who are concerned about their children carrying knives by encouraging them to call parenting organisations such as 'Parentline Plus' to receive confidential advice; encouraging local authorities to provide Safer School Partnership officers to any school that needs one; Trading Standards prioritising test purchasing for the underage sales of knives; working with the Department of Health and local health partners to see what more we can do on knife crime in hotspot areas and supporting licensing authorities to crack down heavily on any establishment that allows underage drinking.</p>

Anyone under 16 years old convicted of possessing, but not using a knife, can expect to receive a warning coupled with referral to a knife education scheme to help them understand the dangers and consequences of carrying knives, and to reduce the chances of re-offending. These schemes for young people will make them understand the full consequences of their actions and will include weapons awareness sessions which provide detailed information on the risks and consequences of carrying knives; it may also include discussions with healthcare professionals and victims' organisations and offenders so that young people understand the full impact of carrying a knife and where it may lead.</p>
	<p pid="d.1584W.6/3">The Government are aware of research on the impact of programmes such as Scared Straight. We have made it clear that meetings with offenders form part of this wider programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.1584W.6/4">The Government are aware of research evidence on such programmes. This is based on a systematic review published by the Campbell Collaboration, by A. Petrosino, C. Turpin-Petrosino and J. Buehler (2003): &quot;Scared Straight&quot; and other juvenile awareness programmes for preventing juvenile delinquency. However, no UK evaluations were included in the Review.</p>

	<p pid="d.1586W.0/1">We are involved in a variety of activity to reduce the incidence of offences related to identity fraud, including through collaboration with public and private sector organisations.</p>
	<p pid="d.1586W.0/2">We have sought to ensure better co-ordination in prosecuting fraudsters. This has involved the establishment of a network of Single Points of Contact in all police forces and a range of Government Departments and agencies dealing with identity fraud investigations and prosecutions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1586W.0/3">Legislation has also been strengthened. Tougher criminal penalties have been introduced for driving licence and passport offences, alongside offences in the Identity Cards Act 2006 to target those who possess and use false identity documents and genuine documents belonging to someone else.</p>
	<p pid="d.1586W.0/4">More powers to share data to combat fraud have been enacted. Provisions in the Serious Crime Act 2007 allow for the targeted exchange of data between the public and private sector through an antifraud organisation to highlight potentially fraudulent applications for goods and services. Provisions in the Police and Justice Act 2006 allow for the release of information on the recently deceased to the private sector to help prevent those identities from being used by criminals.</p>
	<p pid="d.1586W.0/5">We have introduced systems to confirm the validity of UK passports presented to other organisations and interviews for first time passport applicants over 16 years old now take place to verify the identity of individuals.</p>
	<p pid="d.1586W.0/6">A leaflet and a website&mdash;<a href="http://www.identitytheft.org.uk">www.identitytheft.org.uk</a>&mdash;help to increase public awareness of the problem. The material advises on how to reduce the risk of becoming a victim of identity fraud, warning signs to look out for, and what someone should do if they do fall victim.</p>
	<p pid="d.1586W.0/7">We have signalled our commitment to tackle fraud with the allocation of &pound;29 million in new money over three years to implement the recommendations of the Fraud Review. A new National Fraud Strategic Authority will drive forward a comprehensive strategy for tackling fraud, bringing together the Government, criminal justice practitioners, business and the public. The money will also fund a new national lead force role for the City of London police and a National Fraud Reporting Centre which will equip law enforcement agencies with a powerful intelligence tool and help form the basis of better prevention advice and alerts to fraud threats for business and the public.</p>
	<p pid="d.1586W.0/8">Finally, our plans for a National Identity Scheme will provide people with a highly secure means of protecting their identity and help citizens to prove their identities easily, quickly and with vastly improved security.</p>

	<p pid="d.1589W.2/2">The United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA) will respond to every police request where they encounter and arrest people who they have confirmed have been smuggled into the UK in lorries and take that person to immigration detention if appropriate. The UKBA have worked closely and in partnership with the Association of Chief Police Officers and have established immigration crime partnerships with 85 per cent. of constabularies in England and Wales with a target to increase this to 90 per cent. by 2008 and 100 per cent. by March 2009. The Government's plans, set out in &quot;Enforcing the Deal&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-19">19 June 2008</phrase>, set a clear goal to target and remove the most harmful people first, working with local authorities and enforcement agencies to shut down the privileges of the UK to those breaking the rules.</p>

The person must be brought before the court as soon as practicable and no later than the first sitting after he is charged with an offence. If there is no sitting for the day on which the person is charged or the next day, the custody officer must inform the designated officer for a local justice area who shall arrange a sitting not later than the day next following the relevant day.

Building upon Contest, public service agreement (PSA) 26 aims to reduce the risk to the UK and its interests overseas from international terrorism. To achieve this aim, the Government's specific objectives are to:</p>

	<p pid="d.1590W.3/3" class="indent">where we cannot stop an attack, to mitigate its impact;</p>

	<p pid="d.1590W.3/5" class="indent">stop people becoming terrorists or supporting violent extremism.</p>
	<p pid="d.1590W.3/6">Developing and delivering the strategy involves Government Departments, local authorities, the police and other emergency services, the security and intelligence agencies, voluntary organisations, the business sector and partners from across the world. Effectiveness of the strategy is assessed against key outcomes, supported by performance indicators, included in the PSA delivery agreement on countering terrorism. A summary of the PSA was published in October 2007<sup>(1)</sup>. Progress in delivering the PSA will be reported directly to the Prime Minister on a bi-annual basis and, so far as it is possible and consistent with national security, scrutiny arrangements for this PSA, including parliamentary scrutiny, will mirror those in place for other PSAs with progress reports made public during the CSR period.</p>

This would contain details of convictions considered to be unspent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (ROA) 1974 or state that there are no such convictions. The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) does not currently provide a basic check.</p>
	<p pid="d.1598W.5/2">There are two levels of disclosures currently available from the CRB, known as standard and enhanced. The two checks are available in circumstances where an employer is entitled to ask exempted questions under the ROA. This includes any organisation whose staff or volunteers work with children or vulnerable adults.</p>
	<p pid="d.1598W.5/3">Standard disclosures are available to anyone working with children or vulnerable adults, as well as certain other occupations and entry into professions as specified in the ROA. They show spent and unspent convictions, cautions, reprimands and warnings held on the Police National Computer. If the post involves working with children or vulnerable adults, the following may also be searched:</p>
	<p pid="d.1598W.5/4" class="indent">Protection of Children Act (POCA) List.</p>
	<p pid="d.1598W.5/5" class="indent">Protection of Vulnerable Adults (POVA) List.</p>
	<p pid="d.1598W.5/6" class="indent">Information that is held under Section 142 of the Education Act 2002 (formerly known as List 99).</p>
	<p pid="d.1598W.5/7">Enhanced disclosures are available to anyone involved in regularly caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of children or vulnerable adults. They are also available for certain licensing purposes and judicial appointments. Enhanced disclosures contain the same information as the standard disclosure with the addition of any relevant information held by local police forces and disclosed at their discretion.</p>
	<p pid="d.1598W.5/8">It is ultimately for each employer and not the CRB to determine what level of check is required for specific employment positions. Such determination is based on their legal and other responsibilities and subject to any statutory requirements as set by their own regulatory authorities.</p>

	<p pid="d.1600W.9/1">We use a number of measures to assess the changes in educational attainment in academies.</p>
	<p pid="d.1600W.9/2">In 2007, for the 36 academies with underperforming predecessor schools (i.e. not including former City Technology Colleges) the proportion of students gaining five or more GCSE at A*-Cs increased from 22 per cent. in 2001 to 43.7 per cent. in 2007 compared to a national increase of 12.2 points. Including English and Maths the increase is 11.2 percentage points from 14.0 per cent. to 25.2 per cent. compared to a national increase of 7.8 points.</p>
	<p pid="d.1600W.9/3">Independent evaluations also recognise this trend. The National Audit Office report of 2007 found that GCSE performance is improving faster in academies than in other types of school. Taking account of students' personal circumstances and their prior attainment, academies' GCSE performance is substantially better, on average, than other schools. The 2007 PwC report also said that academies' progress in terms of student achievement has generally exceeded corresponding Improvements at a national level and amongst similar schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.1600W.9/4">Finally, Ofsted have now inspected 24 academies. One academy&mdash;Mossbourne&mdash;has been graded as outstanding in every single respect. In terms of their overall effectiveness, four have been graded as outstanding, seven good, with the remaining 13 graded as satisfactory. Key to the future success of the academies is their leadership and management. On this indicator, six academies have been graded outstanding, 17 good and one satisfactory. That means that 96 per cent. which have good or outstanding leadership, compared to 62 per cent. for secondary schools in general.</p>

	<p pid="d.1601W.2/1">We have not made a formal assessment of the effects on local primary schools, local communities and local economies. However, there is anecdotal evidence that academies do have a positive effect in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.1601W.2/2">Many academies work closely with their feeder primary schools to help raise standards. For example, one sponsor is currently working on a joint programme between two academies and partner primaries, with involvement from the local authority and national strategies. This will involve joint training for primary and academy teachers, targeted interventions for pupils not performing at the expected level in writing, and teachers from year six of the primary schools and year seven of the academies meeting to discuss pupils' progress and jointly agree targets for individual pupils. We are also supporting 15 academy projects that are all-through schools. In this way the academies will be able to make an impact at an earlier stage of their students' education.</p>
	<p pid="d.1601W.2/3">The PWC Academies Evaluation of 2007 noted that</p>
	<p pid="d.1601W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Independence appears to have given principals, staff and governors far greater confidence to explore new avenues of funding and new partnerships within the wider community&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1601W.2/5">We also have good anecdotal evidence that academies engage with their communities. For example, the Capital City Academy in Brent allows local supplementary schools to use their facilities, their professional library staff have worked closely with their local library service to set up reading events, and they have become central hubs for local sports and arts partnerships. They were recently named the specialist school which had made the greatest positive impact on its local schools. An award supported by their local family of schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.1601W.2/6">We would expect academies to have a positive effect on their local economy. A number of academies are sponsored by local employers, and their contribution, alongside the rising standards in academies should lead to a more skilled workforce in local communities.</p>

In addition to the 83 academies already open, the Academies Group is actively engaged with developing a large number of academy projects, all of which are at different stages of development. It is therefore not meaningful to calculate a per pupil figure.</p>

	<p pid="d.1603W.2/1">Sponsors of the early academies were required to provide 10 per cent. of the capital costs of a new building, capped at a maximum of &pound;2 million. These sponsorship funds were not payable &quot;up-front&quot;, but over the lifetime of a building project.</p>
	<p pid="d.1603W.2/2">In 2006, the endowment model of sponsorship was announced. All sponsors are now expected to establish an endowment fund.</p>

	<p pid="d.1603W.2/4">Other sponsors joining the programme will, as the norm, establish an endowment fund worth &pound;2 million, with a minimum of &pound;500,000 payable in the first year. Payment of the endowment will normally be over five years.</p>

	<p pid="d.1603W.5/1">There are now 494 specialist arts colleges. They are free to choose between the three broad areas of the arts, including the performing arts. They ensure that learning in the arts is marked by creative rigour and discipline, develop the skills of teachers and use new technologies to raise the quality of teaching and learning. They also work with other schools and the local community in sharing facilities and resources to develop learning opportunities in the arts, through partnerships with creative industries and arts institutions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1603W.5/2">Last November we announced unprecedented funding of &pound;332 million specifically for music to 2011&mdash;including &pound;82 million per year direct to local authorities ring-fenced for music education. The work we are taking forward in music focuses on participation and performance. Building on this, in February 2008 we announced the &quot;Find Your Talent&quot; programme of 10 pathfinders that will trial ways of providing opportunities for children and young people to have a range of high quality arts and cultural experiences, including playing music or singing in ensembles and taking part in theatre and dance performances. We are also continuing to invest in the Creative Partnerships programme so that it can give more pupils the opportunity to develop creativity in learning by working with creative professionals and cultural organisations, including theatre companies, dance and recording studios and orchestras.</p>

	<p pid="d.1610W.3/4">Moderate amounts of alcohol can be provided at public expense when entertaining non- civil servants if not providing alcohol might be regarded as unusual or cause embarrassment. Examples of such events are hospitality from Ministers, at publicity events such as launches or the rare occasions when senior staff judge that official business can best be transacted by hosting a meeting over lunch or dinner. This policy is in accordance with the principles of Treasury guidance in &quot;Managing Public Money&quot; and &quot;Regularity, Propriety and Value for Money&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1610W.3/5">Payment can be made by Government Procurement Card for Ministerial and other official hospitality where such use has been previously authorised. Otherwise, payment can be made at the time and reclaimed or the invoice sent to the Department for payment by the central payment team. If it is considered the occasion did not justify expenditure on alcohol the individual will be expected to meet the cost themselves.</p>

Over and above this, the more set piece listening events we have organised in the last two years are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.1612W.5/2">The Department for Children, Schools and Families has conducted nine citizen's juries which provided an opportunity for a mix of stakeholders, including members of the general public, to engage with each other in small groups to debate important issues relating to the new Department's remit. The first jury was held in Bristol in September 2007 with a further four debates held in London, Leeds, Portsmouth and Birmingham. An additional four debates also took place in London, Leeds, Portsmouth and Birmingham in March 2008. The total cost of these was &pound;820,000</p>
	<p pid="d.1612W.5/3">The Department has run nine focus groups as part of the Time to Talk consultation in Sutton, Birmingham and Sheffield with children aged 11 to 16 to capture their views on the key issues and challenges. The total cost for the nine focus groups was &pound;18,835.25 and this included the facilitation, analysis, and production of a short film of the events. Central Office of Information (on behalf of the DCSF) procured the services of Opinion Leader Research to design, recruit participants to, and facilitate all the events and procured Glasgows to arrange the locations, logistics and catering for events held in September 2007. All the agencies involved were appointed in line with standard Government practice on procurement.</p>
	<p pid="d.1612W.5/4">The Department of Health and the Department for Children, Schools and Families jointly held deliberative events with children, young people and parents to discuss children and young people's health in June 2008. There were three strands to this piece of work:</p>
	<p pid="d.1612W.5/5" class="indent">focus group research with children aged between seven and 15;</p>

Friend the Secretary of State and I have regular meetings with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), of which the National Assessment Agency (NAA) is a division. Recent meetings have included discussions on the administration and marking of Key Stage tests in 2008, which are now the subject of an independent inquiry being chaired by Lord Sutherland.</p>
	<p pid="d.1622W.6/2">Between September 2007 and <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-26">26 June 2008</phrase> my officials have met with NAA routinely to discuss national curriculum test delivery. The Department is represented on the QCA Board as an observer. Senior officers from QCA and officials from this Department meet every six weeks, to discuss QCA's core business, including national curriculum test delivery. A monthly Assessment Board, chaired by a senior official, was established in March 2008 to oversee the delivery of the Department's assessment policy.</p>

	<p pid="d.1625W.5/1">The Department's role is to support locally-led improvement strategies. Schools&mdash;governing bodies, heads and teachers&mdash;have the lead responsibility for raising standards, supported and challenged by local authorities who work closely with partners to bring together all the wider services that enable children to succeed and achieve.</p>
	<p pid="d.1625W.5/2">There are a number of initiatives under way that will improve attainment for Cumbria's pupils. A joint Children's Performance Improvement Board for Cumbria has been in operation since February 2008. The Board's aim is to bring strategic drive to tackling the significant underachievement in the local authority's (LA) secondary schools as well as providing support and challenge to the LA's school improvement service. The Board is looking at how schools currently in Ofsted categories can be effectively supported to improve and how the LA can develop better mechanisms for identifying and challenging underperforming schools at risk of falling into failure.</p>
	<p pid="d.1625W.5/3">The Academies programme is already acting as a catalyst to help transform secondary education in Cumbria. Carlisle will benefit from two Academies offering enhanced curriculum and extended schools facilities. Westlakes Academy and the planned Barrow Academy will improve the life chances of all young people in the area, and will help regenerate the local economies and offer co-located services.</p>
	<p pid="d.1625W.5/4">The National Challenge programme launched on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-10">10 June</phrase> will provide intensive support for all secondary schools in England where fewer than 30 per cent. of pupils achieve five or more good GCSEs including English and mathematics. We are currently waiting for Cumbria to submit plans for their National Challenge schools, identifying what they intend to do to raise attainment above 30 per cent. and how much money they will need from the &pound;400 million available nationally to carry out these plans. Every school will have a National Challenge Adviser as well as access to a range of bespoke school improvement solutions. Where appropriate, funding will provide for radical structural solutions such as Academies and Trusts, including new National Challenge Trusts.</p>

I would also refer the hon. Member to my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-21">21 July 2008</phrase> which set out the number of arts colleges designated in each of the last three years.

	<p pid="d.1628W.11/1">This is entirely a matter for Ofsted. Ministers have no powers to intervene. Ofsted has developed a new pay model, in consultation with staff and the trade unions to address some historic concerns about its salary structure. The new model is designed to be simple, fair and transparent, and has helped to secure an above average settlement of 3.8 per cent. from Her Majesty's Treasury. It is based on one salary rate for each grade and Ofsted considers it to be both competitive and affordable. I have been advised by Her Majesty's chief inspector, Christine Gilbert, that Ofsted has engaged in extensive discussions with the unions about the settlement. There is no further money available for pay and Ofsted is unable to respond to the trade union demands regardless of the actions they are taking or may take in the future.</p>

	<p pid="d.1629W.8/1">The Department is taking a number of steps to increase the take up of meals served in primary schools and to ensure all children have access to healthy food whilst at school.</p>
	<p pid="d.1629W.8/2">School lunch take-up is one of the indicators in the new Child Health PSA and is one of the indicators in the National Indicator Set. New food-based nutritional standards were introduced in September 2006 for school lunches and from September 2007 for other school food. Nutrient-based standards will be introduced for school lunches in September 2008 for primary schools and September 2009 for secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.1629W.8/3">We are investing over &pound;650 million between 2005 and 2011 to help improve school food and keep school lunch prices down. This includes funding to help build kitchens in areas with no kitchen facilities and to better support the development of training centres for the school food workforce. We are also providing an extra &pound;6 million over the next three years to promote healthy food to young people and raise take up.</p>
	<p pid="d.1629W.8/4">Increasing school lunch take-up is also a priority for the School Food Trust. The Trust is supporting schools through its Million Meals Campaign and encouraging healthier eating through its Get Real media campaign aimed at young people. That work is having an impact as shown by the provisional findings from their third annual survey of take up of school meals, reporting on the 2007-08 financial year. In primary schools take up in 2007-08 was 43.6 per cent. an increase of 2.3 percentage points on the value reported for 2006-07 of 41.3 per cent. These figures illustrate that the number of primary school children eating school meals rose by roughly 88000 from 2006-07 to 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="d.1632W.8/1">The Government issued comprehensive guidance for schools and other education institutions, &quot;Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education&quot; in November 2006 and this came into force in January 2007. This sets out the responsibilities of all local authorities, Schools and Further Education Colleges in England, to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. This guidance includes arrangements for safe and responsible recruitment of teachers and other staff in schools and further education colleges and sets out background and other checks required on new members of staff. The guidance is available online at:</p>

	<p pid="d.1632W.8/6">The relevant guidance to employees of businesses offering work experience to students at Key Stage 4 and to 16-18 year olds is contained in Annex A and Appendix 14 of the Department's guidance &quot;Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education&quot;. In principle, any person whose normal duties will include regularly clearing for, training, looking after or supervising a child in the workplace should be vetted and subject to CRB disclosures to ensure he or she is not disqualified from working with children or otherwise unsuitable to be responsible for them. It is intended to apply to people who are specifically designated to have responsibility for looking after, supervising or directly training a child or children throughout the placement.</p>

	<p pid="d.1637W.9/1">In 2008 we maintained the fundamental aspects of the 2007 high performing specialist school (HPSS) criteria but raised minimum thresholds for GCSE 5+ A*-C including English and mathematics. The reasons for these changes were: to reflect the introduction of the national challenge and the Government's target that all secondary schools should have at least 30 per cent. of their pupils achieving five or more A*-C GCSEs including English and mathematics; to ensure that only the top third of re-designated schools qualify for the HPSS programme; and to make the best use of available resources.</p>
	<p pid="d.1637W.9/2">We estimate that as at the end of June 2008, the changes to the criteria for HPSS introduced this year impact on eight existing HPSS. These schools still have the opportunity to maintain the status if their 2008 results are above the necessary threshold. Specialist schools receive an additional &pound;60,000 to &pound;90,000 per year depending on the HPSS roles acquired. Schools that do not meet the criteria will retain funding for these additional roles until August 2009 to plan for any loss in funding. The impact on the Department's budget is neutral as we continue to identify new HPSS and remain on schedule to identify a total of 30 per cent. of all specialist schools to take on an additional HPSS role by 2011.</p>

	<p pid="d.1640W.6/2">It is our policy that all young people have the opportunity to benefit from work experience and we estimate that around 95 per cent. do so, amounting to over half a million placements each year during key stage 4, the final two years of compulsory education. We have published a new standard for work experience which includes specific references to roles and responsibilities for the health and safety of young people. Records of accidents during school hours, including those occurring during work experience, are held by schools who have the primary duty of care. Employers are also responsible for everyone on their premises. The Department for Children, Schools and Families does not collect or hold such data centrally but anecdotal evidence suggests that, with such a massive volume of placements, the track record on safety is first rate and a credit to everyone involved.</p>

A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. Admissions to hospital via A&amp;E include admission methods 21 and 28 (21 = Emergency: via A&amp;E services, including the casualty department of the provider/28 = Emergency: other means, including patients who arrive via the A&amp;E department of another healthcare provider). <i> Data Quality</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts, and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i> Specialty</i> Care is needed when analysing HES data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as Acute). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information. <i> Assessing growth through time</i> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS, there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time. <i> Ungrossed Data</i> The data are ungrossed. This means no estimates (grossing factors) have been added to the data set to make up for any shortfalls or gaps in the data.  <i> Source:</i>  HES, The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.1645W.5/1">There are four different types of treatment for alcohol addiction&mdash;structured counselling, community detoxification, with support from a GP, nurse or alcohol treatment worker, specialised residential services, for those who are not able to receive or not suitable for community based treatment, and self-help groups. The effectiveness of these treatments is dependent on the degree of motivation of the individual and the severity of their addiction.</p>
	<p pid="d.1645W.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-01">1 November 2005</phrase>, the Department published the 'Alcohol Needs Assessment Research Project' (ANARP) assessment of the alcohol treatment needs in England, with a main focus on the measurement of the gap between the demand for and provision of specialist alcohol treatment services in England at a national and regional level. Copies of this publication have been already placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.1645W.5/3">ANARP conducted their research over a period of six months between September 2004 and February 2005 and concluded that there was a large gap between the need for alcohol treatment and access to alcohol treatment.</p>
	<p pid="d.1645W.5/4">Aside from ANARP, data on those receiving alcohol treatment have not been routinely collected. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase> the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System, which collects data on people in structured drug treatment in England, was expanded to include the collection of alcohol treatment data.</p>
	<p pid="d.1645W.5/5">Called the National Alcohol Treatment Monitoring System (NATMS) this system will, in time, allow the Department, strategic health authorities and primary care trusts (PCTs) to monitor alcohol treatment services in England. The latest data show that during the month of April 2008 there were 44,863 people receiving structured treatment for alcohol misuse.</p>
	<p pid="d.1645W.5/6">A new national health service indicator has been put into place to measure the change in the rate of hospital admissions for alcohol related harm from April 2008&mdash;the first ever national commitment to monitor how the NHS is tackling alcohol health harms.</p>
	<p pid="d.1645W.5/7">This indicator is expected to encourage PCTs to invest in earlier identification of people who drink too much, linked to advice and support from GPs or other health care staff&mdash;shown to be the best way of reducing the kind of 'everyday' drinking which over time leads to liver disease and other problems, including dependency.</p>
	<p pid="d.1645W.5/8">From 2007-08 PCTs have received an extra &pound;15 million of additional funding to improve alcohol interventions. The National Audit Office will carry out a value for money audit of NHS spend on alcohol interventions and specialist treatment, with a report expected this autumn.</p>
	<p pid="d.1645W.5/9">In total 76 local authorities have chosen to set a target using National Indicator 31, rate of hospital admissions per 100,000 for alcohol related harm, of the National Indicator Set, as part of their local area agreement. The National Indicator Set allows progress against national priorities, agreed by Government, to be measured and strengthens the incentives for improved and closer partnership working.</p>

	<p pid="d.1655W.5/1">Data on the number of clinical nurse specialists (CNS) are not collected centrally. It is for Cancer Networks to work in partnership with strategic health authorities, NHS trusts and postgraduate deaneries to put in place a sustainable process to assess, plan and review their workforce needs and the education and training of all staff linked to local and national priorities for cancer. Commissioners should benchmark their local CNS provision against similar primary care trusts and take action where the CNS workforce is found to be insufficient.</p>

	<p pid="d.1658W.3/1">A demonstration version of the electronic commissioning toolkit was launched to the NHS in June 2008. Following further development a final version of the toolkit is expected to be launched to the national health service during autumn 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.1658W.3/2">Service specifications for each cancer pathway are still in development. A model generic services specification for colorectal cancer has been shared with cancer networks and a model colorectal pathway placed on the Map of Medicine. Cancer networks are each leading on the development of a service specification/model pathway for different tumours. This work is being facilitated by the National Cancer Action Team who are ensuring appropriate guidance around the sign off of the model pathways with Map of Medicine.</p>

	<p pid="d.1667W.8/1">At full implementation, there will be 3 million invitations nationally for vascular checks. Assuming 75 per cent. uptake of invitations, this would lead to an estimated 2.2 million actual checks carried out. Existing data demonstrates that approximately 1.1 million checks are already done each year, leaving 1.1 million additional checks being performed each year. The programme will begin roll-out from 2009-10 and will be at full implementation by 2012.</p>
	<p pid="d.1667W.8/2">Cost estimates of the programme can be found in the Technical Consultation. The cost estimates are based on scenarios fed into the economic evaluation model and should not be taken as final estimates of the cost of the policy. The final costs will depend on the delivery route for the programme and roll-out plans. These are being developed via engagement with stakeholders during the summer and autumn. We expect to carry out further modelling to support the choice of delivery and roll-out plans.</p>
	<p pid="d.1667W.8/3">Implementing the proposals in the final report of the NHS Next Stage Review, &quot;High Quality Care for All&quot;, is core business for the national health service. The NHS budget for England for 2008-09 is &pound;96 billion and will rise to &pound;110 billion by 2010-11. The proposals will be funded from within that settlement. Some proposals require central funding to ensure effective implementation. Central funding of &pound;150 million in 2009-10 and &pound;400 million in 2010-11 has been made available for this purpose.</p>

Printers and other shared peripheral devices connected to the network are not switched off overnight but automatically go to low power mode after a short period of inactivity both during the day and overnight. The Department will shortly be deploying a network tool that identifies PCs left switched on outside office hours and forces the equipment to shut down safely.</p>

	<p pid="d.1684W.8/1">Practice-based commissioning has two elements, which when supported by appropriate governance arrangements, have the potential to improve-the range and quality of local services. Firstly, the multi-professional, collaborative work in commissioning better care for local populations. Secondly, the role of general practitioner practices in providing an enhanced range of services for their patients. For example by establishing a phlebotomy service in the practice so patients do not have to attend outpatients, or by employing an extra nurse to provide proactive care in the community in order to reduce the number of emergency referrals. The Department will provide further information on this later this summer as part of a package of measures to highlight the precise role and contribution of practice-based commissioning.</p>

During the conversation the Chairman briefly touched on the PCT's decision to award to United Healthcare Europe an Alternative Provider Medical Services (APMS) contract, for the management of the three GP practices. I understand that the PCT publicly announced this decision in January 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.1685W.0/2">The Department has not had any discussions with Camden Primary Care Trust (PCT) regarding the tendering process for the contract to run Camden Road, King's Cross and Brunswick Centre general practitioner (GP) practices. The Department does not collect information on locally managed procurements outwith the current procurements of new GP practices and health centres. Therefore we have no plans to call for a report from Camden PCT.</p>

	<p pid="d.1685W.3/1">The current general medical services (GMS) weighted capitation payment per registered patient is &pound;54.72 but the protection of historic income by the Minimum Practice Income Guarantee means that most GMS practices receive more than this and there is wide variation in the payments that practices receive. If these protected payments were distributed fairly and equitably between GMS practices the average GMS weighted payment per patient nationally would be &pound;66. In North Yorkshire and York Primary Care Trust the average GMS weighted capitation payments received by practices is &pound;69. No information is held centrally on the level of similar payments made by primary care trust to PMS practices or other local contracted providers.</p>

As the recent national GP Patient Survey demonstrates, patients across all parts of the country wish to have greater and more convenient access to GP services. It is for primary care trusts to develop models of primary care and community services that focus more strongly on promoting health, preventing illness and managing long-term conditions. PCTs may therefore chose to commission a wider range of responsive services that reflect local health need and maximise integration with other services such as diagnostics, dentistry, pharmacy and social care.</p>

	<p pid="d.1691W.2/1">Implementing the proposals in the final report of the NHS Next Stage Review, High Quality Care for All, is core business for the national health service. The NHS budget for England for 2008-09 is &pound;96 billion and will rise to &pound;110 billion by 2010-11. The proposals will be funded from within that settlement. Some proposals require central funding to ensure effective implementation. Central funding of &pound;150 million in 2009-10 and &pound;400 million in 2010-11 has been made available for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="d.1691W.2/2">We are confident all the commitments are affordable within this overall total, though precise funding for individual initiatives is still subject to further detailed planning work on implementation including whether they are taken forward nationally or by the NHS locally. The campaign will run alongside the introduction of vascular checks, which will begin from 2009-10 with full implementation by 2012.</p>

	<p pid="d.1692W.2/2">To support decisions on how to spend their allocated resource, primary care trusts have developed operational plans on the specific national requirements for all primary care trusts to deliver, alongside locally determined stretch targets which focus on local ambitions. To support this new approach the Vital Signs indicator set was published with the &quot;Operational Plans 2008/09-2010/11&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1692W.2/3">Lord Darzi's review, &quot;High Quality Care For All&quot; foresees that in an NHS with a stronger focus on preventative healthcare, there will be large scale investment in wellbeing services, according to local needs. All of the areas highlighted by &quot;High Quality Care For All&quot; (obesity, alcohol, drug addiction, smoking, sexual health and mental health) appear in Vital Signs and the National Indicator Set, either as national priorities for local delivery (Tier 2 indicators), or local priorities which can be prioritised by primary care trusts in conjunction with local partners (Tier 3 indicators).</p>
	<p pid="d.1692W.2/4">Improving preventative and wellbeing services was a priority in every strategic health authority vision document published as part of Lord Darzi's Next Stage Review of the NHS. Each vision document is based on an assessment of the evidence by over 2000 clinicians across England, and each one highlighted some or all of these areas (obesity, alcohol, drug addiction, smoking, sexual health and mental health) as requiring action, hence their inclusion in &quot;High Quality Care For All&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1692W.2/5">The World Class Commissioning programme was launched in July 2007 by the Department in order to provide support and improve commissioning across the NHS. This programme will bring about a step-change in commissioning, with one aspect of this change being a stronger focus on long-term health issues.</p>
	<p pid="d.1692W.2/6">Through stronger engagement of stakeholders, and strategic planning with a greater focus on the longer-term, we expect to see increased investment in wellbeing services throughout the NHS as a result of the World Class Commissioning programme and &quot;High Quality Care For All&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1692W.2/7">Primary care trusts commission services from appropriate providers to deliver the services and care required. Services could be commissioned from a range of possible providers who are able to meet the service specifications identified by that primary care trust, in line with NICE guidance, where appropriate. It is up to primary care trusts to decide the appropriate settings for services as part of the commissioning process and the decisions are likely to take account of preferences of the target groups for that service.</p>

Over the next few months, we will be working with stakeholders and national health service colleagues to develop a national enabling framework for the scheme. These discussions will include the scope of the framework, both in terms of services and specialties covered, and how the incentives will work. We will then clarify the framework later this year. The CQUIN scheme will commence from 2009 and evaluation will be subject to a competitive tender process.</p>

This list will be published later in the year and will be available for PCTs to use in their operating plans from April 2009. The incidence of each of these events will vary between PCTs and therefore it will be important that PCTs have the flexibility to prioritise and select the events which will have the most impact on their own health population. The Department also anticipates that, over time, PCTs will expand their list of Never Events and the NPSA will keep under review the national list to incorporate more events that PCTs are able to use as we continue to learn from safety incidents and develop evidence-based interventions to prevent them happening again.</p>

However as noted by the Audit Commission's report on PBC, &quot;Putting Commissioning into Practice&quot; (November 2007), while there are examples of PBC thriving in a growing number of areas, the scale of service redesigns undertaken have been limited in comparison with the potential impact of PBC. &quot;High Quality Care for All&quot; signals the Department's intention to intensify its implementation programme and as PBC matures locally, we expect to see more ambitious redesign of local services undertaken.</p>

	<p pid="d.1697W.11/1">Clinical effectiveness is one of the principal elements of the quality of health services. Therefore, information on clinical effectiveness will form part of the full set of quality measures for acute patient care that are being identified by the Department. Officials have begun identifying measures from existing sources in the national health service, other health-related organisations and internationally. The first set of national quality measures will be assessed for robustness, accuracy and relevance and improvement will be supported by a National Quality Board and strategic health authority-based quality observatories.</p>
	<p pid="d.1697W.11/2">Discussion with clinical staff and expert bodies on the initial set of measures identified by the Department will take place in the autumn. This will ensure that measures are drawn up in partnership with clinical and expert stakeholders prior to the announcement of the national set of measures alongside the next NHS operating framework.</p>
	<p pid="d.1697W.11/3">In partnership with Royal Colleges and specialist associations, work will shortly commence to develop further generations of more sensitive and specific measures of care quality and outcomes. These will exploit new sources of data and research evidence, and will deliver better indicators for clinicians to use locally over coming years.</p>

	<p pid="d.1706W.6/1">No specific steps are being taken by the Government to encourage people to learn resuscitation techniques for heart attack and stroke victims.</p>
	<p pid="d.1706W.6/2">The NHS Plan made a commitment to provide 3000 automatic external defibrillators (AED) in public places. This helps to save the lives of those heart attack sufferers who have a cardiac arrest. National Defibrillator Programme resulted in over 6,050 site personnel from public places such as airports, railway stations and bus stations receiving training in basic life support (BLS) and the use of an AED. By the end of 2006, a further 11,405 people had been trained and 10,642 re-trained. Current responsibility for training lies with the Ambulance Service Trusts.</p>
	<p pid="d.1706W.6/3">The Department has been working with the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Healthy Schools initiative to improve the information available to schools wishing to provide first aid and cardiac pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training to their pupils. A number of first aid and CPR training providers have been involved in this work and it is intended to publish a package of information for schools shortly.</p>
	<p pid="d.1706W.6/4">People with stroke also require urgent treatment initiated by a 999 call. At the launch of the National Stroke Strategy in December 2007 (copies of which have already been placed in the Library), &pound;12 million of central funding was set aside for raising awareness of the signs and symptoms of stroke and the need to call 999. This work is in progress and will support a more urgent and timely response of the national health service and the public to stroke.</p>

			<tr pid="d.1707W.2/8"> <td colspan="4"><i> Data quality</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts, and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i> Finished admission episodes</i> A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. <i> Finished consultant episode (FCE)</i> An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year. <i> Main procedure/intervention</i> The main procedure/intervention is the first recorded procedure or intervention in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure or intervention performed during the episode. <i> Heart operations</i> K01-K78 <i> Secondary procedure</i> As well as the main operative procedure, there are up to 11 (three prior to 2002-03) secondary operation fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show secondary or additional procedures performed on the patient during the episode of care. <i> Time waited (days)</i> Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension. The IC have provided the mean (average) and median (middle in ranking) days waited where there was a main procedure of 'heart operation' in 2005-06 and 2006-07. The median figures are a better proxy to the average time waited as mean figures can cloud the real picture as some anomalies (long-waiters) may be artificially increasing the average. Ungrossed data Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<i>   Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.1708W.2/1">It is a commercial decision for individual companies whether to apply for a traditional herbal registration (THR) under the provisions flowing from directive 2004/24/EC. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is not in a position to estimate how many applications will be submitted. So far, the MHRA has received 38 THR applications, of which 33 are for products containing a single active ingredient and five are for combination products. The MHRA expects that a high proportion of early applications will be for relatively simple products while companies become accustomed to meeting the regulatory requirements of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="d.1708W.2/2">There is normally no requirement for applicants to submit information on the efficacy of the product under the THR scheme. The quality requirements for herbal medicinal products and traditional herbal medicinal products are set out in detailed guidance documents following consultation with industry. The European Pharmacopoeia also sets out legally binding standards for herbal ingredients as well as excipients used in herbal medicinal products. The purpose of the quality tests is to ensure that the herbal medicinal product is safe for use and has a reproducible quality over its proposed shelf-life. Tests are required to ensure that the correct plant materials are used, free from potentially hazardous contaminants such as pesticide residues, fumigant residues, heavy metals/other toxic elements, mycotoxins, bacteria/fungi. Where herbal extracts are employed, tests are required on all materials used, including solvents and reagents used for extraction, to ensure that they are as intended and of acceptable quality. The herbal extract undergoes tests to ensure it is of reproducible quality and that it is free from hazardous levels of, for example, residual solvents, micro-organisms or potential contaminants from the starting plant materials. The finished dosage form is tested to ensure that it contains the declared amount of herbal ingredients and that it will remain of suitable quality throughout the proposed shelf-life.</p>
	<p pid="d.1708W.2/3">European and United Kingdom medicines legislation requires manufacturers and/or importers of registered traditional herbal medicines for human use to hold a manufacturer's licence. It is a condition of such a licence that the holder must have a Qualified Person (QP). The QP must either meet existing specific educational and vocational requirements or attain status through transitional arrangements. The QP has a personal responsibility for certifying that each batch of registered traditional herbal medicine, has undergone the appropriate tests, complies with its registered specification and has been manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice. The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that a safe quality traditional herbal medicine is placed on the market.</p>
	<p pid="d.1708W.2/4">In its regulatory impact assessment of the THR scheme, the MHRA estimated that typically the costs of registering a product under the scheme could be several tens of thousands of pounds but that the figure would vary widely according to specific circumstances, not least depending on whether companies already had systematic quality control systems in place. This assessment has not changed.</p>
	<p pid="d.1708W.2/5">The European Commission launched a public consultation in May 2007 on the review of the operation of directive 2004/24/EC. The consultation included data up to March 2007. It is the European Commission's responsibility to report on the findings of that review and, pending that outcome, we have no present plans to press for an early second review.</p>

	<p pid="d.1710W.3/1">In its regulatory impact assessment of the traditional herbal registration (THR) scheme the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) estimated that typically the costs of registering a product under the scheme could be several tens of thousand pounds but that the figure would vary widely according to specific circumstances, not least depending on whether companies already had systematic quality control systems in place. This assessment has not changed. A steadily expanding THR scheme, alongside the availability of licensed herbal medicines, will offer consumers wide choice of over the counter herbal medicines made to assured standards of safety, quality and product information. The likelihood of increased consumer confidence in the standards of products, including the reliability of product information, could also be of benefit to responsible specialist manufacturers and retailers.</p>

	<p pid="d.1710W.6/1">Companies are not required to notify the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of products marketed under section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968, therefore no estimates are available in relation to these products. Following the expiry of the transitional period permitted under Directive 2004/24/EC manufactured herbal medicines placed on the market will require either a marketing authorisation or a traditional herbal registration (THR). As now there will continue to be some herbal products that potentially can be placed on the market either as medicinal products or under other product regulatory regimes depending on their presentation.</p>

	<p pid="d.1711W.5/1">The current fees for registering applications for products under the traditional herbal registration scheme range from &pound;555 for single existing ingredient to &pound;7,480 for complex new products. The fees charged by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) are set at a level to reflect fairly the cost related to each activity. These fee levels and costs are reviewed closely every year. This is in line with HM Treasury guidance.</p>
	<p pid="d.1711W.5/2">MHRA fees for registering herbal products are significantly lower than those levied on pharmaceutical companies for the registration of other medicines. The fees are based on an estimate of the amount of time it takes to undertake each of the activities and the costs of the relevant staff required to undertake these activities. Applications that are more complex take longer to assess and can require staff with more experience to undertake the work. These costs are reflected in the fee charged. The fee of &pound;7,480 for processing applications for registration of complex herbal products containing two or more ingredients not previously assessed by the agency reflects the additional work necessary when assessing ingredients for the first time.</p>

	<p pid="d.1713W.8/1">The Department does not routinely collect this information and no single definitive cost figure exists. However, a study by the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS)<sup>(1)</sup> in 1999 estimated that hospital-acquired infections (HCAIs) cost the national health service &pound;1 billion a year. This is still the best available estimate of NHS costs, although based on data from 1994-95. There were 11.4 million in-patient episodes in 1994-95. This suggests that the cost of HCAIs in 1994-95 was equivalent to &pound;87 per patient. A cost of &pound;87 in 1994-95 would be equivalent to &pound;137 in 2006-07 prices (applying standard deflators).</p>
	<p pid="d.1713W.8/2">Estimates of the cost of treating specific infections are not available. The Department published a 'HCAI productivity costing<sup>(1)</sup>' tool in May 2006, which suggested a cost of around &pound;4,300 per HCAI case in 2003-04. This analysis was based primarily on the PHLS report and figures were uprated to 2003-04 prices using standard deflators.</p>

	<p pid="d.1715W.5/1">National health service trusts in England are expected to meet the four hour accident and emergency (A and E) operational standard of 98 per cent. of patients being seen, diagnosed and treated within four hours of their arrival at A and E. This standard is set out as an existing commitment for the NHS to meet in The NHS in England: The Operating Framework for 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="d.1715W.5/2">The waiting experience for millions of patients in A and E has dramatically improved from just a few years ago. For two out of the last three financial years, trusts have exceeded the A and E four hour operational standard. For 2007-08 as a whole performance was just below the operational standard, however the overwhelming majority of trusts are still achieving the four hour standard. Performance against the standard is published on a quarterly basis and is available at:</p>

Data Quality: HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. Whilst this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  3. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS, there have been on-going improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be counted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.  4. Ungrossed Data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

These are based on both authorised annual and short term discharge limits to ensure they are within the dose limit of 1 millisievert. Actual doses to the critical groups are estimated from the findings of annual food and environmental monitoring surveys, published in the Radioactivity in Food Environment reports annually.

	<p pid="d.1718W.2/4">There is another code &quot;W26&quot;&mdash;contact with a knife, sword or dagger. This code is used for such diagnoses as accidental knife injuries and excludes assault. Therefore code W26 has not been used in this answer.</p>

The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected, the NHS there have seen ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Ungrossed Data</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Low Numbers</i><br/> Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk).<br/> <i> PCT and SHA Data Quality</i><br/> PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of Treatment and SHA of Treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> HES, The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.1738W.2/5" class="indent">The latest year for which data are available on the national cancer registry database, which ONS operates on behalf of the Department of Health, is 2005. Tables 1-3 below show the number of cases of lung cancer, newly diagnosed in each of the years 1997-2005 in the specified geographical areas, receiving (i) surgical, (ii) hormonal and other treatments and (iii) radiotherapy as initial treatments. In 55 per cent of lung cancer cases in the database during the period, either no treatment information was recorded or patients were recorded as having had no treatment. Ten per cent of cases were recorded as receiving more than one treatment.</p>

Authentication of patients seeking a HealthSpace account has been designed to operate within the specified e-Government Interoperability Framework (e-gif) requirements and industry best practices. In due course, when the technology to do so becomes available, registration requirements will be uprated to the next highest level.</p>

The safeguarding of access controls, including PINS and passwords, is an example of personal responsibility, along with not choosing to access records at a time or location where others may see them. Users will be supported in this by means of standard technical measures used widely in secure electronic transactions, for example by the setting of a 'timeout', so that after a given period of inactivity the user is automatically logged off the system.</p>

NHS organisations will determine which of their staff work within which teams for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="d.1746W.3/2">A new legitimate relationship is normally created when a patient is referred to a team for care. This referral may be from a different part of the NHS or may be a self-referral by a patient, for example when attending a minor injuries unit, or when registering with a general practitioner's practice.</p>

	<p pid="d.1754W.2/1">Recent record levels of capital investment in the national health service estate have resulted in a quarter of the estate occupied by NHS trusts being replaced since 1997 and the proportion of the estate that predates the establishment of the NHS itself has fallen from 50 per cent. in 1997-98 to 20 per cent. in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="d.1754W.2/2">NHS organisations are responsible for the provision and maintenance of facilities to support the delivery of high quality clinical services. Therefore the NHS will locally prioritise investment to reduce backlog maintenance based on risk assessment, reconfiguration planning and available resources. The majority of backlog maintenance relates to low priority work, which trusts will undertake through maintenance programmes. Where higher risks are present, work will be undertaken as a priority. While levels of backlog maintenance vary across the NHS, it is estimated that around 75 per cent. of the total costs to eradicate backlog maintenance is concentrated in 20 per cent. of organisations.</p>

	<p pid="d.1762W.5/1">As the National Audit Office has recently reported, although deployment by local service providers has started, the completion of deployment of systems to all hospitals is likely to take some four years longer than originally planned. This delay is regrettable and is related to the scale and complexity of the task. This is because the new systems have taken longer to be developed and because they are being installed into acute hospitals that already have between 20 and 40 existing systems, built to different standards over many years. The new systems need to be made to operate seamlessly and safely with these non-standard existing systems and interfaces, with associated data cleansing and data quality requirements.</p>

The incidents are reported through a variety of routes, by individual NHS staff, including through local trust risk management systems and web based e-forms (including an open access e-form). The individual reports are not investigated or verified by the NPSA. Since these incidents are self-reported they are not necessarily representative of the NHS across England and Wales and therefore need interpreting with care.<br/> 4.

	<p pid="d.1793W.2/1">As set out in the Cancer Reform Strategy, it is for strategic health authorities (SHAs) to work with cancer networks, NHS trusts and postgraduate deaneries to develop a local long term radiotherapy work force strategy including an urgent review of work force supply, demand and skills mix to identify the investment needed in both staff numbers and types of training commissions. To help SHAs the national Cancer Action Team will shortly be providing guidance on developing a local response to the National Radiotherapy Advisory Group report.</p>

	<p pid="d.1793W.5/1">In line with the recommendations of the National Radiotherapy Advisory Group's (NRAG) Report entitled 'Radiotherapy: Developing a World Class Service for England', the Cancer Reform Strategy (CRS) has recommended that local primary care trusts with their cancer networks may want to review their local radiotherapy service to ensure that recommended levels of fractionisation and linear accelerator productivity are achieved and that they have sufficient capacity to meet the extended 31-day waiting standard for all radiotherapy in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="d.1795W.8/1">No such estimate has been made.</p>
	<p pid="d.1795W.8/2">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) started work in March 2002. CRB checks are generally discretionary, but in some instances are mandatory. CRB checks for staff working in regulated social care were phased in, starting in April 2002, and have been required for all staff since <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-31">31 October 2004</phrase>. Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-26">26 July 2004</phrase>, all staff working in regulated social care are required to be checked against the Protection of Vulnerable Adults (POVA) list. Anyone who is on the list is automatically barred from working in regulated adult social care.</p>
	<p pid="d.1795W.8/3">People can start work in regulated social care before receiving their CRB check where this is necessary to ensure that the care provider has sufficient staff to meet the needs of service users. However, these staff must have applied for a CRB check, they must not be on the POVA list and they must have successfully fulfilled all the other pre-employment requirements. All new staff must undergo training and be adequately supervised.</p>
	<p pid="d.1795W.8/4">In February 2005, Ministers decided that CRB checks should be mandatory throughout the NHS for all eligible new staff with access to patients in the normal course of duties. Full guidance on pre-appointment checks for national health service staff was issued by NHS Employers in May 2005. The NHS Employers guidance is mandatory by virtue of the Standards for Better Health which includes a standard for staff recruitment checks.</p>
	<p pid="d.1795W.8/5">The Commission for Social Care Inspection and the Healthcare Commission are responsible for monitoring compliance. They will take appropriate enforcement action if they find a person who has not been appropriately checked.</p>

The draft NHS Constitution and the Government's proposals are open for public consultation until <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-17">17 October 2008</phrase>.

	<p pid="d.1799W.0/3">When the Department introduces a new immunisation programme following a JCVI recommendation it is normally announced to the NHS through a letter from the Chief Medical Officer. Where appropriate, the Department provides guidance and additional funding to the NHS to implement the programme. In some cases, the requirement to offer a vaccine is imposed by or under legislation. 'Vital Signs', a key component of the NHS Operational Framework, prioritises immunisation. Strategic health authorities performance manage primary care trusts against their local plans. Vaccine uptake is monitored across the country to assist in this process.</p>
	<p pid="d.1799W.0/4">When the Department introduces a new screening programme, following a UK NSC recommendation, the steps taken to ensure the NHS implements the recommendations vary depending on the individual screening programme. In the past, the Department has supported implementation by establishing UK NSC led national programme teams. The UK NSC will provide advice on implementation.</p>
