Gloucestershire county council has resolved to keep confidential the types of information specified in paragraphs 5, 7 and 9. These paragraphs cover information relating to financial assistance provided by the authority, the financial or business affairs of other parties and terms proposed in the course of commercial contract negotiations. No discussions have been held between the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the county council about the council's use of confidentiality provisions in local government legislation.

	<p pid=".1032W.5/1">The Government gave careful consideration to recommendation 1.42 on the beam of greatest intensity. We have sought to address the concerns that the Stewart Group identified in the following ways.</p>
	<p pid=".1032W.5/2">Planning Policy Guidance Note 8 on Telecommunications recognises that when operators are siting mobile phone base stations schools must be given special consideration. It makes clear that, where it is proposed to install, alter or replace a mobile base station near a school or college, operators should discuss the proposed development with the relevant body of the school or college concerned before submitting an application for planning permission or prior approval to the local authority.</p>
	<p pid=".1032W.5/3">Department for Education and Skills has issued advice to local education authorities and schools about base stations in and around school premises and the use of mobile phones by children. Where parents and/or schools wish to know whether the beam of intensity falls on school grounds or buildings, the school should contact the base station's operator. The operators have agreed to provide schools with information on the level of intensity of radio frequency radiation. If there is major concern from the school or parents, they could ask the network operator to adjust the antenna.</p>
	<p pid=".1032W.5/4">Another recommendation (1.41) of the Stewart Report was the auditing of emissions from base stations particularly near schools and other sensitive sites. In an ongoing audit, OFCOM (formerly the Radiocommunications Agency) has measured exposures around nearly 300 base stations to date (<a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">www.ofcom.org.uk</a>). In all cases exposures have been below, and mostly thousands of times below, the guidelines.</p>

The Department did not, therefore, produce any of the Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) linked to the 147 regulations for reform or removal which were announced with the Pre-Budget Report in December 2003. Among the regulations to reform there were several measures with direct benefits for business, including the increase to the statutory audit threshold, which freed 69,000 businesses from the obligation to undergo an independent audit. Final RIAs are laid in the House Library, and all published RIAs are also available from departmental websites.</p>

CWT will offer a wide range of services, including a continuing implant in the Palace of Westminster, access to preferential prices for both air and rail travel, foreign exchange, and an internet self-booking facility for those who wish to book online.

	<p pid=".1047W.8/1">Ministers have made no representations to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) regarding the content of their reports. The content of ONS reports is a matter for ONS on which they alone take the final decision after consultation as appropriate. The Department for Transport (DfT) is involved in the quality assurance process for some ONS reports, which involves discussion at official level. The quality assurance process may identify data quality or methodological issues that lead to ONS changing their reports.</p>
	<p pid=".1047W.8/2">As part of the quality assurance process, DfT officials contacted ONS seeking clarifications on the methodology used to produce the figures on GHG emissions in the Environmental Accounts published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-20">20 May</phrase>. Subsequently, the DfT Head of Freight Statistics informed ONS they were unable to reconcile the figures in the Environmental Accounts with DfT data on the road freight industry. In this case, DfT Statisticians were concerned about data quality and methodological issues. ONS agreed that further investigation was required. ONS has publicly made clear that: &quot;The Office for National Statistics (ONS) alone took the decision on the final wording of the news release on the environmental accounts (report, <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-27">27 May 2004</phrase>). There was no improper pressure from the Department for Transport or anywhere else. ONS could not satisfy itself fully on technical concerns over the reconciliation of figures on road freight emissions based on alternative definitions and hence decided that it would not be appropriate to focus upon transport emissions. There was nothing unusual about the process adopted on this occasion and it is completely wrong to suggest that the figures were &quot;withdrawn&quot; or &quot;removed from the . . . report&quot;. The published datasets were not amended in any way and were published on the National Statistics website in their entirety.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1047W.8/3">Once the reconciliation work is completed it will be made publicly available.</p>

	<p pid=".1049W.9/1">All our education policies are based on the conviction that every child should be able to achieve at the highest level of their potential, irrespective of background. Our national key stage strategies have an essential role to play in narrowing the attainment gap by raising expectations of all our children.</p>
	<p pid=".1049W.9/2">But we also have targeted programmes aimed at narrowing the gap. We are investing heavily in our Sure Start programmes, with additional funding of &pound;669 million by 2007&ndash;08 compared with 2004&ndash;05, because we know that the early years of a child's life are crucial in determining the outcomes for children when they grow up.</p>
	<p pid=".1049W.9/3">The Excellence in Cities programme which now includes Leadership Incentive Grant (LIG) and Behaviour Improvement Plans (BIP) is making a real difference&mdash;as are measures to tackle underperformance which provide support and challenge to schools and authorities falling below floor targets. In terms of five good GCSEs, schools in EiC whole authority areas improved at more than twice the average of non-EiC schools. And after the first year of the BIP (2002&ndash;03), unauthorised absence across secondary schools in the programme in the initial 34 LEAs dropped from 3.03 per cent. to 2.94 per cent. In primary schools the corresponding figures were a drop in unauthorised absence from 1.29 per cent. to 1.17 per cent. Fixed term exclusions dropped by 11 per cent. in secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid=".1049W.9/4">The number of schools below the Government's floor targets for attainment at Key Stage 4 has dropped sharply: in 2000, the number of schools below 20 per cent. was 241&mdash;that figure had dropped to 114 in 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".1054W.2/19">1. The financial data are taken from Sefton LEAs' Section 52 outturn statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&ndash;2000 onwards and the ODPM's RO1 statement previously. 2002&ndash;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&ndash;2000. Hence, for consistency, the combined unit cost is provided since 1996&ndash;97 but due to LEA expenditure on pupils in independent nurseries the unit cost for primary education is a more robust measure.</p>
	<p pid=".1054W.2/20">2. The outturn 2002&ndash;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&ndash;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.</p>
	<p pid=".1054W.2/21">3. Spending in 1997&ndash;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&ndash;99.</p>

	<p pid=".1054W.2/23">5.

The financial data are taken from local education authorities1 Section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&ndash;2000 onwards and the ODPM's RO1 statement previously. 2002&ndash;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Prior to local government reorganisation (LGR) in 1997&ndash;98 Stoke-on-Trent LEA was part of Staffordshire LEA. Consequently figures for 1996&ndash;97 are for pre-LGR Staffordshire LEA and figures for 1997&ndash;98 onwards are for Stoke-on-Trent LEA.</p>
	<p pid=".1056W.6/20">2. Spending in 1997&ndash;98 reflects the transfer of moneys from local government to central government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&ndash;99. 1999&ndash;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.</p>
	<p pid=".1056W.6/21">3. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&ndash;2000.</p>
	<p pid=".1056W.6/22">4. The outturn 2002&ndash;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&ndash;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers.</p>
	<p pid=".1056W.6/23">5. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.</p>
	<p pid=".1056W.6/24">6.

	<p pid=".1059W.0/1">Decisions on the recruitment, retention and deployment of educational psychologists (EPs) are matters for local authorities as employers to determine in light of local circumstances and available resources.</p>
	<p pid=".1059W.0/2">We are aware that there are shortages of EPs in some areas and that, as with other professions, there is a likelihood of a good many experienced staff retiring in the near future. In view of this, the Department has facilitated discussions involving a range of partners, including representatives of the Local Government Association, on developing a new shorter entry training route for EPs. The scheme under discussion would ensure EPs qualifying in six rather than eight years. Years 1&ndash;3 would be the Psychology degree course followed by a further three years of postgraduate training built around work placements. Years 4&ndash;6 would be managed by higher education institutions in partnership with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".1059W.0/3">The new route would require significant additional funding, the case for which will need to be considered within the wider context of the 2004 Spending Review.

We have also said that we will introduce a new adult learning grant of up to &pound;30 a week for full-time learners studying for their first Level 2 qualification. We want to improve the quality of information, advice and guidance to help people choose the right course for them. Basic skills needs for those without qualifications are being addressed through the Government's Skills for Life strategy. We have also asked regional development agencies to work with the Learning and Skills Council, the Small Business Service, Jobcentre Plus, Skills for Business and others to ensure that the aims of Skills Strategy are delivered in a more co-ordinated way that connects with the needs of employers and individuals at the regional, local and sectoral level through the creation of strong and effective Regional Skills Partnerships.</p>

	<p pid=".1065W.2/2">Promoting regular school attendance and reducing levels of absence are key components of the Government's strategy to raise educational standards. The current national Public Service Agreement (PSA) target is to reduce the 2002 level of unauthorised absence by 10 per cent. in this school year; and to sustain the new lower level and improve overall attendance levels thereafter.</p>
	<p pid=".1065W.2/3">To help achieve the current PSA target, the Department set the 56 LEAs facing some of the greatest challenges individual stretching targets to reduce unauthorised absence in 2003/04. These LEAs received extra resources to assist in improving support to schools and pupils with poor attendance and in devising better strategic approaches to attendance management.</p>
	<p pid=".1065W.2/4">In all, the National Behaviour and Attendance Strategy is investing around &pound;120 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;155 million in 2005&ndash;06 on measures to reduce exclusions or provide education for excluded pupils, to support vulnerable and disaffected pupils back into the classroom, to improve behaviour and to tackle truancy and improve school attendance. As many of the measures schools and LEAs implement will improve both pupils' behaviour and their attendance&mdash;and action in respect of one will often have an impact on the other&mdash;it is not possible to identify separately the level of expenditure allocated to tackling truancy alone.</p>

	<p pid=".1069W.8/2">Members of the armed forces may temporarily obscure the vision of apprehended individuals, for reasons of operational security, for example, while they are being transported through militarily sensitive areas. Vision may not be obscured during interrogation. The directive issued by the Chief of Joint Operations to the Commander of British Forces in Iraq covers methods that may be used when obscuring vision, and circumstances in which these methods may be applied.</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.8/3">No other forms of sensory deprivation are permitted. Joint Warfare Publication 1&ndash;10 (Prisoner of War Handling) states that no forms of physical or mental pressure may be used for the purpose of inducing answers to questions, which would preclude the use of 'white noise' or any other sensory deprivation techniques.</p>

	<p pid=".1074W.2/1">Following the publication of a preliminary paper on the <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-19">19 May</phrase>, today we published our full strategy paper &quot;Building on New Deal: Local solutions meeting individual needs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1074W.2/2">The New Deal has already helped over a million people to find jobs and we are continuing to build on this success. The strategy published today will introduce greater flexibility into our employment programmes, providing a service tailored to the needs of individuals, local areas and local employers. Jobcentre Plus District Managers will have increased flexibility to provide whichever type of support is needed to help people move into sustained work.</p>
	<p pid=".1074W.2/3">Our strategy for employment programmes is developing in parallel with the development of the Government's overall skills strategy. As the strands of these strategies develop we will continue to explore the most appropriate way of ensuring that older workers can access the training they need.</p>

	<p pid=".1074W.5/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is the Managing Authority for the European Regional Development Fund in Merseyside. The Department for Work and Pensions hold a similar role for the European Social Fund. Merseyside does not receive Objective 2 or Objective 3 funding and information on levels of European funding at ward level is not held. However Objective 1 public funding is available in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, which includes Crosby, and the following table shows how much has been spent from the start of the current programme in 2000 to <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-14">14 June 2004</phrase>. Final figures for domestic match funding only become available as projects complete. As the majority of projects are still under way the figures given for domestic public match funding are estimated using data from the Merseyside Objective 1 programme plan. In addition to the funding shown here it should be noted that almost 50 per cent. of the Objective 1 programme delivers pan-Merseyside projects, to which residents and businesses in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton also have access.</p>

	<p pid=".1075W.3/1">The UK has set out to implement the EU ETS in a way that meets the twin goals of maintaining UK industry's competitiveness, while maintaining commitment to our environmental goals. As the EU ETS is a new instrument, and, before the start of the first Phase, there remain great uncertainties as to what the EU allowance price may be, detailed analysis of the potential impact on the UK of the scheme was necessary to inform our decisions on implementation. An additional and crucial uncertainty has been how other member states will implement the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1075W.3/2">The DTI published an analytical paper on the impact of the EU ETS on UK industry, examining in particular the trading patterns of EU ETS sectors and possible regional dimensions to the impacts. This is available on the DTI website at <a href="http://www.dti.gsi.gov.uk/energy/sepn/euets.shtml">www.dti.gsi.gov.uk/energy/sepn/euets.shtml</a>. in addition, we commissioned ILEX Energy consultants to examine the possible impact on electricity prices of differing EU allowance prices and the impact on power sector investment. This paper is available on the DTI website, as above. Further work has been commissioned to examine the cross EU impacts on power prices.</p>
	<p pid=".1075W.3/3">This analysis informed the decision for the UK to allocate allowances equal to estimates of what sectors will require in the 2005&ndash;07 period under 'with measures' projections. This is to ensure that EU ETS will not impose a reduction in emissions beyond what is expected given current measures. The exception to this is electricity generation, which due to the very limited international competition that the industry faces, has been allocated a reduction below 'with measures' projections in the 2005&ndash;07 period.</p>
	<p pid=".1075W.3/4">When the Commission's assessment and decisions on all NAPs have been made, a more informed assessment of the impact of EU ETS on UK industry will be possible.</p>

	<p pid=".1075W.6/1">The UK has closely followed the publication of other member states National Allocation Plans (NAPs), and, has actively called for robust and consistent review by the Commission. The need for the Commission to ensure there is consistent adherence to the principles of the Directive's rules for allocation in each NAP, as well as an assessment of possible State Aid implications from allocation, is crucial to ensure that there is minimal distortion of competition between the EU member states.</p>
	<p pid=".1075W.6/2">The Commission has yet to make final decisions on the 14 NAPs submitted to date, so no detailed assessment of the competition implications for the UK can be made. However, ECOFYS consultancy has been commissioned to analyse key aspects of other member states NAPs that are published, which inform UK comments in the peer review process of NAPs. We will continue to work with the Commission to highlight where clear distortions of competition arise from implementation and breaches of the directive establishing the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".1077W.2/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that UK industry has access to the cost effective reduction potential that the JI and CDM mechanisms offer. The UK Climate Change Programme assumes some of the reductions envisaged to meet the 2010 goals and beyond may be made via use of these mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid=".1077W.2/2">In the context of the EU ETS, the linking amendment on the use of project credits from JI and CDM allows member states the discretion to consider whether or not such credits can be used for compliance against emissions covered by the EU ETS. The decision must be notified to the European Commission by June 2006. The Government are keen to allow the use of project credits from Phase One of the EU ETS and negotiated in favour of allowing early linking of the CDM from 2005. A final decision on how UK companies will be able to use such credits in the 2005&ndash;07 period of the EU ETS has not been made.</p>

	<p pid=".1080W.0/1">The information requested is not available on average over the last five years, and could be produced only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case files.</p>
	<p pid=".1080W.0/2">However, a cohort analysis up to and including appeals at the IAA was carried out for asylum applications made in 2002. It is estimated that around four in ten (42 per cent.) of applications in 2002 resulted in the granting of asylum (10 <sup>1</sup> per cent.) or of exceptional leave to remain (23 <sup>1</sup> per cent.) or in appeals which were allowed by the IAA adjudicators (a further 10 per cent).</p>
	<p pid=".1080W.0/3">Based on cases where data are available, it is estimated that 77 per cent. of initial refusals of applications made in 2002 resulted in an appeal (i.e. 54 per cent. of applications in 2002 resulted in appeals), and that 10 per cent. of applications made in 2002 resulted in appeals allowed at the IAA.</p>
	<p pid=".1080W.0/4">Asylum cases are determined according to their individual merits. The rates of refusal at initial decision and at appeal change over time reflecting a variety of factors including the changing mix of applicant nationalities, and changing situations in source countries. Over the last five years the vast majority of appeals have been dismissed, at the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA) and at the Immigration Appeal Tribunal (IAT).</p>
	<p pid=".1080W.0/5">Applications for leave to appeal to the IAT may be brought either by appellants or by the Secretary of State. The majority of applications for leave to appeal to the IAT are dismissed.</p>

	<p pid=".1087W.2/1">Grant support for policing generally, including security arrangements common to all police authorities, is allocated using the police grant funding formula. In addition, one particular component of the formula supports additional security costs that vary between police authorities. Provision is allocated between police authorities in line with professional assessment of relative security pressures.</p>
	<p pid=".1087W.2/2">The component for additional security pressures has been included as part of the police funding formula since its inception in 1995&ndash;96. It represented 1.8 per cent. of total formula provision in 1998&ndash;99, increasing to 2 per cent. from 1999&ndash;2000 to 2002&ndash;03. Following wider formula changes in 2002, the proportion has been 2.3 per cent. since 2003&ndash;04. The provision is an integral part of the overall calculation on which general police grants for each authority are based.</p>
	<p pid=".1087W.2/3">The available figures included in the funding formula for additional security pressures are set out in the table.</p>

	<p pid=".1093W.2/3">The Neighbourhood Watch logos are Crown copyright. We are taking steps to resolve the situation with NNWA and to restore ownership and control of the Neighbourhood Watch trademarks to the Home Office.

	<p pid=".1093W.8/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-04">4 June</phrase> it became a requirement for any door supervisor working in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, including any employed by a company outside those areas, to possess a licence issued by the Security Industry Authority (SIA).</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.8/3">It was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-11">11 November 2003</phrase> that Hampshire and the Isle of Wight would be the initial pilot area for the SIA's licensing arrangements, which are to be rolled out across the whole of England and Wales by April 2005. At the same time, it was made clear that applications in the pilot area could be made from <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-01">1 March 2004</phrase> and that the legal requirement to hold a licence would come into force from <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-04">4 June</phrase>. The SIA has since undertaken considerable consultation with stakeholders, local authorities and the police, and has carried out a wide-ranging publicity campaign. A small number of representations were received from pub and club owners requesting an extension of the <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-04">4 June</phrase> deadline. We have kept in close touch with the SIA throughout the pilot scheme and have received regular updates on progress, and we concluded that the <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-04">4 June</phrase> deadline should stand.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.8/4">The responsibility to apply for an SIA licence rests with the individual. As at <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-04">4 June</phrase>, 722 applications had been received from within the pilot area and 193 licences had been granted. The great majority of applications are being processed within the SIA's published target time of four to six weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.8/5">Some representations have been received about the SIA's state of preparedness, including from a small number of right hon. and hon. Members. The main concerns have related to training requirements and the availability of training providers, the cost and affordability of the SIA licence, and the possibility that inability to meet the <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-04">4 June</phrase> deadline might lead to the closure of businesses and loss of jobs. We have made it clear that all of the necessary procedures and arrangements are in place and that sufficient training capacity has been available for some time.</p>

	<p pid=".1097W.2/1">Where killing is carried out under a licence issued by Defra, the techniqueemployed will depend on the particular circumstances of the individual case, but will normally involve cage trapping and humane dispatch by shooting.</p>
	<p pid=".1097W.2/2">All wild animals are protected by Section 11(1) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, against the use of self locking snares, bows, crossbows, or any explosive other than ammunition for a firearm for the purpose of killing or taking.</p>
	<p pid=".1097W.2/3">Schedule 6 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 details a list of species, including badgers, which are protected from further methods of killing or taking. Prohibited methods are detailed in Section 11(2) of the 1981 Act, and are any trap, net or snare, electrical devices, poisons, stupefying bait, automatic or semi-automatic weapon, any illuminating or sighting device for night shooting, any dazzling device, any gas or smoke, decoys, sound recording or, in immediate pursuit, mechanically propelled vehicles.</p>
	<p pid=".1097W.2/4">It is an offence if any person uses a prohibited method against a Schedule 6 species without obtaining a licence from Defra. On conviction the maximum summary fine and sentence is a &pound;5,000 fine and/or six-month custodial sentence.</p>
	<p pid=".1097W.2/5">Section 2(1) of the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 makes it an offence to use in the course of killing or taking a badger any badger tongs or any firearms other than a smooth-bore weapon of not less than 20 bore or a rifle using ammunition having a muzzle energy of not less than 160 foot-pounds and a bullet weighing not less than 38 grains, or cruelly ill-treat any badger.</p>
	<p pid=".1097W.2/6">The latter would make it an offence to mis-use a permitted or authorised method of killing or taking a badger, in a way which would be cruel to the badger concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".1097W.2/7">It is also an offence, except as permitted by the 1992 Act, to dig for a badger.</p>
	<p pid=".1097W.2/8">Further details of the provisions of the Protection of badgers act can be found in my previous response to the hon.

	<p pid=".1100W.2/1">Prior to 2000, British Waterways and GEC, each invested &pound;147,000 into a joint venture (Fibreway), which laid fibre optic cables under many of British Waterways' towpaths and sold capacity to telecoms operators. In May 2000, GEC decided to concentrate its future activity on telecoms business, under the Marconi name and wanted to invest &pound;200&ndash;300 million in expanding Fibreway. Fibreway was therefore restructured, and British Waterways received an annual payment and a 10 per cent. equity share in the new Fibreway business ipsaris.</p>
	<p pid=".1100W.2/2">In June 2001 ipsaris effectively split its business into two components. The mast site business was transferred to Ultramast and the fibre optic business was listed by way of a reverse takeover of Easynet. Marconi sold 92 per cent. of its share in ipsaris to Easynet in return for 77.5 million shares in the enlarged group. The deal meant that British Waterways received a 2.6 per cent. share of Easynet and a stake in the Ultramast business.</p>
	<p pid=".1100W.2/3">The fibre optic business has continued successfully as part of the Easynet portfolio and British Waterways Board now owns approximately 2 million shares in the business (1.8 per cent.). This is valued at around &pound;2.1 million today, compared with the initial outlay of &pound;147,500. Easynet also continues to pay an annual sum to British Waterways for the use of the wayleave.</p>

We understand that a number of existing contracts are due to expire in the next two or three years and are unlikely to be renewed. Some top fruit growers who do not expect to have a market for their produce may choose to grub up their orchards to qualify for the new Single Payment, rather than retain them to the end of their productive life. This is a commercial decision for the growers concerned.</p>

	<p pid=".1108W.6/1">Salmon fry hatched at Bushmills Salmon Station early in 2004 have already been stocked into suitable habitat in the River Bush catchment. Summerling parr will be stocked into under recruited nursery habitat in the autumn. Fry stocking has been a part of both the Department's scientific research programme and angling development programme on the River Bush in each of the last five years. It has been increased in recent years to bolster declining natural egg deposition.</p>
	<p pid=".1108W.6/2">Tributaries of the Lower River Bann including the Clady and the Agivey are routinely stocked with indigenous juvenile salmon by local angling clubs. This has occurred in each of the last 5 years.</p>
	<p pid=".1108W.6/3">Salmon fry hatched at Bushmills Salmon Station have been stocked into suitable habitat on the River Lagan in 2004. The reintroduction of salmon to the River Lagan commenced in 1991 with a programme of fry stocking and this has continued annually since then.</p>

	<p pid=".1108W.9/1">A cross-border scientific programme was set up in 1995 to address the problem of low salmon runs in the Erne catchment. The programme elucidated some of the reasons behind the absence of a wild breeding salmon population and began a restoration programme that saw increasing numbers of salmon ascending the River Erne from 1998. A number of conclusions and recommendations were reported in 2001 and an action plan was developed.</p>

	<p pid=".1109W.5/1">Policy on salmon and inland fisheries is the responsibility of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. Accordingly, the hon. Member's question has been referred to my Department for answer.</p>
	<p pid=".1109W.5/2">The existing threats to salmon stocks on each of the Rivers Bush, Bann and Lagan are similar, at least at the macro scale.</p>
	<p pid=".1109W.5/3">Research at Bushmills salmon station has demonstrated a significant decline in marine survival in recent years whereby a substantially lower percentage of emigrating smolts are returning as adults to home waters. International research into the causes of this worrying phenomenon is being commissioned and will look at factors such as climatic change, predation and pressure on prey species. The Department has been successful in buying-out over 87 per cent. of coastal nets that exploited fish returning to the Bush and Bann rivers and has approved a range of byelaws made by the Fisheries Conservancy Board that seek to further control both commercial and angling exploitation.</p>
	<p pid=".1109W.5/4">Water quality and habitat degradation are the main causes of poor freshwater production of smolts. Secondary concerns include periodic obstructions to passage and predation by cormorants and seals.</p>

	<p pid=".1114W.8/1">We do not have central figures for the amount spent on buying private healthcare for national health service patients in 1997. In the year 2002&ndash;03 the total cost of acute services subcontracted to or directly commissioned by primary care trusts and NHS trusts from non-NHS providers was approximately &pound;110.58 million. The latest figures for total expenditure on acute services in the secondary care environment (hospital and community health service figures (HCHS) was &pound;17.2 billion in 2001&ndash;02. Therefore, expenditure on acute healthcare from non-NHS providers represents less than 1 per cent. of total HCHS expenditure. It is not possible to extrapolate the precise amount of money spent in the private sector for 2002&ndash;03 from the overall cost of the NHS buying services from non-NHS providers including voluntary and charitable organisations and the independent sector.</p>

For the most recent financial year for 2002&ndash;03, 90 per cent. of all admissions with a valid waiting time were admitted within nine months <sup>1</sup> . During 2002&ndash;03 the maximum inpatient waiting time was 15 months. The current maximum inpatient waiting time in 2004&ndash;05 is nine months, reducing to six months by the end of 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".1116W.6/4">Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>
