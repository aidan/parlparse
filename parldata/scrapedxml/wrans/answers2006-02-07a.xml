CCDHRN is based in Havana and run by Elizardo Sanchez Santacruz, Cuba's best known human rights monitor and a former political prisoner. It is not recognised by the Cuban state. CCDHRN has developed close links with the international media and human rights NGOs, including Amnesty International, and we understand it has a number of funding sources although its running costs are very small.</p>

However, seizure figures since 2001 have been unreliable, due to difficulties in collating data centrally within Afghanistan. Additionally, forensic facilities are not yet widely available in Afghanistan and so Afghan police are often unable to accurately identify substances or record the quantities. We are unable, therefore, to provide a breakdown of types of narcotics seized.</p>

	<p pid="a.1045W.0/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.0/2">DFID already recognises that a wide range of circumstances present significant development challenges to the overseas territories (OT) including small size, isolation and access, limited human resource capacity and vulnerability to external shocks. Funding decisions are not based only, or even primarily, on per capita income criteria, but with limited resources prioritisation is inevitable towards those territories which most need development assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.0/3">The main focus for DFID's support are Montserrat, St. Helena and Pitcairn. None are able to raise sufficient revenue to balance their recurrent budget so we provide budgetary aid to help them do so. We combine this with a development programme to help increase revenue and manage recurrent expenditure efficiently. We do however also provide assistance to other territories through our cross-cutting programme which provides support for a range of activities that are common to many or all of the OTs. These programmes include natural disaster management, environment protection, HIV/AIDS, law revision and child protection. All OTs benefit in some way from this assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045W.0/4">EU programmes have to a large extent focused on those overseas countries and territories whose economic development is least advanced, with wealth per capita criteria being the main deciding factors for allocations. However we are currently in discussion with the European Commission about the arrangements for continued funding for the OTs when the current allocations end after 2007. These discussions have included the commissioning of a study to look at a range of criteria, in addition to gross national income (GNI) per capita, to help determine the allocation of EU development funds to individual territories. We are also working to ensure that, overall, OTs receive an equitable allocation within the total available for EU development funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.1048W.4/1">DFID is currently providing over 70 per cent. of its total programme funding (&pound;100 million) in 2005&ndash;06 through the Government of Afghanistan. The other 30 per cent. of our programme is channelled directly to service providers, including non-governmental organizations (NGO)s, consultants, and multilateral agencies. However, a large amount of the work we fund through the Government is implemented on their behalf by NGOs. DFID also funds NGO work in Afghanistan through its central Civil Society Challenge Fund, and through Programme Partnership Agreements with leading UK NGOs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1048W.4/2">In order to reach more remote and insecure areas, DFID works alongside locally based organisations to promote conflict prevention and stabilisation. This kind of community outreach encourages local organisations to identify areas of need which can then be implemented through community managed projects. The Global Conflict Prevention Pool (a trilateral fund shared by DFID, the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office), is also active in funding local initiatives aimed at enhancing the prospects of peace and security.</p>
	<p pid="a.1048W.4/3">DFID maintains regular dialogue with NGOs on security problems and other challenges to operating in Afghanistan. We also discuss wider policy issues with them. Most recently we co-funded a Civil Society Conference in Kabul which engaged Afghan civil society (including NGOs) in consultation on the Interim-Afghanistan National Development Strategy and sent two civil society representatives to the London Conference on Afghanistan on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase>-<phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1049W.2/1">The rebuilding of Afghanistan cannot be achieved without significant investments in infrastructure; but given the scale of resources required, and the importance of donors working to their respective comparative advantages, we believe other donors are better placed to make these investments. The USA, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Japan in particular are investing in Afghanistan's infrastructure sector. A component of DFID's livelihoods work does however include support for small scale rural infrastructure, and for road construction through emergency employment and rural access programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049W.2/2">The re-establishment of a functioning justice system is widely acknowledged to be essential to improving security and stability in Afghanistan. DFID has been engaged in the development of the Afghan Government's 'Justice for All Strategy' which outlines what needs to be done to re-establish a fully functioning justice system, including for criminal justice. DFID together with other UK Government Departments is specifically engaged in strengthening those aspects of the criminal justice system which relate directly to investigation, prosecution and detention of those engaged in the trade in illicit narcotics.</p>

	<p pid="a.1050W.8/1">The UK played a key role in securing support for the Joint United Nations Programme for HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) prevention policy &quot;Intensifying HIV prevention&quot; at its June 2005 programme co-ordination board, which I attended. This policy clearly emphasises the importance of evidence-informed prevention, including linking sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and HIV programmes and access to SRH supplies including female condoms, and tackling harm reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/2">Building on this, as EU president, we steered and secured agreement on the first EU wide policy Statement on HIV Prevention launched on World AIDS day 2005. This important document affirms the commitment of all 25 European member states to comprehensive and evidence based HIV prevention programming including:</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/3" class="indent">Universal access to sexual and reproductive health information and services;</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/4" class="indent">Reliable access to essential sexual and reproductive health supplies including condoms;</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/5" class="indent">Universal access to education and life skills and sexuality education;</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/6" class="indent">Action to confront and address gender-based violence;</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/7" class="indent">Provision of accessible and integrated health promotion and harm reduction services for drug users.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/8">Also on World AIDS Day 2005, the UK Government published a paper on &quot;Harm reduction&mdash;tackling drug use and HIV in the developing world&quot;. The paper builds on cross-Government consensus on harm reduction, ensuring a coordinated and collaborative UK approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/9">Harm reduction refers to policies, strategies and programmes designed to reduce the harm associated with the use of psychoactive substances, including illicit drugs. Actions include:</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/10" class="indent">Needle and syringe access to reduce opportunities for HIV transmission by removing the need to share injecting equipment;</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/11" class="indent">Drug substitution therapy providing orally administered drugs to reduce the need for injections; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/12" class="indent">Information and advice on sexual and reproductive health.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/13">Harm reduction activities provide an important entry point for interventions such as condom distribution, voluntary counselling and testing, peer education on safer sex and reproductive health. In addition to strong policy and strategy directions, the UK has invested in a number of aid instruments which are helping to secure effective HIV prevention outcomes. This includes our substantial investments in the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, (&pound;100 million annually in 2006 and 2007) the World Bank and in new prevention technologies (International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, International Partnership on Microbicides and the Microbicides Development Programme).</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/14">Across Africa, DFID's 16 priority country programmes <sup>1</sup> are working with national partners to deliver comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment and care services. The main focus has been to strengthen national multi-sectoral responses in line with the &quot;Three Ones <sup>2</sup> &quot;. Within this our programmes strengthen national HIV prevention efforts such as ensuring a stable supply of sexual and reproductive health services and commodities including male and female condoms. For example, DFID's &pound;20 million HIV programme (STARZ) works with the Government of Zambia's national HIV and AIDS programme to provide reproductive health supplies, including condoms and education materials for HIV prevention, along with expansion of prevention of mother to child transmission programmes. In Uganda, we are funding civil society organisations such as TASO to provide prevention services such as youth clubs, radio talks, peer education workshops along with provision of care (counselling, clinical services, child support) to people living with AIDS .</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/15">Brazil's success in stabilising its AIDS epidemic within a decade is an acknowledged model for the developing world. Using the two principles of a rights based approach for people living with HIV and AIDS, and full dialogue and involvement of civil society, prevalence rates in Brazil are less than half the level estimated by the World Bank 10 years ago. The 15 to 24-years age group receive priority attention in AIDS education and health promotion initiatives, with a strong focus on mass media campaigns, backed up with small group education and condom distribution. DFID is now supporting the Brazil programme to provide technical assistance to AIDS programmes in other countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/16">In the Caribbean, as in many places, stigma and discrimination is driving the epidemic. There are particular concerns that young women in the 15 to 24-years age group are now twice as likely as their male peers to be infected with HIV. DFID has been funding a &quot;Champions for Change&quot; programme, designed to encourage political, community and faith-based leaders to speak out against stigma and discrimination directed towards people living with HIV and AIDS, sex workers and men who have sex with men. Early signs, from the UNAIDS Epidemic Update (December 2005) show that overall prevalence may be starting to reach a plateau, though much remains to be done to continue and expand this improving trend.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/17">DFID supports the response to AIDS in nine countries in Asia: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Vietnam, Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Burma (through the UN). HIV in these countries is less than 1 per cent. (with the exception of Cambodia where the incidence and prevalence rates of HIV are now falling, and Burma where measurement is particularly challenging). The relevant UN targets in these countries are therefore the prevalence rates in vulnerable groups rather than in the general population aged 15 to 24. Much of DFID's effort in these countries is directed towards prevention. This includes supporting evidence of modes of transmission and trends in spread of infection in emerging epidemics. We are also supporting the targeted delivery of services to vulnerable groups such as injecting drug users, sex workers and their clients and men who have sex with men.</p>

	<p pid="a.1059W.2/1">&quot;The Feasibility Study of Road Pricing in the UK&quot;, published by the Department for Transport in July 2004, showed that road pricing could potentially reduce congestion by some 40 per cent. with benefits of up to &pound;12 billion a year in time savings and increased reliability. The study modelled a wide range of theoretical schemes and charges including variants of national road pricing and of charging in local authority areas. A copy of the study report was placed in the Library, and is also available on the Department's website.</p>

	<p pid="a.1059W.5/1">&quot;The Feasibility Study of Road Pricing in the UK&quot;, published by the Department for Transport in July 2004, (a copy of which is in the House Library), concluded that the equipment necessary to deliver a full position-based charging scheme would probably not be available in a mass-market, low-cost form, until 2014. The Department is continuing to explore how the market might develop over the coming years and what synergies and opportunities this could offer in terms of road pricing.</p>

I would expect the assessment, which will cover the impacts of introducing the traffic officer service on reducing incident related congestion; improving safety; improving the accuracy of information on variable message signs and freeing up police resources for tackling criminality, to be published after this time when the data has been gathered and analysed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1063W.6/1">With regard to <i>(a)</i> <i>,</i> the Government considered the responses to a consultation on public entertainment licensing conducted in 1996 and the findings of a review of licensing law conducted with stakeholders between 1998 and 1999. The outcome of the Government's consideration of the evidence was reported in the White Paper &quot;Time for Reform: the Modernisation of our Licensing Laws&quot; (Cm 4696). The Government subsequently considered about 1200 responses to the White Paper and the views of relevant stakeholders, including the Arts Council for England, the Musicians' Union, Equity, the Independent Street Arts Network and the Circus Arts Forum. With regard to <i>(b)</i> <i>,</i> the Government examined the operation of the Licensing Act 1964, particularly section 182, Schedule 12 of the London Government Act 1963, the Private Places of Entertainment Act 1967, the Theatres Act 1968 and Schedule 1 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063W.6/2">The evidence showed that live music in bars and restaurants was generally licensable under the 1963 and 1982 Acts, save for the narrow exemption under section 182 of the 1964 Act applying to live music performed by not more than two people throughout the day on premises licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises. Punch and Judy shows were licensable under the Theatres Act 1968, but in practice this law was rarely, if ever, enforced. The position of circuses was unclear under the 1963, 1982 and 1968 Acts because of anachronistic exemptions in the 1982 Act which related to entertainments at pleasure fairs and the lack of any obvious exemptions under the 1963 and 1968 Acts. However, in practice circuses were not being licensed, though some were being controlled by local authorities through the unsatisfactory use of public health legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1065W.2/1"><i>(a)</i> The Department commissioned two pieces of research containing a component of public opinion research:</p>
	<p pid="a.1065W.2/2" class="indent">1. A survey of participation and attendance across DCMS sectors, 'Taking Part', was commissioned in 2005. In addition to asking about respondent's participation in areas of DCMS responsibility, there are a small number of questions on the survey which can be classified as relating to public opinion. On average, the survey takes 40 minutes to complete, and we estimate that one and a half minutes of this is taken up by public opinion questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065W.2/3">The total cost of the survey is &pound;2.5 million, but only a small proportion of this relates to public opinion research.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065W.2/4" class="indent">2. A survey of live music provision was commissioned in June 2004. Although primarily focussed on collecting information from venue operators about the extent of live music provision in their establishment, it contained a number of questions about changes to the licensing regime, their awareness of this and their perceptions of the impact it would have upon them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065W.2/5">The total cost of the survey was &pound;127,252.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065W.2/6"><i>(b)</i> The spend on public relations contracts in 2004&ndash;05 was &pound;100,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065W.2/7">The campaign proved to be excellent value for money as it enabled us to access over 236,000 (advertising value equivalent&mdash;AVE) of space in high profile consumer publications on a targeted national and regional scale for zero cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065W.2/8">It is not possible to give the value by nation, region of UK and London as the contract was not specified in this way and we could provide this information only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.1071W.2/1">The Government made clear in the statutory consultation document on the 2005&ndash;06 review of the renewables obligation that the majority of new energy from waste projects should not need the support of the obligation to be economic. For this reason the Government does not propose to introduce an amendment to eligibility, which would allow the majority of new projects using conventional technologies to claim renewable obligation certificates (ROCs) from mixed waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.2/2">The statutory consultation document also made clear that whilst the majority of new energy from mixed waste plants, utilising conventional combustion technology, should be economic without the support of the obligation, energy from mixed waste plants, which utilise combined heat and power (CHP), would be likely to face additional capital costs in relation to the supply of heat. Given the carbon abatement benefits arising from the use, rather than the waste of heat from the combustion process, the Government proposes to extend ROC eligibility to electricity generated from the biomass fraction of mixed waste, which uses CHP. This change will take effect from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.2/3">Energy from mixed waste, using advanced conversion technologies such as pyrolysis, gasification and anaerobic digestion, remains eligible for support under the renewables obligation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1071W.5/1">The Government's aim is have in place controls which give the consumer sufficient safeguards but which do not unduly hamper the development of the market. Unsolicited text (SMS) messages are illegal under new statutory controls, which were introduced as part of the new Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS) is responsible for administering Premium Rate Services (PRS) and can fine companies and bar access to services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/2">As a result of various PRS scams during 2004, the Government asked the communications and media regulator, Ofcom to carry out a review of PRS regulation. In December 2004 Ofcom published a report, which contained a set of recommendations to reduce the scope for consumer harm. Most of Ofcom's recommendations have already been implemented to improve the PRS regulatory regime, including raising the maximum penalty for breaches of the ICSTIS Code of Practice from &pound;100,000 to &pound;250,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/3">The recommendations focus on:</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/4" class="indent">Enforcement&mdash;tightening up the regulatory regime to give the regulator, ICSTIS, more powers to act more quickly against those abusing the PRS payment mechanism.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/5" class="indent">Consumer redress&mdash;improving the likelihood of consumers being able to get their money back where they are the subject of a PRS fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/6" class="indent">Consumer information&mdash;informing consumers better about how to avoid being the victim of PRS fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/7">One key recommendation that has already been implemented is to slow down the flow of funds from network operators to service providers, by making operators withhold payment for 30 days from when a PRS call is made. New rules on compensation for consumers who have been subject to a scam are also being implemented. Then, if there are complaints, it will be possible to hold back funds for a longer period, thus ensuring that fines and repayments can be paid. This will reduce the likelihood of a quick gain being made through the provision of unwanted or unacceptable practices. The new requirement will allow ICSTIS to have suspect services cut off at an earlier stage using its emergency procedure and prevent service providers from being paid for fraudulent services. The commencement date for this new requirement was <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-15">15 September 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/8">The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) is an independent body set up by the advertising industry to police the rules laid down in the advertising codes. ASA receives and upholds many complaints from parents whose children have received large phone bills because they downloaded ringtones without realising the financial commitment involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071W.5/9">The industry itself announced in January 2005 that consumers must be clearly informed by text about what they have subscribed to, the cost, and how to stop the service (a consumer &quot;must&quot; be able to switch off the service with the universal &quot;stop&quot; command). All the UK mobile operators have signed up to these new safeguards and agreed to require those content providers using their networks to comply with them. In other words <i>all</i> content providers have to comply with the new safeguards or will face the suspension of their services (and therefore the blocking and loss of revenue).</p>

	<p pid="a.1073W.2/1">The 2003 Energy White Paper did not specifically forecast the rate of depletion of UK gas but it did say that &quot;it is . . . likely that the UK will become a net importer of gas on an annual basis by around 2006&quot; (paragraph 6.13). This was in line with the projections of outside analysts. For example, Wood Mackenzie, in its August 2001 multi-client report entitled &quot;Running Short of Gas: The Outlook for UK and Irish Gas Markets&quot;, had said &quot;It is probable that the UK will become a net importer of gas in either 2005 or 2006.&quot; The following table compares the Department's central view of both production and demand at the time of the Energy White Paper with its current central view. This shows that our own gas production from the North Sea declined faster than expected in 2004, with declining production from existing fields not being offset by production from new, smaller fields, and we moved to being a small net gas importer.</p>

	<p pid="a.1078W.11/1">I have regular discussions with the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for International Development regarding the Government's plans to participate in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Stage 3 expansion, and will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1078W.11/2">Any UK deployment to Helmand is predicated upon a fully integrated military and civilian plan designed to improve security, build local Afghan capacity, address the problem of narcotics and improve development opportunities working closely with the Governor and his team. Planning has been co-ordinated across Government including these three Departments. The UK's preliminary operations team, which comprises military, FCO, DFID and PCRU members, continues to refine plans for UK activity in the province.</p>

	<p pid="a.1079W.2/1">Counter-narcotics (CN) operations are the responsibility of the Government of Afghanistan. The UK is the lead G8 nation for counter narcotics assistance in Afghanistan. UK forces deployed under the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Helmand will contribute to the broader CN effort by providing the secure environment in which the rule of law can be applied, reconstruction can take place and legal rural livelihoods can be developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1079W.2/2">Under NATO's operational plan for the ISAF mission in Afghanistan, UK forces under ISAF provide, within means and capabilities, training and operational support to Afghan CN forces.

	<p pid="a.1085W.3/1">As NATO seeks to expand its International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) further across Afghanistan, there are clear benefits in seeking greater synergy with the US-led Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) mission. These include less duplication of effort between the two missions, a more concerted approach to support for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, and simplified coordination with the Government of Afghanistan of the international community's military involvement in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.3/2">ISAFs mission is focused on reconstruction, though ISAF forces need also to be sufficiently robust to defend themselves against terrorists, insurgents and other illegally armed groups. The OEF mission also has a significant reconstruction element, though counter-terrorism is its core objective. ISAF does not, and will not, conduct counter-terrorism operations. NATO's revised operational plan for Afghanistan seeks to ensure greater synergy between the ISAF and OEF missions as ISAF expands, particularly in the field of support to reconstruction. The plan also incorporates clear command arrangements for coordination and, where necessary, deconfliction of operations under the respective missions.</p>

HMS Norfolk, HMS Marlborough and HMS Grafton will all have left naval service by the end of March 2006 and will not therefore have been modified to operate Merlin helicopters. 12 of the remaining 13 Type 23 frigates are included in the modification programme and this will enable the military requirement to be met. There is currently no operational requirement to modify HMS Argyll, but this will be kept under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.1092W.5/1">The Criminal Appeal Act 1995 amended provisions relating to appeals and references to the Court of Appeal and established the Criminal Cases Review Commission as a non-departmental public body . The Act sets out the structure of the Commission, the number of Commissioners and conditions of their appointment. It lays down circumstances where the Commissioners may refer a case; where they should conduct an investigation; their supplementary powers, their access to documents or materials, their power to appoint investigating officers; the conditions under which the Commission is able to disclose information; and makes detailed provision for the appointment of the Chairman and Commissioners and staff and the production of Annual Reports and Accounts.

	<p pid="a.1096W.20/1">The Policy Advisory Board for Forensic Pathology was created in 1991 following the &quot;Wasserman Report&quot; on the provision of forensic pathology in England and Wales. The role of the board was to advise the Home Secretary on forensic pathology matters with particular reference to the national aspects of forensic pathology services in England and Wales, such as appointment and accreditation, quality assurance, training and research and development. In response to the &quot;Leishman Review&quot; of forensic pathology the role of the board has been transferred to other bodies. The board still exists and one of its sub-committees is still responsible for matters related to complaints but the transfer of functions is expected to be completed imminently. At that point the board shall be disbanded.</p>

The 'transient population' that migrates into these areas on a daily basis, either for work or leisure, will not be reflected in the resident population figures. Changes in population estimates between years must also be borne in mind when comparing changes in crime rates.</p>

The total number of absconds and release on temporary licence failures is also detailed. However, a breakdown by establishment could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108W.8/2">The number of temporary release failures compared to the actual number of releases on Release On Temporary Licence (ROTL) per year is very low. In 2002, 287,732 ROTL licences were granted and in 2003 there were 328,780. The corresponding temporary release failures were 316 and 405 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108W.8/3">Prisoners released on ROTL are risk assessed before any release takes place. A Prison Governor will not release any prisoner who is considered to be a risk to the public or who is unlikely to be able to comply with the terms of the ROTL licence. Any failure of ROTL is taken seriously and will be taken into consideration with any further ROTL applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108W.8/4">Prison staff are vigilant in their day-to-day activities in preventing escapes. This is supported by Prison Service Orders, professional expertise and regular internal reminders of the need to mange prisoners decently while preventing their escape. The level of escapes continues to be well below the Key Performance Indicator target. In the period April to <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase> there have been no escapes from prison establishments, three from prison escorts and two from court escorts bringing the overall total to five. This compares favourably to last year's total of 15 escapes for the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108W.8/5">Each abscond from an open or semi open prison is investigated locally and findings inform both local and national policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.1120W.3/6" class="indent">Following the 2001 Census ONS undertook an extensive programme of work to establish the reasons for the difference between the 2001 Census and the MYEs at both a national and local level. This research included a series of Local Authority studies carried out in 2004 which were designed to improve the MYEs in the areas that proved hardest to count in the 2001 Census in England and Wales. The results of these studies showed that better estimates of the population could be made in 15 areas and an adjustment was made to the MYEs in these areas. For the great majority of areas the 2001 Census based population estimate remains the best estimate of the population. A full report on these Local Authority Studies can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1120W.3/8" class="indent">Of the 48 Local Authorities where concern was expressed about the 2001 Census, there were 10 cases-where an adjustment was made to the 2001 based MYEs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1120W.3/9" class="indent">In addition to the 2004 Local Authority Studies, ONS is now investing substantially in a project to Improve Migration and Population Statistics (IMPS). Further information on this project can be found at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS">www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS</a> .</p>
	<p pid="a.1120W.3/10" class="indent">The key aim of this project is to reduce the size of the difference between population estimates and mid-year estimates for 2011 when the next Census is undertaken and to better understand any difference that does remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1120W.3/11" class="indent">The IMPS project is allowing ONS to investigate possible ways to improve the accuracy of the population estimates and to establish where it is possible to introduce changes to data sources and methods that will improve the quality of the statistics. This work includes an evaluation of administrative data sources that might inform the population estimates process and further case studies with a small number of Local Authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1122W.6/1">Spirits fraud continues to be a significant problem, and the Duty Stamps scheme is central to the Government's strategy for tackling it. Duty stamps remain a proportionate response to the problem. Since the original regulatory impact assessment was published in April 2004, industry compliance costs have been reduced from &pound;23 million set-up costs and &pound;54 million per annum ongoing costs to &pound;6 million set-up costs and &pound;4 million per annum ongoing costs. These revised costs were published in an update to the original regulatory impact assessment, which was laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-09">9 January 2006</phrase> alongside the Duty Stamps (Amendment of paragraph 1 (3) of Schedule 2A to the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979) Order 2006. The Government have allocated &pound;36 million over a three-year period to HM Revenue and Customs to implement its enhanced alcohol strategy, which includes the duty stamps scheme. These costs were included in the explanatory memorandum which was also laid alongside the order.</p>
	<p pid="a.1122W.6/2">With the cooperation of the UK spirits industry, the duty stamps scheme remains on course to be implemented in full during 2006&ndash;07. The scheme will, in due course, be the subject of a post-implementation review and a review of the regulatory impact assessment.</p>

As industry representatives pointed out when advocating label stamps, they make counterfeiting a less viable proposition than would have been the case with traditional strip stamps, since fraudsters would need to obtain not only the label stamps but also bottles of spirits without labels. Alternatively, fraudsters would have to incur the cost of removing any existing labels before being able to use counterfeit label stamps.</p>

This rate is subsequently multiplied by the amount of the estimated illicit volume in order to obtain the total VAT loss.</p>
	<p pid="a.1125W.2/2">The approaches used for measuring VAT losses are outlined in the HMCE report: &quot;Measuring Indirect Tax Losses&mdash;November 2002&quot;.

HMRC has made a number of refinements to its approach in response to the findings of the ONS review and these are reflected in the estimates published alongside the 2005 pre-Budget report.

	<p pid="a.1131W.2/1">In these circumstances, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) would expect colleges to make alternative arrangements for the learners, either by offering alternative qualifications accredited with another awarding body or by arranging for an alternative college with the relevant accreditation to take over the provision to these learners.</p>
	<p pid="a.1131W.2/2">Depending on the alternative educational arrangements, as set out above, for the learner to gain their qualification the college would be expected to consider whether a fee refund was appropriate for the learner. The LSC would expect colleges to consider, sympathetically, learner requests for fee refunds where they were not satisfied with the alternatives being offered. If the course fee included an element of examination fee then that should be refunded.</p>

This figure rose to: 217 in 2002&ndash;03, 267 in 2003&ndash;04 and 322 in 2004&ndash;05. For 2005 to date there have been 265 referrals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1134W.2/2">These figures relate to the receipt of all referrals made to the Council. The Council has the power to take disciplinary action on teacher incompetence, and on cases of teacher misconduct which do not relate to child protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.1134W.2/3">Cases are scrutinised by the Council's Investigating Committee before being recommended for a full formal hearing before a professional conduct or professional competence committee. Based on the latest information available from the Council, the number of full hearings dealt with by these committees is set out in the table:</p>

	<p pid="a.1135W.2/1">Following on from my previous response to the hon. Member today, the issue of regulating the work-life balance of head teachers falls to the governing body who would be expected to agree suitable arrangements with the head. With over 20,000 schools across the country there will of course be a range of differing measures and practices adopted by schools, head teachers and governing bodies to ensure that the work-life balance of their head teachers is appropriately agreed and addressed. We are confident in the professionalism of our head teachers and in the skills and judgment of school governors across the country. We would expect that they will work collaboratively to ensure that the work-life balance of the head and indeed the whole school workforce is addressed accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1139W.3/1">There are a number of factors which explain the reduction of &pound;19,692, or 0.03 per cent., in formula grant for Worcestershire county council between consultation and settlement. These are described briefly as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1139W.3/2" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> A 0.1 per cent. decrease in the 2005&ndash;06 Adjusted Local Education Authority Central Functions Formula Spending Share. This was due mainly to a downward revision of the control total for this service block which affected all relevant authorities. A smaller downward revision was also made to the teachers pay grant adjustment for Worcestershire.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139W.3/3" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> A further transfer of &pound;12.269 million for the WEEE directive was added into the 2006&ndash;07 formula grant between Consultation and Settlement. In order to ensure a like-for-like comparison between 2005&ndash;06 and 2006&ndash;07, an adjustment of &pound;11.974 million was made to the County-Level Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services Formula Spending Share in 2005&ndash;06. This led to a 0.3 per cent. increase for all authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139W.3/4" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> A 0.1 per cent. decrease in the 2005&ndash;06 Adjusted Capital Financing Formula Spending Share due to a change in the methodology of adjusting for the Education SCE(R) programme which transferred to capital grant in 2006&ndash;07. The SCE(R)'s for Building Schools for the Future were excluded from this adjustment thereby increasing the 2005&ndash;06 Adjusted Capital Financing Formula Spending Share for those authorities that received a Building Schools for the Future SCE(R) in 2005&ndash;06, and decreasing the 2005&ndash;06 Adjusted Capital Financing Formula Spending Share for those authorities that did not receive a Building Schools for the Future SCE(R) in 2005&ndash;06, like Worcestershire.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139W.3/5">The combined effect of the adjustments shown in <i>(a)</i> to <i>(c)</i> led to a decrease of &pound;19,307 in the Adjusted Formula Grant for 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139W.3/6" class="indent"><i>(d)</i> The number of pupils aged 3 to 18 increased by 7 pupils for Worcestershire between consultation and settlement due to the inclusion of pupils aged 16 and over on Form 8b. However as these had previously not been included for all authorities, this had a negligible effect on Worcestershire's Local Authority Central Education Functions Relative Need Formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139W.3/7" class="indent"><i>(e)</i> A further transfer of &pound;12.269 million for the WEEE directive was added into formula grant. This increased all upper-tier authorities', including Worcestershire's, County-Level Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services Relative Needs Formula by approximately 0.3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139W.3/8" class="indent"><i>(f)</i> A 0.2 per cent. decrease in Capital Financing Relative Needs Formula. At consultation, the Capital Finance Relative Needs Formula is calculated with provisional SCE(R) data and this is expected to change at settlement. Extra SCE(R)s were included in the calculation of the settlement that were not included at consultation. This results in a lower scaling factor for all authorities i.e. those authorities who see an increase in their SCE(R) allocation take a larger slice of the fixed control total so reducing the Capital Financing Relative Needs Formula for other authorities. Although Worcestershire did receive an increase in SCE(R) allocations at settlement, this increase was not enough to counter the reduction in Relative Needs Formula resulting from the reduced scaling factor.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139W.3/9" class="indent"><i>(g)</i> The changes to both the Adjusted 2005&ndash;06 Formula Grant and the 2006&ndash;07 Relative Needs Formulae, led in turn to changes in both the share of taxbase for authorities with education and personal social services responsibilities, and in the split between the Relative Needs Amount, the Relative Resource Amount and the Central Allocation blocks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139W.3/10">The combined effect of the changes shown in <i>(d)</i> to <i>(g)</i> led to a decrease in formula grant before floor damping of &pound;10,880. The combined effect of the changes shown in <i>(a)</i> to <i>(g)</i> led to a decrease in formula grant after floor damping of &pound;19,692.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139W.3/11">In 2006&ndash;07 Worcestershire received an increase in Formula Grant of 3.8 per cent. on a like-for-like basis, after adjusting for changes in funding and function. However, we are also making Amending Reports for both 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 at the same time as the 2006&ndash;07 Settlement. Worcestershire's 2004&ndash;05 Amending Report Formula Grant was &pound;1,007,385 less than the 2004&ndash;05 Settlement Formula Grant; Worcestershire's 2005&ndash;06 Amending Report Formula Grant was &pound;196,583 less than the 2005&ndash;06 Settlement Formula Grant. Therefore the net change in Formula Grant for Worcestershire in 2006&ndash;07 is 2.0 per cent. Worcestershire is a floor authority: it receives &pound;3,381,779 formula grant from the floor damping mechanism.</p>
	<p pid="a.1139W.3/12">In 2007&ndash;08 Worcestershire received an increase in Formula Grant of 2.7 per cent. Again Worcestershire is a floor authority: it receives &pound;2,958,439 formula grant from the floor damping mechanism.</p>

It also introduced a policy that local planning authorities should avoid housing developments which make inefficient use of land (those of less than 30 dwellings per hectare net); encourage developments which make more efficient use of land (between 30 and 50 dwellings per hectare net); and seek greater intensity of development at places with good public transport accessibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.1140W.2/2">Draft Planning Policy Statement 3 &quot;Housing&quot; (PPS3), published for consultation in December 2005, maintains the Government's objective to make the most efficient use of land. It asks local authorities to develop density policies having regard to Annex C of draft PPS3, which sets out indicative density ranges for different types of location, to help local planning authorities develop density policies for their plan area with local stakeholders and local communities. The presumption is that the minimum density of development should be no less than 30 dwellings per hectare.</p>

	<p pid="a.1142W.5/1">The Government are preparing an action plan around social enterprise. Building on the many good examples of social enterprises working in partnership with local authorities to deliver local public services such as social housing, leisure services, community transport, regeneration and recycling, we are exploring how to widen the opportunities for the third sector in the delivery of local public services and the community ownership or management of local assets. We are also providing &pound;300 million through a new Local Enterprise Growth Initiative which will provide many organisations and businesses, including social enterprises, with new opportunities for delivering local economic outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1145W.5/1">New Targeting Social Need (NTSN) is Northern Ireland's high level policy for tackling poverty and social exclusion by directing efforts and resources, within existing departmental programmes, towards people, groups and areas in greatest social need.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145W.5/2">In line with a commitment of the previous Northern Ireland Executive, Government have recently reviewed its policy in this area, and in light of this, will soon announce its priorities for tackling poverty, including child poverty in Northern Ireland. In addition, the Children's and Young People's Unit of OFMDFM is also currently developing a 10-year strategy for children and young people. One of the high level outcomes will be linked to the reduction in child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145W.5/3">Government already targets significant resources at tackling child poverty in Northern Ireland, for example working tax credit, and child tax credit, both provide financial assistance for working families on low incomes. In addition working tax credits also provide help for childcare, benefiting around 11,000 families with an average of around &pound;58 per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145W.5/4">In addition, Government are placing significant emphasis on initiatives that focus on the early years of life, such as the Sure Start and Book Start and the Pre-School Education Expansion Programme. Building on these initiatives, the Northern Ireland priorities and budget 2006&ndash;08, launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-14">14 December 2005</phrase>, established two new ring fenced priority funding packages&mdash;the children and young people, and the skills and science funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145W.5/5">These funds, worth around &pound;96 million over the next two years, will play an important role in giving children the best start in life, and tackling child poverty. Government will announce further details on these funds shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1148W.3/1">I am satisfied with the level of dental provision in the Newry and Kilkeel area both in terms of availability and accessibility. The health service provides a full range of dental services through general dental practitioners, the community dental service and the hospital dental service. No one in that area should be unable to obtain health service dental treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148W.3/2">General dental practitioners are the main providers of dental services in Northern Ireland. There is approximately one general dental practitioner for every 2,400 people in Northern Ireland. This compares to one practitioner for every 2,773 people in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148W.3/3">The full range of dental services they provide is supplemented by the community dental service, operating under the control of health and social services trusts, which has a specific role in treating patients with learning difficulties and screening school children. The community dental service also acts as a 'safety net' in circumstances where the services of a general dental practitioner cannot be obtained. The hospital dental service provides specialist dental services.</p>

	<p pid="a.1156W.5/1">This cannot be determined until the Valuation and Lands Agency completes the revaluation process in the spring of 2006. A study published by the University of Ulster in 2003, using sales information, suggested that the proportion whose bills would decrease following the move to discrete capital based rating would be 61 per cent., while 39 per cent. would face an increased bill. The Department's own analysis supports these estimates and indicates that the proportion of properties which will experience a decrease in bill of more than 5 per cent. is 52 per cent., the proportion that will face an increase in bill of more than 5 per cent. is 35 per cent. and the proportion with no change in bill (that is, between + /- 5 per cent.) is 13 per cent.</p>

It showed that the UK had the highest child poverty rate in Europe in 1999 (29 per cent.), but according to latest data for 2003, we are now closer to the EU average of (23 per cent.). European comparisons are made using data from the European Household Panel Study, and are not comparable with figures using the Family Resources Survey. Data from 2003 remains the most up to date as this was the last year that data was produced for the UK using this dataset. UK comparisons across Europe will be measured using the European Union Survey of Income and Living Conditions (EUSILC) from autumn 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.1163W.2/1">Our concerns about research on minimum income standards have been well documented. What people need to live on varies greatly depending on their needs and a range of factors. Different research methods tend to make different assumptions and generate a range of estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1163W.2/2">There are a range of research methods such as budget standards, deprivation studies, expenditure studies and consensual studies that can be used to look at questions of absolute and relative adequacy of benefits. We look at all these research methods when assessing benefit levels although it is often difficult to draw strong conclusions as the results are sometimes contradictory.</p>
	<p pid="a.1163W.2/3">In practice, when setting benefit rates other objectives such as the need to maintain incentives to work and the need to control public expenditure are also considered.</p>

Our annual report 'Opportunity for All' sets out how we are tackling the problems faced by individuals throughout their lives. Monitoring low incomes is one part of a wider strategy for tackling the causes of poverty and social exclusion, not just the symptoms.</p>

	<p pid="a.1164W.5/1">We want to make sure that everyone in society has the opportunity to enter into employment including those who misuse drugs. We have been working towards this goal for some time. The progress2work initiative, which supports those who are recovering from drugs misuse into work, has now been rolled out across Jobcentre Plus. It delivers specialist support to help people find and sustain employment. So far, over 4,000 claimants on incapacity benefits have participated in the initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164W.5/2">Our assessment is that making participation in a rehabilitation scheme compulsory for incapacity benefit claimants who misuse drugs would be inappropriate. For drug and alcohol misuse, the most effective medical intervention is likely to be counselling/cognitive behavioural therapy, but neither route is going to be effective unless the patient willingly engages. Compulsory therapy with an unwilling participant is most likely to be ineffective.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164W.5/3">Medical treatment can be agreed as part of a claimant's action plan. This is because an individual can volunteer to undertake treatment (whether of their own volition or by persuasion from a personal adviser) as happens in Pathways. However, for a health care professional to carry out a medical intervention, there must be patient consent. That consent must be informed consent, given freely. In law, consent given under duress is not given fully and freely and the fear of losing benefit could amount to duress.

	<p pid="a.1168W.2/2">Evaluation of the impact on the numbers of lone parents entering employment through a range of initiatives including the work search premium, the in-work credit and the extended schools child care pilots is ongoing and we expect to publish results in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.2/3">The in-work emergency fund (IWEF) is being evaluated as part of the evaluation of new deal plus for lone parents and we expect to publish this report in December. Early qualitative evidence on the IWEF will be available in the forthcoming report: 'Work Focused Interviews and Lone Parent Initiatives: Further analysis of policies and pilots' which will be published on the <phrase class="date" code="">16 February</phrase> and will be placed in the Library. There are no plans to publish any assessment of discovery weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.2/4">Evaluation of employment zones is currently ongoing and analysis of data will examine the performance of employment zones in relation to selected Jobcentre Plus comparison sites. This analysis will examine performance by client group including lone parents. We expect to complete this by the autumn and publish results by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.2/5">Three recent publications include qualitative analysis of lone parents' experience of employment zones and relevant information can be found in the following reports: Evaluation of the Single Provider Employment Zone Extension, DWP Research Report No.312, 2006, Chapter 6; Evaluation of Multiple Provider Employment Zones: Early Implementation Issues, DWP Research Report No.310, 2006, Chapter 7; Evaluation of Single Provider Employment Zone Extensions to Young People, Lone Parents and Early Entrants: Interim Report, DWP Research Report no. 228, 2005, Chapter 7, all of which are available in Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.1169W.0/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-02">2 February 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.0/2">Quarterly work focused interviews were introduced in October 2005 for lone parents claiming income support (IS) with a youngest child aged at least 14. For lone parents who remain on IS until their youngest child reaches 16, this will involve a series of up to eight work focused interviews over a two year period, which is six more than under previous arrangements. The interviews aim to help as many lone parents as possible move into work, or closer to the labour market, before their child reaches 16 by providing information, advice and guidance on work opportunities and the range of help on offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.0/3">We estimate a total expenditure of approximately &pound;4.3 million on this initiative during 2005&ndash;06, &pound;0.7 million of which represents the cost of an anticipated increased participation in new deal for lone parents resulting from the work focused interviews. It is too early to confirm allocations for 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.0/4">Potentially all Jobcentre Plus lone parent advisers could be involved in delivering these quarterly work focused interviews, but funding for the initiative is based on a planning assumption of the equivalent of an additional 65 full time staff for the period October 2005 to March 2006 or 130 for a full year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.0/5">Currently, lone parents who have been on income support for more than a year receive an annual work focused interview which provides information, advice and guidance on work opportunities and the range of help and support on offer. Results from these have shown that such interviews help lone parents think about work and many go on to prepare for it by joining new deal for lone parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.0/6">In our Welfare Reform Green Paper: 'A new deal for welfare: Empowering people to work', we set out our proposals to increase the frequency of interviews for lone parents on income support for more than a year to six monthly. This will build on the above success by providing additional opportunities for lone parents to meet with a lone parent adviser.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.0/7">We are also proposing changes to our quarterly work focused interview regime which will now be widened to all lone parents on income support with a youngest child aged at least 11.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.0/8">These proposals are currently out for public consultation and the delivery details are still being developed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1172W.3/2">The Government's 2001 response to the advisory council on the misuse of drugs report into drug related deaths said that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1172W.3/3" class="indent">&quot;An emergency call to a person who has overdosed should be viewed by the ambulance and police services as a medical emergency in the first instance. Ambulance controls should not as a matter of course inform the police when called to a drugs overdose but might do so if the original call indicated some risk to the safety of the ambulance crew, difficulty in access or other unusual circumstances. Additionally, when the original call indicates that the patient might be dead or the paramedic finds that to be the case on attendance, it is reasonable to expect that the police would be informed immediately.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172W.3/4" class="indent">Local policy along these lines should be agreed through the Drug Action Team&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172W.3/5">In addition, the Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee (part funded by the Department) national clinical practice guidelines set out that overdoses from, or use of, illegal drugs would not warrant ambulance crews to provide a lesser level of patient confidentiality than any other health condition. Only when drug use is compounded by situations such as sudden or suspicious death would it be appropriate to override the duty of confidentiality.</p>

	<p pid="a.1174W.6/1">The assessment of availability and access to effective, and quality led health care, and the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, form a part of the Healthcare Commission's duties. The national service framework (NSF) for children provides a standard for determining progress with establishing integrated community-based paediatric continence services, by reference to a continence &quot;Essence of Care&quot; best practice tool. The Department has regular contact with the Department for Education and Skills on the means by which children who have health care needs may be supported in schools and early years settings, as part of achieving the goals of the NSF. The Department has also funded the voluntary organisation Promocon to draft guidance for the use of schools, relating to children with continence problems.</p>

	<p pid="a.1176W.3/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has commissioned work under three research programmes relevant to the safety of genetically modified (GM) foods. The current programme began in 2005 and aims to ensure that the most up to date scientific knowledge is used in the mandatory safety assessment of GM and other types of novel foods. Prior to April 2000, food safety research was the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food (MAFF). The cost of the research funded by MAFF and the FSA into issues related to GM food safety during 1999 to 2005 was &pound;9.72 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1176W.3/2">Four of these projects involved experiments where ingredients from GM plants were fed to human volunteers or farm animals in order to examine the fate of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) present in the plant material. The cost of these projects from 1999 onwards was &pound;0.62 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1176W.3/3">Details of the individual research projects are presented in the annual reports of the FSA's research and surveys programmes, which are available in the Library, and also from the FSA's website. The results have provided reassurance that the most up to date science is applied to the safety assessment of GM foods, and they lay the foundations for the possible application of new technologies such as proteomics in the future. No action is planned on the basis of this research.</p>

	<p pid="a.1177W.9/1">The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 defines country of origin as the country in which a food last underwent a treatment or process resulting in a substantial change. Therefore, products made from meat that has been processed in the United Kingdom can be labelled as British. However, the Food Standards Agency has issued best practise guidance which recommends that where a product is declared to be British, but the meat originates outside of Britain, this should be made clear on the label.</p>

	<p pid="a.1182W.5/1">There are approximately 1 per cent. of human tuberculosis (TB) cases attributed to M. bovis each year. Most of these cases are reactivated disease in older adults who were infected perhaps decades ago or are due to more recent infections contracted abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.1182W.5/2">The strict policy of testing cattle for TB infection combined with meat inspection and pasteurisation of milk and milk products has dramatically reduced the risk from bovine TB. While transmission of tuberculosis from cattle to humans is possible, it is extremely rare. There has been no reported case of transmission of bovine TB from cattle to a child in England and Wales since the Health Protection Agency national reporting system MycobNet began in 1993.</p>
	<p pid="a.1182W.5/3">In the event of children coming into contact with cattle with tuberculosis the general principles for contact tracing are the same as for contacts of a human case of tuberculosis and should be limited to close contacts likely to have had significant exposure to infection. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination may be offered to previously unvaccinated tuberculin negative children who have been exposed to cattle with tuberculosis.</p>
