	<p pid="a.309W.2/1">The DEFRA website has undergone a single redesign since the creation of the department in 2001. This went live on <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-17">17 September 2009</phrase> and external costs for this (for audience research, web structure analysis, design and accessibility auditing) totalled &#163;181,378. It is not possible to separate out the internal staff costs for this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.2/2">The Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA) website design was completed in <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>. The cost of external website design company work was &#163;11,643.75. Of this cost, approximately &#163;2,250 would come under the heading of 'Strategy and planning', the remainder would come under the heading 'Design and build'. The website is hosted on Fera's own IT infrastructure and it is not possible to disaggregate the costs associated with hosting the website. 'Content provision' and 'Testing and evaluation' were all carried out in house. It is not possible to separate out the internal staff costs for this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.2/3">The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) has spent a total of &#163;42,500 on design for their website since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.2/4">The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) website was redesigned in the financial year 2005-06. A project to enable Single Payment scheme customers to submit and track their applications online has been running since 2008 with the functionality made widely available in 2010. The data required to provide information on costs for website design from these projects is not held in a form that is easily accessible and as such this information can be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.2/5">The Cattle Tracing System Online transactional website, which enables farmers to submit cattle birth and movement data directly to RPA's central tracing system was completely rebuilt during 2008 and 2009 using new hardware and software. This provided enhanced functionality and security through the Government Gateway at a total project cost of &#163;3,959,270. Most of the cost was on developing and testing hardware and software to support the interactive transactional services to customers. The spend on web design, which cannot be separated from the total spend, was a small proportion of the overall cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.2/6">The Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) website was redesigned during 2007-08 to improve its template design, navigation and accessibility. The new site went live on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-29">29 April 2008</phrase> and external costs totalled &#163;9,394.13.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.2/7">Between 1997 and 2008 the Environment Agency spent approximately &#163;40,000 on website design. The Agency's Internet Website, Intranet and the NetRegs Website were redesigned during 2008. The Intranet went live in August 2008 and the Website and NetRegs in December 2008. Because most of the templates are shared, it is impossible to extract costs for the Website alone. The external costs for this work (template design, prototype creation, user testing of prototypes and accessibility review) was &#163;88,590. It is not possible to provide internal staff costs for this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.2/8">Natural England vested in October 2006. The design and information architecture costs for the new Natural England website in October 2006 were &#163;17,610. The redesign of the Natural England website went live in February 2009. The design and information architecture costs for this work were &#163;53,991.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.2/9">The Animal Health Agency (known as the State Veterinary Service prior to 2007) came into existence in 2005. The Agency spent &#163;8,000 during 2009-10 to redesign its web pages to match the new DEFRA templates. It is intended that the refreshed pages will go-live during July 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.2/10">The Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA) spent approximately &#163;30,000 in 2005 on redesigning their website. In 2009-10 they spent a further &#163;37,323.29 on design. This work is still ongoing with a planned launch date of autumn 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.2/11">The Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) has spent a total of &#163;6,900 on design since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.2/12">The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) has re-developed its website a couple of times since 1997. Specific figures are not available for earlier work. Following comments from users the VMD is in the process of re-designing its website and costs to date (all internal staff costs) are &#163;17,618.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.2/13">The Drinking Water Inspectorate spent approximately &#163;5,000 on redesign work in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.309W.2/14">In 2005 the existing Sustainable Development Commission (SDC) site was redesigned to improve accessibility, transparency and usability. The cost of this was &#163;3,307.50.</p>

In determining any new target, we will look to reflect our national commitment to a substantially established ecologically coherent network of MPAs by 2012, and work with Contracting Parties to agree a revised target that is both ambitious and achievable. To support this, we are seeking reform of the Common Fisheries Policy that ensures all MPAs can be properly managed.</p>

	<p pid="a.323W.3/1">There are currently no plans to consider whether a proportion of the legal aid budget should be made available to assist victims and witnesses in cases of violent and serious crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.323W.3/2">The Government ensure practical and emotional support to victims through Victim Support and other voluntary sector providers. Through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, it also provides financial compensation to blameless victims of violent and sexual crime.

Any victim or witness can access free legal advice through the Legal Services Commission's Community Legal Advice website and helpline.</p>
	<p pid="a.323W.3/3">The MoJ currently funds Victim Support on an annual basis and they received &#163;38.2 million in the last financial year (2009-10). This year Victim Support are testing a model of working that has seen the development of enhanced support services for the most vulnerable victims of crime and in particular families bereaved by homicide. Other specialist providers of services to victims are funded by the victims' fund, comprised of money collected through the Victims' Surcharge which is levied on all fines and ring-fenced for spending on services to victims. In 2010-11 &#163;2.25 million has been made available to fund third-sector services for victims of sexual violence, &#163;270,000 to fund third-sector services for families bereaved through homicide and &#163;250,000 has been made available to third-sector services for hate crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.323W.3/4">The Government are also working to ensure victims and witnesses get the support they need to attend court and give best evidence. Witness Care Units (run jointly be the Police and CPS) ensure witnesses are kept involved in the process and are helped to attend court and special measures, for example giving evidence by video, behind screens or with the help of an intermediary to assist communication and enable vulnerable and/or intimidated victims to give best evidence. Victims are also able to make a victim personal statement which enables them to set out in their own words the impact of the crime upon them so that it can be considered by the court.</p>

We are looking at how to make the legal aid system more efficient, in the context of the current financial climate, while ensuring that it continues to play a vital part in ensuring that people can get access to justice. The Government will consider the policy, and intends to seek views on the proposed new approach in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.344W.0/3">For some sites where there are several distinct work locations along a short length of motorway, it may be safer for both road users and road workers to have a continuous length of temporary traffic management (such as cones) than to individually sign and protect each site. If it is not reasonably practical to alter the construction sequence then a highway authority may accept having several sets of road works spaced more closely than recommended in the guidance. If this occurs, the site specific risk assessment for each set of works must take into account the effect of the other sets of work on both road user and road worker safety.</p>

The Government are aware of the crowding issues the Bromsgrove station project would address. In assessing the case for funding the project, we will need to take into account value for money and the relative priority of the improvements proposed, as compared to competing programmes elsewhere. The decision on this issue will also be affected by the need to tackle the deficit inherited from the previous Government and the resulting constraints on the availability of funds. This will depend on the outcome of the spending review.</p>

The objective of collecting and assessing information on environmental benefits, alongside other relevant factors such as economic growth potential and safety issues, is to ensure that decisions are based on a full assessment of value for money. The coalition agreement contains a commitment to further reform the way decisions are made on which transport projects to prioritise, so that the benefits of low carbon proposals are fully recognised.</p>

When land bases are unavailable or when host nation support has been denied, Royal Navy carriers make a significant contribution to multi-national sea-based forces by providing a secure platform from which operations ashore and in the maritime and air environments can be projected and sustained.</p>
	<p pid="a.363W.4/3">The aircraft carriers in the Falkland's Task Group formed the backbone of the UK's response as the only platform capable of delivering the required air power to secure eventual campaign success. Land basing was not an option; without the carriers and their air groups, the retaking of the Islands would have been an untenable aim.</p>
	<p pid="a.363W.4/4">UK aircraft carriers have operated in the Gulf on several occasions since 1991. They have been involved in the operations to police the No-Fly Zones in Southern Iraq and have been a significant and important part of the UK's coalition contribution and national diplomatic engagement in the region. UK operations in Afghanistan were initiated in 2001 by a sea-based operation. HMS Illustrious was one of the first British units in theatre at the start of the Afghanistan operation, providing the delivery of early entry land forces into theatre . In 2003, the British landing on the Al Faw peninsula (its major contribution in commencing operations in Iraq) was launched from HMS Ocean and from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal.</p>
	<p pid="a.363W.4/5">The full list of Royal Navy aircraft carriers used in humanitarian operations since 1997 is as follows:</p>

We welcome proposals from manufacturers for caps of the same design made from alternative materials. Indeed, two caps made from faux fur were subject to a full trial by the Guards Division in 2005, but their performance was disappointing and they were rejected as unsuitable. To be acceptable, any alternative would need to meet or exceed the affordability and performance standards of the natural bearskin cap.</p>

	<p pid="a.367W.5/2">The objective of the Light Protected Patrol Vehicle (LPPV) programme is to meet the capability requirement of the armed forces and to do this by selecting the compliant tender which offers the best value for money. Fire resistance is one of many safety and legislative requirements that are assessed. Both of the current solutions for the contract are UK designed and developed and will be manufactured in the UK. It is anticipated, therefore, that whichever company is successful in winning the contract, it will create and sustain jobs in the UK. The LPPV will have strong export potential. HMG will provide maximum support to any export campaigns.</p>

	<p pid="a.375W.5/1">Civil Service Live events are owned and managed by Dods (the publisher of Civil Service World). This year's event focused on efficiency and value for money. In its first year, 2008, the venue hire cost was &#163;211,588 including VAT. In 2009 and 2010 the venue hire costs were covered by Dods. The Cabinet Office does not, therefore, hold any information on the venue costs for these years. The Cabinet Office has never paid speakers to speak at the event. The Civil Service Live website is owned and maintained by Dods and there are no costs to the public purse.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.5/2">In terms of numbers of employees attending the event, the overall delegate numbers for Civil Service Live in 2008, 2009 and 2010 were approximately 6,000, 8,000 and 7,700 respectively. Delegate registration is managed centrally by Dods. The Cabinet Office does not keep a detailed record of every member of staff that attends.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.5/3">Civil Service Live is a cost-effective way for civil servants of all grades to share ideas about innovative ways of working that will help them achieve more for less. It is free for all civil servants to attend. There will have been some travel and subsistence costs for delegates, which will have followed the travel and subsistence guidelines set by the Department.</p>

	<p pid="a.406W.3/1">The Agency Workers Regulations were laid on the basis of the CBI-TUC agreement of May 2008, providing agency workers with a right to equal treatment after a 12-week qualifying period in a given job. However, other aspects of the directive are not subject to the qualifying period and give entitlements from day one of an assignment, including access to amenities or collective facilities such as canteens and access to information about job vacancies in the hirer. In addition, all agency workers already benefit from many of the same protections as permanent workers in the UK, including entitlement to be paid at least the national minimum wage, working time rights such as paid annual leave and a limit on the working week (unless they have signed an opt out) and protection under anti-discrimination law and health and safety rules.</p>

	<p pid="a.406W.6/1">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) allocates capital funding to those Further Education (FE) colleges that it funds directly on a formula basis. The amount awarded is based on the number of students on higher education courses at each institution. It does not fund specific projects, rather it is for each college subject to audit to decide how to deploy the resources they are given. This is the same basis as for higher education institutions. The tables give the amount of resource awarded to each directly funded college in the last five years. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.413W.2/1">The information requested on the Dudley North constituency and Dudley borough local authority area is not available. In the west midlands area the latest official statistics, covering the period from October 2009 to January 2010, show that 940 people were recorded as starting a temporary job funded by the future jobs fund at a cost of up to &#163;6,500 per placement. The young person's guarantee will be replaced next summer by a new work programme. This will offer better targeted and integrated employment support to people who find themselves out of work, including young people. Unlike the young person's guarantee, where young people are eligible if they are claiming jobseeker's allowance, the new work programme will provide help to the young people regardless of what benefit they are claiming and will support young people into sustainable employment.</p>

Where a customer is eligible for job interview-related expenses (through the Travel to Interview Scheme), we aim to reimburse payment within four weeks of the job interview, but this does depend, in part, on customers providing the required supporting information-i.e. original receipts/tickets for the expenses incurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.418W.5/5" class="indent">In terms of our performance, we do not routinely gather information on the time taken to process payments as this would be disproportionately expensive. However, I am keen to make sure people understand how quickly we aim to make payment and how to raise issues or concerns; and have asked that post interview arrangements be incorporated into Travel to Interview scheme information given to customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.418W.5/6" class="indent">In terms of personal adviser interviews people are asked to attend at a Jobcentre Plus office, these are nearly always timed to coincide with their jobsearch review appointments to ensure that no additional travel costs are incurred. However, where this is not possible or where a customer is asked to attend an office other than their normal office of attendance, and they incur additional travel expenses we will reimburse these costs at the start of the interview to allay any worry or uncertainty on the customer's part.</p>

	<p pid="a.423W.5/1">Winter fuel payments are made to most people who have reached women's state pension age, including those who are severely disabled. Older people are targeted because they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cold weather during the winter months.</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.5/2">Disability living allowance is specifically designed to help meet the extra costs of disability, including heating.</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.5/3">Based on the latest available caseload figures, the estimated annual cost increase in benefit expenditure were winter fuel payments to be extended to people receiving the higher rate mobility component or higher rate care component of disability living allowance would be approximately &#163;250 million for winter 2010-11 (in 2010-11 prices), based on a &#163;250 payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.5/4">This is an upper estimate for the cost of extending winter fuel payments to this group as it includes those customers who may be living in a household that already receives a winter fuel payment. It is not possible to identify disability living allowance customers who would not be entitled to a winter fuel payment because they are living in households that already receive a winter fuel payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.423W.5/5">Additional help is available to severely disabled people through the disability premiums that are included in income-related benefits, such as income support, council tax benefit, housing benefit and pension credit. A combination of these premiums and the support received through disability living allowance means that the most vulnerable people can receive up to an approximate &#163;8,000 per year in recognition of their extra costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.424W.5/1">In March, a DWP-led review of the work capability assessment found that generally it is accurately identifying individuals for the right support. The review also made a number of recommendations for improving the assessment, including simplifying the language, making greater provision for people awaiting or in between courses of chemotherapy and people with certain communication and mental health problems, and taking greater account of how an individual has adapted to their condition or disability. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-29">29 June</phrase>, we announced our intention to implement these recommendations, and we will now begin to revise the work capability assessment accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.424W.5/2">Additionally, we have a statutory commitment to arrange an independent review of the main elements of the work capability assessment every year for the first five years of operation. The review will be conducted by Professor Malcolm Harrington, acting as lead reviewer. Professor Harrington is a highly respected occupational physician and will be supported by a scrutiny group, who will review progress at intervals and peer review the final report. It is anticipated that a call for evidence will be made later this month.</p>

However, we recognise that there are links between poor mental health and difficult economic circumstances and, in the current climate, it is understandable that people might worry more about their finances and employment. Our confirmation of the final &#163;70 million instalment of growth funding from the current spending round for the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme is enabling primary care trusts to broaden the geographical coverage of services, meaning more people can get help, and to increase the range of therapies available, giving people more choice and access to the right psychological support.</p>

The data showed that, in 2008-09, across England 91% of statements where none of the statutory exceptions applied were completed within time and 82% of all statements, including ones where the statutory exceptions applied. The figures for North Yorkshire were 85% and 80% respectively. The data is available at the Department's website:</p>

It is the Government's ambition to improve the prestige of the profession so that it attracts the highest quality entrants and to base more initial teacher training in schools so that trainees spend as much time in the classroom as possible, learning from the best teachers. For example, the Secretary of State has already announced plans to expand the successful Teach First scheme so that more schools, including for the first time primary schools, may benefit from the talents of the country's best graduates.</p>

	<p pid="a.448W.0/2">While UKBA holds information on the number of grants, refusals and removals relating to specific areas we do not produce regular reports broken down in this manner. Therefore, to provide information for these areas would be at a disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.448W.0/5">It should be noted that whilst the data captures asylum applications processed within the North West, applicants may no longer reside in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.448W.0/6">The North West region is a processing centre for applications for indefinite leave to remain nationally whilst applications for temporary residence (leave to remain and further leave to remain) are processed nationally in the North East Yorkshire and Humber Region.
