	<p pid="b.475W.3/2">The security situation in Afghanistan remains stable if fragile in places. The Afghan army with the International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) continue to undertake operations to improve the security situation and extend the authority of the Government of Afghanistan across the country. The Taliban are not able to hold territory in the face of offensive action by Afghan and International Security Assistance Forces but they are able to threaten security in parts of eastern and southern Afghanistan by means of improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers and small-scale ambushes.</p>
	<p pid="b.475W.3/3">In Helmand, recent operations have expanded ISAF influence around Sangin and Gereshk, enabling increased development activities, such as work on the irrigation system in Sangin.</p>

For package 2 there is a significant affordability gap and work has been ongoing to develop a whole programme solution. The scale of the facility to be constructed at St. Athan will therefore depend on the outcome of this further work with Metrix. Our current forecast indicates that construction at the St. Athan site is planned to start after contract signature in late 2008, or early 2009, with the final phase of completion scheduled for 2013.</p>

	<p pid="b.480W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no plans to discuss the VAT treatment of tuition in sport with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. There is already a wide ranging exemption from VAT for education. This relief also covers most sports tuition in schools, and similar tuition by local authorities and charitable bodies that do not seek to make any profit from this activity.</p>

The research for this report was carried out some eighteen months ago since which time there has been significant progress in taking forward facilities and services for female prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="b.485W.5/2">Female prisoners were relocated during 2006 while their original accommodation was refurbished and in-cell sanitation provided. They have since re-occupied the fully refurbished modern accommodation in Ash House which is now among the best in the prison estate. This unit includes a wing for long-term and enhanced prisoners and a dedicated exercise yard. Plans are underway to extend the health care centre to provide a dedicated facility for females and to build a new female reception area including a dedicated video link and drug testing unit which should be available by the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.485W.5/3">The current facility has an increased capacity of 69 cells complete with in-cell sanitation and includes specialist safer cells, listener cells, mother and baby units and an enhanced regime unit. There are no immediate plans to provide additional capacity within the current unit as this meets the Service's on-going needs, with 48 cells occupied as of <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-16">16 July 2007</phrase>. In the longer term, NIPS is working towards the provision of more appropriate accommodation for female prisoners including a more discrete, self contained women's facility on the Hydebank Wood site, as recommended within the Human Rights Commission report. This provision, of course, is subject to the availability of funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.486W.2/1">Sentencing in individual cases is entirely a matter for the independent judiciary. We have however announced plans for changes to the statutory sentencing framework to introduce new public protection sentences for dangerous sexual and violent offenders. Under the proposals, dangerous sexual and violent offenders could receive extended public protection sentences whereby they could be detained in custody for the full term of their prison sentence. Those committing the most serious sexual and violent offences could receive indeterminate public protection sentences and could remain in prison for an indefinite period. I will be publishing draft legislative proposals shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.487W.6/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-19">19 July 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.6/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.6/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, if he will undertake an assessment of the recent effectiveness of the Child Support Agency's MPS' Hotline; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.6/5" class="indent">The MP Hotline was developed in response to requests from MP's who required faster responses on certain issues where a formal letter was not required. The system works well and feedback from MPs has been generally positive. However some issues have recently come to light as the Agency has rolled out its new complaints resolution process. Specifically, some MP Hotline telephone numbers have changed without the Agency alerting either MPs or its people to the new numbers. Also as the Agency has changed the complaints resolution process, in some cases those teams newly responsible for dealing with MP queries, have been unaware of the shorter timescales covering queries to the Hotline.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.6/6" class="indent">The Agency has now issued reminders to all involved on how queries to the Hotline should be dealt with and we have amended our internal directories to reflect the new numbers. In addition Lord McKenzie has recently written to all MP's informing them of the changes to the complaints resolution process, as well as the new MP Hotline numbers.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.6/7" class="indent">The Agency remains committed to providing a local and high quality service to all MP's as you work on your constituents' behalf to resolve issues that unfortunately arise on child support cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.6/8" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.490W.2/1">Poverty is a complex and multidimensional issue and there are many measures of poverty. Experts agree that it is very difficult to measure &quot;severe&quot; poverty. The measurement of low income we have adopted looks at a household living on less than 60 per cent. of median income, which is an internationally recognised method and the most commonly used globally. The Department also publishes the &quot;Households Below Average Income&quot; report, which presents information on potential living standards as determined by disposable income, measured at 50, 60 and 70 per cent. of median income.</p>

	<p pid="b.494W.6/1">As I mentioned in my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-09">9 July 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 1193-94W, from November 2007 new HGV and bus engines will be required to monitor their emission control systems and to limit engine power in the event of those emission control systems failing to operate. These provisions are essential to encourage operators to keep the emission control systems properly maintained and working, and so ensure that the intended reductions in emissions of Oxides of Nitrogen (NOX) from current and future standards are actually delivered in operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.494W.6/2">The provisions apply equally to all HGV and bus engines, whether they are using exhaust gas recirculation or selective catalytic reduction, but may be of particular relevance where selective catalytic reduction is being used and the effectiveness of the system could be compromised by a simple omission, on the part of the vehicle operator or driver, to top up the AdBlue reagent.</p>
	<p pid="b.494W.6/3">In the case of engines using selective catalytic reduction (SCR), a level indicator for the AdBlue reagent, incorporating a low level warning, will be required to be displayed on the dashboard near the fuel gauge, and the On Board Diagnostic system will be required to monitor the quality, as well as the presence, of the reagent. On Board Diagnostic systems are also required to monitor for failures which could lead to increased particulate emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.494W.6/4">Using an SCR equipped vehicle with an empty AdBlue tank would be an offence under regulation 61 a of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, as amended, in that it will lead to excess emissions which could have been avoided by routine maintenance.</p>

	<p pid="b.494W.9/2">An eligible pass holder will be able to travel for free at off-peak times on any registered local bus service anywhere in England from April next year. Eligible services are defined in the Travel Concessions (Eligible Services) Order 2002&mdash;a number of criteria have to be met in order for a service to be obliged to offer the statutory concession. An intercity coach service will be obliged to provide the national bus concession on any parts of their route that provides a local service and fulfils the criteria set out in the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.494W.9/3">It is likely that many long intercity coach services will not be covered by the national bus concession in their entirety as they will not be eligible services under the 2002 Order.</p>
	<p pid="b.494W.9/4">No assessment has been made of the abstraction of rail revenue to the intercity coach network following the introduction of national bus concession.</p>
	<p pid="b.494W.9/5">It will be for operators and local authorities to assess which services are covered in accordance with the criteria set out.</p>
	<p pid="b.494W.9/6">The Department is keeping the issue of eligible services under review. The definition can be changed by secondary legislation.</p>

	<p pid="b.495W.5/1">Following publication of the proposals for the Third Rail Package, the Government undertook a statutory public consultation to take into account the views of stakeholders which were integral to formulating the UK negotiating line. In accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines the Government produced an initial Regulatory Impact Assessment at the time of consultation in 2004 to assess the likely effects of the directive on the UK industry and users. This was continually updated to account for changes made to the proposal by the Council and European Parliament. A partial Regulatory Impact Assessment was submitted to the Scrutiny Committee of both Houses on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-14">14 January 2005</phrase>.</p>

Although this has to be formally adopted by both the European Parliament and the Council, there is a strong expectation both will vote to accept.

	<p pid="b.500W.5/1">The UK has been a leading actor in the substantial progress made by the international community to deliver debt relief. The multilateral debt relief initiative (MDRI) and the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative have already delivered irrevocable debt relief to 22 countries, releasing resources to fund country-owned strategies for poverty reduction. Key to sustaining these benefits is to ensure that developing countries' debt management is strengthened and that all creditors' lending is responsible.</p>
	<p pid="b.500W.5/2">This is why the UK has been leading efforts with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to get export credit agencies (ECAs) to agree firm guidelines on responsible lending to poor countries. In April this year we were successful in persuading OECD countries to extend the scope of the OECD statement of principles on unproductive expenditure beyond just heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) to also cover all IDA-only countries. As a result, at least 26 extra developing countries will now be covered by this agreement on responsible lending.</p>
	<p pid="b.500W.5/3">We are now taking this work forward with G8 partners, who share our commitment to ensuring responsible lending and borrowing. It is of course critical that all large official creditors, including those outside the G8, engage in this process. We will continue dialogue on this issue in the international fora in which we participate, including the OECD, the Paris Club and the G20.</p>

It is an industry-led initiative, fully endorsed by Government, which will run throughout the academic year, September 2007 to July 2008. DEFRA has contributed financial support amounting to &pound;130,000 to develop the programme. In addition, DEFRA has lent a member of staff to the Royal Agricultural Society of England (RASE) to work on the initiative.</p>

The need for greater co-ordination is a significant issue, leading to the recommendation for a pivotal role for Animal Health (formerly the State Veterinary Service). DEFRA accepts his recommendations and has considered how to act on them with Animal Health and Local Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory Services in particular. Animal Health is developing a lead role in co-ordinating Animal Health and Welfare delivery. At the same time, Animal Health is conducting, with local authority representatives, a review of the efficacy of the current delivery arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.513W.2/2">Remote sensing of fishing vessels is not a stand alone enforcement tool and must be used along side other resources like satellite monitoring records, aerial and surface surveillance means. It can nevertheless lead to increased effectiveness in the deployment of those resources and could be particularly useful in monitoring remote closed areas. This will however need to be considered on a case-by-case basis and only used, as the Council Regulation states, where there is clear evidence of a cost benefit in relation to the traditional control means in the detection of fishing vessels operating illegally.</p>

	<p pid="b.515W.6/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) contributes directly to the delivery of the UK's National Drugs Strategy by supporting efforts to disrupt the supply of illicit drugs to the UK. Preventing the importation of heroin from Afghanistan and cocaine from Latin America into the UK is a top priority for our international efforts. We engage with countries along the main trafficking routes from Afghanistan, especially Pakistan, Iran, Turkey and the Balkans, and Latin America, especially the Caribbean and West Africa, as well as with the producer countries. Our overseas posts provide the operational base for the Serious Organised Crime Agency's overseas work, which acts to support the law enforcement activity of partner agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.515W.6/2">The UK works closely with host Governments to support action to disrupt trafficking, seize consignments of illicit drugs, and their financial proceeds, and ensure effective prosecution of offenders. We help to build capacity amongst the region's law enforcement agencies and judiciary with the provision of legal drafting, law enforcement and prosecution training and equipment. We work closely with other partners including the EU and US to maximise effect.</p>
	<p pid="b.515W.6/3">The UK is working with the Afghan Government and the international community to bring about a sustainable reduction in the cultivation, production and trafficking of opium in Afghanistan. We are spending &pound;270 million over three years in support of the Afghan Government's National Drug Control Strategy and its four priorities&mdash;targeting the trafficker, strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods, reducing demand and developing state institutions. Some &pound;2.7 million of FCO funds has been allocated to Afghan regional capacity building since 2005, as well as bilateral funding for Pakistan and Iran of nearly &pound;1 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.515W.6/4">In addition &pound;6 million of Home Office funds is being spent on procurement of two helicopters for use by the Pakistan anti-narcotics force, as announced by my right hon.

	<p pid="b.515W.6/5">The UK also devotes considerable resources within the Latin American region to combat the trafficking of cocaine to the UK. Through its Global Opportunities Fund, the FCO has allocated &pound;1.7 million since 2005 to specific projects to support counter-narcotics efforts in the Latin American region. For the current financial year, a sum of &pound;647,000 has been allocated.</p>

Significant achievements include strong and influential relationships being built with key continental and national actors in the emerging African peace and security architecture. High quality training and other support is being provided to strengthen African capacity for peace support operations and to encourage the professionalism of African armed forces. Country programmes are making innovative contributions to peace-building and post conflict stabilisation work.</p>

	<p pid="b.517W.2/1">There are 230 Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) staff with an Arabic language qualification at various levels recorded on the FCO management information system. This is around 6 per cent. of the total number of diplomatic service staff. The figure does not include staff employed locally. Using success in the internal FCO Arabic exam at Operational or Extensive level as a measure of fluency, 70 staff acquired fluency in Arabic between 2000 and 2006. Other staff serving in Arabic-speaking posts will have retained fluency from previous use of the language. Five staff will complete Arabic Operational training in 2007 and a further 14 in 2008. We would expect the overall number of Arabic speakers in the diplomatic service to increase as we continue to train staff and target hard language skills, including Arabic, at recruitment and inward transfer. We will also be encouraging staff to return to the region to reuse existing language skills.</p>

	<p pid="b.533W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.533W.5/2">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.533W.5/3" class="italic"> Mediation</p>
	<p pid="b.533W.5/4">The Government believe that mediation can offer considerable advantages over going to court in the settling of family disputes, especially where children are involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.533W.5/5">A survey was carried out by the Office for National Statistics in 2002. The survey indicated parents who made their own arrangements for children following relationship breakdown were far more satisfied than when the courts ordered arrangements. The policy aim is to increase the proportion of parents making arrangement for themselves. Mediation is one way of helping these parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.533W.5/6">The provisions of the Children and Adoption Act 2006 will enable the court to direct parties in child contact disputes to attend a meeting about mediation. Referrals will also be encouraged through changes to court rules and forms, particularly in relation to disputes over children.</p>
	<p pid="b.533W.5/7">The National Audit Office Report on legal aid and family mediation published in March 2007 was supportive of family mediation and concluded mediation could resolve cases significantly more quickly and could also reduce legal aid costs. However, it did not include a specific evaluation of effects on children.</p>
	<p pid="b.533W.5/8" class="italic"> Courts</p>
	<p pid="b.533W.5/9">The Ministry of Justice (then DCA) has commissioned various pieces of research, which considered the effect on children in family disputes that have been resolved through the courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.533W.5/10">A report by Liz Trinder published in March 2006, evaluated the process and effectiveness of in-court conciliation in contact cases as well as the relative effectiveness of three different models of in-court conciliation. In-court conciliation is another way to help parents reach agreement themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.533W.5/11">In September 2006, the consultation paper on the Separate Representation of Children was published. The consultation considered how to provide better outcomes for children whose parents are separating and to safeguard their interests in section 8 Children Act 1989 proceedings when their parents have turned to the courts to decide where the child shall live, and who the child should see. It also considered the question of judges and magistrates speaking directly to children to help them obtain an informed picture of the case. The consultation ended on <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase> and a response is due to be published shortly.</p>

PCA data: Prescription information is taken from the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) system, supplied by the Prescription Pricing Division (PPD) of the Business Services Authority (BSA), and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispensed in the community, i.e. by community pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors, and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospitals, including mental health trusts, or private prescriptions.<br/> 2. Prescription items: Prescriptions are written on a prescription form. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item.<br/> 3. Exemption category estimates: The exemption data are identified from the box ticked on the back of the prescription form and rely on the form being completed correctly which may not always be the case. Information for categories that are not required to pay a charge (e.g. children) is based on a one in 20 sample of all exempt prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists, appliance contractors and dispensing doctors. The information we have is therefore an estimate and subject to sampling errors. Children are defined as 0 to 15-year-olds, and as 16 to 18-year-olds in full-time education.<br/> 4. Dispensing doctors: Data up to 2000 are not strictly comparable with data from later years. Up until September 2000 only patients having their prescriptions dispensed by the community pharmacists and appliance contractors were required to complete the back of the prescription form, but from October 2000 this requirement was extended to patients of dispensing doctors. Therefore data prior to October 2000 do not include prescriptions dispensed by dispensing doctors.<br/> 5. BNF classifications: The Prescription Cost Analysis system uses the therapeutic classifications defined in the British National Formulary (BNF). No information on why a drug is prescribed is available and since drugs can be prescribed to treat more than one condition it is impossible to separate the different conditions that a drug was prescribed for.</td> </tr>

It requires licensed electricity suppliers to source a specific and increasing percentage of their sales from renewable sources. Eligible renewable generators receive one Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) for each 1 MWh of electricity generated. However, to encourage more renewable generation from a wider range of sources, the Government are proposing to change the RO so that renewable technologies are awarded differentiated levels of support, for example, offshore wind could receive 1.5 ROCs/1 MWh and wave 2 ROCs/1 MWh. The Government are currently consulting on these proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.541W.8/2">This is a matter of concern across Europe. The European Commission has indicated that it will propose amending the Framework Decision on combating Terrorism to criminalise the incitement to terrorism and the intentional transmission of information useful to terrorism, such as bomb-making instructions. A conference was held by the European Commission in March to discuss these proposals, at which officials from the Home Office and Foreign and Commonwealth Office participated. Government officials continue to be engaged in discussions.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.8/3">There are provisions in the Terrorism Act 2006 to cover the hosting of websites which contain information on bomb-making. Under section 1, it is an offence to publish a statement that is likely to be understood as encouraging terrorism. Under section 2, it is an offence to disseminate a terrorist publication. These offences could cover the act of making available information on bomb-making on a website if the elements of the offences are satisfied.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.8/4">In addition, sections 3 and 4 of the Act establish an internet 'Notice and Takedown' procedure under which those such as content providers, editors and hosts of websites can be served with a notice requiring them to remove from public view or amend material which is considered to be unlawfully terrorism-related.</p>
	<p pid="b.541W.8/5">Where the position of those who host websites is concerned, the Electronic Commerce Directive (Terrorism Act 2006) Regulation 2007, which implements the Electronic Commerce Directive in relation to the Terrorism Act, provides that where a host has actual knowledge that it is hosting unlawful terrorism-related material and it has failed to take down the material expeditiously on acquiring such knowledge, it may be liable under the Terrorism Act.</p>

It will cover fixed and mobile operators, and pay TV services. Ofcom will look at the nature and level of charges levied by communications providers and how well signposted and transparent such charges are. It will investigate how far consumers are aware of additional charges, whether they are able and willing to shop around on the basis of core prices and additional charges rather than just core prices, and whether there are certain groups of consumers who are unable to do this and therefore may be disadvantaged.</p>
	<p pid="b.544W.2/3">On investigating this issue, it has become clear that it would be wrong to look at BT in isolation. More than 40 per cent. of homes are provided with telephony services by operators other than BT, and the differentials for payment by non-direct debit range from no extra charge to &pound;15 a quarter. Some providers provide no payment option other than direct debit.</p>

	<p pid="b.544W.6/2">Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) is an established technology that the police use to identify vehicles of interest through pattern recognition software. It is used to target terrorism, serious and organised crime, volume crime (such as burglary) and some vehicle documentation offences (for example, uninsured driving and road tax evasion). Police officers using the technology are achieving a significantly higher arrest rate and offences brought to justice rate when compared to conventional policing methods. The recent terrorist incidents in London and Glasgow demonstrated the usefulness of ANPR as an intelligence and analysis tool.</p>
	<p pid="b.544W.6/3">The Government have invested over &pound;32 million to support the deployment of ANPR for traffic and wider policing purposes. A number of other public organisations also use the technology, for example to support traffic management and congestion charging. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is in regular contact with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport on matters of shared interest, including roads policing and enforcement and the role of technology in this and wider security matters. We will ensure that any benefits to engage criminality that can be derived from the use of the ANPR network will be balanced against the need to safeguard human rights and the privacy of individuals.</p>

	<p pid="b.548W.5/13">These figures reflect the fact that the Building Safer Communities Fund and Anti-Social Behaviour Co-ordinators Grant was pooled within the Safer and Stronger Communities Fund in 2005-06 along with the Drugs Strategy Partnership Support Grant. This pooling was an initial step in the development of Local Area Agreements (LAAs) and saw partnership funding paid to Unitary and Upper Tier Authorities. Cumbria, an Upper Tier Authority, received funding that was originally allocated to Allerdale, Copeland, Barrow, Carlisle, Eden and South Lakeland CDRPs.</p>
	<p pid="b.548W.5/14">The 2007-08 figures are not directly comparable with previous years because the pooled budget now includes a larger number of funding streams. Cumbria county council and its partners are now able to use this grant flexibly to deliver a wide range of outcomes, including reductions in crime, anti social behaviour and the harms caused by drugs.</p>
	<p pid="b.548W.5/15">The figures exclude any funding allocated to the CDRP that has been targeted at specific initiatives, such as the Street Crime Initiative and the Tackling Violent Crime Programme, and any discretionary allocations made by the Regional Director. Data on those funding allocations are not held centrally, or would be available only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.566W.2/2">From the 2008/09 academic year, a 16-year-old who qualifies for an educational maintenance allowance will be guaranteed a minimum level of support if they go on to higher education. The guarantee will support aspiration and provide certainty about the financial support available to students to fulfil their potential. The estimated cost will be around &pound;15 million in 2010-11 in steady state.</p>

	<p pid="b.567W.2/1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) collects data on country of domicile of learners through the Individualised Learner Record (ILR). It is not possible to provide data on learners undertaking vocational training, particularly as a number of young people follow a mixed programme involving both vocational and general subjects. For funding purposes, the LSC regards as 'ordinarily resident' any person who habitually, normally and lawfully resides in the UK or European Union or the European economic area for the three years prior to the start of their course as 'home' learners. The LSC only funds provision for home learners if they satisfy the three years residency criteria. In 2005-06 there were 44,630 non-UK nationals who were learners on publicly funded further education (FE) provision and 2,230 on work based learning (WBL) programmes. Non-UK nationals accounted for 1.3 per cent. of all LSC funded FE provision and 0.4 per cent. of all WBL learners. The data for 2006-07 are not yet available.</p>

	<p pid="b.572W.5/2" class="indent">The LSC plans to start piloting family telephone advice through the existing CLS Direct telephone service in the autumn of 2007. This will enable clients seeking family advice to get information about mediation from trained operators.</p>
	<p pid="b.572W.5/3" class="indent">As a result of decisions taken in the light of the LSC's and the then Department for Constitutional Affairs' consultation &quot;Legal Aid Reform: Family and Family Mediation Fee Schemes&quot;, the decision as to whether domestic abuse is a bar to mediation will now sit with the mediator and not the solicitor.</p>
	<p pid="b.572W.5/4" class="indent">The new Family Fee Structure will also remove the financial disincentives for solicitors to make referrals to mediation, which has historically been an obstacle to increasing mediation referrals, a fact recognised by the mediation profession and in the NAO's report.</p>
	<p pid="b.572W.5/5" class="indent">The LSC will monitor the number of referrals made by individual firms to mediation. A report, due for implementation in October 2007, will extract information from LSC databases on the exemption from mediation reasons used by individual firms, and sanctions will be available if solicitors firms do not make appropriate and timely referrals.</p>
	<p pid="b.572W.5/6" class="indent">The LSC is currently developing a new supplier management system to replace existing systems. This will make it easier to track cases across different schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.576W.0/1">The Government considered the merits of installing seat belts in cellular vehicles in 2003. We concluded that the risk of prisoner self inflicted deaths outweighed the benefits of seat belts being installed compulsorily.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.0/2">Cellular vehicles operated by private contractors for the National Offender Management Service are not fitted with seat belts within the cells. Seat belts are fitted for prisoners in all 32 non-cellular vehicles operated by private contractors. Seat belts are fitted for prisoners in 31 cellular vehicles operated by HM Prison Service. These vehicles are primarily used to escort category A prisoners who have a higher level of supervision.</p>

	<p pid="b.576W.6/2">Research carried out in January 2007, calculated that the average distance from home for male prisoners is 50 miles and for women prisoners 55 miles (the women's estate is much smaller and more widespread). Considerable emphasis is placed on encouraging prisoners to maintain family ties. Governors are required to consider family contact issues, educational courses and treatment programmes before moving prisoners.</p>

	<p pid="b.598W.2/1">The Government's Renewed Alcohol Strategy, 'Safe, Sensible, Social&mdash;Next Steps in the National Alcohol Strategy' aims to focus future action on reducing the types of harm that are of most concern to the public, by creating an environment that actively promotes sensible drinking and increasing the public's awareness of the risks associated with excessive consumption and how to get help.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.2/2">The Government are aware that many adults of all ages do not realise their drinking patterns may be damaging their physical and mental health and may be causing substantial harm to others. A ground-breaking agreement between Government and the alcohol industry to place health information on alcohol product labels will help people to monitor their alcohol intake more easily. This will be supported by a sustained national communications campaign that will raise the public's knowledge of units of alcohol and ensure that everyone has the information they need to estimate how much they really do drink.</p>

	<p pid="b.598W.5/1">The Government's renewed alcohol strategy, 'Safe. Sensible. Social'. The next steps in the 'National Alcohol Strategy', emphasises the need to challenge the binge drinking culture. Sustained national campaigning will challenge public tolerance of drunkenness and drinking that causes harm to health.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.5/2">From 2008, national campaigning will raise the public's knowledge of units of alcohol, to ensure that everyone, women and men, has the information they need to assess how much they drink in relation to advice on sensible drinking.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.5/3">The Government are concerned that young people aged 16-24 years are significantly more likely than people in other age groups to have consumed more than twice the recommended sensible drinking limit.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.5/4">The Know Your Limits campaign, launched by the Government in October 2006, provides a range of advice to women on how to remain safe if they find themselves in vulnerable situations as a result of having consumed too much alcohol.

Neither can HES supply data that could be used to accurately assess the change in the number of alcohol related illnesses since 2004.

	<p pid="b.602W.3/1">Information is not available in the form requested. Information is available on the level of general dental care commissioned by primary care trusts (PCTs) and on the services provided. However, the two data returns cannot be directly compared.</p>
	<p pid="b.602W.3/2">The first data set shows (for a given month) the prospective annual level of services that have been commissioned as at that point. However, the annual services commissioned at a given point in time will not necessarily remain a reliable guide to the services due to be provided over the following 12 months, because levels of commissioning can change from month to month. For instance, the volume of services commissioned as at March 2007 is higher than the volume of services commissioned as at April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.602W.3/3">The second data set shows courses of treatment (and the corresponding units of dental activity) reported by dentists and processed by the NHS Business Services Authority up to the end of March 2007. This does not, however, represent the full-year data for 2006-07 because further courses of treatment carried out in 2006-07 were reported and processed during the first quarter of 2007-08. The full-year data are likely to be published in August.</p>

Information has been placed in the Library which shows the ratio of case assessments to case starts (i.e. the start of a course of treatment) notified to the Business Services Authority, Dental Services Division for the period April 2006 to March 2007 for national health service orthodontic services provided under primary care contracts. However, there are likely to be a number of potential reasons (i.e. not limited to decisions that a patient is not eligible for treatment) why a case assessment is not followed by a case start.</p>
	<p pid="b.620W.2/2">Under the dental reforms introduced in April 2006, all providers of primary care orthodontic services are required to use a well-established index of orthodontic treatment need to assess eligibility for NHS treatment. This provides a fairer and more consistent way of assessing clinical needs and ensuring that resources are deployed on treatments that bring genuine health gain. It is for primary care trusts to agree local clinical governance frameworks that cover what information providers of orthodontic services have to make available to demonstrate compliance with this and other contractual requirements.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-07-19b.148500.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-07-19b.622W.9" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" colnum="622W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070719/text/70719w0032.htm#0707207004098">
	<p pid="b.622W.9/1">The Department has run a number of advertising campaigns during the previous 12 months in the drive to improve public health. In some instances these are part of longer-term campaigns to address particular issues, e.g. smoking cessation, and some are tactical campaigns, e.g. flu immunisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/2">Where long-term campaigns are involved, evaluation techniques are used to measure current performance against pre-determined targets, and to benchmark against previous campaigns. By so doing the department can aim to improve the effectiveness of future campaigns. This is consistent with the recommended principles of the Engage planning framework, which is designed to improve the quality and effectiveness of government campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/3">Where campaigns have short-term tactical targets, evaluation is also specifically undertaken to ensure response levels are achieved through the most effective deployment of media, and once more to inform future planning for similar activities. Examples of these two campaign approaches follow.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/4">Depending on the nature of the task, the department uses appropriate industry-wide recognised measures to determine the success and cost effectiveness of the campaign. The Central Office of Information is often involved in the campaign development process and these measures are also used by them to measure campaign success levels. The measures chosen will include some of the following elements:</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/5" class="indent">spontaneous ad awareness;</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/6" class="indent">prompted ad awareness;</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/7" class="indent">spontaneous ad recall;</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/8" class="indent">prompted ad recall;</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/9" class="indent">logo/brand recognition;</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/10" class="indent">slogan recognition;</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/11" class="indent">ad recall (first mention);</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/12" class="indent">ad recall (all mentions);</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/13" class="indent">attitude shift (pre/post);</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/14" class="indent">attitude shift (regular tracking);</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/15" class="indent">specific policy/product detail recall;</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/16" class="indent">agreement with relevant statements (pre/post);</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/17" class="indent">response by channel (telephone, coupon, website);</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/18" class="indent">response by medium (TV, national press, etc);</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/19" class="indent">response for information;</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/20" class="indent">response to helpline;</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/21" class="indent">second stage response (e.g. fill in an application form);</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/22" class="indent">final stage response (e.g. receive benefit, give blood);</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/23" class="indent">tracking of response quality (from initial inquiry to final result);</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/24" class="indent">behavioural shift&mdash;immediate (e.g. join smoking cessation group); and</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/25" class="indent">behavioural shift&mdash;long term (e.g. give up smoking).</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/26">Example of long-term campaign evaluation</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/27">Using these measures, some of the top line results from recent tobacco campaigns since September 2006 are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/28" class="italic"> Motivations That Matter (September 2006)</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/29" class="indent">70 per cent. of 16-34 smoking men aware that impotence can be caused by smoking, (compared to 45 per cent. at start of campaign).</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/30" class="indent">41 per cent. of 16-34 smoking women said the ads made them more likely to quit.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/31" class="italic"> Hook/Send Off (January to March 2007)</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/32" class="indent">82 per cent. of smokers agreed that a smoker who smokes 5,000 cigarettes a year must be really addicted;</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/33" class="indent">76 per cent. of smokers agreed that the campaign was aimed at people like me;</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/34" class="indent">39 per cent. of smokers said 'Hook' made them think they should give up now; and</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/35" class="indent">23 per cent. of smokers said that TV advertising was a prompt for their most recent quit attempt (prompted).</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/36" class="italic"> Direct Response:</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/37">During the Hook/Send Off campaign 83,606 people phoned the NHS Smoking Helpline, 545,564 people visited the gosmokefree website and 195,000 people interacted with the interactive TV pages (total of 824,170 responses).</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/38" class="italic"> Secondhand Smoke (March 2007)</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/39" class="indent">42 per cent. of adults (48 per cent. of smokers) spontaneously recalled any element of the campaign (82 per cent. and 84 per cent. respectively for prompted awareness);</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/40" class="indent">88 per cent. of adults agreed second hand smoke can cause lung cancer in non-smokers post-campaign (78 per cent. pre-campaign);</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/41" class="indent">75 per cent. of adults agreed second hand smoke can cause heart disease in non-smokers post-campaign (70 per cent. pre-campaign); and</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/42" class="indent">50 per cent. agreed most of the smoke from a cigarette can't be seen or smelt post-campaign (27 per cent. pre-campaign).</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/43" class="italic"> Example of tactical campaign evaluation:</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/44">The flu immunisation communications campaign has been run annually since 2000. The advertising has been evaluated by pre and post campaigns surveys of the target audiences to measure changes in spontaneous and prompted recall and recognition of the advertising, propensity to get the jab, the relative cost effectiveness of the different media, take-up of campaign materials, and ultimately, take-up of the jab.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/45">In 2006 the research indicated that, compared to 2005, the advertising had achieved:</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/46" class="indent">similar levels of prompted recall and recognition among the at-risks groups;</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/47" class="indent">propensity to get the jab was also similar to 2005 among the total sample surveyed, and increased with the number of media recognised;</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/48" class="indent">among the over-65s there was some decline in spontaneous and prompted recall of any flu jab advertising, and in propensity to get the jab; and</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/49" class="indent">among the at-risk groups of all ages spontaneous recall of any flu jab advertising changed little, but there was a decline in prompted recall. Propensity to get the jab remained stable, and was slightly higher among those who had seen the campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/50">Take-up of the campaign materials by the national health service was 2.8 million items.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.9/51">The campaign contributed a take-up of the vaccine of 74 per cent. among the over-65s in 2006 (65.3 per cent. in 2000-01), towards the World Health Organization target of 75 per cent. by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.627W.2/1">The Talk to Frank helpline is run as part of a pooled service that includes Know the Score, Drinkline, Sexual Health Line and Hepatitis C Information Line. This allows for a more efficient and cost effective model that shares costs across the helplines. The overall cost for the pooled service in 2006-07 was &pound;1.45 million. Due to the shared nature of this service, it is impossible to give completely accurate cost for the Talk to Frank helpline alone. But based upon the split in number of calls, we estimate that the Talk to Frank helpline service would cost roughly &pound;800,000 of the &pound;1.5 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.639W.8/1">The Department has made no such assessment. Neither does it collect figures on the numbers of cases of plagiocephaly. However, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children has estimated that almost half of children develop positional plagiocephaly and that only a very small minority develop it in the womb. The rest develop positional plagiocephaly from spending a lot of time in one position, usually on their backs. Nevertheless, Doctors recommend that babies sleep on their backs in order to reduce the incidence of cot death.</p>
	<p pid="b.639W.8/2">There are several treatments for plagiocephaly available either on the national health service, or through parental intervention. However, since in the overwhelming majority of cases, the condition is self-correcting, many doctors do not deem additional treatment necessary.</p>

One of the aims of the reconfiguration programme 'Commissioning a Patient-led NHS', which was published in July 2005, was to improve relationships between healthcare and local authorities by bringing their boundaries closer together. Approximately 70 per cent. of the new primary care trusts (PCTs) are coterminous with the boundaries of local authorities with social services responsibilities. This compares with 44 per cent. of PCTs previously coterminous.</p>

All new medicines are now also required to have patient information leaflets which provide information on how to use the medicine, and on their side effects.</p>
	<p pid="b.644W.2/4">In January 2006 the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published a health technology appraisal of statins which found that they were both clinically and costs effective for prescription to people at a 20 per cent. ten-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease, as well as for patients with established disease.
