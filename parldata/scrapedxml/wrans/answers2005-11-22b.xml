	<p pid="b.1797W.3/1">Under the new arrangements for local commissioning of national health service dentistry from April 2006, units of dental activity (UDA) refer to courses of treatment that are weighted to reflect their relative complexity. The three main categories of courses of treatment correspond to the three bands in the proposed new patient charging system, which was published for three months consultation over the summer. The proposed weightings for different courses of treatments, that is the number of UDA to which they correspond, were set out in the draft general dental services (GDS) and personal dental services (PDS) contract regulations, which were published in August 2005. The final version of those proposed regulations will be laid before Parliament shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1797W.3/2">At the end of November, GDS dentists are due to receive information showing their level of activity, expressed in terms of UDA, during the reference period, <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase>, and their NHS earnings during the same period. Primary care trusts (PCTs) and dentists will use this as the basis for agreeing new annual contract values and the number of UDA that the dentist is expected to carry out over the course of the year in return for this annual contract value. GDS dentists will be guaranteed an annual contract value based on their reference period earnings, uplifted to reflect 2006&ndash;07 pay and prices, provided the dentists agree with their PCT an annual level of UDA to be carried out during 2006&ndash;07 equivalent to 95 per cent. of their activity during the reference period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1797W.3/3">PDS dentists are due to receive similar information from PCTs at the end of November. PDS dentists will be guaranteed an annual contract value worth at least that of their current PDS agreement, uplifted to 2006&ndash;07 pay and prices, in return for carrying out annually an appropriate level of UDA agreed with their PCT.</p>

The tariff will set the price for out-patient attendances and will exclude the additional cost of anti-TNF drugs, for which funding will continue to be negotiated locally.

	<p pid="b.1804W.0/2">The national service framework (NSF) for children, young people and maternity services, published in 2004, is a 10-year programme intended to stimulate long term and sustained improvement in children's health.</p>
	<p pid="b.1804W.0/3">Standard eight of the NSF relates to children who are disabled or who have complex needs. It requires that they receive co-ordinated, high-quality child and family-centred services that are based on assessed needs, which promote social inclusion and, where possible, which enable them and their families to live normal lives. Toward this end, the Department will shortly publish an exemplar on complex disability, which will be launched on <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase> at a conference to mark one year since the launch of the NSF. In addition, the Council for Disabled Children will be holding a workshop on <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase>, sponsored by the Department, which will look at what more central Government can do to help colleagues to implement standard eight.</p>
	<p pid="b.1804W.0/4">Exemplars are not standards against which to measure progress. Rather, they are illustrations of policy in the form of a description of a patient's journey.</p>

	<p pid="b.1806W.5/1">The issue of eating disorders among young people, especially young girls, is a serious problem. Anorexia in particular can have serious consequences for general health and has high rates of mortality.</p>
	<p pid="b.1806W.5/2">In January 2004, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published a guideline on the care of people with eating disorders. The guideline makes specific recommendations for the treatment of adolescents and young people in recognition of their unique needs. Some of the recommendations are:</p>
	<p pid="b.1806W.5/3" class="indent">Effective assessment of people with eating disorders, which includes co-ordination of care, the involvement of patients and their carers, providing good information, moral support and getting help early;</p>
	<p pid="b.1806W.5/4" class="indent">Involving family members, including siblings, in the treatment of children and adolescents with eating disorders. Interventions may include sharing of information, advice on behavioural management and facilitating communication;</p>
	<p pid="b.1806W.5/5" class="indent">Offering adolescents with bulimia cognitive behaviour therapy adapted as needed to suit their age, circumstances, level of development and including the family as appropriate; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1806W.5/6" class="indent">Young people are treated in age appropriate settings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1806W.5/7">While each patient will have their own individual needs, the guideline gives clear recommendations on the type of treatments that are available and sets out a structured pathway of care. NICE have also published information for the public that explains the guideline and sets out what people with eating disorders can expect from the national health service.</p>

	<p pid="b.1811W.2/1">The United Kingdom's stockpile of antivirals is intended primarily to treat all patients who develop influenza given a clinical attack rate of 25 per cent. The stockpile will be carefully managed to ensure that it is used for the 25 per cent. of the population who are expected to become ill. The use of antiviral medicines will be closely monitored from the outset. However, the clinical attack rate will depend on the nature of the virus. Should the attack rate prove higher than expected, or a pandemic strike before the stockpile is fully established, antivirals may need to be prioritised. The published antiviral strategy allows for prioritisation to treat those front line health staff at higher risk due to exposure and the groups identified as being in greatest clinical need. Further advice will be provided during the pandemic by the UK national influenza pandemic committee on the basis of emerging information.</p>

	<p pid="b.1811W.8/1">The base scenario in the United Kingdom influenza pandemic contingency plan assumes that 25 per cent. of the population would have clinical symptoms of pandemic 'flu. This is based on the best available evidence, including considerations of influenza pandemics in the 20th century and independent experts. However, there are many uncertainties and the number of people affected and the impact on the health care system will depend on the nature of the pandemic 'flu virus. That is why the plan outlines scenarios with different numbers of people affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1811W.8/2">The base scenario also considers that at least 0.37 per cent. of those ill will die from pandemic influenza or complications. This is based on the proportion seen in seasonal flu and the 1957 pandemic. Scenarios with a case fatality rate of up to 2.5 per cent. (greater than the pandemic of 1918&ndash;19) are also considered in the plan. Local planners are encouraged to consider the range of fatality rates when drawing up their local contingency plans.</p>

The proposal to purchase in advance the capacity needed to make pandemic flu vaccine will make sure that an effective vaccine is available for use in the United Kingdom as early as possible after a flu pandemic starts. The UK will need approximately 120 million doses to be available as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1812W.2/2">We are working closely with other countries, the World Health Organization, and the European Commission and are in regular dialogue with manufacturers to ensure that a vaccine can be developed as quickly as possible once a pandemic influenza strain emerges.

	<p pid="b.1812W.2/3">We are finalising a contract for the purchase of a two to three million doses of vaccine against the H5N1 strain currently circulating in South East Asia.

We hope to award this contract shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1815W.2/1">The NHS Prostate Cancer Programme, launched in September 2000, set out the Government's commitment to improve early detection of prostate cancer. The prostate cancer risk management programme (PCRMP) has been set up to ensure that all men considering a test for prostate cancer are given information on the benefits, limitations and risks associated with having a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test.</p>
	<p pid="b.1815W.2/2">Raising public awareness of prostate cancer is one of the key challenges for the future. We want men to know what their prostate is, what it does and what can go wrong with it. However we have to raise public awareness in a responsible way so as not to cause undue anxiety and worry. Thanks to the work of the prostate cancer advisory group we now have, for the first time, a definitive set of key messages for the general public about the prostate gland, including prostate cancer. The key messages have been agreed by 20 organisations, including charities, patient groups and professional bodies as well as the Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.1815W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="">31 October</phrase>, we announced a joint venture to pilot raising awareness of the prostate using the key messages in a primary care trust area. The effectiveness of the intervention will be fully evaluated, along with the impact on local health services. &pound;100,000 is being provided by the Government, with the remaining &pound;50,000 being provided by signatories to the prostate cancer charter for action. The pilot is due to begin in spring 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1815W.2/4">We have provided funding for the following organisations to increase public awareness of prostate cancer:</p>
	<p pid="b.1815W.2/5" class="indent">In 2003&ndash;04, we provided &pound;30,000 to the men's health forum to help fund their publication the Men and Cancer Manual&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="b.1815W.2/6" class="indent">We have provided &pound;135,000 to the Prostate Cancer Charity to increase available information about prostate cancer;</p>
	<p pid="b.1815W.2/7" class="indent">We are providing &pound;105,000 to the Prostate Cancer Charity to improve awareness of the risks and symptoms of prostate cancer in African and Afro-Caribbean men in Britain;</p>
	<p pid="b.1815W.2/8" class="indent">We have worked with the prostate cancer charter for action to develop UK Prostate Link, a unique information source for men with prostate cancer, their families and health professionals. UK Prostate Link was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-03">3 November 2005</phrase>, and is available at: <a href="http://prostate-link.org.uk/">http://prostate-link.org.uk/</a>. &pound;100,000 is being provided by the Government, with the remaining &pound;50,000 being provided by signatories to the prostate cancer charter for action.</p>
	<p pid="b.1815W.2/9">The number of PSA tests carried out each year is not collected centrally. However, research funded by the Department and carried out by the cancer screening evaluation unit, Institute of Cancer Research, has shown that the overall rate of PSA testing increased significantly from 1999 to 2002. The number of PSA requests submitted by participating laboratories rose by 42 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1819W.5/1">The Government have received no such representations from the BBC. However, the BBC, as television licensing authority, considers that the current definition of a television receiver in the licence fee regulations already extends to a PC that is used to watch television programme services over the internet, if they are received at the same time or virtually the same time as they are received elsewhere by conventional means.</p>
	<p pid="b.1819W.5/2">The Government have no plans for any changes to the current arrangements but, as indicated in the BBC Charter Review Green Paper published in March 2005, believes that changes to the existing funding model might have to be considered if in future large numbers of people are downloading audio-visual content from the internet and watching it on their computers or mobile phones, rather than using traditional TV services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1830W.2/23">We have been quite clear since launching our Olympic bid three years ago that Lottery proceeds would form a key part of the public funding package. We have allowed for up to &pound;1.5 billion to be raised in this way, some of which will be raised by new Lottery games solely for this purpose. We expect the non-Olympic good causes to receive up to 5 per cent. less in income, as a result of sales diversion, over the eight-year period from 2005 to 2013. In addition, up to &pound;410 million will be redirected from the proceeds of non-Olympic Lottery games after 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.1833W.3/1">The European Commission has acknowledged that the essential preconditions for lifting the EU export ban have been fulfilled. We are now awaiting proposals from the Commission for legislation to lift the ban. Such proposals would have to be submitted to EU Member States to consider in the Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH). If the Member States were to vote in favour of the proposals in SCoFCAH, they would be translated into all EU languages and presented to the College of Commissioners for formal adoption. We hope that these processes will be completed in early 2006, but this is a best case scenario.</p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.3/2">In the meantime we are consulting widely within the UK on the corresponding changes which will be required to domestic legislation. This should enable us to implement the necessary amendments as soon as possible when the EU legal processes are completed. This should enable beef exports from the UK to resume at the earliest opportunity. The consultation package is available on the DEFRA website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/bse-exports/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/bse-exports/index.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1842W.5/1">There is little robust data on the numbers of new entrants by type of farming.</p>
	<p pid="b.1842W.5/2">Figures from the June Agricultural and Horticultural Survey indicate the number of holdings in England by farm type in June each year. These figures show the net change in the number of holdings but it is difficult to infer specific information from the figures in terms of new entrants. Please see the following table.</p>
	<p pid="b.1842W.5/3">A recent source of information about new entrants to farming is the report into Entry to and Exit from Farming in the UK that was commissioned by DEFRA in 2003. This is available on the DEFRA website at <a href="http://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/reports/entrvexit/default.asp">http://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/reports/entrvexit/default.asp</a>. Among the more significant findings from this research were that the rate of entry into farming was lower than the rate of exit and that both the rate of entry and the rate of exit were lower than in other sectors. The research found that some 2 per cent. of farmers had entered the industry in the five years up to and including 2003, while up to 18 per cent. of farmers had retired over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1842W.5/4">Although the study did not look at rates of entry by farm type, there were indications from the research that the proportion of decision makers who have been farming for 20 years or less was highest in the poultry, horticulture and dairy sectors and lowest in the pig and cereals sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1842W.5/5">Broader information about new UK businesses in the agricultural sector registering for VAT is given in table 2. VAT registrations do not capture all start-up activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Only 1.8 million out of 4.3 million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2004. Therefore, although the figures show an overall decline in the numbers of businesses registering for VAT in the agricultural sector between 1997 and 2004, this does not necessarily mean that there was a decline in the numbers of new entrants over the same period.</p>

	<p pid="b.1845W.5/1">Our food security policy ensures consumers have access to a stable and adequate supply of food. Our domestic agriculture industry has an important contribution to make to the continuity of food supply by improving its ability to produce what the market requires. The reformed CAP, in breaking the link between subsidy and production, is encouraging farmers to produce what the market requires, rather than what subsidies dictate. Our farmers are well placed to produce foodstuffs that Europe's climate is suited to, but we cannot grow all the agricultural products our consumers might want to buy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1847W.3/1">The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 makes it a requirement that any bird listed on a Schedule to the Act that is kept in captivity must be ringed and registered with Defra. The list includes some, but not all, species of bird of prey that are likely to be used for hunting. The Act is a possession control, and does not regulate the purchase or sale of specimens. We request that registered keepers of birds notify the Department of the death or loss of a registered bird, but this is not a legal requirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1847W.3/2">The sale (or commercial use) of certain species of birds of prey is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), applied by EC Regulations, which requires the use of a certificate issued under Article 10 of Council Regulation. An individual or organisation which purchased or sold listed birds of prey without complying with the regulations would be committing an offence. However, the possession of such a certificate is sufficient. There is no requirement to register individual sales under that certificate with my Department.</p>

	<p pid="b.1852W.2/1">The main reason for the difference between institutional and market prices is the current system of national sugar quotas. The limitation of production by quota has produced a fragmented EU market which provides little incentive for competition between sugar processors in different member states. The EU Commission's proposals for reform of the sugar regime are expected to increase trade between member states and competition between beet processors and cane refiners. Further analysis of these issues is given in the Government's regulatory impact assessment of options for reform of the EU Sugar Regime.</p>

	<p pid="b.1853W.3/1">The Highways Agency carried out a Route Management Strategy, on the A19 in 2003 that included an assessment of accident rates and identified specific lengths of carriageway where there was an increased risk of personal injury accidents. While this road is better than the national average for 'A' roads in terms of personal injury accidents, a number of improvement schemes were carried out in 2003&ndash;04. These included improved lighting, road markings and safety fencing schemes. The Highways Agency will continue to monitor accident trends regularly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1853W.3/2">The strategy also identified a need to undertake a Central Reserve Gaps study that has been recently completed. Any high priority gap closure schemes identified in this study will be included in the Highways Agency forward programme of safety improvements subject to funds being available.</p>

	<p pid="b.1853W.6/2">The UK project The Potential for Renewable Energy Sources in Aviation&quot; produced by Imperial College Centre for Energy, Policy and Technology in 2003 for DTI, studied the options for potential renewable fuels for civil aviation. The study examined a whole range of alternative fuels and energy sources including bio-ethanol. Bio-ethanol was found to be inherently unsuitable as it does not contain sufficient energy for a jet fuel, in either mass or volume terms. The practical implications of these two factors are that aircraft range would be reduced compared to conventional fuels, and even if air-frames were redesigned with significantly larger fuel capacity, their take-off weight would be too high.</p>

	<p pid="b.1861W.0/5">Up-rating these figures using 2004 casualty data to 2004 prices gives average values for the prevention of accidents as <i>(a)</i> serious injury &pound;184,269 and slight injury &pound;18,496 and <i>(b)</i> fatal &pound;1,573,217. The average cost in 2004 prices of the lost output element of accident prevention costs were for fatal &pound;522,639, serious &pound;21,379 and slight &pound;2,550.

	<p pid="b.1863W.2/2">The starting point for the Highways Agency's service providers on the motorway and trunk road network is the Trunk Road Maintenance Manual, which gives advice on the method and timing of treatment to prevent ice forming and on dealing with snow. Service providers have the opportunity to use different methods and timings providing they can demonstrate an improved service to achieve the overall objective of keeping the roads free from ice and snow.</p>
	<p pid="b.1863W.2/3">For local roads, there is detailed advice on winter service in Section 13 of Well-Maintained Highways; Code of Practice for Highway Maintenance Management, published by the UK Roads Liaison Group in July this year. Among other things, this code advises authorities to formally approve, adopt, and publish, in consultation with users and key stakeholders, a Winter Service Operational Plan, based on the principles of the code. The Department of Transport strongly recommends the code to local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1864W.2/1">The objective of the national safety camera programme is to reduce excessive speeds, injuries arid crashes at camera sites. All cameras operating within the programme have been required to be highly visible and clearly signed since <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-01">1 June 2002</phrase>. No specific assessment has been made of the extent to which this change has contributed to the effectiveness of the programme. However the independent 3-year evaluation report of the programme covering all cameras operating between April 2000 to March 2003 concluded that there had been a 33 per cent. reduction in personal injury collisions and a 40 per cent. reduction in fatalities at camera sites Assessment of the programme over the period April 2000 to March 2004 will be contained in the 4-year evaluation report which will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1864W.8/6">The two evaluations of the national programme assessed the effectiveness of cameras using a statistical model, in which the effects of long-term trends and seasonal variations were among many different parameters. Full details of the modelling approach are included in the Appendices to these reports.</p>
	<p pid="b.1864W.8/7">In respect of the two year report, the statistical model shows that in Great Britain prior to the study period there was a national trend of over 4.5 per cent. per annum reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured (KSI) and a 0.75 per cent. per annum reduction in personal injury collisions (PIC). The assessment concluded that even after taking these national trends into account there was a 35 per cent. reduction in the number of KSIs and a 6 per cent. reduction in the number of PICs at camera sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.1864W.8/8">The statistical model also shows that the frequency of KSI casualties for the whole of Great Britain increases from quarter to quarter through the year, with those during the first quarter of each year (January to March) being about 10 per cent. less than that during the last quarter (October to December) of the same year. The model did not assess seasonal variations relating directly to the camera sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.1864W.8/9">In respect of the three year report, the statistical model shows that in Great Britain over the study period there was a national trend of a little over 4 per cent. per annum reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured (KSI) and a 1.5 per cent. per annum reduction in personal injury collisions (PIC). The assessment concluded that even after taking these national trends into account there was a 40 per cent. reduction in the number of KSIs and a 33 per cent. reduction in the number of PICs at camera sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.1864W.8/10">The statistical model also shows that in urban areas the frequency of KSI casualties for the whole of Great Britain increases from quarter to quarter through the year, and that rural areas have a peak in quarter three.

Speed cameras are installed by the local highway authority as the appropriate solution to a road casualty problem following their investigation of that problem. It is not possible to predict in advance where these road casualty problems may arise. Any speed cameras proposed as part of the national safety camera programme will need to meet the site selection rules that apply at the time before being considered for approval as part of the programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1865W.5/1">The Department receives occasional representation from road safety groups in support of reduced speed limits, including in villages and outside schools. No such representations have been received from the police at the national level, although we are aware that many police authorities support these measures at the local level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1865W.5/2">The Department has not undertaken specific assessment of the reduction of speed limits in villages and outside schools. However, research shows a clear link between reducing vehicle speed and accident reduction, with a 1 mph reduction in average speed expected to lower accident frequency by 5 per cent. It also shows that 20 mph zones and 20 mph speed limits can be effective at reducing collisions and injuries in the right situation, in particular when accompanied by traffic calming measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1865W.5/3">Local authorities already have the powers under section 84 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to introduce local speed limits, including 20 mph, if they believe it appropriate to do so. The Department encourages their implementation in areas where vulnerable road users are present, particularly around schools.</p>

It will replace existing programmes to: promote measures to combat direct or indirect discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation; promote gender equality; support analysis, research and cooperation between member states in employment and labour market matters; and encourage cooperation between member states to combat social exclusion. The new programme does not propose a range of specific projects, but rather provides a framework to support EU-level actions under the areas covered, such as developing statistical tools, sharing of best practice, awareness-raising campaigns and support for organisations operating in the relevant fields.</p>

	<p pid="b.1872W.0/1">The Government recognise the concerns of many pensioners, particularly those on low or fixed incomes, about council tax. This Government have already taken action to improve pensioner incomes, spending nearly &pound;11 billion extra on pensioners in 2005&ndash;06 compared to 1997 as a result of measures we have introduced since then. On average, after allowing for inflation, pensioner households are about &pound;1,500 better off this year than they would have been under the system which operated in 1997. The least well-off third of pensioner households are, on average, &pound;2,000 better off.</p>
	<p pid="b.1872W.0/2">Help with council tax bills is available for those who are least well off through council tax benefit (CTB). Nearly two and a half million people aged 60 or over now benefit, though the Government are concerned that many pensioners do not claim their entitlement. The Department for Work and Pensions is taking active measures to ensure that people are made aware of CTB and are encouraged to take up their entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1872W.0/3">The Government are providing additional money to pensioners specifically to help them pay their council tax bills. We gave &pound;100 to households with someone 70 or over in 2004&ndash;05. In 2005&ndash;06 households with someone aged 65 or over are receiving &pound;200, usually with their with winter fuel payment, unless they are receiving; the guarantee credit element of pension credit (people getting the guarantee credit element of pension credit are already entitled to up to a 100 per cent. rebate on their council tax bills). Households with someone aged 70 or over getting the guarantee credit element of pension credit are receiving &pound;50 to help with living costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1872W.0/4">While no decisions have been taken on capping in 2006&ndash;07 and beyond, we will not hesitate to use our capping powers to protect council taxpayers from excessive council tax rises in the future. In 2003&ndash;04, the last year in which capping was not undertaken, the average council tax increase in England was 12.9 per cent. This fell to 5.9 per cent. in 2004&ndash;05 and again to 4.1 per cent. in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="b.1872W.0/5">Sir Michael Lyons is currently conducting an Inquiry into the financing of local government in the context of its wider functions and future role. He is aware of the widespread concerns about how the current council tax system affects pensioners and others on low and fixed incomes. Sir Michael is due to report before the end of 2006 and the Government will carefully consider his recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1873W.5/1">Firefighters enjoy the same legal protection from violence as anyone else. The criminal law already contains a wide range of power to deal with violent behaviour. There is a hierarchy of offences against the person where injury results, ranging from grievous bodily harm through actual bodily harm to common law offences of assault and battery, depending on the injuries inflicted. Courts have the power to impose the appropriate sentence, taking into account all the circumstances of a particular case. It is to be expected that the Courts would regard attacks on emergency personnel in the execution of their duty as being particularly serious offences. Maximum penalties for offences of violence range from six months for common assault to life imprisonment for causing grievous bodily harm with intent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1877W.6/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) was created in May 2002. Since then (and indeed since 1997 as the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) and then the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR)) we have undertaken one piece of research specifically on unitaries as part of its annual Local and Regional Government Research Programme. This was commissioned from PricewaterhouseCoopers and sought to produce a financial model for the calculation of potential costs associated with the creation of unitary authorities in those regions where referendums for elected regional assemblies were due to be held. The model considered a limited range of well-defined costs&mdash;the 'costs of being in business'&mdash;and is available on the Boundary Committee for England website at <a href="http://www.boundarycommittee.org.uk">www.boundarycommittee.org.uk</a>.</p>

They also exclude national advertising, television, radio, response handing, magazines, education and citizenship, national events and exhibitions and Camouflage (Youth programme), which are funded centrally by Headquarters Recruiting Group, a part of the Army Training and Recruiting Agency.

	<p pid="b.1884W.5/1">The United Kingdom commitment to Operation Maturin has been both bilateral with Pakistan and through NATO. Bilaterally, the RAF have deployed three CH-47 Chinooks, which have flown and combined total of more than 200 flying hours and delivered nearly 900 tonnes of aid to date, comprising food, tents and blankets, but also tools, plastic sheeting, corrugated iron and baby care equipment. The breakdown of tonnage by individual items is not available. Up to <phrase class="date" code="">16 November</phrase>, they had also evacuated some 325 personnel, 32 of whom were casualties. The number of personnel involved in this deployment is 81 (77 deployed as part of the Support Helicopter Force and four medics).</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/2">A six-person Operational Liaison and Reconnaissance Team (ORLT) deployed to Islamabad on <phrase class="date" code="">19 October</phrase> to provide support to the UK operation. A two-man Mobile Air Operations Team deployed to Chaklala airbase, on the weekend of 29 and <phrase class="date" code="">30 October</phrase>, where they carried out a successful reconnaissance of a Forward Operating Base to the north of Islamabad. Four logistic planners deployed to Islamabad on <phrase class="date" code="">26 October</phrase> to assist the UN Joint Logistics Centre (UNJLC), where they are assisting in the development of a UN relief plan, including making more effective use of available aircraft. The MOD has also provided 23,000 vegetarian and halal ration packs, while a four person Joint Media Operations Team is providing coverage of the UK response and assisting NATO where possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/3">Four C-17 flights have provided strategic lift, including: the transportation of two civilian Puma helicopters to Pakistan on behalf of DfID and the International Committee of the Red Cross; the transportation of one CH-47 Chinook helicopter and its crew and equipment (two flights); and, on behalf of NATO, the transportation of a medical team of three accompanied by equipment and a Land Rover. Each flight required a crew often. A total of 57 passengers were transported. Details of the total tonnage carried on these flights is not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/4">The United Kingdom has contributed to the NATO relief effort in a number of ways. Four RAF C130 Hercules with six crews, and supporting Specialist Deployed Operating Base elements from RAF Lyneham, have been made available to NATO. Three have been deployed to Incirlik, Turkey to deliver aid via the NATO airbridge. One remains in the UK at 48 hours notice to deploy. As of <phrase class="date" code="">14 November</phrase>, they had carried out 30 flights, delivering 288 tonnes of aid (37 per cent. of the total moved by NATO), comprising tents, mattresses, stoves, blankets and medical items. The breakdown of tonnage by individual items is not available. The number of personnel involved in this deployment is currently 91 (84 in Incirlik, and seven in Baku, Azerbaijan).</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/5">A RAF Mobile Medical Team of four people (one GP, two Medical Technicians and one Environmental Health Technician) deployed to the region on <phrase class="date" code="">16 November</phrase>. One RAF officer is in Islamabad as part of NATO's own Operational Liaison Reconnaissance Team (OLRT). A seven person UK Liaison party from the UK Joint Force Air Component HQ has joined the French-led Joint Force Air Component HQ and are deployed in France and Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.5/6">In addition to our standing NATO commitments, a sub-unit 59 Independent Commando Squadron Royal Engineers, supported by personnel from 42 Commando Royal Marines, has been offered to NATO. If the offer of this capability is taken up it will comprise 86 personnel deploying to Pakistan.</p>

Most of these events were minor with no radiological consequences and in some cases were false alarms. Very rarely was radioactive material released to the environment or did people receive significant radiation doses.</p>

This reflected movements in the exchange rate of the US Dollar to the Pound and in the cost of living index comparing Washington with the UK. However Frais was underspent by &pound;29,000 the previous financial year and it was agreed that, that amount could be carried over to this financial year to be available for possible additional expenditure in respect of the EU and G8 presidencies, as well as the visit of Their Royal Highnesses The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. This expenditure will need to be accounted for in the usual way.</p>

	<p pid="b.1897W.2/2">In the light of concerns about the fairness of the trial proceedings that led to Craig Alden's conviction in 2002, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) offered Mr. Alden the services of a member of the FCO pro bono lawyers panel, Jeremy Richardson QC, to review the conduct of his case. The decision to offer Mr. Alden this assistance was made without prejudice to the fact that the Government, as in all cases of British Nationals subject to trial proceedings overseas, takes no position as to the guilt or innocence of the accused.</p>
	<p pid="b.1897W.2/3">Jeremy Richardson produced two reports on Mr. Alden's case. Mr. Richardson concluded that the trial proceedings in the case were flawed, and that this raised doubts about the fairness of Mr. Alden's conviction. The Government supported Mr. Alden's application to the Brazilian Government for Presidential Expulsion. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary wrote to the Brazilian Foreign Minister in March 2005, highlighting the concerns about the trial process raised in Mr. Richardson's reports. In August 2005, the Brazilian authorities informed British Embassy officials of their intention to reject Mr. Alden's request for Presidential Expulsion. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has recently received a formal written response from the Brazilian Foreign Minister confirming the rejection. My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the FCO raised that matter with the Brazillian ambassador on <phrase class="date" code="">16 November</phrase>. Mr. Alden has been on hunger strike since <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1897W.2/4">We have strongly urged Mr. Alden to reconsider this course of action. Consular officials are in regular contact. The British Embassy nurse visited him on <phrase class="date" code="">11 November</phrase> to assess his condition. We continue to make daily checks on Mr. Alden's health.</p>
	<p pid="b.1897W.2/5">Consular officials in London have regular contact with Mr. Alden's family and supporters, and met them most recently on <phrase class="date" code="">14 November</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1917W.8/1">Section 9 enables NASS support to be withdrawn from failed asylum seeking families who are failing without reasonable excuse to take reasonable steps to leave the UK voluntarily, or to place themselves in a position in which they can do so. A lengthy process has been developed which provides oral and written warnings that families' support may be withdrawn if they fail to take steps to leave. Whether support is actually withdrawn depends on the families' reactions, and it is not therefore possible to provide a realistic estimate of the number of families which might be affected by any national roll out of section 9.</p>

	<p pid="b.1918W.8/1">We have already made real progress in reducing the number of unfounded asylum applications. The monthly number of asylum applications have fallen by 75 per cent. between October 2002 and September 2005. This reduction follows the implementation of a range of legislative and operational measures designed to reduce the number of unfounded asylum applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.1918W.8/2">We have also dramatically reduced processing times. Around 80 per cent. of asylum claims now receive an initial decision within two months. At the same time the number of failed asylum seekers being removed from the UK has risen significantly. In 2004 over 1,000 asylum seekers were removed each month, compared with around 400 per month in 1996.</p>
	<p pid="b.1918W.8/3">In February 2005 we published our five-year strategy for asylum and immigration, Controlling our borders: Making migration work for Britain&quot;. The strategy set out a range of measures to strengthen our border controls and reform our asylum system. We expect that the deterrent effect of these measures will further reduce the number of unfounded asylum applications in the United Kingdom. The 'New Asylum Model' will introduce faster tightly-managed processes for all new asylum claimants, including: a new screening process for asylum applicants that enables us to put them through a processing track tailored to the characteristics of their claim; a clear contact management strategy for each processing track including compulsory contact management for those not detained; and the introduction of specialist case managers who will manage each asylum case from application right through to integration or removal. Measures to strengthen our border controls include; the roll-out of fingerprinting of all visa applicants; expanding the network of airline liaison officers who advise check-in staff on forged documents; introducing electronic checks on all those entering and leaving the country; and the roll-out of new technology, including the e-borders programme, to create a fully integrated system of immigration control.</p>

	<p pid="b.1922W.2/1">The Criminal Records Bureau's (CRB's) performance for standard disclosures has consistently exceeded the target of 93 per cent. issued within two weeks. This is because the processing of a standard disclosure is entirely within the direct control of the CRB.</p>
	<p pid="b.1922W.2/2">However, the performance for enhanced disclosures is currently below its target of processing 90 per cent. within four weeks. This is because enhanced disclosures involve an additional level of check by police forces and the CRB relies on forces to complete their checks efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="b.1922W.2/3">During the period October 2004 to September 2005, the average processing time for a CRB check was 26.09 days. The average processing time has been calculated to include time out with the customer. The maximum length of time taken to process a check during this period was 356 days.</p>
	<p pid="b.1922W.2/4">There are no data available to determine the average or maximum time taken to process a full POVA check or a POVA first check, because these figures are not collated centrally. However, during the aforementioned period, 95.1 per cent. of POVA first checks were completed within 48 hours and 97.5 per cent. were completed within 72 hours against service standards of 98 per cent. and 100 per cent. respectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.1924W.2/5">Between 1999&ndash;2000 and 2000&ndash;01 the definition covered current and former partners but did not include violence between family members over 18. The definition was:</p>

	<p pid="b.1927W.0/1">Forensic services called upon to assist terrorism investigations come from a number of organisations including specialist services provided by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory and the Forensic Science Service. These services have the capacity available to facilitate investigations of terrorist offences through the provision of a range of forensic services and techniques. These include the recovery and analysis of DNA, which can assist in the identification of offenders and victims, the analysis of explosives and the recovery of data from electronic devices. Resources are allocated by the organisations as needed, with priority given to terrorism investigations and prosecutions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1928W.3/1">The departmental report 2004&ndash;05 refers to the aim to increase the national sanction detection rate to bring more offences to justice in order to deliver the SR04 PSA3 aim of bringing 1.25 million offences to justice by 2007&ndash;08 (with an interim target of 1.15 million for 2005&ndash;06). It is estimated that to bring 1.25 million offences to justice by 2007&ndash;08 will require a sanction detection rate of 25 per cent, a figure which was included in the National Policing Plan 2005&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1928W.3/2">The Government acknowledge the need to improve sanction detection rates across all police forces. For that reason, a major drive has been under way since last summer with the aim of achieving a significant increase in sanction detection rates. This includes a range of operational improvements intended to build the investigative capability of the police service, together with some targeted support for forces with performance concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.1928W.3/3">Data for 2004&ndash;05 show that this concerted effort is leading to performance improvements, with the sanction detection rate increasing from 19 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04 to 21 per cent. in 2004&ndash;05. Provisional data for 2005&ndash;06 (unchecked management information) indicates that there have been continued improvements in sanction detection rates nationally, and that performance is currently ahead of the estimated required trajectory to achieve both the interim 2005&ndash;06 target and the PSA3 target in 2007&ndash;08.</p>

	<p pid="b.1937W.5/1">Section 71 of the Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended) requires public authorities, including the police, to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups. These requirements apply to police operations to enforce the Terrorism Acts, as well as their other activities. Furthermore, the Secretary of State has made the police and many other public bodies subject to a further specific duty to produce a race equality scheme setting out how they intend to meet their general statutory duty. The Commission for Racial Equality is responsible for enforcing the Race Relations Act and has produced statutory guidance for public authorities on how to comply with the statutory duties.</p>
	<p pid="b.1937W.5/2">The Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended) also requires all Government polices that are relevant to race equality to be fully impact assessed for any potential adverse impact on racial groups. Accordingly, a Race Equality Impact Assessment was carried out on the Prevention of Terrorism Bill in February 2005. This assessment laid out the procedures for monitoring the impact of the legislation. The Terrorism Act 2000 and Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 were introduced before this became a legal requirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1937W.5/3">Both the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 require the Secretary of State to lay reports before Parliament on the working of those Acts. The independent reviewer of both Acts, currently Lord Carlile of Berriew QC, is responsible for compiling these reports. His latest reports can be viewed on the Home Office website (<a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>).</p>

	<p pid="b.1943W.2/1">The Departments area guidelines are applicable to any school but are particularly aimed at new school buildings. The Department bases its allocations for specific central programmes such as Building Schools for the Future on these guidelines and so these allocations will be sufficient to enable kitchen and dining facilities to be included.</p>
	<p pid="b.1943W.2/2">It is not a legal requirement for a school to have a kitchen. Schools and local authorities are expected to provide nutritious and freshly prepared meals. It is the Government's view that this would ideally be from an on-site kitchen, but it can be achieved off-site if the appropriate arrangements are in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1943W.2/3">Over the current three years, 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06, the Department is providing direct capital grants to Northamptonshire schools of some &pound;32 million, also formulaic funding allocations of &pound;49 million. In addition, during this period, there was an allocation to the local authority of &pound;100 million in respect of a Private Finance Initiative, and nearly &pound;5 million in respect of the Targeted Capital Fund programme. It is for the local authority, acting in co-operation with Bridgewater primary school and other schools, to prioritise expenditure in accordance with asset management plans. This includes whether to invest in kitchens or other assets.</p>

	<p pid="b.1946W.5/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently reviewing the Mayor's powers and, in preparation for this, the Mayor submitted detailed proposals on subjects including skills to the Government on <phrase class="date" code="">20 July</phrase>. Further details about this are available on the GLA website at: <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/powers/index">www.london.gov.uk/mayor/powers/index</a>.jsp</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.5/3">The Government Office for London (GOL) works with key stakeholders to support the effective delivery of the Government's education and skills objectives in particular through ensuring proper linkage with regeneration policies and programmes. These stakeholders include the Learning and Skills Councils, local authorities, the London Development Agency, the voluntary and community sector and employer representatives. GOL also contracts with and funds the Connexions Service for young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.5/4">GOL is working with partners to improve educational achievement and attainment and also carrying forward work with the London Skills Commission to improve the skills and employability of Londoners through the implementation of the Framework for Regional Employment and Skills Action. Currently, a key responsibility is to ensure that the Government's Every Child Matters agenda is implemented effectively so that outcomes for London children are improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.5/5">Further information about GOL's role in Education and Skills can be found at <a href="http://www.gos.gov.uk/gol/Education_skills/">http://www.gos.gov.uk/gol/Education_skills/</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.5/6">Along with the other Regional Development Agencies, the London Development Agency's (LDA) responsibility for education and skills in the region is laid out in the 1998 RDA act as:</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.5/7" class="indent">(1) to promote employment in it's area</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.5/8" class="indent">(2) to enhance the development of and application of skills relevant to employment in its area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.5/9">To fulfill this role, the LDA acts to co-ordinate the activities of other education and labour market institutions to be in line with the regions economic development strategy&mdash;ensuring that the final outcomes of their interventions yield an increase in the employment rate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.5/10">To do this the LDA supports and shapes investments being made by the Learning and Skills Councils, Higher Education, Jobcentre Plus, European Funding, the Government Office for London, the local authorities and that delivered through charitable foundations (e.g. lottery).</p>
	<p pid="b.1946W.5/11">The LDA are funding approximately &pound;75 million of skills related activity this year, around &pound;16 million over the next three years directly on joining up activity (the 'London Regional Skills Programme') and a planned further &pound;40 million on supporting locally based skills initiatives ('Creating Opportunities Fund'). Much of the funds available for businesses and communities have attracted European additional money nearly doubling initial investment. The London Skills Commission 2005/06 action plan is designed to wrap round and shape the &pound;5 billion (approximately) that is invested in adult skills, education post-14 and business support in London each year, making it more fit for business needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1947W.2/1">The Department is aware that there is a gap between eligibility and take up of free school meals, and has funded research, commissioned by the Child Poverty Action Group, into the reasons children fail to take up their free school meal entitlement. The findings were published in a report entitled 'Improving the Take-Up of Free School Meals' in May 2001. The report showed that pupils and parents considered that the quality and choice of food on offer discouraged take up.</p>
	<p pid="b.1947W.2/2">In March 2005, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced a package of measures designed to improve significantly the quality of school meals, by, among other things introducing improved school meals standards and a 'toolkit' for parents to inform them how to work with their schools to improve school meal provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.1947W.2/3">Improving the quality of school meals may also improve the take-up of free school meals.</p>

	<p pid="b.1948W.5/1">The Department did not oppose the installation of fire sprinklers in Grace Academy, Chelmsley Wood.</p>
	<p pid="b.1948W.5/2">It is the Department's policy that each school plan, including that for Grace Academy, should be based on a fire risk assessment and where necessary incorporate the principles of fire engineering as an intrinsic part of its design. This is a statutory requirement of The Education (Independent School Standards) (England) Regulations, (2003) with which Academies, as independent schools, must comply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1948W.5/3">All schools, maintained or independent are designed in accordance with the highest industry specifications to meet the functional requirements of the Building Regulations on Fire Safety. Sprinkler systems are primarily incorporated for property protection whereas the Department's main concern is that</p>
	<p pid="b.1948W.5/4" class="indent">the safe escape of the occupants in case of fire is reasonably assured&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1948W.5/5">It is therefore felt that the use of automatic sprinkler systems is unnecessary. There is no requirement in The Building Regulations 2000 or the Education (Independent School Standards) (England) Regulations, (2003) for the installation of sprinklers to be included.</p>
	<p pid="b.1948W.5/6">The decision on whether or not to install a sprinkler system in Grace Academy rested upon the advice of the appointed independent fire consultant. The consultant's expert view was that a sprinkler system was not a requirement for life safety. Based on this advice Solihull metropolitan borough council's building control department accepted the project without a sprinkler system.</p>

In the first year, the scheme offers assessment opportunities in Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Punjabi, Spanish and Urdu. Additional languages will be available from autumn 2006 and are likely to include Arabic, Bengali, Irish, Gujarati, Hindi, Modern Greek, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Swedish, Tamil, Turkish, Welsh and Yoruba. The external assessment which learners can choose to take at the end of each stage of the scheme leads to an accredited qualification&mdash;Asset Languages offered by Cambridge Assessment&mdash;and attracts assessment and attainment points which contribute to a school's performance table.</p>
