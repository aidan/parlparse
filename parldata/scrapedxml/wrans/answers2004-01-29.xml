This yields a figure which is 4.4 per cent. for 2003&ndash;4 and falling in future years, against a planned 4.9 per cent. in 1996&ndash;97. We cannot yet compare final out-turns because figures are not yet available for this year but, based on previous years' experience, we would expect this year's out-turn to be lower than the 4.6 per cent. of total government spending out-turn figure for 1996&ndash;97.</p>

	<p pid=".451W.3/1">The White Paper, The Future of Air Transport, reflects the overarching perspective of the Northern Ireland administration on the key issues surrounding the development of air transport within the United Kingdom, as they affect Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland administration's input to the production of the White Paper reflected the cross-cutting and inter-departmental character of the issues previously consulted on during 2002. A senior official from the Northern Ireland Civil Service was a member, together with representatives from other regions and the Department for Transport, of the steering group that produced the White Paper. The implications of the White Paper for Northern Ireland's three commercial airports are currently being considered locally and in consultation with the Department for Transport within the 'balanced approach' of economic development, people's desire to travel, environmental impact, safety and security and the continuation of air services to the major London airports.</p>

	<p pid=".452W.3/1">New Targeting Social Need (TSN) is the Government's main policy for tackling poverty and social exclusion in Northern Ireland. New TSN aims to tackle poverty and social exclusion by targeting efforts and available resources within existing departmental programmes towards people, groups and areas in greatest social need.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.3/2">An independent external evaluation of New Targeting Social Need has now been completed. This assessed the way in which the policy had been implemented and examined its impact. The outcome of the evaluation will feed into future thinking on New TSN and will soon be the subject of public consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.3/3">Presently in Northern Ireland, the Government are placing significant emphasis on initiatives that are focused on the early years of life, such as the Sure Start and Book Start and the Pre-School Education Expansion Programme. These complement mainstream service programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.3/4">Alongside these initiatives the Government are developing long-term strategies dealing with child poverty. To this end the Children's and Young People's unit of The Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) is currently developing a 10-year strategy of which child poverty is one of the key themes. The focus of the strategy is poverty, participation, protection and provision. As part of the development of this strategy, a multi agency group in November 2003 produced a strategic objective and related measures and outcomes specifically tackling child poverty. The group also considered how to take this forward and how the Children's Strategy should dovetail with the wider New TSN strategy (current and future) for tackling poverty and social exclusion in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.3/5">A total of &pound;36 million has been made available through the Children's Executive Programme Fund with the specific aim of supporting children in need and young people at risk. &pound;17 million has already been allocated for projects involving children and young people in areas including health, education, play and working with children at risk.</p>
	<p pid=".452W.3/6">Recent research commissioned by OFMDFM entitled &quot;Low Income Households in Northern Ireland&quot; shows that the concentration (proportion of those in poverty who are children) of children in poverty between 1990&ndash;94 has dropped from 36 per cent. to 33 per cent. between 1999&ndash;2002.

	<p pid=".454W.2/1">From the latest monitoring of New Deal compliance, 91 per cent. of junior doctors (this includes Pre-Registration House Officers, Senior House Officers and Specialist Registrars) are already working and being trained in less than 56 hours per week and are thus meeting the requirements of the European Working Time Directive which will come into effect in August 2004. It is not possible, without disproportionate cost, to disaggregate the figures in the form requested.</p>

	<p pid=".461W.5/1">In Newtownards there are currently 234 pre-school places in statutory nurseries and 136 in settings in the voluntary and private sector. Of these, 52 statutory places and all of the voluntary and private places were created by the Pre-school Education Expansion Programme. The planning of pre-school provision and the allocation of voluntary/private sector places is a matter for each Board's Pre-School Education Advisory Group (PEAG), which identifies shortfalls in funded pre-school provision at local area level. The intention was that new places created under the programme for Northern Ireland as a whole would be broadly on a 50:50 basis between the statutory and voluntary/private sectors, though at local level the ratio varies considerably, depending mainly on the level of provision prior to the programme. In Newtownards, most of the statutory provision pre-dated the expansion programme.</p>
	<p pid=".461W.5/2">The number of pre-school places which the South Eastern Education and Library Board's PEAG is funding in Newtownards is already sufficient to satisfy the demand from the parents of children in their immediate pre-school year. It is not necessary, therefore, for the PEAG to introduce additional providers such as the playschool at Londonderry Primary school.</p>

	<p pid=".462W.11/1">In June 2003 the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety set up a Northern Ireland SARS Taskforce charged, inter alia, with preparing a contingency Plan for SARS in Northern Ireland. This in turn led to the establishment of eight sub-groups drawn from the HPSS to take forward various aspects of SARS preparation and these groups reported to a Conference in Belfast on <phrase class="date" code="">8 December</phrase> at which the Contingency Plan was also launched. A tabletop exercise, to test the Plan, was held the following day and the lessons learned from that will be incorporated into the Plan at the next reprint.</p>
	<p pid=".462W.11/2">The Contingency Plan includes arrangements for any one (or all) of three acute hospitals to be designated to deal with SARS patients. Plans for upgrading work at these, and other hospitals with A&amp;E Departments, are in preparation, while steps to provide personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care workers, including GPs, in contact with suspected SARS cases are also well advanced. A training package video/CD Rom covering a number of issues including infection control and the use of PPE has also been prepared for distribution to the service.</p>

	<p pid=".466W.3/1">The Department's annual influenza immunisation campaign is the main element of its programme to minimise any winter influenza outbreak. There are two main groups involved in the campaign: everyone over 65 and those under 65 who are considered to be at risk because of an underlying medical condition such as asthma, diabetes, a heart condition etc. The Department has proactively promoted immunisation this year with a particular focus on those 'at risk', including children. Figures on vaccination uptake to the end of November show that the campaign is ahead of the targets set for this year.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.3/2">This year also the Department has regularly reminded the public of measures to protect themselves from influenza and of the steps to take to look after themselves should they develop it.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.3/3">The Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) at Belfast City Hospital monitors the incidence of influenza through a network of spotter practices and provides information directly to the Department. The assessment provided by CDSC in the middle of January 2004 is that influenza is circulating at very low levels in Northern Ireland. Boards and Trusts all have plans in place to deal with upsurges in the numbers of cases of flu, should this occur.</p>
	<p pid=".466W.3/4">In 2003 the Department secured a small supply of a new anti-viral drug called Oseltamivir which can be administered, in the event of a serious outbreak, to patients and staff in nursing homes, residential homes and hospitals to prevent them catching the flu.</p>

	<p pid=".467W.3/3">The Rural Policing Fund was introduced during 2000&ndash;01, when a specific grant of &pound;15million was made available for policing in more rural areas, without reducing grant to the predominantly urban forces. &pound;30 million has subsequently been made available annually to the 31 forces with the most widespread populations. The Fund has always been distributed according to the relative average sparsity of population.</p>

	<p pid=".470W.10/2">The number of cancers in England, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, increased by 6.9 per cent. between 1995 and 2000. This is mostly accounted for by increases in breast cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, bowel cancer, melanoma, mesothelioma and lymphomas. However, this should be balanced against significant decreases in the numbers of lung, stomach and cervical cancers.</p>
	<p pid=".470W.10/3">There are many reasons for the changes in incidence of these cancers.</p>
	<p pid=".470W.10/4">The increased incidence of breast cancer can be attributed not only to the success of the national breast screening programme in identifying new cases, but also changes in factors that affect a woman's hormonal environment, such as obesity, use of hormone replacement therapy and differing patterns of child birth. The increase in reporting of prostate cancer is primarily due to the greater use of prostate specific antigen testing. Increased incidence of melanoma is due to greater over-exposure to sunlight. The increased number of bowel cancer cases is partly due to diet and lack of physical activity. For mesothelioma, the increase is due to the increased numbers of people exposed to asbestos in the 1960s and 1970s who, because of the long latency period of the disease, are only now developing this condition. The reasons for increased cases of testicular cancer and lymphomas are unclear.</p>
	<p pid=".470W.10/5">The decrease in lung cancer incidence is due to reduced rates of smoking in men over the last two decades. The reduction in stomach cancer is primarily thought to be due to changes in diet. The reduction in the number of cases of cervical cancer is almost certainly due to the national screening programme identifying abnormalities which, left untreated, would later become cancerous.</p>

	<p pid=".472W.14/1">The Government have no plans to introduce a new definition of dual diagnosis into statute. Under the draft Mental Health Bill it is proposed that there will be a single definition of mental disorder with no exceptions or exclusions, so that people can be treated according to their individual needs.</p>
	<p pid=".472W.14/2">Under the current Mental Health Act 1983 a person cannot be treated as being mentally disordered (for the purposes of the Act) solely on the ground that he is dependent on alcohol or drugs, there must be dual diagnosis of a mental illness. We believe that, in practice, these exemptions have been misunderstood and misapplied. This has meant that some people have not received the compulsory treatment which they need to prevent them from harming themselves or others.</p>
	<p pid=".472W.14/3">The intention of proposals in the draft Mental Health Bill is that strict conditions will ensure the powers are only used where the nature or degree of mental disorder requires treatment under the care of a mental health consultant; appropriate treatment is available for the individual patient and there is a risk to self or others that warrants such treatment. This will mean that there is no artificial barrier to people being treated under compulsory powers when this is necessary because the conditions in the Bill are satisfied.</p>
	<p pid=".472W.14/4">In May 2002 the Department of Health published Dual Diagnosis Good Practice Guide. The guide reaffirms dual diagnosis as a priority for mainstream mental health services and emphasises the need for them to work in partnership with other agencies, such as substance misuse services and drug action teams.</p>

This was an average increase of 17.40 per cent., on the previous year. The National Treatment Agency (NTA) has responsibility for monitoring the spend of this resource.</p>

	<p pid=".483W.2/1">Transmission of infection between infectious females and their offspring is thought to be an important process in the dynamics of TB in badger populations. The Central Science Laboratory's Woodchester Park study has shown that there is a significant statistical relationship between the number of infected cubs in a social group and the presence of an infectious female. However, no assessment has been made of the proportion of cubs born to infectious females which themselves go on to become infectious.</p>

	<p pid=".484W.5/1">Bovine TB is a regional problem with a higher incidence of disease in the South West of Great Britain and in Northern Ireland. Defra publishes the incidence of TB in Great Britain on a regional basis, to demonstrate the regional distribution of incidents. The OIE requires a composite annual report for the whole of the United Kingdom. The composite report indicates the average incidence of TB in the UK; but does not demonstrate the localised incidence within the regions. The composite report which is provided each year, as required for the OIE, is derived by amalgamating the regional reports for GB and Northern Ireland, therefore there would be no cost benefit in providing only a UK report and the true regional incidence of the disease would remain unclear.</p>

	<p pid=".485W.6/29">Figures less than five have been suppressed for reasons of confidentiality. Statistics on the disability profile of the civil service as a whole from April 2003 show that 3.6 per cent. of the civil service overall had a declared disability (1.7 per cent. in the SCS). Corporate data on disability by disability type is not published. Further data can be found on <a href="http://www.civil-service.gov.uk/statistics">www.civil-service.gov.uk/statistics</a>. The civil service anonymous Diversity Survey (2001) showed that 15 per cent. of respondents were declaring a disability or long-standing illness against a declared level of 4 per cent. staff with a disability. This could show that disabled staff are more likely to take part in the survey, or that many people who consider themselves to be disabled or have a long standing illness have not declared this to their employer. This level of disability is consistent with the Spring 2003 Labour Force Survey which reported a level of 12.9 per cent. disability in the economically active population.</p>

	<p pid=".486W.2/1">The CAP reform agreement will substantially reduce trade distorting support as a result of the decoupling of direct payments. There is a degree of national discretion over the extent of decoupling but we anticipate that EU Blue Box support (defined as subsidies deemed less trade-distorting because they are linked to production-limiting programmes such as set-aside, e.g. arable area and livestock headage payments) will fall by at least two-thirds. Amber box support (defined as subsidies which significantly distort trade, e.g. support prices) is estimated to fall by a modest amount due to reductions in support prices and declines in production as a result of decoupling. However, amber box subsidies have already been falling substantially due to the previous Agenda 2000 reforms.</p>
	<p pid=".486W.2/2">Both decoupling and reductions in support prices will reduce export subsidies, but the precise impact will depend on future conditions on world markets and on the exchange rate.</p>

	<p pid=".486W.5/1">The Government understand the problems that low farmgate prices for milk have caused farmers in Lancashire and in the rest of the UK, and the challenges the dairy sector will face adjusting to the new conditions that will be created by a reformed CAP. While the Government recognise these difficulties, they also believes that the UK dairy sector has a sustainable future and, in line with their &quot;Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food&quot;, will work alongside the industry to facilitate and support its development. The UK has a comparative advantage in terms of climate, farm efficiency and size over many of its competitors. If the dairy supply chain can work together to maximise this potential and address some of the difficulties it faces, then there is no reason why it should not succeed.</p>

	<p pid=".488W.0/1">The Government are committed to help develop a farming industry which is environmentally, socially and economically sustainable. The Government's Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food (SFFS), published in December 2002 sets out how the Government will work with the whole of the food chain to secure a sustainable future for English farming and food industries, as viable industries contributing to a better environment and healthy and prosperous communities.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.0/2">One of the strategy's key aims is to protect the environment and reward farmers for providing environmental goods. Last year's agreement on CAP reform will help further this objective by removing an incentive to overproduce. In addition, the cross compliance measures to be introduced as part of the agreement will help farmers to reduce damaging environmental impacts by making farm subsidies dependent on meeting good agricultural and environmental conditions. The CAP reform deal also provided for the switching of support from production subsidies to environmental and rural development schemes. In England, we have been running a pilot Entry Level Scheme designed to link key elements of good environmental management across a wider area than the current schemes. Provided that the pilot is successful, the scheme will be made available across England during 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.0/3">Defra is also carrying out a strategic review of options to reduce diffuse water pollution from agriculture, and will be consulting further on this in the near future.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.0/4">The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000) provides protection for wildlife and their habitats and sets out comprehensive statutory protection for all species and habitats. All wild birds are afforded statutory protection under the 1981 Act, which fulfils our obligations under the EC Wild Birds Directive. Certain animals and plants are also protected under the 1981 Act. In addition to the protection given to certain animals by the 1981 Act, further protection is also granted to certain species via the Habitats Regulations 1994.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.0/5">Furthermore, England's Biodiversity Strategy builds on the foundations already laid in conserving habitats and species and aims to go further by ensuring that the implications for wildlife as a whole are considered an integral part of agriculture policy. The strategy encourages the management of farming and agricultural land so as to conserve and enhance biodiversity as part of SFFS.</p>
	<p pid=".488W.0/6">Also as part of the SFFS, an outline Animal Health and Welfare Strategy for Great Britain was published for consultation in July 2003. The strategy sets out the direction for animal health and welfare related policy over the next 10 years. It aims to improve the health and welfare of kept animal, and protect public health from animal disease. The strategy is underpinned by the principle of partnership between government and all those involved in and affected by animal health and welfare. It sets out the factors that will help inform Government decisions and the rationale for Government intervention in animal health and welfare including the need to protect and promote the welfare of animals.</p>

	<p pid=".489W.2/1">In 2003 fishing vessels using single trawl gears caught a much wider range of species than those using pair trawl gears. While both single and pair trawlers caught predominantly more pelagic species, a greater proportion of landings by pair trawlers comprised pelagic species than by single trawlers.</p>
	<p pid=".489W.2/2">Information on fish sizes is collected for marketing purposes. However since this is recorded as size bands which differ between species, and because the grading of fish is often not recorded, it is not possible given the data available to determine how the size of fish caught differs between the two fishing methods.</p>

	<p pid=".490W.5/1">A considerable amount of work is going on in Defra to improve our IT facilities and systems. We are also seeking to improve usage and exploitation of the capacity of the Department's systems in the interests of efficiency and service delivery. It is against that background that the variety of audit mechanisms need to be understood. They are:</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/2" class="italic">1. Departmental audit:</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/3" class="indent">The IT Audit Branch of the Department's own Internal Audit Division conducts a continuous programme of audit assignments (approximately 15&ndash;20 per year) in order to provide an assurance concerning the management of our IT systems' (hardware and software) lifecycle&mdash;specification, procurement, development, implementation, operations and decommissioning. The scope of audit assignments included in the programme is determined using a risk-based approach and ranges from in-depth examination of single projects or operational systems, to &quot;horizontal&quot; reviews of management processes which can be expected to apply reasonably consistently across projects or systems&mdash;for example, software licensing, infrastructure change management, IT governance.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/4" class="indent">Internal audits contribute to an assurance that hardware and software products are being used properly within the Department, in the sense that projects/systems contribute effectively and efficiently to the achievement of Departmental objectives, are compliant with legal and regulatory requirements, apply mandated or claimed standards and acknowledged best practice, and are appropriately economical in the use of funds and other resources.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/5" class="indent">The Department's Security Branch conducts a rolling programme of IT security audits focusing on compliance with Departmental IT Security policies throughout the Defra estate. It also co-ordinates the implementation of BS7799&mdash;the British Standard for the Management of Information Security. Internal Audit Division is responsible for independent review of achievement of compliance with this standard.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/6" class="italic">2. Other internal tools and mechanisms:</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/7" class="indent">There are IT-supported administrative systems in place to assist with the identification and management of IT assets (hardware and software).</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/8" class="indent">A fixed asset inventory is maintained on the Department's Resource Accounting and Management Information System (RAMIS) and holds details of fixed assets valued at &pound;2,000 or more, including IT assets.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/9" class="indent">The e-Business Directorate holds information about the software installed on our Office Systems network as well as about major server and application development software, and ensures that the correct number of software licences is held. An IT inventory management application is used to identify hardware on Defra's Local Area Networks.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/10" class="indent">&quot;Audit Logs&quot; recording information concerning users' access to and activity on the Department's IT systems are automatically specified and implemented for all significant IT systems. These are generally for the benefit of system owners in day-to-day management of the system, but may sometimes be used by Internal Audit to examine for signs of improper use of the systems.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/11" class="italic">3. External audit bodies and mechanisms:</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/12" class="indent">External audit bodies which may examine IT management functions include reviews by NAO, and by EU Audit (where the system/function in question is involved in administration of EU-funded schemes). As with internal audit, external audits of administrative functions may also touch upon IT management issues and may prompt internal audit follow up.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/13" class="indent">All new major IT-enabled business change programmes within Defra are subject to OGC Gateway Reviews and Health Checks, which examine and report on the management of Programmes, and can also be regarded as a form of external audit.</p>

	<p pid=".493W.0/1">The Government have set statutory performance standards for local authorities in 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06 for the recycling and composting of household waste. The targets are based on the amount of household waste recycled and composted in 1998&ndash;99 and require each authority, on average, to double its recycling and composting rate by 2003&ndash;04, and triple it by 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".493W.0/2">Local authorities are not required by law to collect commercial and industrial waste but can do so if asked to by an occupier of premises in their area. The occupier is required to pay the local authority for this service. There is no obligation placed upon local authorities to recycle this waste and, if they do, it will not contribute to their statutory performance standards, which only cover household waste.</p>
	<p pid=".493W.0/3">Commercial and industrial waste collected by local authorities does, however, fall within the definition of municipal waste and is therefore subject to the Landfill Directive requirements to reduce biodegradable municipal waste going to landfill. All waste disposed of in landfill site is also subject to the Landfill Tax. Both the announced increases in the Landfill Tax to raise it to &pound;35 a tonne in the medium to long-term and the introduction of the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme from 2005, to implement the Landfill Directive requirements, will encourage more recycling.</p>

	<p pid=".495W.0/2">We shall bring legislation into force on <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2006</phrase> under the Employment Directive outlawing age discrimination in employment and vocational training. Such legislation will improve the work opportunities of older people from all groups. Our consultation on proposals for this legislation ended in October 2003. We shall consult on draft regulations later this year. People who experience discrimination on other grounds will continue to be protected under the relevant current discrimination legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".495W.0/3">In the meantime the Government encourages employers, through the Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment, and the Age Positive campaign, to adopt non-ageist approaches to recruitment, selection, training and development, promotion, redundancy and retirement.</p>

Night Vision Goggles (NVG) can, in certain circumstances, enhance these capabilities. However, NVG can be operated only in aircraft that have been specifically modified for this role and from compatible ships. Naval helicopters are fitted to allow operation with NVG according to their tactical role in operations. The operational role for the helicopters of 849 Naval Air Squadron involved in Operation Telic did not require the modifications to the helicopters that are necessary for the provision of NVG. We are currently considering whether to adopt as policy a fleet-wide NVG capability.</p>

The report notes that although the EU has made some progress in job creation, market liberalisation and creation of a knowledge-based economy, there remains considerable work to be done if the EU is to meet its 2010 goal of becoming the most dynamic economy in the world. The Commission notes that the 2005 mid-term employment targets are likely lo be missed and it therefore urges member states to reinvigorate their commitment to the Lisbon reform agenda.

	<p pid=".512W.7/1">I wrote to Oxfam, Amnesty International and the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA) on <phrase class="date" code="">18 October</phrase>, welcoming the launch of the Arms Trade Treaty as a useful contribution to the international debate on arms issues. The UK supports the goal of an international instrument on arms transfers, although to be effective any such measure would have to enjoy the support of all major arms exporting countries.</p>
	<p pid=".512W.7/2">The UK Government are working to promote tougher controls on arms exports at an international level. In January 2003, DFID, FCO and MOD hosted a conference at Lancaster House on strengthening international controls on arms exports. The UK organised a meeting during the July UN Biennial Meeting of States on Small Arms, which sought to follow up on the Lancaster House conference.</p>
	<p pid=".512W.7/3">These consultations suggest that there are many areas of common ground and significant political will among States. They also demonstrate that more needs to be done before we can secure a universal commitment to strengthening export controls.</p>
	<p pid=".512W.7/4">In the next two years the UK will continue to call for international controls and support a series of regional meetings, to build consensus on the need for common, harmonised controls. We hope that if there is sufficient support at the regional level, then an international agreement could be reached by the 2006 UN Review Conference on Small Arms. Although the draft Arms Trade Treaty covers all arms, not just Small Arms and Light Weapons, many of its principles are similar to those we are promoting as part of the UK initiative on strengthening transfer controls.</p>
	<p pid=".512W.7/5">Between 2001 and 2004, the UK is providing over &pound;20 million to programmes targeted at controlling the supply, demand and availability of arms.</p>

	<p pid=".513W.8/1">It is difficult to make an overall assessment of the rise in prices of basic services in South Africa. The latest consumer price index figures published by Statistics South Africa suggest that overall inflation was 4.8 per cent. for the year to November 2003, while the price of fuel and power in urban areas rose over the same period by 6.8 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".513W.8/2">The Government of South Africa is committed to providing free basic services to the poor. The Free Basic Water policy entitles poor households to 6,000 litres of water each month, and the Free Basic Electricity policy to 50 kilowatt hours of electricity each month, free of charge. Poor households must pay for their use of services above these thresholds.</p>

	<p pid=".516W.8/1">There are no specific requirements for the retention of personal notes following either a criminal or civil trial. Experts may be required to annex their original reports to a statement in order to explain their findings. There is also a statutory duty on expert witnesses to ensure that any information, which may undermine the prosecution's case, is disclosed.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.8/2">The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health does not issue guidance to practitioners on retention of data. However, there is a professional duty upon all expert witnesses to consider carefully the possible use to which notes and records may be required in the future, for example possible appeals.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.8/3">The Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners is implementing a system of registration of forensics practitioners. Each expert will be bound by a code of practice which will require practitioners to retain their work in order that it can be reviewed if necessary at a later date by another member of the Council.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.8/4">The Intercollegiate Working Group chaired by Baroness Kennedy is examining issues surrounding the provision of training for expert witnesses and their use in the investigation process. The Group will report its findings in the Spring.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.8/5">There is no single official list of persons considered expert witnesses. Various organisations and bodies hold lists of expert witnesses for the purpose of assisting both their own members and other bodies which may require the assistance of an expert. The National Crime and Operations Faculty of the police force retains a database of persons with expertise in a wide range of areas, which is available to other law enforcement agencies. Other similar databases include those held by the Law Society, which retains a database for the use of its members. The Home Office retains a database of pathologists, registered to conduct post mortems on behalf of police or coroners. The Crown Prosecution Service does not retain a central database of experts. Some CPS Areas do keep a list of suitable experts for use in cases.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.8/6">The National Crime and Operations Faculty (NCOF) and its database have been in existence since 1997. It currently retains details on a wide range of experts, both medical and non-medical, which is used by police forces, security services and the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.8/7">The various bodies maintaining a database will each have different methods of inclusion and exclusion of experts. With respect to the NCOF database individual experts will be included usually following a referral by a police area as to suitability for inclusion. Professional credentials and experience are then carefully considered prior to any decision being taken to include the expert on the database.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.8/8">The NCOF does not delete experts from its database, in order that a historical record is maintained. If concerns arise over a particular expert then a decision would be taken over his or her continued use. If the decision were not to use that expert again the record would be marked accordingly.</p>
	<p pid=".516W.8/9">The National Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners is in the process of implementing registration of forensic practitioners nationally. This will cover all types of forensic practitioners but at present does not include paediatricians. Registration with the Council as a forensic practitioner is only possible after an assessment of an applicant's professional experience and credentials. Once suitable assessors are identified the scheme will be extended to paediatricians. This is a voluntary scheme, however once completed it will represent a definitive list of suitably competent practitioners.</p>

	<p pid=".517W.2/1">The key criterion the SFO uses when deciding whether to accept a case is that the suspected fraud appears to be so serious or complex that its investigation should be carried out by those responsible for its prosecution. The following factors are taken into account:</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/2" class="indent">1. The sum at risk is estimated to be at least &pound;1 million (this is simply an objective and recognisable signpost of seriousness and likely public concern rather than the main indicator of suitability).</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/3" class="indent">2. The case is likely to give rise to national publicity and widespread public concern. This would include cases involving Government Departments, public bodies, the governments of other countries as well as commercial cases of public interest.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/4" class="indent">3. The investigation requires a highly specialised knowledge of, for example, financial markets and their practices.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/5" class="indent">The case has a significant international dimension.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/6" class="indent">5. There is a need for legal, accountancy and investigative skills to be brought together in a combined operation.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/7" class="indent">6. The suspected fraud appears to be complex and one in which the use of Section 2 powers (Criminal Justice Act 1987) might be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".517W.2/8">The SFO does not have separate criteria that apply to allegations of bribery of a foreign public official. Allegations of this nature would have to meet the above criteria for the SFO to commence an investigation.</p>

	<p pid=".519W.3/1">Outlined as follows is background on a range of the Department's policies and actions, and their impact on Plymouth and Devon local education authorities. Where analysis has allowed, constituencies requested and the Plymouth Travel to Work Area are detailed.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/2" class="italic">Specialist Schools Programme</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/3">The Specialist Schools Programme is contributing to the creation of a specialist system in which every secondary school has its own special ethos and works with others to spread best practice and raise standards. The programme helps schools, in partnership with private sector sponsors and supported by additional Government funding, to achieve their targets to raise standards. It promotes school improvement by providing opportunities for schools to work to their strengths, enabling them to deliver effective teaching and learning in their area of expertise, as well as across the curriculum, and to drive innovation.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/4">Any maintained secondary school in England may apply to be designated as specialist in one of 10 areas: arts, business and enterprise, engineering, humanities, language, mathematics and computing, music, science, sports and technology. Schools can also combine any two specialisms.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/5">There are currently 1,444 specialist schools operating in eight of the 10 specialisms (this represents 46 per cent. of all secondary schools). We expect the first music and humanities colleges to begin operating in September 2004. Over 1.5 million pupils now attend specialist schools&mdash;half of all pupils attending secondary schools are attending specialist schools.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/6">The number of applications from schools wishing to be specialist is at record levels. In October 2001, 267 schools applied; in October 2003 it was 411.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/7">Specialist schools raise &pound;50,000 from private sector sponsorship (less in the case of schools with less than 500 pupils attending) and prepare four-year development plans for improvements in teaching and learning and involving other local schools and the wider community. Designated schools receive a &pound;100,000 capital grant and &pound;126 per pupil per annum for four years. Schools making good progress in meeting their targets can apply for extension funding for another four years.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/8">The Government have set a target to increase the number of specialist schools to 2,000 by 2006. The aim is that all secondary schools will become specialist schools.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/9" class="italic">Beacon schools:</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/10">The Department is currently phasing out the existing beacon schools programme.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/11">The leading edge partnership programme is specific to secondary schools and builds on the success of the beacon schools initiative to encourage an accelerated pace of change and improvement. We need our very best schools and departments to play a leading role in this; to encourage excellence, to develop curriculum expertise and to work with other schools to raise standards through improved teaching and learning. Leading secondary schools will work with other secondary school partners to find solutions to the most critical learning challenges and those most likely to have the greatest impact on closing the attainment gap. We are committed to establishing a network of 300 partnerships by 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/12">In primary, the leading practice programme, described in the recent primary strategy document &quot;Excellence and Enjoyment&quot;, a strategy for primary schools, will build on successful practice developed through the beacon programme. We intend to develop a leading practice programme with common national criteria and branding. It will focus on identifying outstanding work in particular areas, within schools that are performing well across the board. The LEA will have a role in working with leading practice schools to ensure they contribute to local networking arrangements so that excellent practice is spread widely.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/13" class="italic">Excellence Clusters:</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/14">Excellence Clusters are designed to bring the benefits of Excellence in Cities (EiC) to smaller pockets of deprivation. Some 197 secondary schools and over 440 primary schools are involved in Excellence Clusters. Like EiC, the clusters focus on some of the most deprived areas of the country, using a structured programme designed to raise standards.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/15">Clusters benefit from extra resources to provide the three core strands of the EiC programme:</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/16" class="indent">Extended opportunities for Gifted and Talented pupils</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/17" class="indent">Access to full time Learning Mentors for pupils who need them</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/18" class="indent">Learning Support Units to tackle disruption.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/19">A fourth strand of funding is available to target particular local issues, as identified by the schools in each cluster.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/20">Under our transformation strategy for Education Action Zones (EAZs) established under the Standards and Framework Act 1998 41 of the 73 EAZs will transform to Excellence Clusters. This process will be completed by the end of April 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".519W.3/22">The Leadership Incentive Grant is intended to accelerate the improvement in standards and to strengthen leadership at all levels in schools. The grant also enables schools to work together to share expertise, resources and effective practice to strengthen teaching and learning.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/23" class="italic">Primary Leadership Strategy:</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/24">In 2003, primary schools in every LEA were invited to take part in the Leadership Programme, funded by the Primary National Strategy and developed in partnership with the National College for School Leadership (NCSL). (The National Primary Strategy is a holistic whole-school improvement strategy, building on and incorporating the Literacy and Numeracy Strategies.)</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/25">The programme seeks to support schools in improving the leadership of the teaching and learning of English and mathematics, helping to ensure that the rate of progress of children within the school community continues to improve as more reach the standards expected.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/26" class="italic">Sure Start:</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/27">Sure Start programmes work with parents-to-be, parents and children to promote the physical, intellectual and social development of young children&mdash;particularly those who are disadvantaged&mdash;so that they can flourish at home, when they get to school and during later life. The programme aims to help strengthen families and reduce child poverty by enabling parents to maximise their opportunities to work, learn and study, confident their children are being cared for in a safe and stimulating environment; and contribute to building and sustaining strong local communities through high quality and innovatively delivered family services, which respond to the needs of the communities they serve.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/28" class="italic">Connexions:</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/29">Connexions is the Government's front line support service for all young people in England aged 13&ndash;19. Connexions will play an integral role in the delivery of the agenda for reform on services for children and young people proposed in the Green Paper &quot;Every child matters&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/30">Through multi-agency working, Connexions provides integrated advice guidance and access to personal development opportunities to help remove barriers to learning and progression and ensure young people make a smooth transition to adulthood and working life. Personal advisers play a lead professional role. They provide advice on careers and lifestyle issues as well as barriers such as homelessness and drugs. They refer young people to specialist support where needed.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/31">The new vision statement for Connexions launched in November 2002, signed by eight Government Ministers, re-affirmed the universal nature of the service.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.3/32">Connexions' overarching objective is to reduce the number of 16 to 18-year-olds who are not in education, employment or training (MEET). Connexions Partnerships have a target of reducing local MEET numbers by 10 per cent. by November 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".525W.6/1">The Landfill Tax Credit Scheme (LTCS) has not ended, although two of the objects of the scheme were withdrawn in April 2003, those which concerned research and development, and education on sustainable waste management. Since April 2003 a number of projects in categories c and cc have continued to be financed by legacy funding through the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the Welsh and Scottish Assemblies and the Northern Ireland Authorities but the current arrangements will cease at the end of March. The value of environmental education projects funded in calendar year 2003 under these categories is &pound;71,300, although that amount may increase since claims can be made until April 2004. However, some types of education projects are currently, and will still be, eligible for funding under some of the remaining objects of the scheme, for example biodiversity.</p>
	<p pid=".525W.6/2">As part of the sustainable waste delivery public expenditure programme established as a result of the reform of the LTCS, and managed by Defra, work will be taken forward on waste awareness. Therefore, my Department has no plans to increase the level of funding for environmental educational in schools.</p>
