	<p pid="b.3W.8/1">President Abbas submitted the Palestinian application for full membership of the UN on <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-23">23 September</phrase>. No vote is imminent in the Security Council, while the membership committee considers its recommendation. So far we have not been presented with a detailed proposal on which to take a position. Whether the committee returns the issue to the Security Council, or whether President Abbas decides to turn to the General Assembly, the UK will use its vote in a way which increases the likelihood of a return to meaningful negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="b.3W.8/2">The UK's position on recognition of a Palestinian state is clear: a Palestinian state is a legitimate goal, and the best way of achieving this is through a comprehensive agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The UK has deliberately reserved its position on the question of recognition of Palestinian statehood while we continue to urge all parties back to talks. Withholding our position in this way, along with other European partners, maintains the pressure on both sides to show the flexibility needed to enable a return to negotiations.</p>

	<p pid="b.8W.0/1">There are no plans to carry out a central assessment of referral practice to physiotherapy in England. It is for local national health service organisations to make their own decisions about routes of referral for physiotherapy, based on which route is clinically appropriate and of value to the health care system and local community.</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.0/2">Some organisations may include self-referral in their access routes. To help local organisations in making decisions about self-referral, the Department has collaborated with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy to pilot and evaluate self-referral. The pilots identified a number of benefits including earlier presentation and supporting self-care by empowering patients to be more actively involved in managing their condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.0/3">Information about this project can be found in the &#8220;Self-referral pilots to musculoskeletal physiotherapy and the implications for improving access to other AHP services&#8221;. This document has already been placed in the Library and is available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.8W.0/5">The NHS has been asked to make up to &#163;20 billion of efficiency savings by 2014-15 while simultaneously improving the quality of services it provides in order to meet rising demand resulting from an ageing population and new developments in technology and drugs. Local NHS organisations are best placed to decide on how to meet this challenge, according to local circumstances and priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.0/6">There have been a number of initiatives to improve access to physiotherapy and other allied health professional services including delivering services more efficiently. The Allied Health Professional Service Improvement Project demonstrated in a range of services, including physiotherapy, how service redesign can improve access and clinical outcomes, and release cost-savings back into the system.

Last year we provided &#163;9 million to support 59 local awareness campaigns to raise awareness of breast, bowel and lung cancer and early indications are that there has been a positive response to the campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.3/2">In June this year we announced that we would be providing &#163;2.5 million to support a further 18 local awareness campaigns, seven of which will seek to raise awareness of breast cancer in women over 70. Survival rates for women with breast cancer in this age range are poorer than in other comparable countries and this is why we are focusing on this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.8W.3/3">More generally, we encourage all women to be breast aware. The Department has worked with health professionals, patient groups and the voluntary sector to develop a set of key messages for breast cancer that include the signs and symptoms of the disease. These are available on the NHS Choices website and we encourage charities and other stakeholders to use them widely in awareness raising activities. The Department has also published &#8220;Be Breast Aware&#8221;, a leaflet which advises women to know what changes to look for and report them to their GP as quickly as possible.</p>

The Department of Health, working with the NHS armed forces networks, Combat Stress and others have put in place a number of initiatives aimed at improving access to mental health services for veterans. These include a 24-hour helpline through Combat Stress (working with Rethink), and an increase in the number of mental health professionals conducting veterans outreach, assessment and referral work (also with Combat Stress), set up a pilot of Big White Wall&#8212;an early intervention service for service personnel, veterans and families and launched an e-learning package for general practitioners with the Royal College of General Practitioners. In all of these areas, alcohol misuse is a key issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.9W.8/2">In addition to these veteran specific initiatives, most, areas of England have access to the full range of alcohol treatment services including advice and information, counselling and therapy, medical detoxification (both in the community and in-patient when necessary), and rehabilitation services (both residential and in the community day treatment services), as defined in the Department's best practice guidance &#8216;Models of Care for Alcohol Misusers&#8217; published in June 2006.

In 2002-03, Brighton Healthcare NHS Trust and Mid Sussex NHS Trust merged to become Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust. 2. Figures relating to years 1998-99 to present have been taken from the published annual publications available on: http://www.hesonline.nhs.uk The figures provided relating to 1997-98 were not previously published. 3. It should be noted that these data should not be described as a count of people as the same person may have been admitted on more than one occasion. 4. Activity includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector. 5. A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. <i>Emergency admissions include:</i> Emergency: via Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) services, including the casualty department of the provider Emergency: via general practitioner (GP) Emergency: via Bed Bureau, including the Central Bureau Emergency: via consultant out-patient clinic Emergency: other means, including patients who arrive via the A&amp;E department of another health care provider 6. Hospital providers can also include treatment centres (TC). Normally, if data are tabulated by health care provider, the figure for an NHS trust gives the activity of all the sites as one aggregated figure. However, in the case of those with embedded treatment centres, these data are quoted separately. In these cases, '-X' is appended to the code for the rest of the trust, to remind users that the figures are for all sites of the trust excluding the treatment centres. The quality of TC returns are such that data may not be complete. Some NHS trusts have not registered their TC as a separate site, and it is therefore not possible to identify their activity separately. Data from some independent sector providers, where the onus for arrangement of dataflows is on the commissioner, may be missing. Care must be taken when using this data as the counts may be lower than true figures. 7. Assessing growth through time: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. <i>Source:</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.13W.8/1">We fully support patients having a choice of pharmaceutical services providers. Patients can take their prescriptions to any national health service pharmacy they wish to have their prescriptions dispensed.</p>
	<p pid="b.13W.8/2">However, in more remote and rural areas NHS pharmacies may not always be viable. That is why, to ensure adequate access to NHS dispensing services, primary care trusts may authorise general practitioners to dispense to patients provided certain criteria set out in regulations are met. Under these regulations, such doctors provide a more restricted range of pharmaceutical services than pharmacies.</p>

	<p pid="b.18W.2/2">The Government have made no formal assessments of the expected long-term performance of CTF investments, but expect that investment growth in CTF accounts will be broadly in line with other investment products.

	<p pid="b.18W.2/5">Junior ISAs and CTF accounts will operate in different ways and the Government do not believe it is in the interests of the six million CTF account holders to rush into wholesale changes to the CTF scheme without consulting all interested parties first. Therefore, once Junior ISAs have been successfully launched, the Government will consider the future of existing CTF accounts, including whether CTFs should be converted into Junior ISAs.</p>
	<p pid="b.18W.2/6">In the meantime, to ensure that children with a CTF are not disadvantaged, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-01">1 November</phrase> the Government will increase the CTF contribution limit to &#163;3,600, bringing it in line with the Junior ISA limit. Through this the Government are providing support for all parents wishing to save for their children's future.</p>

The Ministry of Defence's (MOD) renegotiation programme required a high level of professional skill which was not available within the MOD on the scale needed for an exercise of this scope within the timescales available, and it was clear that additional assistance was required.

	<p pid="b.32W.2/1">Although the Ministry of Defence is reducing its civilian staff headcount and has imposed a freeze on most external recruitment, we still need to recruit for posts that are business critical or provide support to current operational commitments. The majority of the external recruitment carried out since May 2010 has been for Service Children's Education, to provide teachers overseas, and also for medical grades, including doctors, nurses and physiotherapists. We have also had to fill a number of senior civil service posts critical to driving forward our reform agenda. These posts are usually advertised across a range of specialist media, as well as on the civil service jobs website. The amount spent on recruitment advertising since May 2010 is &#163;522,826.59. This does not include any expenditure by the trading funds and Royal Fleet Auxiliary.</p>

	<p pid="b.32W.8/1">The armed forces covenant underlines our commitment to ensuring that all the service community, including ex-service personnel, receive the support and recognition which they deserve. As part of this, we work very closely with other Government Departments, devolved Administrations and voluntary sector organisations to ensure that the needs and circumstances of the ex-service community are known with the aim of improving veterans' access to services and to assist with their transition to civilian life. This includes the work undertaken by the Department of Health to inform GPs about the potential problems that may face veterans and the Department for Communities and Local Government programme to ensure that local authorities give priority to eligible veterans in relation to housing. Indeed, the publicity surrounding the implementation of covenant initiatives has succeeded in raising, the profile of the needs of our service community among the wider public.</p>
	<p pid="b.32W.8/2">In addition, the Department aims to inform the public of the help and advice available to veterans. For example, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) publishes a quarterly newsletter, Veterans World, which provides information on specific Government, devolved Administration and charitable initiatives aimed at assisting veterans. The MOD also regularly engages with news channels and documentary makers to publicly highlight the issues faced by some veterans and the steps the Government are taking to address these.</p>

This means that all of DFID's current and future programmes in Indonesia will contribute to the sustainable management of natural resources. They will do this by helping to reduce deforestation and promoting more sustainable economic growth and employment opportunities. This will also help Indonesia meet its target for reducing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

	<p pid="b.38W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) promotes environmental awareness in Mozambique at provincial and sub-district levels, first, through Budget Support. This will help finance a nationwide campaign launched by the President of Mozambique last year and run by the Ministry for the Environment, which encourages, for example, every school pupil to plant a tree and every community to preserve their forests. It will help increase the number of local &#8216;environmental educators' from 800 in 2010 to 5,000 in 2014.</p>
	<p pid="b.38W.2/2">Secondly, DFID promotes environmental awareness by mainstreaming environmental issues into the projects we deliver through multiple sectors for example, education, agricultural, livelihoods, water and sanitation and by supporting civil society to advocate on environmental issues. DFID also leads by example, including by cutting the carbon footprint of our office in Mozambique. For example, the office cut its electricity consumption by 34%, comparing the last two months' bills to the same period last year.</p>

	<p pid="b.38W.5/1">DFID staff have been made aware of the public sector-wide scheme which the Cabinet Office is taking forward in response to Government commitments. This scheme will give public sector workers new rights to spin out to form new enterprises and continue to deliver public services, including through new mutuals and co-operatives. These rights will not be uniform across organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.38W.5/2">The Mutuals Support Programme is a fund of more than &#163;10 million, administered by the Cabinet Office. It will be dedicated to supporting some of the most promising and innovative mutuals so that they reach the point of investment readiness. This will be supported by the Mutuals Information Service that will give help and guidance to potential and existing mutuals. These will be launched later in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="b.47W.12/1">Escort officers are trained in the use of control and restraint techniques, which are used only as a matter of last resort when all other alternatives of persuading a person to comply with their removal from the UK have failed or they need to be controlled for safety reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.47W.12/2">The use of restraint is legitimate and lawful so long as its use is justified, proportionate and de-escalated at the earliest opportunity when the individual has complied. Escort officers are required to submit a report each time force has been used to restrain a detainee while being removed. However separate records are not held on injuries sustained. This could be determined only by examination of each use of force or incident report submitted at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.52W.0/1">The coalition Government announced in the 2010 Budget that all public sector pay would be subject to a 2-year pay freeze (except for staff who earn less than &#163;21,000 per annum). This current freeze, which began in April this year, is in addition to the one-year freeze introduced previously by the previous Administration.</p>

For 2010-11, the Ministry of Justice awarded non-consolidated performance-related payments to 24.2% of those senior civil servants in scope for consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.52W.0/5"><i>(a)</i> For the SCS performance year 2009-10, non-consolidated performance-related payments were awarded to those placed in Performance Groups 1 and 2 as part of the end-year SCS performance management process. In line with Cabinet Office guidance, non-consolidated performance-related payments were differentiated, for those in Performance Group 1 and those in Performance Group 2.</p>
	<p pid="b.52W.0/6">For 2009-10, 53 SCS pay bands 2 and 3 (Directors and Directors General) were awarded non-consolidated performance-related payments and 111 were awarded to SCS Pay Bands 1 and 1A (Deputy Directors). 18 members of SCS Pay Bands 2 and 3 (Directors and Directors General) were awarded Performance Group 1 and 35 were awarded Performance Group 2. 43 members of SCS pay bands 1 and 1A (Deputy Directors) were awarded Performance Group 1 and 68 were awarded Performance Group 2.</p>

	<p pid="b.57W.3/1">The Prisoners' Earnings Act (PEA) enables deductions from prisoners' earnings in certain circumstances pending the introduction of a wider power to do so which is contained in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill currently before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.57W.3/2">It is a statutory requirement of the PEA that the recipient or recipients of its proceeds is/are formally prescribed by the Secretary of State. He has prescribed that the funds should go to Victim Support.</p>
	<p pid="b.57W.3/3">The Coalition programme for government and the Green Paper &#8216;Breaking the Cycle&#8217;, published by the Ministry of Justice in December 2011, committed to implementing the Act with the aim of deductions from the earnings of prisoners going towards services which support victims.</p>
	<p pid="b.57W.3/4">In deciding which organisation or organisations to prescribe we took account of the uncertainty about the amount of revenue the PEA would generate which results from the difficulty in predicting how many prisoners would be engaged in qualifying work. This uncertainty rendered the PEA revenue unsuitable for a competitive funding process. It also meant that any prescribed organisation needed to possess sufficient capacity to deliver the project or projects the PEA was intended to fund if the revenue actually raised proved lower than anticipated.</p>
	<p pid="b.57W.3/5">As the PEA represents the first time prisoners have contributed in this way we wanted the proceeds to go to an organisation which worked nationally with a broad range of victims of crime. Victim Support is the principal provider of support for victims in England and Wales and has over 35 years' experience of the sector. Its national coverage and size made it the ideal choice.</p>
	<p pid="b.57W.3/6">The Ministry of Justice has not entered into a contract with Victim Support for the PEA revenue. Victim Support is currently considering a number of potential projects and will make a final decision once it is known how much revenue will be raised through the levy.

	<p pid="b.65W.2/1">The draft National Planning Policy Framework makes clear that the purpose of the planning system is to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. It states that, for the planning system, delivering sustainable development means building a strong, responsive competitive economy; promoting strong, vibrant and healthy communities; and protecting and enhancing our natural, built and historic environment. These three components should be pursued in an integrated way, looking for solutions that achieve multiple goals.</p>
	<p pid="b.65W.2/2">The draft framework also states that, when determining planning applications, local planning authorities should aim to conserve and enhance biodiversity. Planning permission should be refused for development resulting in the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats, unless the need for, and benefits of, the development in that location clearly outweigh the loss. If significant harm resulting from a development cannot be avoided, adequately mitigated, or, as a last resort, compensated for, then planning permission should be refused.</p>

Therefore, it is important to provide additional capacity at opening in order to accommodate this build-up.

	<p pid="b.73W.5/1">The Department received representations on a number of issues related to the renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO) during consultations on the renewable energy directive (RED). These included suggestions that the RTFO should distinguish between bioethanol and biodiesel, arguing that if it did, this might provide a mechanism to drive equal demand for both products. The suggestion has been taken into account through the consultation exercise.</p>
	<p pid="b.73W.5/2">The RTFO is a mechanism designed to reduce carbon emissions and promote the supply of sustainable biofuels. It does not seek to direct the market towards a particular biofuel product or method of production.</p>
	<p pid="b.73W.5/3">In respect of future incentives under the RTFO and assessments of the adequacy of that mechanism in driving a market for renewable transport fuels in the UK, I refer the hon. Member to the answers given to him on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-05">5 July 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-07-05.1172"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 1172-3W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.73W.5/4">In the consultation on proposals to implement the RED we proposed to provide additional support to waste-derived biofuels under an amended renewable transport fuel obligation. We expect to publish a Government response soon setting out both our plans and the timeline for implementation.</p>

	<p pid="b.77W.3/1">The lead UK Government Department dealing with recovery in the event of a major civil nuclear accident in England is the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). In Wales, it is the Welsh Assembly Government, in Scotland, the Scottish Government, and in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Executive. The Government Decontamination Service also would play a key role across the UK during the recovery from such an incident, while local authorities and their resilience forums would collaborate with relevant Government Departments and agencies during this phase.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.3/2">Proper attention has been given to the identification of the necessary resources and facilities required should the unlikely event of an emergency occur involving a nuclear installation. The National Recovery Guidance has been developed in line with and following the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 definitions. This national guidance was produced in 2007 by the National Recovery Working Group, commissioned by Ministers. New material is added to the guidance regularly as new information and guidance becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.3/3">As part of the Department's ongoing assessment and enhancement of the emergency planning and response to such incidents, we are working closely with DEFRA and other partners across Government on issues relating to the transition from the response to the recovery phase.</p>

	<p pid="b.77W.6/1">The two instances where exercise scenarios were extended into severe accident territory (paragraph 491 of the report by HM Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations) were as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.6/2">Exercise Madonna took place in 1997 at Heysham Power Station. The scenario was based on the findings from the Hinkley Point C public inquiry, which recommended that a &quot;beyond design basis accident&quot; scenario should be adopted that would help to improve the ability of the police and the county emergency planning department.</p>
	<p pid="b.77W.6/3">Exercise Isis took place in May 2002 at Bradwell Power Station, and was conducted following 9/11. It tested a scenario significantly beyond the design basis and involved participation by all the major organisations with an interest at both local and national level. The exercise was successful and showed that detailed plans could be extended to deal with larger events.</p>

	<p pid="b.83W.5/1">The under 18 conception rate in England is declining and is at the lowest level for nearly 30 years. It is not possible to identify a causal link between sex and relationships education in primary or secondary schools and England's reduction in teenage pregnancies. However, international evidence and lessons from local areas where teenage pregnancy rates have fallen fastest, indicate that in order to avoid teenage pregnancies, young people need:</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.5/2">a comprehensive programme of SRE, which: promotes the benefits of delaying first sex; provides young people with the knowledge and skills to resist pressure from peers and the media; and informs them about contraception, so that they can avoid unplanned pregnancies and STIs when they do become sexually active; combined with</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.5/3">access to young people-centred contraceptive and sexual health (CASH) services, in locations and at times that fit with young people's lives; and which offer the full range of contraceptive options, including long-acting contraceptive methods.</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.5/4">We still have high teenage pregnancy rates compared with many other western European countries. Local areas should maintain their efforts to reduce teenage pregnancy rates further as part of their ambition to tackle child poverty and health inequalities, and to learn from those areas which have achieved significant reductions. We will be saying more about this in the forthcoming Positive for Youth Policy Document and the Sexual Health Policy Document.</p>

The proposals set out a bursary rate of between &#163;4,000 and &#163;20,000 depending on the degree classification of the trainee and the subject specialism or phase of the postgraduate course. We expect to announce the final arrangements for 2012/13 shortly.

	<p pid="b.84W.5/1">We are determined that those who serve in the armed forces, and their families, should not be disadvantaged when they seek to secure a school place for their children. That is why we consulted upon reforms to the admissions code that would allow admission authorities to include the children of service families as an exception to the infant class size regulations. We have also changed the code to require local authorities and admission authorities to treat a service family as resident in their area as soon as proof of posting has been provided. In addition, we intend to remove the requirement that local authorities manage the processing of in-year applications, which would capture many service families. Instead, these families will be supported through information and paperwork by the local authority to enable them to apply directly to the schools in their area. This should mean a faster outcome for those parents in finding a place for their child than at present.</p>
	<p pid="b.84W.5/2">Subject to the parliamentary process, we expect the new admissions and appeals codes to come into force in February 2012 and to take full effect on applications for the September 2013 intake onwards.</p>

	<p pid="b.86W.9/1">We are promoting growth of small and medium-sized enterprises in a number of ways:</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/2" class="italic">Removing barriers to growth</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/3">We have introduced an extensive public thematic review of the existing stock of regulation through the Red Tape Challenge website, providing businesses with the opportunity to tell Government which regulations are working and which are not. From 3 to <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-19">19 October</phrase> the spotlight is on employment-related law. Retail was the first theme to go live in early April, resulting in the removal or simplification of over half the 257 retail regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/4">We have introduced a moratorium exempting micro (fewer than 10 employees) and start-up businesses from new domestic regulation for three years from <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/5">From 2012, the qualifying period for unfair dismissals will be extended from 12 months to two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/6" class="italic">Providing people with the advice and guidance they need to grow their business</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/7">We are transforming the way that we enable people to receive the information, advice and guidance they need to start and grow their business.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/8">Our new approach to Government services and advice for business is based on:</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/9">digital services which provide the best advice available and accessible when businesses need them; and</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/10">advice provided by business people for business people, not by the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/11">We have been working with the British Bankers Association (BBA) to launch:</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/12"><a href="http://www.mentorsme.co.uk">www.mentorsme.co.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/13">which provides a single, easy to use search engine to find organisations offering mentoring services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). And we are supporting a massive expansion of the number of mentors available to SMEs.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/14">In addition we are:</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/15">revamping the Business Link website:</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/16"><a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">www.businesslink.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/17">setting up a dedicated &quot;My New Business&quot; area on the website to provide training and information for those looking to start a business&#8212;with the best video and interactive advice produced by experts and available 24/7; and</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/18">setting up a new Business Coaching for Growth (BCG) programme to enable small businesses with high growth potential to realise their potential.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/19" class="italic">Finding new markets</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/20">Export markets are vital to growth. Under this Government, UKTI has introduced a comprehensive offer for SMEs to help them export. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/21">Passport to Export&#8212;is a trade development programme offering new and inexperienced exporters help and support to build the capability to start exporting proactively and make their first visit to an export market. Launched in 2001, it is delivered by International Trade Advisers (ITAs) in England and has helped around 14,000 SMEs.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/22">Gateway to Global Growth&#8212;offers experienced SME exporters the opportunity to increase their exporting skills and awareness of what is on offer from UKTI and private sector suppliers. The aim is to help them enter more difficult markets or expand in existing ones. The approach is similar to Passport, but aimed at innovative SME exporters with two to 10 years' export experience, ready to widen and diversify their overseas business. It was launched in 2009 and nearly 3,000 companies had been signed on to the programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/23">The Overseas Market Introduction Service&#8212;provides assistance for businesses of all sizes from posts overseas and is chargeable but at a subsidised rate. This is available to all sizes of companies but approximately 85% of users are SMEs.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/24">Market Visit Support&#8212;provides assistance to new to export and/or new to market SMEs visiting overseas markets, individually or in groups as part of their trade development process.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/25">The Export Marketing Research Scheme&#8212;run for UKTI by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), provides free advice for SMEs on marketing research and a limited amount of grant is available for approved marketing research projects for SMEs and trade associations.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/26">The Export Communications Review&#8212;also run for us by the BCC, provides SMEs with impartial and objective advice on language and cultural issues to help them improve their competitiveness in export markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/27" class="italic">Finance for g rowth</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/28">Ensuring the flow of credit to viable SMEs is essential for supporting growth and is a core priority for this Government. The Government are providing a comprehensive package of support for small businesses, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/29">Continuation of the Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme until 2014-15, providing up to &#163;600 million of additional lending to around 6,000 viable SMEs in 2011 and, subject to demand, over &#163;2 billion in total over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/30" class="italic">Trade finance:</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/31">A new Export Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme, providing up to &#163;1 million of lending to support viable SME exporters who are unable to access a commercial loan. A six-month pilot scheme commenced in April 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/32">A bond support scheme available from participating banks, freeing up additional working capital.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/33">A widening of the eligibility of the existing short-term credit insurance policy, the Export Insurance Policy, by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD).</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/34">An export working capital scheme, facilitating exporting firms' access to pre and post-shipment working capital finance for specific export contracts.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/35">A foreign exchange credit support product, to share risk with banks on their credit exposure arising from the foreign exchange hedging contracts provided to SME exporters, where there is some other form of ECGD support.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/36">Continuation of the Government's Enterprise Capital Funds programme, increasing our commitment by &#163;200 million over the next four years, providing for more than &#163;300 million of venture capital investment to address the equity gap for early stage innovative SMEs with the highest growth potential.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/37">Encouraging Business Angel investment by reviewing the regulatory framework affecting angels and through the establishment of a new &#163;50 million Business Angel Co-Investment Fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.86W.9/38">A &#163;1.4 billion Regional Growth Fund operating across England from 2011 to 2014 to support projects and programmes that lever private sector investment creating economic growth and sustainable employment. It aims particularly to help those areas and communities currently dependent on the public sector to make the transition to sustainable private sector-led growth and prosperity.</p>

	<p pid="b.88W.2/1">In the coalition agreement the Government made clear that they believe business is the driver of economic growth and innovation. This includes the need to take action to boost enterprise, including women's entrepreneurship.</p>
	<p pid="b.88W.2/2">The Government are committed to broadening the range of activities intended to promote enterprise and to ensuring that the needs of potential and actual women entrepreneurs are fully integrated into these activities. For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.88W.2/3">Challenging aspirations and capability&#8212;particularly seeking to embed enterprise awareness at an early age, as there is evidence that differences in enterprise aspiration between the genders start to open up early in secondary education. We will therefore support every school to give pupils meaningful enterprise experience by helping them develop and run their own business and we will ensure that every school and college has access to positive local role models and enterprise champions&#8212;including female entrepreneurs.</p>
	<p pid="b.88W.2/4">A new approach to Business Improvement&#8212;as part of our work to transform the way that we enable people to receive the information and advice they need to start and grow their business (including the updating of <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">www.businesslink.gov.uk</a>, and establishing a new national helpline, a comprehensive start-up service and a new Business Coaching for Growth service), we have paid particular attention to ensuring the services are accessible to women and are designed and presented in the right way for a female audience.</p>
	<p pid="b.88W.2/5">Improving the business environment and access to finance&#8212;the Government are taking a number of steps which will benefit women-led businesses as well as other businesses, including: delivering long-term certainty and stability in the tax system; reducing regulatory burdens; encouraging a world-class skills base; ensuring the financial sector can supply affordable credit to viable businesses; and encouraging more diverse sources of finance for SMEs, including where appropriate, access to equity finance.</p>
	<p pid="b.88W.2/6">This Department does not provide any financial assistance for women's business centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.88W.2/7">The Government want to engage with small businesses and entrepreneurs to help make the UK the best place in the world to start and grow a business, and make the next decade the most entrepreneurial and dynamic in Britain's history. The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40618" name="Vincent Cable">the right hon. Member for Twickenham (Vince Cable)</phrase>, has therefore created the Entrepreneurs' Forum, to provide him with an informal and personal source of advice on business and enterprise policies.

	<p pid="b.89W.5/1">The Irresponsible Lending Guidance is helping to raise standards in both the main stream and sub-prime sectors. For example, trade associations in both sectors have required their members to adopt practices and procedures that are compliant with the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) guidance. However, OFT intelligence suggests that lenders in both sectors need to do more to fully meet the standards set out in the guidance&#8212;and where there is clear evidence that they don&#8217;t meet these standards and consumers may be adversely affected, the OFT does, and will continue to, take action against the businesses concerned. In line with a commitment given at the time that it published the Irresponsible Lending Guidance, the OFT expects to commence a review of business compliance with the guidance shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.91W.6/2">The Government consider that the most effective support they can provide in relation to the Hawk is by promoting exports of the aircraft from the UK. The Government are actively engaged in promoting exports of the Hawk, and in particular the UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) Defence and Security Organisation is supporting BAE Systems export campaigns in a number of overseas markets. Export customers for high value defence equipment frequently seek a level of local production and technology transfer, but export orders still deliver significant benefit and value for the many UK companies in the supply chain. The Government have not provided support directly towards production of the aircraft in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.94W.0/12">The question asks for those with &#8220;AAB or above at A level&#8221; to be identified (therefore the wider specification of grades and qualifications proposed in the Higher Education Funding Council for England &#8216;Consultation on funding for teaching and student number allocation in 2012-13' Annex C: AAB equivalences has not been used). Only the three highest grades have been considered in this analysis. The dominator for the calculation of the percentage is the number of applicants that made at least one choice to the type of institution.</p>
	<p pid="b.94W.0/13">The data covers UK domiciled applicants in the UCAS main scheme, Higher Education Institutions with UCAS membership and A levels reported through the 2010 Awarding Body Linkage (ABL arrangements only cover qualifications taken in the last 18 months). The school type reflects the centre through which the application was submitted and uses UCAS' standard centre groupings. UCAS is not able to report on non-selective state funded schools as these are not identified in their data.</p>
	<p pid="b.94W.0/14">The AAB and better group will contain applicants with a range of attainment from AAB to A*A*A*A* for example. The mix of applicant attainment within the AAB or better group may vary across centre type and this is likely to account for some of the differences in the offer rate seen, for example for those that achieved exactly AAB, the variation in offer rate from Oxford or Cambridge universities is reduced to within 0.6% across centre types.</p>
	<p pid="b.94W.0/15">For a majority of these applicants, offers are made prior to A level attainment being known. Predicted grades have not been considered in this analysis. An institution's decision to make an offer is likely to depend on subjects in addition to the potential grade profile. This data reports those who have achieved particular A level grade profiles without any filtering of the range of subjects. The mix of subjects offered may be associated with school type.</p>

The granting of these powers is subject to meeting specific criteria designed to establish that the applicant is a well-founded, cohesive and self-critical academic community that can demonstrate firm guardianship of its standards. As part of our proposed reforms to higher education we are currently consulting on a range of measures to encourage a greater diversity of higher education provision which is responsive to the needs of students.</p>

	<p pid="b.109W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.109W.2/2"><i>(a)</i> The Department considers a person to be terminally ill if they suffer from a progressive disease with a prognosis of six months or less. Those with terminal illnesses are among a small minority of claimants who are fast-tracked into the support group without having to attend a work capability assessment (WCA).</p>
	<p pid="b.109W.2/3">People considered to be terminally ill by the Department are assessed to have limited capability for work-related activity and therefore cannot be assessed to be fit for work or placed in the work related activity group.</p>
	<p pid="b.109W.2/4">The Department recently published an ad hoc analysis of WCA outcomes at initial assessment for employment and support allowance (ESA) claims by detailed medical condition based on the International Classifications of Diseases (ICD10). This analysis was published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-21">21 September 2011</phrase> and can be accessed using the following link:</p>
	<p pid="b.109W.2/5"><a href="http://statistics.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/adhoc_analysis/index.php?page=adhoc_analysis_2011_q3">http://statistics.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/adhoc_analysis/index.php?page=adhoc_analysis_2011_q3</a></p>
	<p pid="b.109W.2/6">This shows the outcomes of the initial WCA for new ESA claims starting between October 2008 and November 2010 (the latest data available), after the effect of appeals. This shows that there were:</p>
	<p pid="b.109W.2/7"><i>(b)</i> 200 fit for work decisions out of 1,200 new claims where the primary condition was classed as Parkinson's disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.109W.2/8"><i>(c)</i> 700 fit for work decisions out of 4,900 new claims where the primary condition was classed as multiple sclerosis.</p>
	<p pid="b.109W.2/9"><i>(d)</i> The term 'requiring open heart surgery' is not defined by the International Classifications of Diseases (ICD10) published by the World Health Organisation; as a result we are unable to provide information in the format requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.109W.2/10">Entitlement to employment and support allowance (ESA) is based on functional capabilities, not on condition per se. The medical condition recorded on a claim form does not in itself confer entitlement to ESA. So, for example, a decision on entitlement for a customer claiming employment and support on the basis of alcoholism would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities assessed by the work capability assessment, or on the effects of any associated mental health problems. It is also important to note that, where someone has more than one diagnosis or disabling condition, only the predominant one is currently recorded.</p>

	<p pid="b.110W.0/1">The closure of the Central Office of Information is part of a programme to reform Government communications as a whole. This builds on the success of the moratorium on marketing and advertising, which saw external spend through COI fall from &#163;532 million in 2009-10 to &#163;168 million in 2010-11 and central Government Departments cut their communications budgets by half. These reductions in spending mean that COI is no longer viable as a trading fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.110W.0/2">The decision on the full package of reforms was made on the basis of the information contained in the former Permanent Secretary for Government Communication's &#8216;Review of Government Direct Communication and the Role of COI&#8217; and the Government's response to this report. The original report was published on the Cabinet Office website in March and can be seen at:</p>

	<p pid="b.116W.6/1">His Honour Judge Darlow ruled, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-19">19 October 2005</phrase>, that there was no case to answer in relation to the charges of misconduct in public office. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was, therefore, unable to proceed on these charges.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.6/2">At the same hearing, the judge also indicated that the type of penalty he would impose on the remaining charges under the Data Protection Act 1998 would not justify a complex criminal trial. This obliged prosecutors to review the decision to proceed. The Code for Crown Prosecutors states that a public interest factor tending against prosecution is if the court is likely to impose a nominal penalty. In the light of this and applying the Code, the prosecution offered no evidence on these charges on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.6/3">The CPS queried the judge's ruling in court and subsequently sought counsel's advice on referring his rulings in this case to the Court of Appeal, through an Attorney-General's reference. The CPS was advised that the case was not suitable for referral to the Court of Appeal because the law required no further clarification.</p>
	<p pid="b.116W.6/4">Section 58 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 now allows appeals of judge's rulings within a trial. This was not available at the time of these proceedings.</p>
