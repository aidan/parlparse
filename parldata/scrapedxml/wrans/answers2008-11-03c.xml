	<p pid="c.8W.2/1">Tackling pensioner poverty remains one of this Government's key priorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.8W.2/2">The Government have introduced a number of measures to help older people out of poverty. In 1997, the poorest pensioners lived on around &pound;69 a week, today pension credit ensures that no pensioner needs to live on less than &pound;124.05 a week (&pound;189.35 for a couple). We have successively raised the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit at least in line with earnings in every year since its introduction, and the value of the safety-net we provide for the poorest pensioners has increased by over a third in real terms since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.8W.2/3">We have made good progress in tackling pensioner poverty. Between 1998-99 and 2006-07 the number of pensioners in low income in the UK has fallen from 2.9 million to 2.1 million (measured by 60 per cent. of contemporary median income after housing costs.)</p>
	<p pid="c.8W.2/4">Our commitments in the Pensions Act 2007 to continue to uprate the pension credit standard minimum guarantee at least in line with earnings over the long term, and to reintroduce the earnings link to basic state pension from 2012, or by the end of the next Parliament, will help secure the gains we have made into the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.8W.2/5">We are striving to ensure that older people are aware of, and take up their entitlements through initiatives such as: using sophisticated data matching to identify those who may be entitled to, but not currently receiving, benefits; home visits for vulnerable customers; targeted local marketing and media campaigns; a simple and straightforward claim process and ever closer working with partner organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.8W.2/6">In addition to pension credit we have increased winter fuel payments to &pound;200 for households with someone aged 60-79, and &pound;300 for those with someone aged 80 or over. We will be making an additional payment for winter 2008-09 of &pound;50 for households with someone aged 60 to 79 and &pound;100 for those with someone aged 80 or over. Since 1997, we have also introduced free eye-tests, free off-peak bus travel for pensioners and free television licences for those aged over 75.</p>

	<p pid="c.12W.3/1">The House Administration is undertaking a liability review and assessment that will determine the full extent of any monies to be recovered from consultants. Once assessed, if required, negotiations for repayment will occur. Sums have been retained against some consultants, but the full extent of any recovery will not be known until the liability assessment and negotiations are finalised.</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.3/2">The Project Advisory Board included various members of staff from both Houses of Parliament led (a) from inception in September 2004, through design and tender of the works by the then Director of Parliamentary Estates and (b) from contractor appointment through construction until summer 2007 by the then Serjeant at Arms. At that stage, in the light of delays and construction problems, a project recovery manager was appointed who initially reported to the Clerk of the House and Chief Executive and then, from autumn 2007, to a new Project Board led by the Principal Clerk of Select Committees. This has seen the project through to completion and post-completion trialling and operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.12W.3/3">The extension to the project to include the Grand Committee Room roof and Westminster Hall steps was authorised by the Project Advisory Board early in the project in 2004 on the basis that to do so might create a more beneficial price for the works and a more timely construction period and to do otherwise would create potential conflict of working area arrangements.</p>

This meeting took place on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-07">7 May 2008</phrase>, when the FSC's proposals were discussed in detail in the context of the Legacy Masterplan Framework (LMF) being developed by the LDA.

	<p pid="c.17W.0/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the Charity Commission. I have asked the Commission to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Andrew Hind, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-24">24 October 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.0/3" class="indent">As the Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, I have been asked to respond to your written Parliamentary Questions concerning charities operating in Israel and measures against UK charities supporting inappropriate individuals and/or organisations overseas.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.0/4" class="indent">The Charity Commission is the independent regulator of charities in England and Wales. The register of charities, which the Commission maintains, does not include charities which are based in other parts of the United Kingdom, so my answers below are confined to England and Wales only.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.0/5" class="indent">The issues you raise are complex and not answered easily in the Parliamentary Question form (although I attempt to, below). Our guidance, &quot;Charities working internationally&quot;, available on our website (<a href="http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk">www.charitycommission.gov.uk</a>) covers the principles that should be applied for charities working abroad and in areas of conflict and political tension. From your series of questions, I can see that you have an obvious interest in how UK charities are regulated in such areas, particularly the Middle East. If you would find it helpful, our Director of Legal and Compliance, Kenneth Dibble, will be happy to meet you to discuss our approach to regulation and what our requirements are for charities operating in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.0/6" class="indent">To take your PQs in turn:</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.0/7" class="indent">PQ 229942: Charities that work overseas, and are registered with the Charity Commission, are obliged to describe the countries in which they work. However, they are not obliged to specify areas within those countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.0/8" class="indent">Based on information from the Register of Charities, 1,150 charities include Israel in their area of operations and 143 include 'Occupied Palestinian Territories'.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.0/9" class="indent">PQ 229921: Charities falling under our regulatory jurisdiction can only provide funds for activities that further the charity's purposes, which may include a defined beneficial class (ie a specified group of whom will benefit) and area(s) of operation (ie where that benefit will be applied). The main considerations for deciding what charitable activities will be carried out in any region and to any group of beneficiaries are, firstly, a demonstrable need of charity and, secondly, that the charitable aid or services are delivered within the law&mdash;both charity law and all other laws that apply.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.0/10" class="indent">PQ 229923: Charity trustees must act with due diligence to ensure that their charity's assets and reputation are not at undue risk of harm or abuse from the conduct or activities of the individuals and organisations they work with. They must also ensure that they operate within charity law, and any other applicable law. The Charity Commission has a statutory objective to promote compliance by charity trustees with their legal obligations. The Commission's Compliance and Support function is responsible for the delivery of its regulatory compliance work in this area. Our recently published &quot;Risk and Proportionality Framework&quot; for compliance work, available on our website, sets out the Commission's approach to regulatory compliance work.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.0/11" class="indent">PQ 229943: Charities must operate within the law. It is unacceptable for a charity to support violent or unlawful activities, either in the UK or overseas. The Commission issues a range of guidance to charity trustees to assist them in mitigating the risk of the charity's assets or reputation being used in such unacceptable ways. Where a charity's assets or reputation are abused (whether deliberately or unwittingly) to support such activities, the Commission will act swiftly to resolve the issues&mdash;either by providing support to trustees or, where necessary, intervening by using the Commission's legal powers.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.0/12" class="indent">PQ 229922: The Charity Commission has issued guidance to the charity sector on &quot;Charities Working Internationally&quot; which is publicly available on the Commission's website. The Charity Commission has also issued specific guidance on undertaking particular types of charitable activity such as the relief of need, education and so on. This guidance supports charity trustees to ensure that, no matter what their activities are or where they occur, those activities are charitable and legitimate.</p>
	<p pid="c.17W.0/13" class="indent">I hope this is helpful and please do let my office know if you would like a meeting with Kenneth Dibble.</p>

	<p pid="c.18W.2/3" class="indent">As the Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, it falls to me to respond to your Parliamentary questions concerning charities operating internationally and: the number of charities penalised by the Commission for receiving illegal donations in each of the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.18W.2/4" class="indent">The Charity Commission is the independent regulator of charities in England and Wales.

	<p pid="c.18W.2/5" class="indent">PQ 230100: Charities which work overseas, and are registered with the Charity Commission, are obliged to describe the countries in which they work. However, they are not obliged to specify areas within those countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.18W.2/6" class="indent">Based on information from the register, there are 41,901 charities, based in England and Wales, which operate overseas. A copy of a table which indicates which countries registered charities are operating in has been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.18W.2/7" class="indent">PQ 230101: While the Charity Commission maintains records of the published reports of all the statutory inquiries it has undertaken over the last five years, it does not record this information centrally. Therefore, due to the significant time required to analyse the Commission's records manually, this question can only be answered at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.36W.5/1">The following table sets out the number of constables and police community support officers in England and the Avon and Somerset constabulary for March 2007 and 2008. It is not possible to identify what proportion of constables are, or will be funded by the Home Office during the CSR period as the cost of policing is jointly met through police grant from the Home Office, revenue support grant from the DCLG and the police authority precept on the council tax. Decisions on the number of officers at each rank are an operational matter for the chief constable.</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.5/2">In December 2006, in response to requests from Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities, my predecessor agreed to relax the controls over officer numbers imposed by the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF). As a result of this relaxation, chief constables are able to use the CFF funding where it is most needed, rather than solely to fund police officer posts. This flexibility has given the service the freedom they asked for to employ staff instead of officers in back office and support roles, allowing officers to concentrate on core policing functions.</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.5/3">CFF payments total &pound;274.3 million for England, including &pound;1.422 million for the Avon and Somerset constabulary. As many forces are now taking advantage of the new CFF flexibilities it is not possible to identify how many constable posts continue to be funded through the CFF.</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.5/4">In the case of police community support officers specific grant funding for neighbourhood policing includes a contribution towards the cost of maintaining PCSOs in England. Home Office funding in 2008-09 for neighbourhood policing, including PCSOs, is &pound;310 million, including &pound;7 million for Avon and Somerset to continue implementing neighbourhood policing and to help support the cost of their PCSOs. The Government have announced that this funding will be uprated in each year of the comprehensive spending review period in line with inflation.</p>

	<p pid="c.44W.8/2">The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) has assessed six sites for a multi purpose test centre (MPTC) location in the search area around Haverfordwest in Pembrokeshire.</p>
	<p pid="c.44W.8/3">One site, brought to DSA's attention by Pembrokeshire county council, was confirmed as being suitable. The site is council-owned and Agency staff held positive discussions with council officials regarding its use for motorcycle testing. However, the planning application submitted by DSA was later turned down by the council as was a subsequent appeal against the decision. Because of the problems encountered in finding a suitable location it has not been possible to set a timetable for establishing a MPTC in Pembroke. There is insufficient time to locate a suitable site for a MPTC, obtain planning permission and construct it in Pembroke before the target implementation date for the new practical motorcycle test at the end of March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.44W.8/4">DSA is therefore looking for and assessing other sites which could be used part-time to deliver the off-road manoeuvres exercise. Sites under consideration include sports stadiums, docks, car parks and showgrounds. So far two potential sites have been identified in Pembrokeshire and these are being further assessed. DSA also wrote to Pembrokeshire county council on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-22">22 October</phrase> seeking assistance to locate such suitable sites.</p>
	<p pid="c.44W.8/5">There have been no specific discussions relating to Pembrokeshire but the Secretary of State for Transport has been fully briefed and is aware of the current situation relating to the progress in the development of the network of multi purpose test centres.</p>

	<p pid="c.52W.9/2">Responsibility for civil aeronautical and maritime Search and Rescue (SAR) policy rests with the Department for Transport. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency provides a response and co-ordination service for maritime SAR, counter pollution and salvage. This includes the mobilisation, organisation and tasking of adequate resources, including volunteers, to an incident.</p>
	<p pid="c.52W.9/3">In respect of volunteer organisations co-ordinated, the MCA can call upon 3,500 Voluntary Coastguard Rescue Officers (comprising 390 Teams) and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution has 4,500 lifeboat crew and 4,000 shore side staff at over 230 lifeboat stations. In addition, there are a number of small local organisations who are part of the declared facility system that can also be utilised.</p>
	<p pid="c.52W.9/4">While the MCA records information on the assets it tasks in any civil maritime search and rescue incident, it does not allow for easy retrieval of statistical information on the organisations involved.</p>
	<p pid="c.52W.9/5">The Police Service, through its command infrastructure, co-ordinates land based SAR operations. Voluntary inland Search and Rescue organisations including the mountain rescue volunteers are formed to provide SAR services on land. Operationally, each team is responsible to, and works under the aegis of a co-ordinating authority. This will normally be the police, who collate their own statistical records.</p>

These programmes include wide-ranging alcohol awareness and education, incorporating regular and mandatory briefs supported by a range of media such as posters, information booklets and DVDs. There are also regulations to limit the availability and consumption of alcohol, supported as necessary by the threat of disciplinary action. Medical treatment, welfare support, intervention and rehabilitation programmes operate for those where misuse of alcohol has become a concern or a serious problem.</p>

	<p pid="c.60W.2/1">Funding for the treatment of mental health conditions, of which post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is only one (and not the predominant) diagnosis, is provided from a number of budget areas within the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid="c.60W.2/2">In Iraq and Afghanistan, we deploy highly skilled and experienced uniformed mental health nurses to provide the necessary in-theatre care and treatment for all our personnel. Funding for these personnel, and all associated treatment costs, are provided from overall operational budgets.</p>
	<p pid="c.60W.2/3">In the UK, the majority of treatment is provided on an out-patient basis, through our 15 military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMH) across the UK (plus satellite centres overseas), and funding for these falls to the Single Service Commands. It is not possible to separate out costs from overall unit medical budgets.</p>
	<p pid="c.60W.2/4">In the relatively few cases where in-patient care is required, it is currently provided under external contract. In the last financial year (2007-08), the total contract costs were &pound;3.87 million. Within this total figure, the costs of treating patients who were admitted with a primary working diagnosis of PTSD was &pound;388,000. Note that PTSD can be caused by a range of circumstances and final diagnosis might differ from the initial assessment.</p>
	<p pid="c.60W.2/5">Once individuals are discharged from the armed forces, responsibility for their health care falls to the NHS&mdash;this has been the policy of successive Governments since 1948. There are three main exceptions. First, the Reserves Mental Health Programme (RMHP) provides a mental health assessment plus, if necessary, out-patient treatment at a DCMH, to any current or former member of the UK Volunteer and Regular Reserves who has been demobilised since <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January 2003</phrase> following an overseas operational deployment as a reservist, and who believes that the deployment may have adversely affected their mental health. Medical staffs who provide these assessments and treatment do so as part of their overall duties and are not uniquely engaged on the RMHP; it is not therefore possible to provide an overall cost of the programme without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.60W.2/6">Second, the Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) based at St. Thomas' Hospital, London also offers help for veterans with mental health symptoms. Originally established in 1993 for veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict, the MAP is now available for those with operational service from 1982 (including veterans of the Falklands campaign). Veterans who have recently deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan may also attend if their Service Medical Officer or General Practitioner thinks it would help. The total costs of this programme could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.60W.2/7">Finally, the MOD funds war pensioners undergoing treatment at the Ex-Services Mental Welfare Society ('Combat Stress') homes. MOD gave Combat Stress &pound;2.5 million in individual fees in 2006-07 and agreed, in October 2007, to a phased increase of 45 per cent. to reflect the build-up of staff and capability.</p>

	<p pid="c.61W.2/1">The healthcare of veterans is principally a matter for the national health service and the four UK health Departments, reflecting the need to provide expert care close to an individual's home and family. Information has not been collected on how many former members of the armed forces were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in each of the last five years. However, a sample survey on psychiatric morbidity is currently being carried out by the Office for National Statistics; this includes questions allowing identification of veterans, the time at which they served and whether any traumatic experience that may have caused their condition took place in service. This will allow a clearer understanding of the extent and nature of veterans' mental health problems. In addition, in 2003 we commissioned Kings College London to undertake a study of the health outcomes for some 20,000 personnel deployed to Iraq or in a non-deployed comparator group. This includes analysis of mental health outcomes which so far shows that generally there is not a higher incidence of mental health problems among those deployed though there were some specific areas of concern, notably among reservists; we have taken steps to address this by offering those with operational service since 2003 access to defence medical services where appropriate, for assessment and treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.61W.2/2">We will continue to monitor carefully the research, which has now been extended to cover in addition personnel deployed to Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="c.62W.6/1">The Army Recruiting and Training Division (ARTD), formerly the Army Training and Recruitment Agency, uses the army assurance framework to meet the audit requirements of recommendation 8. The approach is designed to support a culture of continuous improvement and addresses all aspects of training including the trainee learning experience. This includes regular inspections by various parties, as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.62W.6/2" class="indent">1st Party Assurance&mdash;completed at unit level under the direction of the unit commanding officer either weekly or monthly at the discretion of the commanding officer. The results of these inspections are reported annually to HQ ARTD.</p>

The MOD's Directorate General of Training and Education coordinates all 2nd Party audits throughout the armed forces. A unit can expect to be audited by each organisation every two years</p>
	<p pid="c.62W.6/4" class="indent">3rd Party Assurance&mdash;Completed by Ofsted usually every three years, at as little as 24 hours' notice.</p>
	<p pid="c.62W.6/5">The audit of the physical training estate is conducted through the integrated estate management plans (IEMPs). Since 2003 the MOD has improved some 20,000 single living bed spaces for the armed forces, and this will increase to 50,000 by 2013. In total the MOD plans to spend some &pound;8.4 billion on living accommodation over the next decade, which includes &pound;3 billion on delivering new build and upgraded accommodation. Phase One trainees are housed in dormitories which are partitioned into three separate areas, each with four beds, with individual wardrobes and storage cupboards providing a degree of individual privacy. On each floor there are four dormitories, with dedicated sanitary facilities, utility rooms, baggage stores, and communal and recreation areas. A platoon office and a 'duty of care' en suite bedroom are located on each floor, to ensure good visibility of personnel passing through the communal areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.67W.6/1">In line with long-standing practice, the health care of veterans is primarily a matter for the NHS which, evidence indicates, meets the needs of a large proportion of those with mental health problems. We are aware that some veterans seek a service that can provide an expert cultural understanding of the military context of their problems. To address this, the Department is working with the four UK health departments in piloting a new expert mental health care service for veterans in six NHS trusts across the UK. The NHS sites undertaking pilots are: Stafford, Camden and Islington, Cardiff, Bishop Auckland, Plymouth and Scotland. In addition, for those veterans and health professionals not in a pilot catchment area, we have expanded our Medical Assessment Programme (MAP), based at St. Thomas' hospital, London, to include assessment of veterans with mental health symptoms who have operational service since 1982 by a military psychiatrist with considerable service experience. Where appropriate, the Department also funds care at the centres run by the charity Combat Stress for those veterans in receipt of a war pension on the basis that their condition has been accepted as attributable to service.</p>

	<p pid="c.68W.5/1">The Government have looked at what more can be done to counter the growing problem of piracy off the Horn of Africa.

	<p pid="c.68W.5/2">The review recognised the increased incidence of piracy in recent months off the Horn of Africa and Gulf of Aden. It noted that this is an international problem which the UK alone cannot solve and acknowledged that the UK was already supporting international efforts to counter piracy through Combined Task Force 150 and that planning was under way for both NATO and EU operations in which the UK would play a part. The review's main conclusion was that the UK should move beyond simply honouring commitments under international law to respond to individual acts of piracy, towards a more active role in countering piracy.</p>

	<p pid="c.74W.3/41">The principal cause for a later service commencement date has been the significant re-scoping and redesigning of the radio solution following the major reconfiguration of the Ambulance Trusts in 2006. This has resulted in a more resilient and flexible solution being delivered which comes about through the networking of two of the communication control system and the ability of Trust control rooms to connect to either system. It is planned that all Trusts will have full service by the end of 2009.</p>

This provision allowed for radios to be installed in all A&amp;E ambulances, rapid response vehicles, officers cars, patient transport vehicles, on motorbikes and in air ambulances.

	<p pid="c.76W.8/1">Raising awareness of the symptoms of cancer is a key element of the Cancer Reform Strategy. Through the National Awareness and Early Diagnosis Initiative, we will be taking forward work to improve awareness of the signs and symptoms of all cancers, including breast cancer, among men and women. We will be working to support local interventions to increase cancer symptom awareness and encourage early presentation.</p>
	<p pid="c.76W.8/2">We are currently investing in the Improvement Foundation's pilot work to develop and test methods of raising awareness of breast, bowel and lung cancers in 20 of the most deprived areas in the country. Full findings are expected in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="c.76W.8/3">The Department encourages all women to be breast aware. Our Be Breast Aware leaflet (a copy of which has been placed in the Library), produced with Cancer Research UK, sets out the signs and symptoms of breast cancer so women know what to look for.</p>
	<p pid="c.76W.8/4">Male breast cancer is very rare. In England in 2005, 260 men were diagnosed with breast cancer in England compared to 38,108 women, and 77 men died from breast cancer in England compared to 10,244 women.</p>
	<p pid="c.76W.8/5">We acknowledge the importance of raising men's awareness of health issues and encouraging men to take an active interest in their health. Breast Cancer Care has produced an information pack for men, &quot;Men with breast cancer&quot;. The Department contributed towards the cost of the Men's Health Forum's &quot;Men and Cancer&quot; manual, published in 2004, which provides information on prevention and treatment for all cancers that affect men.</p>

	<p pid="c.84W.11/1">This information is not held centrally. Local health service providers, working with their commissioners of health care, determine the configuration of critical care services that most effectively meet the needs of their local populations. Since 2000, there has been an increasing trend for intensive care units to merge with high dependency units as this offers the prospects for the best outcomes for patients associated with the most effective and efficient use of resources.</p>

	<p pid="c.85W.5/1">Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is an oestrogenic hormone formerly used in the treatment of threatened miscarriage.</p>
	<p pid="c.85W.5/2">The Department is aware of several studies that are investigating the risk of abnormalities other than vaginal cancer in women who were exposed to DES in utero. Most of these data come from a large ongoing study conducted by the National Institute of Cancer in the United States. These data have not been formally evaluated but there is some evidence to suggest that the risk of cervical cancer in DES daughters may be increased and limited support for an increased risk of breast cancer in young women. The Department encourages women to attend regular cervical and breast screening.</p>
	<p pid="c.85W.5/3">In 1978 a study commissioned by the Medical Research Council followed up women in the UK who had been exposed to DES and their offspring for all significant health outcomes. Mothers and offspring were flagged at the National Health Service Central Register and coded copies of death and cancer registrations were notified to the researchers. Follow-up was discontinued in 1999 due to small numbers of participants.</p>

	<p pid="c.110W.8/1">We remain very concerned by the humanitarian situation in Gaza. We monitor it closely through humanitarian agencies and NGOs. Ongoing restrictions on Gaza's crossings impact on the provision of humanitarian services, although assistance funded by the Department for International Development (DFID) does get through to those that need it.</p>
	<p pid="c.110W.8/2">DFID assesses the impact of its humanitarian funding for Palestinian refugees in Gaza through regular reporting from the implementing agency, the UN's Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA). Our funding supports the delivery of essential services (particularly health care and education) by UNRWA to registered refugees in Gaza, who are the majority of the population. In 2008, we have provided &pound;19 million to UNRWA.</p>
	<p pid="c.110W.8/3">In March 2008, DFID provided &pound;2 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for its work in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. This helped restore basic services in Gaza such as water, waste water and hospital infrastructure damaged during hostilities, thus reducing public health risks. Our earlier funding for the European Commission's TIM/PEGASE mechanism supported the provision of emergency medical and social services to the population of Gaza and the West Bank and paid salaries of key public sector workers.</p>

	<p pid="c.110W.14/15">The initiative also announced a &pound;20 million grant through UNICEF to help deliver education in emergency, conflict and post-crisis countries. To ensure that this support will have maximum impact, we have recently agreed a common monitoring and evaluation framework with UNICEF and partners to align the grant with the multi-donor Transition Fund held by UNICEF and expect to make disbursements shortly. In addition, DFID is providing UNICEF with &pound;4 million per year to build UNICEF's capacity in humanitarian response, including in the education sector. DFID has worked with UNICEF to ensure that this includes the full funding of a project setting up a roster of education experts for deployment in emergencies.</p>

	<p pid="c.123W.5/1">The information requested was published in the 2007 Budget. It is estimated that the reform of relief from business rates in respect of empty property will increase net tax yields by &pound;950 million in 2008-09 and by &pound;900 million in 2009-10 (and around &pound;900 million thereafter). This estimate reflects the increase in yield from rates, offset against reduced corporation tax yield (because rates are a legitimate deduction from corporation tax) and changes in other tax yields resulting from increased transactions and associated behaviour.</p>

The Commission applied programme-wide corrections on grounds that aspects of programme management undertaken by the Government Office had not complied sufficiently with the Commission's regulations. The outcome was a financial correction of &euro;25 million which represented less than 4 per cent. of these programme's value. The Department accounted for the correction in the financial year, 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="c.127W.6/1">The Department published &quot;Improving the Effectiveness of Rent Arrears Management: Good Practice Guidance&quot; in June 2005. It is aimed at all social landlords and all levels of a landlord's rent arrears management service.</p>
	<p pid="c.127W.6/2">On rent arrears, the guidance makes no explicit reference to debit or credit cards. It stresses the value of preventative measures. It advises landlords, among other things, to ensure that arrears repayment arrangements are realistic by undertaking with the tenant a detailed financial assessment of his or her income and expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="c.127W.6/3">On rent payment, the guidance advises that landlords should provide a diverse range of methods for tenants to pay their rent. These should be well-publicised, flexible, accessible and convenient to use. While credit and debit cards are included in the range of possible payment methods mentioned, the guidance states that any review of payment methods should consider their effectiveness in minimising arrears.</p>
	<p pid="c.127W.6/4">The Housing Corporation is aware that the use of credit and debit cards to pay rent and rent arrears has raised concerns. It has not issued any guidance to housing associations on this, as it is for each individual association to decide its own approach to managing rent payment.</p>
	<p pid="c.127W.6/5">The Housing Corporation supports flexible approaches to the payment of rent and other charges. For many tenants, for example those who may find travelling difficult, being able to use direct debits or online banking provides convenience and security. The Corporation also recognises that it may not be cost-effective for landlords to handle relatively small amounts of cash.</p>
	<p pid="c.127W.6/6">The Corporation has published a financial inclusion toolkit to assist landlords to recognise and tackle the root causes of multiple indebtedness, and to signpost good quality advice and support. Social landlords are expected to manage rent arrears positively, intervening before debt escalates out of control.</p>

	<p pid="c.129W.5/1">'Business Rate Supplements: a White Paper', published in October 2007, set out the Government's plans to introduce a power for county councils, unitary authorities and the Greater London authority to levy supplements on non-domestic properties with a rateable value over &pound;50,000 in both the public and private sectors. Subject to the legislation required to give effect to these proposals, authorities will also be able to introduce more generous safeguards for local businesses. Any estimate of the likely additional costs falling on non-domestic ratepayers as a result of the levying of a supplement will therefore be for the relevant levying authority. Local authorities are required to pay taxes like any other taxpayer. They have considerable freedom as to how they budget to spend the resources available to them, bearing in mind local priorities and their overall resource position.</p>

Prosecution and conviction would be for the simple offence (e.g. assault) without reference to any homophobic motivation. Court data do not contain background information in relation to offences committed, and it is therefore not possible to separate out the number of successful prosecutions and the corresponding sentence imposed for offences with a homophobic motivation.</p>

Fashion industry initiatives, both for London as a national and international fashion centre, and for those working in the industry in this country, are central to the strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.139W.5/2">Creative Britain includes plans to tackle problems faced by the industry and to encourage and support its growth through education, access to technology and to business support, as well as a commitment to promote British fashion on the world stage.</p>

We will work with the industry and with Skillfast UK, the Sector Skills Council for the fashion, textile and apparel industries, to create new apprenticeship opportunities as part of a new Creative Apprenticeships initiative. We will also help the London College of Fashion, the BFC, Skillfast and others to scope a project to develop a High-Fashion Hub for London; this project is intended to be a model for the fashion sector elsewhere in the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.139W.5/4">We will work with the Mayor of London to champion London Fashion Week and help it fight to retain its status as a focal event in the industry calendar amidst increasingly strong international competition.</p>

	<p pid="c.140W.0/1">London's position in the International Congress and Convention Association's (ICCA) rankings for 'number of meetings per city' has fallen over the past three years. However, the UK remained in the top four countries in the rankings of 'number of meetings held per country' over this same period. ICCA advises commentators not to interpret their statistics in isolation, as they only record events that take place regularly and rotate between at least three countries. These statistics do not take into account the corporate and inter-governmental sectors.</p>

	<p pid="c.144W.0/1">As part of the Department's Diversity and Health and well-being policies, we have a range of initiatives and programmes in place to support staff and to manage stress, mental health and behavioural issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.144W.0/2">Furthermore, in order to raise awareness of stress and mental health issues we have implemented a range of initiatives and guidance for managers and staff to manage mental health problems in the workplace including an initiative to tackle the stigma and discrimination associated with mental illness.</p>
	<p pid="c.144W.0/3">We regularly monitor sickness absence and reasons for absences as a means to tackle attendance issues and provide support to our staff.

	<p pid="c.144W.0/6">The Department has completed a stress audit recently and the overall departmental analysis shows that there are no areas of high risk stress across the Department, and only three areas of medium risk. We are now in the process of drawing up an action plan to address the issues highlighted in the report. We will also be running a health event in November which will aim to raise awareness of health and well-being issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.144W.0/7">The Department's sick pay policy pays for sickness absence on full pay for up to six months in any period of 12 months absence&mdash;followed by half pay for sickness of up to a maximum of 12 months in any period of four years or less.</p>

	<p pid="c.145W.8/2">Lord Burns' independent review, commissioned by the Football Association (FA), recommended a number of measures designed to reform their decision-making structure in order to make it a more modern, effective and representative governing body for football. His recommendations fell into five main areas: a reformed FA board headed by an independent chairman; a broader, more representative FA Council to act as the &quot;parliament of football&quot;; a new semi-autonomous regulation and compliance body; the creation of a Community Football Alliance to bridge the governing body functions for the professional and national sides of the game; and a funding formula to clearly set out the distribution of FA surpluses.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.8/3">The recommendations were approved by the FA Council in October 2006 and by the AGM in May 2007. Since that time the new FA board has been introduced, with five representatives for each of the professional and national game, alongside the FA CEO and Lord Triesman as the FA's first independent chairman. In addition, the FA Council has expanded to incorporate greater representation for players, supporters, managers, referees, ethnic minorities, disability football, women's football and other areas of the game. The new Football Regulatory Authority acts as an oversight body for the FA's governance and regulation activities. The funding formula is also now in operation and measures have been putt in place to bridge the gap between the professional and national games.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.8/4">As part of the monitoring process the FA will review the changes they have put in place at Council, Board and Football Regulatory Authority level by 2012.</p>

	<p pid="c.146W.2/1">Most of Hemel Hempstead and its surrounding areas receive signals from the 'Hemel Hempstead' transmitter at Bedmond. This transmitter already broadcasts digital signals and digital terrestrial television (DTT) coverage and should be generally good. There is a small area in the centre of the town where terrain and tall buildings screen viewers from the main Hemel Hempstead transmitter. In that area, viewers receive signals from the much smaller 'Hemel Hempstead Town' relay transmitter. Hemel Hempstead Town only broadcasts four analogue services at present and therefore DTT reception will not be possible for viewers that rely on it.</p>
	<p pid="c.146W.2/2">When switchover occurs, Hemel Hempstead Town relay will be converted to broadcast digital services and the power of the digital services from the transmitter at Bedmond will also be increased. These two measures should improve the reception reliability of the digital services and extend their reach to match that of the analogue services they replace. Switchover is due to occur in the ITV London region in 2012.</p>

	<p pid="c.149W.5/1">My Department has received detailed recommendations from People 1st on improving the skills of staff working in the tourism industry. These recommendations were outlined in Raising the Bar: the National Skills Strategy for hospitality, leisure, travel and tourism sector in England, which was launched in March 2007. An action plan was produced in November 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.149W.5/2">The strategy outlines a 10-point plan to improve skills in the priority areas of management and leadership, chefs and customer service, as well as to improve staff retention by supporting and developing employees and making them aware of career development opportunities. It was developed by People 1st following extensive research with 5,000 employers about their skills needs and a review of training and qualifications. This was supported by my Department through four Ministerial Skills summits between 2005 and 2007 which received recommendations from four employer working groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.149W.5/3">The 10-point plan includes an online skills and employment resource called the UKSP which provides a wealth of benefits for businesses looking to improve training in their organisations and for individuals looking to develop careers in the industry, by matching skilled applicants to good employers. The plan also includes action to reform qualifications, support for small businesses, establish a new national skills academy for hospitality to raise standards of delivery of training, improve the quality of apprenticeships, develop new 14-19 diplomas in hospitality and in travel and tourism, launch a campaign to promote careers and improve perceptions of jobs in the sector, and develop a pre-employability package aimed at jobseekers. Further details can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="c.149W.5/5">I met People 1st in my first few weeks as Tourism Minister and I will be working closely with them and the new academy to ensure that these recommendations are implemented consistently across England. As part of this, I will be chairing the second meeting of the National Skills Strategy Monitoring and Implementation Group later this year, to review how all partners&mdash;public and private&mdash;are helping take the recommendations forward, and address any barriers to implementation.</p>

	<p pid="c.152W.8/1">The Government commissioned Ed Gallagher, chairman of the Renewable Fuels Agency, to lead a study on the indirect effects of biofuel production, including the impact on food prices.</p>
	<p pid="c.152W.8/2">The Gallagher Review, published in July this year, concluded that increasing demand for biofuels contributes to rising prices for some commodities, notably for oil seeds. For most crops however, price rises in the longer term are rarely more than 5 per cent. But the risk of impacts on food prices is one of the reasons why we are calling for a more cautious approach for biofuels.</p>
	<p pid="c.152W.8/3">Biofuels are not the only reason why food prices have increased in recent years. Other factors include smaller harvests in 2007 because of droughts; higher fertiliser and oil prices; rising GDP; and changing diets leading to a higher demand for animal feed.</p>

	<p pid="c.153W.2/1">Vaccination against bluetongue in England and Wales is voluntary, and delivered through existing veterinary medicine supply chains, an approach agreed with the livestock industry to ensure the simple, rapid roll-out of vaccine to protect animals earlier this year. Because the approach to vaccination is voluntary, no definitive figures can be provided on the numbers of livestock actually vaccinated.</p>
	<p pid="c.153W.2/2">However, to date, sales data from the supply chain suggests the overall uptake of vaccine across the whole of England is around 60 per cent. Initial vaccine uptake was high&mdash;reaching between 80 per cent. and 90 per cent. in the south east and east of England, but uptake in the counties of northern England and in Wales has been lower.</p>

	<p pid="c.159W.3/1">The EU directive on packaging and packaging waste (2004/12/EC) requires all member states to ensure that a minimum of 60 per cent. of all packaging waste is recovered (of which 55 per cent. must be recycled). The directive specifies material specific recovery/recycling targets of 60 per cent. for glass, 60 per cent. for paper/board, 50 per cent. for metals, 22.5 per cent. for plastics and 15 per cent. for wood. We are currently on track to achieve these targets by <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-31">31 December 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.159W.3/2">The UK has transposed this directive through two pieces of legislation&mdash;the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations (Amendment) 2008 and the Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended).</p>
	<p pid="c.159W.3/3">Under the producer responsibility regulations, companies must ensure that a proportion of the packaging they handle is recovered and recycled. The amount they must recycle depends on how much packaging they handle, the activities they have carried out with that packaging e.g. retailing, packer filling and the targets set by the Government. Small companies or companies who do not handle much packaging are exempted from the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="c.159W.3/4">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) has been working with retailers, brands and manufacturers to reduce packaging waste. WRAP has been working specifically to increase the amount of recycled material used by the UK manufacturing sector, to promote recycling by consumers and householders and advising local authorities on their recycling schemes.</p>

	<p pid="c.165W.2/1">Iranian leaders argue that the situation of women in Iran is better than in other countries in the region and are rightly proud that women make up over half of all university students. However, women remain largely excluded from positions of authority, and gender based inequality is widespread and reinforced by Iranian law. We are particularly concerned by the treatment of Iranian women connected to the Campaign for Equality (which aims to collect 1 million signatures on a petition demanding changes to discriminatory laws and educate women about their rights). Many, throughout the country, have been arrested for peaceful activities in support of the campaign and sentenced to prison terms or flogging sentences on charges such as 'acting against national security' and 'propaganda against the system'. The Campaign's website has been blocked by the Iranian authorities 16 times. With the EU, we continue to make our concerns about this known to the Iranian authorities, and have done so at least four times this year. In a public declaration issued on <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-06">6 August</phrase> the EU condemned the arrest of three women's rights activists arrested in Kurdistan province and called on the Iranian authorities to</p>
	<p pid="c.165W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;release these activists unconditionally as soon as possible and to drop all charges against them and other activists of the One Million Signatures campaign who are still under investigation or arrest&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.165W.2/3">The EU condemned this persecution and intimidation once again in a human rights d&eacute;marche delivered on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-06">6 October</phrase>, and called for the release of 16 detained women's rights activists connected to the campaign.</p>

	<p pid="c.165W.5/1">We have serious concerns about Iran's poor human rights record. Together with the EU, we remain committed to raising these concerns regularly with the Iranian Government and continue to press them to work towards international human rights standards and fulfilment of their obligations under UN human rights conventions. We have done so more than 30 times this year in bilateral and EU meetings with the Iranian authorities and in public declarations. Senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials raised concerns about the execution of juvenile offenders, during the visit of Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Safari in September. The most recent EU human rights demarche, covering the full range of concerns, was delivered by the EU presidency on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-06">6 October</phrase> in Paris, as Iran is becoming increasingly reluctant to receive representations about human rights in Tehran. Recent EU statements have focussed on juvenile execution cases, the situation of religious and ethnic minorities, and the proposed draft penal code which, if adopted, would set out a mandatory death sentence for apostasy. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and speak out about human rights violations in Iran.</p>

We do not get involved in Iran's internal political debates, as these are for Iranians themselves to resolve, but together with the EU we continue to promote the internationally recognised principles to which so many Iranians aspire including freedom of speech and transparent, genuinely democratic and accountable government. Our work to assist the development of civil society around the world will continue in support of this goal. We have concerns that Iran's electoral processes do not allow for truly competitive elections or democratic opposition, and have urged the Iranian Government to give their citizens a genuine democratic choice about their country's future, and the opportunity to choose from the full range of candidates.</p>

The length of time taken to grant each kind of assistance can also vary significantly between different cases: in many cases eligibility can be assessed very quickly, but sometimes we may require more information from applicants, or need to carry out checks to substantiate claims, particularly if those concerned left our employ some time ago.</p>

However, the UK does support President Karzai and his Government in their efforts to reconcile all parties to Afghanistan's democratic constitution and to bring disaffected Afghans into society's mainstream, providing they renounce violence and accept Afghanistan's constitution. In Pakistan, the UK is working to support the Government of Pakistan's 'multi-pronged' strategy to tackle militancy in the tribal belt, including development, governance reform and security measures. As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary made clear during his visit to Pakistan in April this year, we support the Government of Pakistan's plans to reconcile with people who are willing to participate in politics in a non-violent way. Such reconciliation should be designed to marginalise those who are using extremist means for ideological reasons.</p>

	<p pid="c.169W.5/1">I am not aware of any occasions on which British officials have formally interviewed Wouter Basson. When the Government became aware of allegations that South Africa had an offensive Chemical and Biological Weapons (CBW) programme, UK experts visited South Africa to obtain a clearer assessment of the programmes which had been halted by the South African authorities in 1992. This included meetings at which Basson, as the senior scientist involved, was present.</p>

Officials from my Department are actively discussing with TIGA, the national trade association representing the video games industry, a range of issues including the shortage of skilled recruits. We are encouraging the sector to work closely with the relevant Sector Skills Councils and with Higher Education Institutions to address their skill needs. In particular we have suggested that the industry should explore the potential of Foundation Degrees or Employer Co-funding in addition to graduate recruitment. We are also interested in promoting opportunities for undergraduates to obtain work experience and we are exploring with the industry what more we can do to encourage staff exchanges.</p>

	<p pid="c.183W.3/1">Information on the date a decision is made that adoption is in the best interest is currently only collected retrospectively for those looked after children who are adopted. We currently do not collect information on when the decision is made for those children that are placed for adoption. However we have made a change to our data collection from 2008-09 which will mean from autumn 2009 we are able to provide this information for children when the decision is made, irrespective of whether the adoption has taken place.</p>
	<p pid="c.183W.3/2">Information is published on the number of looked after children adopted by local authority. However this cannot be broken down by ethnicity due to data disclosure reasons. The number of children adopted in the year ending <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase> is just over 3,000. Breaking this down by local authority (see table LAE1) and then again by ethnicity would produce very small numbers and would result in most of the figures being suppressed with a hyphen (-). It may be possible to produce figures by local authority and ethnicity by region but we would be able to provide this only at a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.183W.3/3">The available information by local authority can be found in table LAE1, taken from the Statistical First Release (SFR 27/2007) entitled 'Children looked after in England (including adoption and care leavers) year ending <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>'.

	<p pid="c.185W.0/1">Our policy is for all pupils, irrespective of background or ability, to have an entitlement to a core of learning set out in the National Curriculum statutory Programmes of Study. It is the role of Government to decide the overall aims, values, principles and subject requirements of the National Curriculum, to ensure that all young people are prepared for their future role in society.</p>
	<p pid="c.185W.0/2">Within this statutory framework, schools have the freedom to decide how to organise learning, taking account of local circumstances and the interests, aptitudes and backgrounds of their pupils.</p>
	<p pid="c.185W.0/3">Schools may decide when and how National Curriculum Programmes of Study are delivered, which aspects to cover in depth, and how long to spend on each subject. They are not required to teach the subjects discretely and there are no prescribed time allocations for particular subjects. Schools may adapt the Programmes of Study in order to provide all pupils with appropriately challenging work at each key stage; they may group pupils in whichever way best meets their needs and are free to use a range of teaching methods. Head teachers may also introduce other experiences and subjects once they are satisfied that they are meeting the statutory requirements of the National Curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="c.185W.0/4">Recent curriculum developments have been aimed at reducing the statutory core and allowing schools even more autonomy to organise their curriculum. With these changes I believe we have got the balance right between a national statutory curriculum entitlement and a school-level curriculum designed to meet the specific needs of pupils.</p>

These will be subject to consultation with employee representatives. A blueprint for the YPLA and a Post 19 implementation strategy are being developed for publication this autumn which will provide further detail.</p>
	<p pid="c.188W.8/3">It is therefore too early to be able to provide staffing numbers for each agency at this stage. However, we are committed to retaining the valuable expertise of as many LSC people as possible and will continue to do all we can to support LSC staff, working with their representatives, to ensure they have as much certainty as possible about what their options will be, as the new organisational set up becomes clearer. The LSC has a good track record of delivering major restructuring programmes. For example, 'theme 7' of the LSC's Agenda for Change programme undertaken last year was designed to further streamline the organisation and give local offices a more strategic role, built around a stronger relationship with local authorities and other key stakeholders. Since 2003 staffing levels at the organisation have reduced from 7,000 to 3,451 (the average number of staff in full time equivalent numbers employed by the LSC for the year ending March 2008, including 269 agency and temporary staff and five inward secondees).</p>

	<p pid="c.194W.2/1">The information requested in his question (232413) is not held centrally, however Advanced Skills Teachers, Leading Teachers, and other primary school teachers may be able to provide primary schools with specialist mathematics support. We do not hold numbers for how many are doing this centrally. The recent &quot;Independent Review of Mathematics Teaching in Early Years Settings and Primary Schools&quot; by Sir Peter Williams estimated that approximately 3,000 teachers with a mathematics specialism are currently working in primary schools. By 2019 we will have implemented Sir Peter's main recommendation in accordance with his timetable, so that all primary schools will have access to a mathematics specialist teacher with their numbers increasing to around 13,000.</p>

	<p pid="c.198W.2/2">There is currently no statutory entitlement for free bus travel for young people. At present 48 per cent. of young people walk or cycle to school and there is a risk that a blanket concession could encourage young people who currently walk or cycle to take the bus. However, local authorities can use their existing powers to offer local concessionary travel to young people.</p>

At secondary age, pupils attending one of their three nearest schools that is between two and six miles from their home, and those attending their nearest school preferred on grounds of religion or belief between two and 15 miles, will be entitled to free school transport.</p>

Rather, local authorities, 14-19 partnerships and consortia take student travel time and cost of travel into account in planning for diploma delivery.</p>
	<p pid="c.203W.5/2">In each of the 40 most rural areas, we have funded the post of Transport and Access Co-ordinator (at &pound;75,000 per local authority for 18 months from September 2008) to allow these local authorities to investigate and arrange more effective and efficient transport for their young people accessing diplomas. We have also made funding available through the diploma formula grant to reflect the additional costs of travel between institutions in more sparsely populated local authorities. Details of how this funding was calculated can be found in the diploma grant guidance issued to local authorities and 14-19 partnerships in December 2007.

	<p pid="c.210W.2/2">Information from the LSC from 2006-07, the last complete academic year for which we have data, shows that 480,000 work experience placements took place during Key Stage 4, supported by education business partnership organisations. We estimate that around 300,000 employers work with education each year. On that basis we are confident that young people will continue to have access to work experience but will keep this under review.</p>

	<p pid="c.211W.0/1">The Government believe that the EU's commitment to a 30 per cent. reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of a comprehensive international agreement should be built firmly into the current EU Climate and Energy Package. We believe that the trigger for moving to the higher EU GHG target should be the EU's ratification of an international climate agreement for post-2012. Once the decision to ratify is taken, we favour amending the EU's implementing legislation by the comitology procedure rather than co-decision. This is in line with the proposal from the European Commission and the position taken by the European Parliament. However, ultimately, it is the commitment to the 30 per cent. reduction target that is of greatest importance. Whatever process is put in place to move to a higher target, it must be swift and transparent.</p>

For the remaining 14, wasted heat energy is assessed at approximately 1.1 TWh for the year 2006. This calculation allows for some plants that are not yet working at full capacity and takes into account their own energy requirements for incineration.

	<p pid="c.213W.0/2">In the context of the Energy Bill, the Department has considered the concept of an emission performance standard for new power stations. We do not support the introduction of such a standard because it would not yield any additional carbon savings as missions from the power sector are already capped under the EU emissions trading scheme. Furthermore, it presents a number of risks:</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.0/3" class="indent">potentially undermining the EU ETS;</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.0/4" class="indent">to the UK's security of energy supplies&mdash;in particular it would be likely to lead to increased dependence on gas and therefore in turn, higher electricity prices for consumers; and</p>
	<p pid="c.213W.0/5" class="indent">to the deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies, should such a standard rule out new coal-fired power stations. This is because the lower efficiency of existing coal-fired power stations makes retrofitting of carbon capture and storage equipment a less attractive option, because that in itself will reduce the efficiency of a power station.</p>

	<p pid="c.214W.2/1">The latest available statistical information on the timeliness of inquests relates to the calendar year 2007. The estimated average time taken to complete inquests in 2007 by coroners in England was 25 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="c.214W.2/2">Statistics on inquests lasting more than one year have been collected only since 2004. However, I can confirm that 9 per cent. of inquests concluded by coroners in England in 2007 took over a year. I can also confirm that all coroner jurisdictions except two (the Isles of Scilly and the Queen's Household, which both have only a very small number of inquests in a year) concluded at least one inquest in either 2006 or 2007 where the time taken was more than a year. These figures relate only to those inquests where the death occurred in England and Wales. Timeliness statistics are not collected by the Department for inquests where the death occurred elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="c.214W.2/3">There are a number of reasons why individual inquests can take considerably longer man the average time of 25 weeks. These include the need for coroners to await medical reports and the completion of investigations by other agencies such as the police, the Health and Safety Executive, and the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-11-03c.232942.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-11-03c.221W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" speakername="Michael Wills" colnum="221W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081103/text/81103w0052.htm#08110419005969">
	<p pid="c.221W.2/1">The Commission has powers under section 146 (3) of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 to enter premises and take copies of information relating to income and expenditure from a registered political party, a recognised third party and a permitted participant in a referendum. This power can be exercised by the Commission for the purposes of carrying out its functions. At present, the power to enter premises does not apply to election agents or candidates in elections (except candidates at a local election in Scotland). However, the Commission does currently have powers under section 146(1) to require the disclosure of documents relating to income and expenditure from election agents or candidates. It is a criminal offence under section 146(5) to fail to comply with such a requirement.</p>
	<p pid="c.221W.2/2">The Bill repeats the existing power to enter in clause 1(5) of Schedule 19A (to be inserted into the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 by Schedule 1 to the Bill). It also extends it to candidates (other candidates in Scottish local government elections), election agents, regulated donees (including MPs) and regulated participants. The result is that the original PPERA power for the Commission to enter premises for the purposes of carrying out its functions will now apply to election agents and candidates, alongside the other individuals and organisations listed in paragraph 1(1) in Schedule 19A.</p>
	<p pid="c.221W.2/3">In addition, the Political Parties and Elections Bill seeks to provide new powers for use by the Commission when it undertakes an investigation into a suspected breach of PPERA. To this end the Bill provides the Commission with new powers to request information, to put questions and to apply for a warrant to enable it to enter premises when carrying out an investigation into a suspected offence or other contravention of the 2000 Act. These powers are capable of applying to election agents and candidates who have such information in the same way that they may apply to anyone else. However, we have also introduced a number of important safeguards for the use of these new powers. In relation to entry of premises under this new power, the Commission will need to apply for a warrant under paragraph 3 of Schedule 19A. There is no automatic right of entry. For a warrant to be issued, the Commission must demonstrate on oath to a justice of the peace that it have reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed (or other contravention of PPERA has occurred). They must also establish that documents are on the premises that were withheld following an earlier request or that are otherwise relevant to the investigation. When entering the premises, they must be accompanied at all times by a constable.</p>
	<p pid="c.221W.2/4">As I made clear in the Second Reading debate on the Bill, we have heard the force of opinion in the House on the issue of the Commission's powers and will consider what can be done to address it.</p>

	<p pid="c.224W.2/1">There are two statistical counts of persistent offenders used in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="c.224W.2/2">The first count is of persistent young offenders (PYOs). A PYO is a young person aged 10 to 17 who has been sentenced guilty of recordable offences on three or more separate occasions, and within three years of the last of these is arrested by the police for a further recordable offence.</p>
	<p pid="c.224W.2/3">During the three month period from April to June 2008, there were 7,389 criminal court cases across England and Wales in which PYOs were found guilty and sentenced. In the London metropolitan area there were 804 such cases. Of these, 17 were in the borough of Hillingdon. Counts of cases against offenders are not collected at any level lower than this borough.</p>
	<p pid="c.224W.2/4">Further information on PYOs can be found on the Ministry of Justice website:</p>
	<p pid="c.224W.2/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/averagetimearresttosentencepyo.htm">www.justice.gov.uk/publications/averagetime arresttosentencepyo.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="c.224W.2/6">The second is for prolific and other priority offenders (PPOs). The PPO programme tackles a small hard-core of offenders (not confined to any age group) who commit a disproportionate amount of crime, and cause disproportionate damage to their communities. It is a crime reduction programme with a reducing re-offending focus.</p>
	<p pid="c.224W.2/7">Data from the PPO scheme performance framework indicated that at the end of March 2008 there were a total of 11,296 PPOs being managed in England and Wales. In London, there were 1,172 of these offenders being managed, of whom 23 were in Hillingdon. Counts of offenders being managed are not available at lower level than this borough.</p>
	<p pid="c.224W.2/8">Additional information on PPOs is available on the Home Office Crime Reduction web-pages:</p>

	<p pid="c.225W.2/1">The effect of clause 10 of the Political Parties and Elections Bill (Bill 141) will be that the key consideration in determining whether or not the candidate expenditure limit applies will be the purpose for which expenditure is used. Whether or not a person has formally announced or promoted their candidature will not be the crucial factor, as the clause provides that election expenses can include those incurred by a person who later formally becomes a candidate.</p>

	<p pid="c.225W.5/1">The figures in the impact assessment for the numbers of donations potentially affected by the additional declaration requirements in clause 8 of the Political Parties and Elections Bill are estimates, as there is no publicly available data on the number of donations accepted by political parties of amounts between &pound;200 and the thresholds above which the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 requires that donations be reported to the Electoral Commission and publicly disclosed. The estimates were arrived at through extrapolating from the publicly available data on donations of over &pound;5,000 to parties' central offices and &pound;1,000 to local accounting units. These estimates were intended to represent an average yearly figure, taking into account the fact that levels of donations increase considerably towards the end of an electoral cycle.</p>
	<p pid="c.225W.5/2">The Government accept that a number of political parties have concerns that the impact assessment underestimates the compliance burden that the requirements of clause 8 might impose on political parties. As I indicated at Second Reading of the Political Parties and Elections Bill, representations have been received from a number of parties that the &pound;200 limit is too low, and we have also received wider representations about the impact of clause 8 on those charged with complying with the law. Although I am clear that greater transparency is essential, it should not be achieved at the cost of overburdening political parties and I am ready to consider representations on the detail of our proposals in that area.</p>

	<p pid="c.227W.0/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that violence in prisons is not tolerated in any form. Since 2004, a national strategy has directed every public sector prison to have in place a local violence reduction strategy and from mid 2007 this has been applied to both the public sector and contracted estate. A whole prison approach is encouraged, engaging all staff, all disciplines and prisoners in challenging unacceptable behaviour, problem-solving and personal safety. The Prison Officers Association are partners in its approach.</p>

Assault information is recorded at establishment level in four categories: Prisoner on Prisoner, Prisoner on Officer, Prisoner on Other and Other (which may include non-prisoner perpetrators). The 'Prisoner on Officer' and 'Prisoner on Other' categories mostly refer to assaults on staff. However 'the latter category may include some non staff victims for example visitors. The 'Other' category includes assaults or allegations of assault by non prisoners including any by staff, visitors etc.</p>

	<p pid="c.234W.3/2">Before the establishment of the Department for Energy and Climate Change, Government responsibility for funding fuel poverty programmes rested with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, not the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR). However, between 2005-06 and 2007-08, BERR contributed &pound;2 million to two demonstration programmes in north-east England and Yorkshire and Humberside to provide microgeneration and mains gas to deprived communities. In June 2008, BERR announced a further &pound;3 million fuel poverty pilot within the Low Carbon Buildings Programme. BERR has also made available &pound;150,000 to Citizens Advice to deliver the 'Energy Best Deal' project, which will promote switching of supplier among vulnerable groups. These funding streams are moving to the new Department for Energy and Climate Change.</p>

Sectoral restrictions apply principally in the transport, agriculture, coal and steel sectors. Restrictions generally arise from either the Industrial Development Act of 1982, which provides the statutory basis for SFLG, or from European State Aid rules designed to prevent public interventions from distorting the market. In April 2003, sectoral restrictions on retail, catering and other local service businesses were removed.</p>
