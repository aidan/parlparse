The work is being funded by Defra's BREW (Business Resource Efficiency and Waste) programme with just under &pound;600,000 spent in 2005.

	<p pid="d.2W.5/1">The most common process for converting vegetable oil into biodiesel is trans-esterification. This process is well known from years of use in the oleochemical sector. However, the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership will be looking at the specific environmental impacts of biodiesel processing as part of their work on developing draft environmental standards for biofuels. The impacts in terms of pollution to air, land and water are controlled by the Environment Agency. A pollution prevention control permit is required where biodiesel is being produced for own-use by six or more people or for commercial operations producing more than 5,000 litres a year. The processing of biodiesel from waste cooking oil and tallow is also subject to waste management controls. Various studies have assessed the greenhouse gas impact across the whole production process from raw material to finished biodiesel. UK-produced biodiesel typically gives greenhouse gas savings of around 55 per cent. compared to fossil diesel.</p>

	<p pid="d.3W.0/1">The current skin test for bovine tuberculosis is an effective test. It is the accepted standard laid down in both national and international legislation for determining the existence of the disease in a cattle herd. Under EU law, the gamma-interferon diagnostic blood test may be used to supplement the skin test. It is considered marginally more sensitive than the skin test, but less specific. This means that it results in a higher probability of false positives. EU legislation allows for the gamma-interferon test to be used to pick up cases missed by the skin test, but not to overrule it.</p>

	<p pid="d.6W.6/2">Prior to April 2004 most of the Environment Agency's flood defence funding came from levies paid by local authorities. These levies have now largely been replaced by direct funding from Defra. Local authorities still pay some levies to the agency and also continue to fund other flood defence related work; such expenditure is supported by the local government funding mechanisms operated by what is now ODPM.</p>

	<p pid="d.7W.5/1">Landfills are a major source of emissions of methane&mdash;a powerful greenhouse gas&mdash;and also a potential pollution hazard requiring careful management. For this reason landfill lies at the bottom of the waste hierarchy, and thus represents the least favourable management route for most wastes. The Government has targets under the EU Landfill Directive to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste going to landfill to 75 per cent. of 1995 figures by 2010 and to 35 per cent. by 2020. The Government seeks to discourage all landfill&mdash;including that of commercial waste&mdash;through the landfill tax escalator. Landfill remains, however, the best management route for certain wastes in certain circumstances and, indeed, the only available option for some others (such as heavy sludges from industrial processes).</p>

	<p pid="d.15W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.5/2">A discussion paper published jointly by HM Treasury and the Department for Transport in March 2003, entitled 'Aviation and the Environment: using economic instruments', considered the role of economic instruments and the environmental costs of aviation. This was also considered in 'Air Transport White Paper, The Future of Air Transport', published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-16">16 December 2003</phrase> and in chapter 5 of 'Aviation and Global Warming', published by the Department for Transport on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-10">10 February 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.5/3">The Air Transport White Paper set out the conclusions of the Government's analysis, including our view that aviation should be brought within the ED emissions trading scheme by 2008, as the most effective way of tackling the climate change impact. Along with other measures to tackle local environmental impacts, this will help to ensure that the air transport sector meets its environmental costs.</p>
	<p pid="d.15W.5/4">Under the terms of the Chicago convention, it is illegal to tax fuel for international flights, and so the Government have not undertaken an analysis of the potential revenue implications that would result from taxation of fuel used on international flights. Also, figures for aviation turbine fuel consumption for specific flight services are not collected. It is therefore not possible to estimate the potential revenue effect of applying the same tax treatment to the domestic aviation industry as to public transport bus companies. The Government anyway does not accept such direct comparisons as valid as they assume no change in demand or to the working practices of the aviation industry.</p>

	<p pid="d.17W.6/1">The House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology did an investigation, which reported in November 2000 and said:</p>
	<p pid="d.17W.6/2" class="indent">The absence of confirmed cases of tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) poisoning from cabin air and the very low levels of TOCP that would be found in even in the highly unlikely worst case of contamination from oil leaking into the air supply lead us to conclude that the concerns about significant risk to the health of airline passengers and crew are not substantiated.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.17W.6/3">In 2004 the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) published research into fume events by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory Porton Down and the (then) Defence Evaluation and Research Agency. That concluded that</p>
	<p pid="d.17W.6/4" class="indent">'no single component or set of components can be identified which at conceivable concentrations would definitely cause the symptoms reported in cabin air quality incidents'.</p>
	<p pid="d.17W.6/5">But acids were found which could act as irritants, and as a result CAA brought in specific troubleshooting and maintenance actions to minimise the potential for fume events.</p>
	<p pid="d.17W.6/6">The inter-departmental Aviation Health Working Group has recently arranged for the independent Committee on Toxicity (COT) to review further evidence which the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) has collected. This process is under way and should help us to specify any further research needs in an area where public funds have already been invested without finding a link between cabin air and long-term health problems.</p>
	<p pid="d.17W.6/7">Meanwhile, some research is starting in the USA funded by the Federal Aviation Administration. Government officials are in touch with the research team to monitor progress. In principle, we are interested to join in international research when we have a clearer idea of the needs, and we shall review our position on the American project after the COT has held a formal meeting in public in the spring.</p>

The campaign consisted of a new website, posters and a supporting TV filler film. A new campaign is planned for summer 2006. Aimed at younger children, the 'Cycle Smart' campaign for seven to 10-year-olds is a series of posters and a comic that use Disney characters to communicate simple cycle safety messages, including helmet wearing. The latest edition was released in summer 2003 and we launched a new website, in partnership with Disney, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-18">18 March 2005</phrase>. A new campaign is also planned for later this year.</p>

We have also established a new national standard for cycle training with more than 20 road safety bodies.</p>

	<p pid="d.23W.5/2">It should be recognised that at any individual location there is some element of chance variation in the number of serious accidents between one year and the next, so it would be wrong to conclude automatically that a camera is not effective. However, the Handbook of Rules and Guidance for the National Safety Camera Programme for England and Wales for 2005&ndash;06 published in November 2004, requires partnerships to, at least annually, review the effectiveness of existing camera sites and to specifically consider sites where there appears to be a continuing problem of high numbers of collisions, notwithstanding the use of cameras, to assess whether further or different action should be taken.</p>
	<p pid="d.23W.5/3">In these instances partnerships should consider what alternative cost-effective engineering or other solutions should be implemented to tackle the problem instead of, or in addition to, the cameras. Solutions might include greater speed enforcement, road improvements, traffic calming or road safety education and information measures. Operational cases for 2005&ndash;06 indicated that as a result some 104 camera sites were being stood down.</p>

	<p pid="d.25W.5/1">Where there is a new development such as a housing estate or a business park which provides for public access the responsibility for road and public safety matters principally lies with the owner of the site. This will usually be the developer until the properties are sold after which the owners of the properties fronting the road will become responsible for maintaining it until it is adopted as a publicly maintainable highway by the relevant highway authority. While the road remains unadopted, the relevant street works authority can serve a notice requiring the owners of premises fronting the street to execute such works to obviate danger to traffic using it as may be specified in the notice within a prescribed time. Should the works not be carried out in the required timescale the street works authority may carry out the works itself and recover the costs from the owners of the relevant properties.</p>
	<p pid="d.25W.5/2">In addition, the local traffic authority has a duty to secure the expeditious, convenient and safe movement of vehicular and other traffic, including pedestrians. This applies to all highways and roads to which the public has access, irrespective of whether or not the road has been adopted as a public highway.</p>
	<p pid="d.25W.5/3">The relevant police authority will also have a responsibility for safety matters in its area.</p>
	<p pid="d.25W.5/4">Where the new development is a new highway intended for use by the public and does not impinge on an existing highway the highway authority promoting the new highway and which makes the orders in relation to the construction of the new highway is the authority responsible for road and public safety matters during the construction stage as well as after adoption of the road as a public highway.</p>
	<p pid="d.25W.5/5">When the new development is an improvement to an existing highway, depending upon the circumstances, either the highway authority promoting the improvement to the highway or the traffic authority which regulates the use of the existing highway is the authority responsible for road and public safety matters. Usually the relevant highway authority and the relevant traffic authority are the same authority.</p>
	<p pid="d.25W.5/6">Who the relevant highway authority or the relevant traffic authority is will depend upon the location of the highway development, the classification of the highway (i.e. local road, trunk road or special road) and the nature of the development.</p>

	<p pid="d.27W.6/2">In the meantime, we have asked the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership to take forward two separate but related pieces of work in this area, both of which have been part-funded by this Department. The first is the development of an agreed and user-friendly methodology to allow the carbon savings from different biofuels to be calculated. The second is the development of a sustainability assurance standard for all biofuels.</p>

	<p pid="d.31W.2/1">The current armed forces pay structure, known as pay 2000, does not use the 'trade pay' system. Instead it places each rank within each and every trade into either a higher or lower pay band, based upon job weight.</p>
	<p pid="d.31W.2/2">All Infantry and Royal Armoured Corps (RAC) trades have undergone job evaluation within the last two years. As a result, from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase> the only differences in pay banding between the infantry and RAC will be at colour sergeant rank where the infantry are in the lower band, and RAC staff sergeants (the equivalent rank) are in the higher band, and at corporal rank where infantry corporals are in the higher band and RAC crewmen are in the lower range. Infantry soldiers are paid in the higher band at all ranks except private and colour sergeant.</p>

	<p pid="d.33W.5/1">When the scheme was first announced in November 2000, it was intended that payments would be made only to those British civilian internees who could demonstrate a close link with the United Kingdom at the time of internment. In March 2001, this close link was defined in terms of the individual or one of his or her parents or grandparents having been born in the UK. This definition was made public in July 2001 and has become known as the birthlink criterion. My Department is currently undertaking a review of the scheme to establish what criteria were used for claims from British civilian internees that were decided before the introduction of the birthlink definition. I will report the outcome to the House.</p>

	<p pid="d.35W.8/1">The Defence Training Review (DTR) programme is currently evaluating the bidding consortia's proposals. The impact on further and higher education sectors and manufacturing companies depends on bidders' training and estates solutions, the extent to which the education and manufacturing sectors are drawn into training design, delivery and support and the exploitation of third party opportunities and revenue. Until the evaluation phase is complete and a decision has been taken to select a preferred training partner, I am not in a position to make any detailed comment on the wider impact of the DTR solution.</p>

	<p pid="d.38W.5/2">It is of course the primary responsibility of the Afghan Government to treat individuals it detains in accordance with international law.

	<p pid="d.41W.5/1">Physiological trauma may arise as a result of any physical injury or illness, including environmental injury, and its treatment is an integral part of the medical care and support given to injured armed forces personnel by members of the Defence Medical Services.</p>
	<p pid="d.41W.5/2">When deployed on operations, United Kingdom forces are supported by a range of in-theatre medical facilities, staffed by fully-qualified military medical personnel. These are capable of providing immediate treatment in theatre, and are backed up by fast and efficient medevac procedures to return personnel to the UK for further treatment as necessary.</p>
	<p pid="d.41W.5/3">On return to the UK, injured personnel will be given the treatment they need, usually through one of the MOD's Ministry of Defence hospital units attached to NHS hospitals. When necessary, follow-up treatment is provided through specialist units such as the 15 regional rehabilitation units (RRUs) in the UK and Germany, and the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court, which provides world-class medical care, rehabilitation, prosthetics and adaptations for service personnel. Where there are psychological consequences, further treatment is provided through one of 15 MOD Departments of community mental health located in the UK (plus other satellite centres overseas), or if necessary through in-patient care at Priory Group facilities, with whom there is close liaison.</p>

	<p pid="d.45W.7/2">During the review use of periodicals was recorded over a 12-month period. As a result many periodicals that were no longer being used widely were cancelled, titles taken in duplicate were reduced where practicable, with copies held in the place of greatest use, and a number of closed runs were disposed of. &pound;29,000 of savings have been redeployed to meet new needs, including subscriptions to electronic sources. Out of 1,400 titles 419 current subscriptions were cancelled and a further 319 closed runs of older titles agreed for disposal. Some cancellations were made during the summer of 2004, and the majority came into effect in January 2005, when existing annual subscriptions ended. The large majority of cancelled titles were not kept on display in the Members Library as they were of marginal interest and not in demand. The Library has subsequently received a small number of queries from Members with regard to specific titles, as a result of which two titles have been relocated to the Members Library and five titles reinstated. Single articles from titles not held in the Library can be obtained for Members through Inter Library Loan.</p>

The responsibility for co-ordinating preparation and holding camps lies with the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG) in conjunction with the British Olympic Association who are developing a pre-training guide and application process to assist the Devolved Administrations and the English Regions in securing these training camps. The 2012 Nations and Regions Group, chaired by Charles Allen, will also be working with the Regions to develop plans for maximising the benefits of hosting the Games and regional working groups will be fully engaged on this issue as work goes forward.</p>

We remain committed to play and we are developing a more strategic approach to play policy through the cross departmental group which was set up last year.</p>

	<p pid="d.56W.8/1">The UK Film Council provides financial assistance to film projects to help deliver a consistent flow of high quality and culturally significant films. All film projects are selected according to an assessment of their cultural and creative merits. Funding will generally be given only to projects that are wholly or substantially capable of certification as a 'British' film. However, the UK Film Council is able to exercise discretion and may still elect to finance a film if there are other strong cultural reasons for doing so. Full details of the eligibility criteria for individual funding schemes are available on the UK Film Council website at <a href="http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk">www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk</a></p>

Some 15,000 individuals' experiences are now represented in the archive, of which close to half cover service in the Second World War, and the collection is continuing to grow.

Beyond that, the Department is currently trialling apprenticeships for adult entry in three sectors: engineering, construction and health and social care, and discussions are taking place to include the IT sector. These trials are due to complete in March 2006, although some programmes may take longer depending upon their starting date. We will decide in the light of these trials how the apprenticeship model can be adapted to the needs of older entrants to an occupation; and what&mdash;if any&mdash;extra public funding should be made available to support the costs of the learning.</p>

	<p pid="d.70W.2/1">The Government's expectation is that most local authority areas will have a children's trust by April 2006, and all will by 2008. There is progress in all areas towards having children's trusts arrangements in place by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.70W.2/2">There is no target for the use of home childcarers. In April 2003, we introduced the Home Childcarers Scheme allowing Ofsted to approve registered childminders to provide care in parents' homes. 300 carers were approved under that scheme. A subsequent PSA target required us to introduce, by April 2005, a light-touch Childcare Approval Scheme. This new scheme was launched in December 2004 and became effective in April 2005. 1,339 carers have been approved under it. Our target for the Neighbourhood Nurseries Initiative was the creation of 45,000 new full-time daycare places for children under 5 in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged areas by 2004. This was achieved. There are no plans to expand the programme. Our focus now is on the development of Sure Start children's centres, building on neighbourhood nurseries and other early years provision.</p>
	<p pid="d.70W.2/3">107 early excellence centres (EECs) were established and there are no plans to expand the programme. There were no targets for the development of EECs. We expect all EECs to develop into children's centres.</p>
	<p pid="d.70W.2/4">We expect all schools to be making a core offer of extended services including child care, 8am-6pm, all year round, by 2010, with a third of secondary schools, and half of primary schools, doing so by 2008. The vast majority of schools are currently providing some extended services, and all local authorities have received funding in the current financial year, 2005&ndash;06, to support the development of extended schools in their areas. The National Remodelling Team is monitoring progress through its work with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.70W.2/5">There has been an evaluation of children's trusts in place since April 2004. It will be completed by the end of March 2007. Two interim reports have already been published and available at: <a href="http://www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/strategy/childrenstrustpathfinders/nationalevaluation/">www.everychildmatters.gov.uk/strategy/childrenstrustpathfinders/national evaluation/</a> whilst three practitioner focused reports will be published in May 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.70W.2/6">The Childcare Approval Scheme is being run by Nestor Primecare Services Ltd., the approval body, under contract to the DfES. The scheme is being closely monitored as part of the contract management process, overseen by an Inter-departmental Implementation Board.</p>
	<p pid="d.70W.2/7">A comprehensive national evaluation of the neighbourhood nursery initiative began in August 2002, and will run until August 2006. The final evaluation report is due to be published towards the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.70W.2/8">The 29 pilot EECs were the subject of an evaluation study between 1997 and 2002. The final report of this study was published in November 2004.</p>
	<p pid="d.70W.2/9">The Department is implementing a comprehensive research and evaluation strategy for extended schools, including an evaluation of the impacts of full service extended schools. The findings of the evaluation of the first year of the full service extended schools, and a baseline survey of extended services in maintained schools were published in September 2005. We are collecting annual data from schools to show progress towards the extended school core offer targets published in the Ten Year Childcare Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="d.71W.5/1">In March 2005 the Government appointed Professor Al Aynsley-Green as England's first Children's Commissioner. From this point, the Commissioner worked on a part-time basis until he formally took up his post on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July 2005</phrase>.

	<p pid="d.72W.3/2">The calculation of the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 takes authorities' 2005&ndash;06 level of spending as the baseline, rather than their Schools Formula Spending Share (SFSS); it gives all authorities a minimum increase of 5 per cent. per pupil over the baseline in each of the next two years; and then distributes the remaining grant to reflect the Government's key priorities for education.</p>
	<p pid="d.72W.3/3">The Wirral's baseline spending in 2005&ndash;06 was &pound;3,279 per pupil, which reflects its spending of 2 per cent. below SFSS. Given the 5 per cent. per pupil increase, in 2006&ndash;07 Wirral is receiving an additional &pound;2.78 million to reflect the Government's key priorities for education, plus an additional &pound;0.687 to help move its per pupil funding towards the level indicated by the funding formula. Its average guaranteed unit of funding in 2006&ndash;07 is therefore &pound;3,514 per pupil. That gives the Wirral an indicative allocation of DSG in 2006&ndash;07 of &pound;171.6 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.72W.3/4">In the City of London's case, its baseline spending in 2005&ndash;06 was &pound;6,286 per pupil which reflects its spending of more than 75 per cent. in excess of SFSS in 2005&ndash;06. Given the 5 per cent. per pupil increase, plus an additional &pound;27,000 to reflect the Government's key priorities for education, the City of London's average guaranteed unit of funding in 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;6,708 per pupil. Its indicative allocation of DSG in 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;1.7 million. Given that the City of London only has about 250 pupils, it is not possible to make meaningful comparisons between its unit costs and those of other authorities.</p>

	<p pid="d.83W.5/1">The Department does not hold data centrally on languages spoken by schoolchildren in London. A survey undertaken in 2000 by Philip Baker for the School of Oriental and African Studies <sup>1</sup> indicated that there are over 300 languages spoken in London and that the 20 most common first languages are, in descending order of number of speakers, English, Bengali/Silheti, Panjabi, Gujerati, Hindi/Urdu, Turkish, Arabic, English based Creoles, Yoruba, Somali, Cantonese, Greek, Akan (Ashanti), Portuguese, French, Spanish, Tamil, Farsi, Italian and Vietnamese.</p>
	<p pid="d.83W.5/2">The medium of instruction in maintained schools is English and all pupils learning English as an additional language (EAL) should be supported to acquire English. The Government's 'Aiming High' strategy for raising achievement of pupils learning EAL advocates that schools should make use of pupils first language in the classroom, where appropriate, as a tool for learning alongside learning English.</p>

	<p pid="d.83W.5/4">The Department does not hold data centrally on the provision of mother tongue teaching in London, however, it is known from local authority data, where available, that there is widespread provision for teaching community languages through supplementary schools. For example, supplementary schools in Croydon provide teaching in 23 languages and supplementary schools in Islington provide teaching in 30 languages. These schools are usually run by local communities and respond directly to local demand.</p>

	<p pid="d.85W.0/1">The LSC is currently undergoing a radical restructuring exercise which will enable it to work even more effectively with local partners and stakeholders in identifying and responding to London's learning and skill needs. The existing local office structure will be replaced by a number of specialist local Partnership and Economic Development teams made up of experienced education and training professionals. They will work closely with local partners and stakeholders to ensure that properly funded education and training is available that meets the needs of learners and employers in the London area. These changes are in keeping with the Government's wider public sector reform agenda, which seeks to move responsibility for local delivery closer to the frontline. Each of the local LSC councils in London continue to include representatives from a wide range of local interests, including employers, local authorities and the voluntary and community sector.</p>

In pursuance of an investigation, the school and the local authority may be required to provide information to Ofsted, and the school may be required to arrange a meeting between parents and inspectors.

	<p pid="d.87W.2/1">The level of funding per pupil received through the dedicated schools grant (DSG) reflects the characteristics of children in each authority: authorities receive more funding if they have higher numbers of children living in deprived circumstances. That is because pupils from more deprived backgrounds are likely to have additional educational needs, and to require additional help if they are to have an equal chance to succeed. North Somerset's average level of funding per pupil mainly reflects the authority's lower than average level of deprivation. The Government will review the operation of a number of aspects of the new school funding arrangements, including the DSG distribution, but in doing so it will continue to aim to give all pupils an equal opportunity in life.</p>

	<p pid="d.88W.0/1">A research review commissioned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in 2003 found some indication that there is a relationship between overcrowding and children's educational attainment, and between overcrowding and children's social and emotional development. However, the research evidence on the effects of overcrowding on attainment is limited. It is also hard to separate any direct effect of overcrowding from the effect of other associated factors, such as poverty and degree of parental involvement in education. Current evidence suggests that any direct effect of overcrowding on attainment is likely to be small.</p>

	<p pid="d.93W.5/1">Overseas trained teachers can teach in England for up to four years without Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). If they wish to continue to work in maintained schools for longer than four years they must gain QTS via the appropriate TDA approved route and register with the General Teaching Council (GTC).</p>
	<p pid="d.93W.5/2">Directive 89/48EEC facilitates the free movement of any national of an EEA member state (MS) wishing to pursue a regulated profession in a host MS. Therefore a migrant teacher with the relevant qualification is given automatic recognition under the directive and they are awarded Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) following an application to the GTC. Again, once they have gained QTS they will have to register with the GTC to teach in a maintained school.</p>

We have also appointed the National Remodelling Team to provide support to schools and local authorities in developing extended services. Good progress is being made with 4,400 schools, thus far, indicating their willingness to work on developing extended services.</p>

	<p pid="d.95W.2/2">Total education spending by Newcastle-Upon-Tyne local authority in 2004&ndash;05 was &pound;185 million, including spending on provision outside schools. The Department is currently working on figures for spending on school provision for 2004&ndash;05 that are comparable with the Dedicated Schools Grant, on both a cash and per pupil basis, and will place them in the Library as soon as they are available.</p>
	<p pid="d.95W.2/3">The Dedicated Schools Grant 2005&ndash;06 baseline per pupil for Newcastle-Upon-Tyne is &pound;3,390. In 2006&ndash;07 the guaranteed per pupil unit of funding is &pound;3,640, an increase of 7.3 per cent. The total DSG allocation will not be finalised until May 2006 when the January 2006 pupil figures are finalised. In addition, while authorities must apply the whole of their allocation of DSG to their Schools Budget, they are free to add to it from their own resources. Final figures for total budgeted expenditure per pupil for 2006&ndash;07 may therefore be higher than the authority's allocation of DSG per pupil for that year.</p>

	<p pid="d.95W.5/1">The Department for Education and Skills pays dedicated schools grant (DSG) to local authorities, to provide for those items that are included in each local authority's schools budget, which consists of the delegated budgets allocated to individual schools, and a budget for other provision for pupils which local authorities fund centrally. Each local authority then decides, in consultation with its Schools Forum, on the distribution of funding between its schools. The national formula for distribution of DSG does not take account of the level of deficit at an authority's schools and, normally, local authority formulae for distributing funding do not do so either. However, it is open to an authority to distribute additional funding to a school which is in financial difficulties. Where a school is in deficit, it should agree a plan with its local authority to eliminate the deficit over a three-year period.</p>

	<p pid="d.99W.2/1">The great majority of schools are safe and orderly places, but we are determined to reduce the risk of violence to an absolute minimum. To achieve that we are:</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.2/2" class="indent">legislating to give heads, teachers and other school staff a clear statutory power to discipline pupils, to reaffirm their statutory right to use reasonable force in certain circumstances and to give them a new power to search pupils for weapons;</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.2/3" class="indent">developing specific violence reduction advice and training, in co-operation with associations representing heads and other school staff.</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.2/4">In addition we have:</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.2/5" class="indent">given every secondary school access to high-quality behaviour management training materials and expert advice from behaviour management consultants;</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.2/6" class="indent">funded extra support for schools facing the greatest challenges through our Excellence in Cities and Behaviour Improvement Programmes;</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.2/7" class="indent">provided &pound;120 million for school security improvements since 1997;</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.2/8" class="indent">given schools a legal toolkit on how to ban aggressive parents from the site and have them removed and prosecuted if they flout the ban; and</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.2/9" class="indent">helped to establish over 400 Safer Schools Partnerships that base police officers in schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.2/10">Also, we are:</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.2/11" class="indent">giving every primary school access to high-quality training and curriculum materials for developing pupils' social, emotional and behavioural skills and developing similar materials for secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid="d.99W.2/12">The Department has confirmed that it is committed to backing head teachers' authority when pupils' behaviour warrants exclusion. We have made clear that heads can permanently exclude pupils who are very disruptive or violent even where this is a first or 'one off' offence. Guidance for exclusion appeal panels makes clear that an exclusion should not normally be overturned in a range of circumstances, including where there has been violence or the threat of violence. For less extreme offences head teachers may exclude pupils for a fixed period or may impose detention.</p>

	<p pid="d.101W.5/1">Latest figures published by Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) show that accepted applicants from England to full-time undergraduate courses rose by 9 per cent. in 2005/06. This was a larger than usual increase. We might therefore expect a slight fall in application numbers for the 2006 entry and then a return to a long-term upward trend, as experienced in 1997 and 1998 when the last major change to student support arrangements was introduced.</p>
	<p pid="d.101W.5/2">Latest figures for 2006/07, covering students who applied by mid-October to Oxbridge or to medical and dentistry courses, show that applicants from the UK were down by 2 per cent. However, these are early figures and only give a partial picture. The first major milestone in the application cycle is mid-January, which is the advisory closing date for applications from UK domiciled students. Figures for the number of students who had applied by this point will be published by UCAS in mid-February, and these will give a more reliable indication of trends.</p>

The science budget allocation to NERC has doubled since 1997, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining the quality of environmental research in the UK. NERC is currently consulting widely with stakeholders on proposals on how best CEH can contribute on a sustainable basis to this.</p>
	<p pid="d.104W.2/2">NERC has been asked to collate data on projects commissioned at CEH from Government Departments and agencies, and on funding of CEH. I shall ask the chief executive of NERC to write to the hon. Member on these points.</p>

	<p pid="d.106W.8/2">Defra provides a wide range of support for small businesses in the food sector, including food retail. For example, in 2004&ndash;05, the Department provided an additional &pound;2 million to the Business Link Network to support projects designed to look at different approaches to increase the uptake of advice to small businesses in economically underperforming rural areas. The Department supports the retention of shops in small settlements. In line with this, the Government have assisted local services by extending mandatory rate relief at 50 per cent. to include sole village public houses, petrol stations and village food shops under the village shop scheme. Planning guidance has also been provided to local authorities to adopt a positive approach to planning proposals designed to improve the viability, accessibility or community value of existing services and facilities such as village shops. The Department also provides a range of trade development, consumer awareness and business competitiveness initiatives, as well as funding under various grant schemes, to regional and local food businesses, including assisting small producers to gain access to markets. The Department also currently devotes just under &pound;4 million per year on schemes to encourages innovation in the food sector and pays particular attention to dissemination of research and development results to small and medium sized food and drink companies through, for example, a network of Regional Technology Transfer Centres.</p>

	<p pid="d.111W.12/2">The Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) was launched in April 2001 as a cross-departmental Initiative. It is designed to stimulate and increase the demand for research and development (R and D) from high tech small firms and give them the opportunity to demonstrate that they have the ability to undertake and deliver high quality R and D to the public sector. The participating government departments agreed to a target of purchasing at least 2.5 per cent. of their extramural R and D from SMEs by 2004&ndash;05. The Research Councils are also participating in their own arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="d.111W.12/3">The Chancellor mandated departments with extramural R and D budgets to take part in the Initiative in his Budget on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-16">16 March 2005</phrase>, at which time the implementation process commenced.</p>
	<p pid="d.111W.12/4">Compliance with the mandatory requirement is monitored by the DTI's Small Business Service. The present focus is on making a success of the relatively newly introduced mandatory option. To this end, in order to improve access for small firms, departments will be required to use the Supplier Route to Government (CSRG29) website to offer Government R and D contract opportunities, when it is launched shortly.</p>
	<p pid="d.111W.12/5">Until the <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-16">16 March</phrase> Budget participation was voluntary. We aim to publish the voluntary phase performance figures for 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 under SBRI as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="d.111W.12/6">In future, we will publish performance figures on an annual basis. Apparent poor performance by individual departments will be investigated initially by the Small Business Service and Ministers will decide what action to take in order to bring about an improvement.</p>

	<p pid="d.112W.2/20">VAT registration and de-registration data do not capture all business activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 4.3 million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2004.</p>

While we acknowledge that there has been a reduction in recent years in some human rights abuses, there is still a lot that needs to be done to improve the situation. During the visit to the UK by Vice-President Santos in late November 2005, my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), Lord Triesman of Tottenham, raised human rights issues. We have made it plain to the Government of Colombia that we are willing to work with them to help bring an improvement to the situation in the country, either as a bilateral partner or through our EU membership. We will continue to look for ways to bring about change, working with other partners such as the UN and civil society, to achieve this goal.</p>

FCO officials will meet the delegation to discuss human rights and hear their views on how the Government can best support civil society in Colombia to improve the human rights situation.</p>

This included their eligibility to leave the FCO on compulsory early retirement (CER) terms. In order to help achieve the FCO's efficiency targets, in particular the decision to reduce substantially the number of staff in the senior management structure, these provisions were extended to a wider range of senior officers in September 2004, using funding from the Treasury's Efficiency Challenge Fund. This exercise enabled some officers not eligible for CER (i.e. those aged under 50) to leave on compulsory early severance (CES) terms.

The Government will participate constructively in these discussions, but it would not be sensible to pre-empt now where the discussions might end up. In the coming months we need to focus on the EU's policy agenda, including follow-up to the issues discussed at Hampton Court.</p>

	<p pid="d.122W.8/2">I apologise for the delay in providing a substantive answer to the hon. Member's questions on this matter. This is because the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), to whom the Special Rapporteur's letter was addressed, was dissolved at the end of June 2004. An additional difficulty is that the incident to which it refers is alleged to have happened in February 2004, when there was a great deal of militia activity of this type in Iraq. We are working with the United States Government, via whom the letter was passed to the CPA, to ascertain whether they have any record of what happened to the letter and what action was taken on it. They are still researching the archives.</p>
	<p pid="d.122W.8/3">Given the delay in providing a substantive reply, we will continue to pursue with the US authorities and, exceptionally, I will write to the hon. Member when we have more information, and will place a copy of my letter in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="d.124W.11/1">Our risk assessments&mdash;including those in the former Yugoslavia&mdash;are informed by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC). JTAC analyses all intelligence relating to international terrorism, and produces threat assessments for Government Departments and agencies. It is Government policy not to comment on specific risk assessments and threat levels for security reasons: such information could be extremely useful to terrorists.</p>
	<p pid="d.124W.11/2">The risks posed by former Yugoslav army material is predominantly from undiscovered caches, and as such is difficult to quantify. UK troops are trained to respond appropriately to abandoned material: when ordnance is found, appropriate measures are taken to destroy it safely. UK troops also participate in Operation Harvest carried out by the EU Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, EUFOR, to discover and collect illegal ordnance. In a typical three month period, EUFOR collect some 500 small arms, 200,000 rounds of ammunition, 2,500 hand grenades and over 250kg of explosives. The UK is also currently contributing over &pound;500,000 to destroy surplus stockpiles of small arms, light weaponry and ammunition in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This project includes an initial target of 250,000 small arms and an additional overall aim of 10,000 tonnes of ammunition.</p>

	<p pid="d.125W.2/1">The grave situation in Zimbabwe is a direct consequence of the policies pursued by the Mugabe regime. We have been active in securing international scrutiny for Zimbabwe's actions, including by the UN Security Council. The report of the United Nations Secretary General's Special Envoy, Anna Tibaijuka, on the recent clearance of housing in Zimbabwe noted that these human rights violations could come under the remit of the International Criminal Court (ICC). However, we judge that there is most unlikely to be agreement in the UN Security Council to refer Zimbabwe to the ICC at present and that failure to secure agreement would constitute a reverse.</p>

	<p pid="d.133W.2/1">The standard guidance issued to the Northern Ireland departments is detailed in the Cabinet Office publication 'non-departmental public bodies: A Guide for Departments.' That guidance states:</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.2/2" class="indent">'A non-departmental public body's ability to employ and manage staff is an important element of its relative independence from Ministers. While the sponsor department must be careful not to detract from a non-departmental public body's independence, it does have a responsibility to assist a new non-departmental public body in making a sound start in its management policies. The sponsor department should encourage non-departmental public bodies to adopt Human Resource management practices which meet at least the minimum standards expected of public service employers.'</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.2/3">The Department of Finance and Personnel also issued 'Guidance on Codes of Practice for Board Members of Public Bodies' in March 1997. That stated that departments should ensure that executive non-departmental public bodies adopt new or revised codes based on the new guidance.</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.2/4">The guidance states:</p>
	<p pid="d.133W.2/5" class="indent">'The board should ensure that the body's rules for the recruitment and management of staff provide for appointment and advancement on merit on the basis of equal opportunity for all applicants and staff. In filling senior staff appointments, the board should satisfy itself that an adequate field of qualified candidates is considered, and should always consider the merits of full and open competition. In recruiting external candidates, this should normally be used'.</p>

Employers are informed of all convictions, spent and unspent, including cautions and bind-over orders, no matter when the offence was committed, and non-conviction information which CRO considers to be reliable. These are all made available to the employing authority and are taken into account in the decision on whether to offer employment.

However, in this source the categorisation of employment in the public or private sector depends upon the responses from the individuals interviewed. As reported by ONS in October 2005 in the publication Public Sector Employment Trends&quot;, some individuals tend to misreport private sector employment as being in the public sector hence leading to overestimates of the share of public sector employment.</p>

The definition of harm&quot; was expressly clarified by Section 120 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, commenced <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-31">31 January 2005</phrase>, to include harm caused to a child by seeing or hearing the ill-treatment of another person.</p>
	<p pid="d.149W.0/5">In addition, the Children and Adoption Bill, currently before this House, would place a duty on CAFCASS to conduct a risk assessment in any private law proceedings where they are involved. This duty applies not only in cases where issues of harm are raised, but also in cases where the CAFCASS officer suspects that harm may be an issue. The CAFCASS officer is required to inform the court of the results of the risk assessment. That Bill would also allow courts to direct parties in contact proceedings to attend a domestic violence perpetrator programme to address violent behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="d.149W.0/6">These measures, taken together, will ensure that the family courts are in a position to make decisions on what contact arrangements may be safe, based on all the facts, as early as possible in the proceedings.</p>

However, the Department also provides a wide variety of other arrangements which allow staff to work flexibly, and thereby help to promote diversity and the achievement of a better work-life balance, while still ensuring its business is conducted effectively. These include initiatives such as a flexitime scheme, part-time working, job sharing, part-year appointments, which are particularly suitable for people wishing to work only during school term time, compressed hours, fitting the working week into less that five full days, and special leave arrangements to cope with a variety of circumstances.</p>

The key elements of this strategy include:</p>

	<p pid="d.165W.2/6">The supply and distribution of medicines is tightly controlled within the European community. All licensed wholesalers must comply with the community's agreed standards of good distribution practice and there exist strict licensing and regulatory requirements enshrined in UK domestic legislation to safeguard patients against potential hazards arising from poor distribution practices, for example, purchasing suspect or counterfeit products, poor storage, failing to establish the bona fides of suppliers and purchasers, inadequate record keeping, avoiding deterioration of the medicinal product, etc. The MHRA will take regulatory action where breaches are identified, which may take the form of revoking licenses or the instigation of criminal proceedings.</p>

If successful, this research should lead to the first UK gene therapy clinical trial aimed at treating DMD. The Government will carefully monitor developments in this area in considering future funding needs.</p>

	<p pid="d.166W.8/1">Genetic testing is one component of specialised medical genetics services. These are commissioned by specialised commissioning groups, funded by their constituent primary care trusts (PCTs) from PCTs' normal allocations to provide services for their local populations.</p>
	<p pid="d.166W.8/2">The Government have undertaken a number of initiatives since 2001 to strengthen genetic services. In 2002, nearly &pound;11 million was awarded over up to three years across England to provide new laboratory equipment and pump-prime new substantive posts in both clinical and laboratory services. Over 40 clinical scientist and technical posts were funded.</p>
	<p pid="d.166W.8/3">The genetics White Paper, Our Inheritance, Our Future&mdash;Realising the potential of genetics in the NHS&quot; in June 2003 built further on this investment. Up to &pound;3.5 million is being made available for a programme to increase the laboratory workforce. This will fund up to 90 new laboratory scientist trainees and the equivalent of 10 full time trainer posts. We have also invested &pound;1.5 million so far in a scheme to train 50 new genetics counsellors over a period of five years.</p>
	<p pid="d.166W.8/4">The White Paper committed to &pound;18 million to expand and modernise National health service genetic laboratory capacity. This investment, made during 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06, will support genetics laboratories in delivering the genetics White Paper standards for making test results available more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="d.166W.8/5">We have also invested over 4 million to date on several initiatives, including two national genetics reference laboratories and staffing support for the UK Genetic Testing Network, that help laboratories make best use of their capacity.</p>

	<p pid="d.167W.2/1">The UK Genetic Testing Network (UKGTN) is a network of the main national health service molecular genetic laboratories in the United Kingdom. It produces the 'NHS Directory of Molecular Genetic Testing' which lists molecular genetic tests available through NHS genetic services (<a href="http://www.ukgtn.org">www.ukgtn.org</a>) as well as a database of all UKGTN laboratories and the tests that they offer. As many tests are rare and volumes are often low no laboratory offers all the tests listed but tests are sent to other laboratories as necessary.</p>
	<p pid="d.167W.2/2">In addition to these molecular genetic tests offered through the UKGTN some tests will be offered through other laboratories such as those serving haemophilia services and there are other types of genetic test provided for example through cytogenetics laboratories.</p>

	<p pid="d.168W.2/2">Birmingham and The Black Country strategic health authority reports that the board of Good Hope Hospital National Health Service Trust reviewed its strategic objectives in conjunction with its franchise partner, Tribal Secta, and decided that the best way to achieve foundation trust status by 2008 was to seek a local NHS partner to work with. As a result, the board has accepted interim management support from Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust and has given the new management team a specific remit to assess whether Good Hope Hospital NHS Trust can stand alone or should seek a merger partner. The contract with Tribal Secta, which was scheduled to run until August 2006, was therefore terminated by mutual agreement eight months early to facilitate the trust's new strategic objective of achieving foundation trust status.</p>

However, the South East London Strategic Health Authority has advised that the methodology used in the calculation of profit of sale of the former Greenwich District Hospital site did not change. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital Trust made a net &pound;1.1 million surplus from the disposal of this site in 2004&ndash;05 arising from the difference between the net sale proceeds and the value of the asset in the trust's audited accounts. This benefit reduces the size of the deficit that the trust has to recover.</p>

	<p pid="d.175W.2/1">As part of the Department's commitment to reducing administrative burdens on the national health service, statistical information relating to medicines management in hospitals is not collected routinely. However, in 2003 NHS trusts were invited to self-assess their medicines management performance against developmental good practice standards contained in the Department's medicines management framework. Responses were considered by strategic health authorities (SHAs) and, where appropriate, action plans to address areas of weakness would be developed and implemented by the individual trusts. The information collected by SHAs suggested that by the end of 2004 some 67 per cent. of respondents expected to have systems in place to utilise patients' own drugs and enable self-administration, where appropriate. The Department does not hold results centrally for the medicines management framework. In line with Shifting the Balance of Power&quot;, SHAs performance manage this process.</p>
	<p pid="d.175W.2/2">Further information about medicines management in hospitals is expected to be available in summer 2006 when the Healthcare Commission publishes findings from its acute hospital portfolio medicines management review.</p>

	<p pid="d.177W.2/1">The Department has committed funding of &pound;5 million (2004&ndash;05 to 2006&ndash;07) and is actively supporting the implementation and development of an infrastructure to facilitate mental health helpline providers, working in partnership to achieve increased quality, efficiency, capacity, governance, choice and access in relation to the provision of helpline services 24 hours a day. Members of the Mental Health Helplines Partnership (MHHP) are taking forward a detailed programme of work and progress can be reported in the following areas:</p>
	<p pid="d.177W.2/2" class="indent">Accredited training: facilitation of accredited training for mental health helpline workers through the Telephone Helplines Association.</p>
	<p pid="d.177W.2/3" class="indent">Mental Health Helplines Quality Standards (MHHQS): 25 helplines have received accreditation and work is progressing to accredit a further 12.</p>
	<p pid="d.177W.2/4" class="indent">Targeted Investment Resources: The MHHP has processed over 20 applications for targeted investment and approved 10 to date. Further applications are currently being processed.</p>
	<p pid="d.177W.2/5" class="indent">Telecommunications solution: Once established this telecommunications solution will enable callers to access mental health helplines 24 hours a day. It is anticipated that a preferred provider will be identified within six months.</p>
	<p pid="d.177W.2/6" class="indent">MHHP website: Negotiations are at an advanced stage with a preferred provider for the development and maintenance of a website, which will provide partnership updates on all areas of work and helpline services.</p>
	<p pid="d.177W.2/7" class="indent">Shared Services provision: Later this year work is due to commence on commissioning shared services for MHHP members.</p>
	<p pid="d.177W.2/8" class="indent">Mental health helplines conference: The MHHP will host a second national mental health helpline conference in May, to share its achievements with service users and key stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="d.183W.11/1">This information is not collected centrally in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="d.183W.11/2">Several estimates have been made of the number of patient safety incidents that occur each year, and the number of people who die as a result. For example, estimates that have been widely quoted are of 850,000 incidents per year and 40,000 deaths in England. The accuracy of these estimates, and of similar estimates from other countries, has been widely debated. Such estimates are likely to depend on a number of factors including the source of the original data and the definitions used in the original studies from which the estimates were derived.</p>
	<p pid="d.183W.11/3">Many patients, particularly those in acute care settings, are critically ill, and so grading the degree of harm caused by an incident is not straightforward. For example, some deaths following incidents may have occurred as a result of the underlying illness rather than as a result of the incident.</p>
	<p pid="d.183W.11/4">The Government is concerned about assuring and improving the safety of care for NHS patients. As part of our national health service patient safety programme, we established the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) in July 2001 to improve the safety of NHS patient care. The NPSA has introduced a national reporting and learning system for patient safety incidents and issued a number of patient safety solutions to the NHS to improve the safety of care for areas of known risk.</p>
	<p pid="d.183W.11/5">The reporting and learning system will, in time, enable us to understand the nature and extent of adverse events in the NHS more fully, and take action to prevent them being repeated.

	<p pid="d.184W.2/1">Health care provided for national health service patients by establishments outside the NHS is covered by the provisions of the Care Standards Act 2000 and the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="d.184W.2/2">Those private healthcare establishments, including independent hospitals or clinics, or medical agencies providing services to NHS patients, that are subject to registration with, and inspection by, the Healthcare Commission under the Care Standards Act are required to comply with the Private and Voluntary Healthcare (England) Regulations 2001 and the National Minimum Standards (NMS) for Independent Health Care published in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="d.184W.2/3">Within this framework, the Healthcare Commission uses three essential suitability criteria to determine whether persons, organisations and services are suitable to operate:</p>
	<p pid="d.184W.2/4" class="indent">fitness of premises&mdash;that premises are fit for the purpose of the service;</p>
	<p pid="d.184W.2/5" class="indent">fitness of persons&mdash;that the persons running and managing the service, any person nominated as the responsible individual on behalf of an organisation, and any staff or other persons working for the service are fit to do so; and</p>
	<p pid="d.184W.2/6" class="indent">fitness of services and facilities&mdash;that the treatment, services and facilities (including policies and procedures) meet the requirements of the Private and Voluntary Healthcare Regulations, are suitable and safe and meet the needs of the service users as interpreted through the NMS for the service concerned.</p>
	<p pid="d.184W.2/7">The registration process has been designed to assess each application against these criteria. The process includes interviews with the applicants, checks on their character and an inspection or pre-registration visit to the service.</p>
	<p pid="d.184W.2/8">The registered provider is responsible for providing a safe and effective service. This includes having a health and safety policy and risk assessments in place and audit systems to assess the quality of care.</p>
	<p pid="d.184W.2/9">The Healthcare Commission currently inspects all registered establishments annually. Establishments are inspected against the requirements of the 2001 regulations and the NMS. Inspections focus on perceived areas of risk in each establishment. Assessment managers prepare written reports setting out requirements, recommendations, and areas of concern identified during inspections. These reports, which are published and available on the Commission's website, include timetables for compliance with any specific requirements.</p>
	<p pid="d.184W.2/10">In addition, health care provided for NHS patients, be it by the NHS or for the NHS by a non-NHS establishment, is reviewed by the Healthcare Commission under the 2003 Act, against the NHS standards&mdash;Standards for Better Health&quot;&mdash;published by the Secretary of State in July 2004. As part of its review process, the Healthcare Commission ensures that services for NHS patients delivered from outside the NHS are commissioned against these standards, including those covering patient safety.</p>
	<p pid="d.184W.2/11">Those services contracted directly by the Department from non-NHS organisations are commissioned using the framework of the Standards for Better Health&quot; and where appropriate are reviewed against the Private and Voluntary Healthcare Regulations and NMS.</p>

	<p pid="d.185W.2/2">A letter was issued from the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-08">8 December 2005</phrase> to the RCN General Secretary, Dr. Beverley Malone, which stated that:</p>
	<p pid="d.185W.2/3" class="indent">We do not have a policy requirement or timetable for PCTs to divest themselves of provision. We well support PCTs whether or not they divest themselves of service provision, provided that what is being offered is genuinely best for local patient care.</p>

	<p pid="d.185W.2/6">In response to the letter, Dr. Beverly Malone has publicly stated:</p>
	<p pid="d.185W.2/7" class="indent">Issuing an application to be granted permission to apply for judicial review is not a step the RCN took lightly. We are, therefore, pleased a settlement has been agreed with the Department of Health and especially welcome the reassurance that there is no policy requirement or timetable for PCTs to divest themselves of provision.</p>
	<p pid="d.185W.2/8" class="indent">The RCN looks forward to working closely with the Government to ensure that nurses, and other health care workers, are involved in any decisions made about the future of the NHS.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.185W.2/9">The RCN have been fully involved in discussions around the White Paper, which is due to be published at the end of January, and will set out a vision for the future of local health and care services that will address questions about how, when and in what settings primary care services are delivered.</p>

	<p pid="d.188W.11/1">As with all medicinal products, vaccine safety is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) with advice from independent experts. The United Kingdom's Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its expert working group on vaccine safety have thoroughly reviewed the safety of thiomersal-containing vaccines, including alleged links with neurodevelopmental disorders, and kept this under close review.</p>
	<p pid="d.188W.11/2">In 2001, the CSM, now the Commission for Human Medicines, conducted a major review of the available evidence and has since then considered new data on a number of occasions as it has emerged. Following concerns in the United States of America (USA) about the possible toxicity of thiomersal-containing vaccines, the Department funded a study using the UK's general practice research database to investigate whether there is a relationship between the amount of thiomersal that an infant receives through vaccination at a young age and subsequent neurological disorders. Data from a study involving over a 100,000 UK children were considered by CSM in 2003. Further studies from Denmark involving almost half a million children and a study from the USA have also specifically investigated the suggested link between mercury-containing vaccines and autism. None of these studies have found any evidence of a causal association with subsequent neurodevelopment disorders, including autism.</p>
	<p pid="d.188W.11/3">The advice of CSM stands that there is no evidence of harm from the very small quantities of thiomersal contained in some vaccines, with the exception of possible allergic reactions, typically skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection. This view concurs with that of the World Health Organisation, the USA's Institute of Medicine and the European Medicines Agency. The balance of benefits and risks of thiomersal-containing vaccines remains overwhelmingly positive.</p>
	<p pid="d.188W.11/4">None of the vaccines that are currently part of the recommended childhood immunisation programme contain mercury.</p>

	<p pid="d.190W.0/2">For adults, the target was to reduce the percentage of dentate adults with at least one deep periodontal pocket (greater than 6 millimetres) from 17 per cent. to 10 per cent.

The National Child Health Survey conducted in 2003 found that 12-year-olds in England had an average of 0.7 teeth with obvious decay experience, 59 per cent. of five-year-olds in England had no primary teeth with obvious decay experience and the average number of primary teeth with obvious decay in five-year-olds was 1.5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="d.197W.2/1">The published data relate to the number of crimes recorded by the police in terms of financial years. For the year 2004&ndash;05, Lancashire police recorded 152,043 offences. This figure takes into account the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002. Therefore, figures after April 2002 are not directly comparable with those for earlier years.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.2/2">Estimates of the proportion of crime that is reported to the police can be made at a national level using the British crime survey (BCS), but sample sizes are not sufficiently reliable to estimate reporting rates at the sub-national level. Forty-two per cent. of victims interviewed in the 2004&ndash;05 BCS said that the incident had been reported to the police or was known to them. This figure is similar to that for 2003&ndash;04 and shows that most crimes (58 per cent. of comparable crimes) are never reported to the police.</p>

	<p pid="d.199W.3/1">The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975 sets out those occupations and positions exempt from the provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (the Act). This provides that persons employing individuals in those occupations and positions are exempt from the provisions of the Act and may therefore ask an individual to reveal details of all convictions, both 'spent' and 'unspent', under what is termed as an 'exempted question'.</p>
	<p pid="d.199W.3/2">The positions generally involve work with children and vulnerable adults, work involving the administration of justice and other employment of sufficient sensitivity to warrant a higher than normal level of criminal disclosure on public protection grounds. The Exceptions Order is updated periodically, ensuring that it reflects changes in risk to employers and the public.</p>
	<p pid="d.199W.3/3">The Criminal Records Bureau operates under the Police Act 1997. This provides that when applying for one of the two higher level Disclosures, Standard and Enhanced, an application must be accompanied by a statement from a registered person that the Disclosure is required for the purpose of asking an 'exempted question'. Accordingly release of conviction information by the criminal Records Bureau is fully consistent with the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.</p>

	<p pid="d.201W.8/1">Tackling regional drug dealers is part of core police business and funding for these operations is met from within general grant allocations. The Government has put significant extra resources into the police service in England and Wales over the last few years. On a like-for-like basis, Government grant and central spending on services for the police will have increased by 56 per cent. or almost &pound;4 billion between 2000&ndash;01 and 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="d.201W.8/2">It is a matter for each chief constable and police authority to decide how best to deploy the available resources across the force area, taking into account operational priorities and objectives.</p>
	<p pid="d.201W.8/3">We recognised that capacity in this area needed to be developed and in 2001 provided short-term funding of &pound;6 million to three regional drugs units to develop expertise in tackling cross-regional drugs-markets, in order to disseminate the lessons learned. These were Operation Middle Market (West Midlands), Merseyside Middle Market Unit and Tarian Regional Taskforce (South Wales).</p>
	<p pid="d.201W.8/4">The creation of the Serious Organised Crime Agency in April 2006 will provided enhanced capacity and support to local police forces in tackling serious organised crime at the regional and national level.</p>
	<p pid="d.201W.8/5">Furthermore forthcoming police force restructuring will ensure that forces have the capacity, capability and resilience to effectively deal with regional drug dealers and similar criminality.</p>

	<p pid="d.207W.2/2">Any number of forces may be investigating historic child abuse cases at any one time and, as individuals involved in such cases may have moved around the country, there was a chance that individuals could be investigated by more than one police force at the same time. To avoid this duplication the Association of Chief Police Officers asked the Serious Crime Analysis Section (SCAS), part of NCPE, to take over the Historical Institutional Child Abuse Database and keep it operating as long as required. A recent evaluation has indicated that there is still a requirement for such a database.</p>
	<p pid="d.207W.2/3">Guidance on Investigating Serious Sexual Offences was published on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) by the National Centre for Policing Excellence in September 2005. This document touches on the investigation of historic child abuse cases.</p>

	<p pid="d.210W.8/1">The United Kingdom and the United States are both parties to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. The Convention provides for the transfer of sentenced persons to continue serving their sentences in their country of nationality or one with which the sentenced person has close links. Transfer under the Convention requires the consent of both states involved and the prisoner concerned.</p>
	<p pid="d.210W.8/2">Article 16 of the Convention enables contracting parties to transit through UK airports to another contracting party, or to a third party, where transfer of the prisoner has been agreed in accordance with the relevant international agreement. The Convention does not require that records of transit requests be kept. For the purposes of the transfer of sentence prisoners transit only takes place in the United Kingdom through Gatwick and Heathrow and it is the normal practice of states wishing to transit through Heathrow or Gatwick airports to fax a request to the National Offender Management Service. The request would normally contain details of the individual concerned, including sentence and offence details, the agreement under which transfer has been agreed, and flight details. The National Offender Management Service then makes the relevant arrangements for transit. Once transit has been completed the request is destroyed either by shredding or disposal in confidential waste. Secure disposal is used because requests contain personal information about the prisoner. Transit requests are not electronically recorded.</p>

The vast majority of police forces do have some dedicated staff to major crime investigation; however, generally this takes the form of a small, core office team, with the additional investigative staff being drawn from basic command unit's (BCUs), ordinarily the CID. It is believed that, at the time of the assessment, only 13 of the 43 forces of England and Wales had sufficient staff dedicated to MITs to prevent any abstractions from BCU.</p>

	<p pid="d.227W.2/1">When probation trusts are established, most staff will transfer from probation boards to the new trusts on the same terms and conditions of employment. If, in due course, work transfers to an alternative provider, staff will generally transfer, with their pay, terms and conditions protected by TUPE and the recent extension of the Two Tier Workforce Agreement. Staff who do not wish to transfer will be free to terminate their contract of employment. The employment status of chief officers will change in the transition from boards to trusts: they will cease to be statutory office holders appointed by the Secretary of State and will instead be appointed and employed by the trust itself. If a chief is not appointed to the trust, he or she will be compensated accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="d.231W.2/1">Building on the National Action Plan launched in 2004, in November 2005 we launched the National Reducing Reoffending Delivery Plan, the cornerstones of which are: partnership working at national, regional and local levels; end-to end-offender management under the National Offender Management Service (NOMS); and public protection. The Delivery Plan sets out the key actions the Government intends to take over the next 18 months towards the delivery of our target of reducing re-offending by 10 per cent. by the end of the decade. It also charts the real progress NOMS and its partners have made over the last 18 months in delivering services to offenders that address the reasons for their re-offending. For example, 87 per cent. of prisoners on whom information is recorded now have accommodation to go to on release, the number of educational awards offenders have achieved has risen by 40 per cent. and the number completing a drug treatment course in prison or a drug testing order in the community is up by a third. (Copies of the Delivery Plan were placed in the Library at the time of publication.)</p>
	<p pid="d.231W.2/2">Alongside the Delivery Plan, we announced three important new reducing re-offending alliances. The first of these will build on links with employers at national, regional and local levels to explore how businesses can work with NOMS to improve the employability and training of offenders. The second, the civic society alliance, will involve working with local authorities and other local partners to support the resettlement and reintegration of offenders. The final alliance is with faith groups and the voluntary sector and will address the needs of offenders through the innovative work by faith and voluntary sector groups already under way.</p>
	<p pid="d.231W.2/3">Complementing the alliances, NOMS has published an Action Plan to improve effective engagement and partnership with the voluntary and community sector. Also, as part of the cross-Government Together We Can&quot; Action Plan, NOMS and the Youth Justice Board have developed a joint approach to working with communities and civil renewal. This has the twin aims of reducing re-offending and increasing public confidence, with a focus on four priorities: public protection; unpaid and reparative work; victims and restorative justice; and community integration.</p>
	<p pid="d.231W.2/4">In December we published, jointly with colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Work and Pensions, a Green Paper, 'Reducing Re-offending Through Skills and Employment'. We have been developing proposals for embedding skills and employment for offenders as key tenets of the broader national delivery plan for reducing re-offending. We hope that this will start a constructive dialogue with our partners about how we can most effectively equip offenders for employment and with the basic skills needed for law-abiding adult life, including engaging employers in the design and delivery of programmes for offenders and drive improvement in the quality of the programmes offered to offenders.</p>
	<p pid="d.231W.2/5">Beyond this, NOMS is about to publish a five year strategy. This will set out the wider vision for how NOMS will work with its many partners to reduce re-offending and cut crime.</p>

	<p pid="d.239W.12/2">The estimated expenditure under the Financial Assistance Scheme on deferred pensioners in the Allied Steel and Wire (Cardiff) pension scheme is &pound;50,450 (before tax deductions) in 2005&ndash;06. This covers the first payments made in December and monthly payments for the months January to March.</p>

This information is unlikely to be available until the scheme is close to finalising winding up.</p>

EDS are then asked to conduct impact assessments against all aspects of their IT service and provide a documented response. This response is reviewed by senior Agency officials who, based on the information provided, make a final decision on whether to proceed with the change.</p>
	<p pid="d.266W.2/6" class="indent">Change requests are primarily made to incorporate new or amended functionality. This may be required for various reasons, but predominantly to address needs that could not be foreseen at the system development stage&mdash;such as incorporating the requirement to transfer responsibility for payment of maintenance from Girobank to the Alliance and Leicester, for example.</p>
	<p pid="d.266W.2/7" class="indent">The changes requested have improved the degree of support that the system provides to staff while processing cases and delivering customer service. This has included enhancements to our mechanisms for distributing workload, our automated exchange of information with Jobcentre Plus and the quality of automatically produced customer notifications.</p>

	<p pid="d.272W.2/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the Chief Executive, Mr. Stephen Geraghty. He will write to the hon. Member with the requested information.</p>
	<p pid="d.272W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="d.272W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="d.272W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many customer complaints were made to the Child Support Agency in each year from 1996&ndash;97 to 2005&ndash;06 to date.</p>
	<p pid="d.272W.2/5" class="indent">The volumes of complaints received direct from clients, their representatives and MPs to the Child Support Agency or to our Ministers, for which information is available, are in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="d.272W.2/6" class="indent">It should be noted that it is difficult to use this information to make meaningful comparisons over time due to changes in the way that information has been recorded. In particular whilst the volume of stage 1 written complaints undoubtedly rose between 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04, this is likely to have been due in part to more rigorous recording of complaints received at the time, and the introduction by the Agency of a three tier complaints process during 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="d.272W.2/7" class="indent">It should also be noted that the volume of complaints has stabilised. In the twelve months up to November 2005, the Agency received a total of 54,000 complaints, this compares to 55,000 for the 12 months up to May 2005 (the earliest period for which comparable data for total numbers of complaints received is available).</p>
	<p pid="d.272W.2/8" class="indent">Further, to put the attached figures into context, the 54,000 complaints received in the 12 months to November 2005 represent less than 4% of the 1.4 million cases dealt with by the CSA.</p>

	<p pid="d.275W.2/1">In the new scheme a non-resident parent can apply for a variation&quot; to the maintenance calculation to have special expenses&quot; taken into account. In the old scheme either parent can apply for a departure&quot; from the formula. One of the grounds on which a variation or departure can be applied for is where the non-resident parent (or in the old scheme the absent parent or parent with care) has expenses relating to debts which arose before the non-resident parent became a non-resident parent, and at the time that the non-resident parent and the parent with care were living together.</p>
	<p pid="d.275W.2/2">The debts must have been incurred for the joint benefit of both parents, or their children, or for the benefit of the other parent but where the person applying remains legally responsible for the repayments.</p>
	<p pid="d.275W.2/3">Expenses relating to a bank overdraft can be taken into account but only where at the time it was taken out it was agreed to be for a specified amount and repayable over a specified period.</p>
	<p pid="d.275W.2/4">Only the expenses exceeding a certain threshold are allowed. In the current scheme the threshold is set at &pound;10 a week where the non-resident parent's net weekly income is below &pound;200, and &pound;15 a week where it is &pound;200 or more. In the old scheme the threshold is &pound;15 a week for all cases.</p>
	<p pid="d.275W.2/5">A departure or variation is only allowed where it is just and equitable&quot; to do so. Broadly this means that the result of the variation or departure must be fair taking account of all the circumstances of the case, and, in particular, the welfare of any child likely to be affected. This includes the child for whom maintenance is paid as well as any other children living with either parent.</p>

	<p pid="d.277W.8/1">The new Office for Disability Issues (ODI) will report annually to the Prime Minister on cross-government progress in implementing the Strategy Unit report, Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People. The first report is due to be published by summer 2006. It will contain an assessment of the activity undertaken both by the ODI and by relevant Government Departments to fulfil the responsibilities and recommendations set out in Strategy Unit's report.</p>
	<p pid="d.277W.8/2">The Department for Work and Pensions has responded positively to the recommendations of the Strategy Unit report and, working closely with colleagues from other Departments, established the cross-government ministerial steering group that is taking forward the Government's strategy to deliver substantive equality for disabled people by 2025. The Department co-ordinated cross-government efforts in setting up the Office for Disability Issues, which was launched on <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase> this year, and partnered with the Department of Health and ODPM in the development of the pilots for individual budgets, announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-21">21 November 2005</phrase>. The Department is also leading an exercise to appoint people onto an advisory group that will work with disability organisations, disabled people, and Government officials to develop proposals for a national forum for organisations of disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="d.277W.8/3">The Department for Work and Pensions is also committed to taking forward the recommendations in the Life Chances report on employment, working with other Government Departments to achieve these. Progress against these recommendations will be published in the ODI annual report. The Life Chances report, and the recommendations within it are key in helping the Department for Work and Pensions in reviewing the employment services offered to disabled people, and in considering how best to reform incapacity benefit to ensure that disabled people are empowered and supported within the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="d.277W.8/4">Work is underway on a project to research information and advice required by disabled people and review existing cross-government provision. We will work with other Departments to develop proposals to improve the provision of information and advice about services to disabled people. The Directgov website for disabled people, <a href="http://www.directgov.uk/disability">www.directgov.uk/disability</a> is now the central point for all information from Government. It has been warmly received by disabled people and organisations and continues to grow in popularity and interest. All Departments contribute to the information and services and it is now written and co-ordinated within the Office for Disability Issues.</p>

	<p pid="d.279W.0/1">The reorganisation of the Disability Benefits Unit is a matter fro the chief executive of the Disability and Carers Service, Mr. Terry Moran. He will write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Terry Moran, dated January 2006</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.0/3" class="indent">In reply to four of your recent Parliamentary Questions about the reorganisation of the Disability Benefits Unit, the Minister for Disabled People, Anne McGuire MP, on behalf of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, promised you a substantive reply from the Chief Executive of the Disability and Carers Service.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.0/4" class="indent">You asked what assessment he had made of the Disability and Carers Service's reorganisation of the Disability Benefits Unit to operate on a regional basis.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.0/5" class="indent">The Disability Benefit Unit (DBU) is the largest of the Disability and Carers Service's (DCS) operational sites and has responsibility for the ongoing management of approx 4.5 million cases where Attendance Allowance or Disability Living Allowance is in payment. It also deals with new claims for these benefits from people living in the south of England.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.0/6" class="indent">The decision to reorganise on a regional basis was made in order to improve service delivery to customers and their representatives, by reducing the number of people and teams that have to be involved in handling claims and changes of circumstances. Under the current organisation, a claim or change of circumstances could be dealt with by one of a number of functional teams dealing with customers from any part of Britain. The new model joins holistic benefit teams in the DBU with their counterparts dealing with new claims in our regional centres, the Disability Benefit Centres (DBC). Customers will continue to contact DCS through the national Customer Care Helpline (CCH) and the underlying structural changes should not be obvious to them, except that their business will be dealt with more efficiently and effectively.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.0/7" class="indent">You also asked if he would list the private sector firms that have been contracted for the reorganisation of the Disability and Carers Service; and what the value was of each such contract.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.0/8" class="indent">The total cost of accommodation, infrastructure and IT changes has been budgeted at &pound;444,000. The changes are being made through the DWP's normal partners, Land Security Trillium, EDS and BT.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.0/9" class="indent">You also asked how many staff hours he expected to be taken up by the <i>(a)</i> reorganisation of the Disability Benefits Unit and <i>(b)</i> subsequent training of staff; and what this represents in terms of financial cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.0/10" class="indent">In answer to part <i>(a)</i> of your question, the notional staff cost associated with the move is 79,617, based on an assumption that each member of staff will be non-productive for half a day during implementation.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.0/11" class="indent">In answer to part <i>(b)</i> of your question, most staff will continue to carry out the same work as they are currently but, over the coming months, a programme of learning and development will be used to refresh or broaden the skills of those who require it. A skills audit of all staff is being carried out currently and that will be used to assess the training needs and costs. Whilst the full cost has not yet been assessed, it is worth mentioning that some training of this nature would have been undertaken as part of the normal life of the unit; the key difference is that the skills audit will facilitate precise targeting of the training.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.0/12" class="indent">Finally, you asked what advice he had received from the Disability and Carers Service on the likely impact on assessment of claims during the reorganisation of the Disability Benefits Unit.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.0/13" class="indent">The expectation is that, in the immediate term, there will be minimal disruption to services. Pre-implementation activities have included the deployment of a dedicated team that has ensured there are no bottlenecks of work in the DBU and contingency plans exist should, unexpectedly, there be difficulties in the immediate period after the changes. The CCH will be open for its normal hours, and provide the full range of services, throughout the implementation period. In the medium term, the expectation is that the unit will function more effectively and efficiently and there will be gains in terms of improvements in quality, time taken to deal with cases, overall customer care and efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.0/14" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="d.288W.5/1">In August 1997 there were 137 medical examination centres (MECs), in December 2001 there were 121, and in July 2005 there were 125. These figures relate to permanent sites. In addition medical services use up to 40 casual hire centres, which are used as and when required.</p>

However, no customer is required to travel more than 90 minutes each way on public transport to attend a MEC. Where customers cannot get to an examination centre within 90 minutes using public transport, or where it is clear that they would have health-related difficulties in travelling, alternative arrangements are made.</p>
