In addition, the Defence of the Soviet Arctic Region Medal (DSARM) is a campaign medal and it was agreed at the end of the Second World War, by the then allied countries, not to exchange campaign medals. (The Atlantic Star is the British medal awarded for service in Atlantic Convoys.)</p>
	<p pid=".796W.8/3">However, officials have been examining the possibility of an exception to the present rules to permit veterans to accept the DSARM should the Russian Government formally seek the Government's authority to award the medal to British Citizens.

	<p pid=".814W.0/1">This aspect of the Employment Directive is implemented by the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003. The regulations define &quot;religion or belief&quot; as &quot;any religion, religious belief, or similar philosophical belief&quot;. It will be for the courts and tribunals to determine, in accordance with the Directive's requirements, whether a religion or belief falls within this definition. However, guidance to help employers put the new legislation into effect is available from Acas, and on the website acas.org.uk. In addition the Acas national helpline (08457 47 47 47) is able to offer advice on employment related issues.</p>
	<p pid=".814W.0/2">The reference to &quot;religion&quot; includes religions such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Rastafarianism, Baha'is, Zoroastrians and Jains. Branches or sects within a religion can be considered as a religion or religious belief, such as Catholics or Protestants within the Christian church.</p>
	<p pid=".814W.0/3">The reference to &quot;similar philosophical belief&quot; includes philosophical belief which is similar to a religious belief in that it is a profound belief affecting a person's way of life, or perception of the world. The belief should occupy a place in the person's life parallel to that filled by the God or Gods of those holding a particular religious belief.</p>

	<p pid=".823W.0/1">This Department does not collect data on feed usage and composition from the limited number of enterprises engaged in cod farming in the UK. However, we estimate that between 1.2kg and 1.4kg of feed is needed to produce 1kg of farmed cod of a marketable size.</p>
	<p pid=".823W.0/2">We do not have information on the weight of the raw marine resource used in feed for farmed cod. The quantity involved will vary depending on the proportion of fishmeal used in the different grades of dry fish feed produced for cod at various stages of growth. Cod, like other farmed piscivorous species are unlikely to consume more natural marine resources through feed than their wild counterparts would consume in the natural environment.</p>
	<p pid=".823W.0/3">The fish used for aquaculture feed are generally small, bony pelagic species sourced from non food grade fisheries, usually off the coasts of Peru and Chile, and in the North Atlantic, North Sea and Baltic Sea.</p>
	<p pid=".823W.0/4">We understand that feed for farmed cod includes protein and oils derived from marine sources, carbohydrate, starch, minerals and vitamins.</p>

	<p pid=".825W.2/1">The results of the routine biological monitoring of the River Nene in spring 2003 showed that biological water quality at Cogenhoe (NGR SP 831 615) (mid reaches of the River Nene) and sites as far downstream as Orton Staunch (NGR TL 167 973) were uncharacteristically poor. In particular, there was a general absence of water hog louse, mayflies and freshwater shrimp, normally commonly occurring freshwater invertebrate species in the River Nene. In contrast, the invertebrate community at Duston Mill (NGR SP 730 597), the routine monitoring site further upstream of Cogenhoe, suggested good water quality with these taxa found in abundance.</p>
	<p pid=".825W.2/2">Results of a survey undertaken in September 2003 from sites along the River Nene show that biological water quality at Billing Road Bridge and Cogenhoe (mid reaches of the River Nene) is improving (although water hog louse and freshwater shrimp is still absent). In contrast, the invertebrate community at sites in the lower reaches of the River Nene has largely recovered, and these sites achieved their water quality target rating.</p>
	<p pid=".825W.2/3">Recently an additional survey has been undertaken at the same sites. Although sample processing is not yet completed, initial observations suggest that mid reaches of the River Nene are still impacted by the pollution incident that occurred earlier in the year. Of particular concern is the continuing absence of water hog louse and freshwater shrimp.</p>
	<p pid=".825W.2/4">The Environment Agency undertakes routine freshwater invertebrate surveys in spring and autumn seasons each year at specific sites along the River Nene. This information is available to members of the public upon application to the Environment Agency Customer Services Department in Lincoln (Tel. 01522 513100). Additional surveying of the River Nene and Hardingstone Dyke was undertaken to locate the source of the pollution. Data arising from these surveys is not currently available pending the outcome of the Environment Agency Special Enforcement team review of this case. Monitoring undertaken to record recovery of the River Nene and Hardingstone Dyke, is also available to members of the public, on application to the customer services department.</p>
	<p pid=".825W.2/5">Surveys have been undertaken at three-monthly intervals at important sites along the River Nene using standard methods which sample the accessible margins of the watercourse using a pond net. Key species (water hog louse and freshwater shrimp) which were absent at sites along the mid reaches of the River Nene remain absent. The Red Data Book riffle beetle <i>Stenelimis canaliculata</i> was not found in any samples taken in 2003, although it has been recorded very infrequently in the lower reaches of the River Nene in the past. It is difficult to say whether its absence is related to the pollution incident, as it is a deep-water species and unlikely to be sampled using Environment Agency standard methodology.</p>
	<p pid=".825W.2/6">The Environment Agency have not carried out a specific survey for the Red Data Book riffle beetle <i>Stenelimis canaliculata</i> and have no plans to conduct such a survey. To do so would disturb the habitat, which could be damaging to this and other deep water species.</p>
	<p pid=".825W.2/7">It is not normal practice to restock invertebrate populations damaged by pollution incidents; invertebrate populations usually recover through natural colonisation from tributaries and unaffected sites upstream, or natural invertebrate re-distribution.</p>
	<p pid=".825W.2/8">Fish were not affected directly by the pollution incident, so fish re-stocking is not necessary. However, the longer term health of fish populations in the mid reaches of the River Nene may be affected because their food source remains depleted.</p>

The results showed a diverse and abundant invertebrate community and the biological data suggested excellent water quality. The key species impacted by the pollution on the River Nene, water hog louse (<i>Asellus aquaticus</i>) and freshwater shrimp (in this instance, <i>Crangonyx pseudogracilis</i>) were abundant in Morton's Leam.

The Government of Zimbabwe's reluctance to acknowledge the disastrous effects of the fast-track land reform programme has prevented the humanitarian community from carrying out a comprehensive assessment or establishing recognised IDP camps.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.5/2">Numbers of documented Zimbabwean refugees are negligible&mdash;the vast majority of Zimbabweans fleeing the crisis are classed as migrants. Again, exact numbers of this transient population are difficult to assess, as many are illegal migrants in the sub-region. However, there are believed to be 2.35 million Zimbabwean migrants in the Southern Africa region. The vast majority of these, approximately two million, are in South Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.5/3">DFID is providing support to the International Organisation for Migration and also a Zimbabwean NGO working with former farm workers to prevent displacement and provide, humanitarian assistance for displaced people.</p>

	<p pid=".832W.2/1">The UN World Food Programme (WFP), who are the principal coordinators for general food distributions in Zimbabwe, have to date secured over 50 per cent. of the funding requested for this year's Emergency Operation (EMOP) in Zimbabwe. This follows recent pledges of US$8 million from the European Union, and &pound;5 million from DFID. This means that food will be available for distribution until mid-February 2004, when there will be a shortage of cereals if further contributions are not forthcoming. A substantial additional pledge is anticipated shortly from the United States.</p>
	<p pid=".832W.2/2">Despite this funding, the WFP have reduced monthly ration levels in order to accommodate the growing number of vulnerable people, above the level anticipated when the EMOP appeal was originally prepared. This increase in beneficiary numbers is partly due to increased urban vulnerability, as spiralling inflation (now over 500 per cent.) has affected food prices in shops. There is also emerging evidence of up to several hundred thousand people facing crisis in the former commercial farming areas, most of whom are former farm workers displaced by the Government's disastrous land reform programme. Additionally, the state-controlled Grain Marketing Board has proved erratic and unreliable in contributing to food supply and distribution in the country. Donors are monitoring the situation closely, in close consultation with the WFP.</p>

Health professionals can provide contraception to young people under 16 provided they are satisfied that the young person is competent to understand fully the implications of any treatment and to make a choice of the treatment involved. Health professionals work within an established legal framework which involves assessing the young person's competence to understand the choices they are making and encouraging them to talk to their parents. All professionals are bound by their professional code of confidentiality. A young person's request for confidentiality is respected unless there are serious child protection issues.</p>

The same information is reproduced in the School Governors' Guides to the Law, which are revised and re-issued annually.

This letter is posted on The Parent Centre website.</p>
	<p pid=".836W.8/3">All LEAs and schools must have a charging policy in place, which is readily available to parents. In addition, when schools make charges, or request money, they must explain whether parents are being asked to pay for a specific activity or make a general contribution to school funds. Schools must also be clear whether or not contributions are voluntary.</p>

	<p pid=".837W.5/25"><sup>(13)</sup> The table shows the value of loans cancelled or written off during each financial year.</p>
	<p pid=".837W.5/26"><sup>(14)</sup> Two portfolios of student loans to the value of just over &pound;2 billion have been sold to the private sector in March 1998 and March 1999. The figures in the table relate to the public debt only.</p>
	<p pid=".837W.5/27"><sup>(15)</sup> A cancelled loan is one where the borrower no longer has any liability to repay as set out by legislation. A borrower's liability to repay a mortgage style loan shall be cancelled: on death of the borrower; after 25 years or when the borrower reaches the age of 50 (60 if the borrower was aged over 40 when he/she last borrowed), whichever is the earlier, provided the borrower is not in arrears of any loan agreement; and if the borrower is in receipt of a disability related benefit and permanently unfit for work. Income contingent loans are cancelled because of death or permanent disability in the same way, but are cancelled on the grounds of age when the borrower reaches the age of 65. A written off loan is one where the borrower remains liable to repay but recovery is deemed unlikely by the loan administrator or not possible by legal judgment.</p>

	<p pid=".837W.5/31">The amount written off or cancelled may relate to loans advanced in any of the previous financial years. Therefore data cannot be expressed as a proportion of amount lent.</p>
	<p pid=".837W.5/32">In addition to the amount shown in the table, &pound;0.5 million was written off under the Repayment of Teacher Loans scheme in respect of accounts in public ownership in financial year 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".837W.5/33">The introduction of the income contingent loan based system of student support from 1998&ndash;99 meant that the amount of student loans paid out each year has increased. The amount of loan advanced in 1993&ndash;94 was &pound;292.3 million (all mortgage style); in 2002&ndash;03 it was &pound;2,618.0 million (of which &pound;2,599.2 million was income contingent loans). A consequence of this increase is a higher level of write-off or cancellation.</p>

	<p pid=".844W.3/2">I am placing a copy of the terms of reference applicable to Lancaster University's Project Isolus public consultation work in the Library of the House. Lancaster University placed advertisements for the public meeting at Whitehaven in three local weekly newspapers during the week before the meeting, to reduce the risk of it being poorly attended. The first advertisement appeared in the North West Evening Mail on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-24">24 November 2003</phrase>, one week before the meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-01">1 December 2003</phrase>. This strategy was also aimed at ensuring that the advertisements would appear at about the same time as any articles published in advance of the meeting, thereby setting the event in context. Information on public meetings, at Whitehaven and elsewhere in England and Scotland, was also published on the Lancaster University website around two to four weeks in advance of the confirmed date for the meetings.</p>

	<p pid=".849W.11/1">The Department for Regional Development continues to support 16 rural community transport partnerships, which offer a range of transport services for their members that complement conventional public transport networks and which in particular provide transport opportunities for people with reduced mobility in rural areas. These partnerships cover most of rural Northern Ireland and the Department is encouraging local interests to establish partnerships in areas currently not covered. The Department also provides revenue support to Translink to maintain a network of 44 rural routes across Northern Ireland, which would otherwise be uneconomic to run. Recently the Department introduced the Bus Challenge Scheme to support new stage carriage bus services in both rural and urban areas. This scheme is open to both Translink and private bus operators and is aimed at addressing gaps in the provision of bus services. So far the Department has agreed to support eight new routes which go through rural areas.</p>

	<p pid=".851W.2/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister welcomes the interim report by the Barker Review and look forward to seeing what policy recommendations emerge in the Kate Barker's final report.</p>
	<p pid=".851W.2/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has already taken significant steps to tackle the shortage of affordable housing. In all around &pound;5 billion is being allocated over the next two years&mdash;2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 to support housing investment in the English regions.</p>
	<p pid=".851W.2/3">In addition we have consulted on a proposed update to Planning Policy Guidance note 3: Housing. The aim of the update is to provide a framework that will secure more affordable housing without affecting the overall supply of housing, deliver a better mix of housing in new developments in terms of size, type and affordability, and ensure that the needs of the whole community are addressed, including for particular groups such as key workers. Affordable housing can be secured through planning obligations and we consulted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-06">6 November</phrase> on our proposed new policy to improve negotiated planning obligations and legislation for an optional planning charge.</p>

	<p pid=".854W.5/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recognises the important contribution that shared ownership schemes can play in making home ownership affordable for people on modest incomes. The Home Ownership Task Force, which reported on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-13">13 November</phrase>, has proposed 45 recommendations to assist in the delivery of affordable housing, including improvements to the operation of the shared ownership scheme. We are considering the recommendations and will respond in the new year.</p>
	<p pid=".854W.5/2">Government funding for shared ownership is provided by the Housing Corporation through grants to registered social landlords. Around 13 per cent. of the Corporation's Approved Development Programme in 2003&ndash;04 (total programme &pound;1.2 billion) will be spent on home ownership initiatives, including shared ownership and the Homebuy equity loan scheme. In 2002&ndash;03 over 4,000 affordable homes were provided through the shared ownership and Homebuy schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".854W.5/3">In addition the &pound;250 million Starter Home Initiative is helping key workers into home ownership primarily through equity loan and shared ownership arrangements. Almost 6,000 key workers have so far benefited from the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".854W.5/4">From April 2004, the new key worker housing programme will help key workers, both first-time buyers and those wishing to trade-up, in areas of high housing costs. The options available to key workers through the scheme will include equity loan and shared ownership arrangements. Full details of the operation of the scheme will be announced by the beginning of March.</p>

	<p pid=".855W.5/1">Each local planning authority would be required, under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill, to prepare an Annual Monitoring Report. Regulations would specify that the report has to be prepared by <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-31">31 December</phrase> in each year to cover the period from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March</phrase> immediately preceding. The authority would need to report on their performance against the published local development scheme and on the impact of their policies on the ground. The authority and stakeholders would need to know what effect its policies and proposals were having in order to decide whether they are achieving the desired effect or whether changes are needed. Draft Regulation 48 requires authorities to include information on housing policy and performance.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.5/2">If the annual report on the effect of the authority's policies or proposals demonstrates that they are not performing as desired this should trigger the authority to revise their local development scheme (and subsequently their local development documents) under clause 25 (revision of local development documents). If they fail to do so, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister can direct the authority to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.5/3">Through the planning delivery grant, we are investing an extra &pound;350 million in planning over the three years 2003&ndash;06. This will provide local authorities with the resources to deliver an improved, efficient and responsive planning system that takes good decisions in sensible timeframes and delivers the right development in the right places. Part of the grant is top-sliced for local authorities in areas of high housing demand. In 2004&ndash;05 we are giving serious consideration to an element of the grant being related to performance in the delivery of housing in these areas.</p>
	<p pid=".855W.5/4">Through comprehensive performance assessment we make across the board judgments about the quality of the services delivered and management in authorities. We can use it to assess whether there are corporate reasons for any failure to deliver good housing and planning services. It informs us on the nature and scope of any support that might be needed for failing housing and planning services.</p>

	<p pid=".857W.5/13">The formula grant per head figures in the table are not directly comparable since the services provided by West Sussex county council are not the same as those provided by London boroughs. London boroughs also provide those services provided by the district council within the West Sussex area; while West Sussex county council received an allocation of grant to cover fire services in 2003&ndash;04, that are provided by the Greater London Authority in the London area. In addition the City of London also provides police services. The total England figure includes both district level and police services; neither of these services are provided by West Sussex county council.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.5/14">The calculation of formula grant takes account of a range of factors other than the numbers of recipients. It includes top-ups for deprivation, pay costs, and other factors such as population sparsity that drive the costs of service delivery in different areas, as well as the relative ability of councils to raise council tax in their areas. Simple per capita comparisons will not therefore be meaningful comparisons of all the factors that drive grant distribution.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.5/15">If West Sussex county council received &pound;1,166.30 per head of formula grant then it would have received &pound;879,685,274, an additional &pound;500,043,641; at &pound;809.90 per head of formula grant then it would have received &pound;610,869,505, an additional &pound;231,227,872; and at &pound;892.49 then it would have received &pound;673,163,260, an additional &pound;293,521,627.</p>

	<p pid=".863W.3/1">We announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-01">1 December</phrase> that the fee charged by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) for a Standard Disclosure will rise from &pound;24 to &pound;28 and that for an Enhanced Disclosure from &pound;29 to &pound;33. These increases will take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.3/2">We have always made it clear that the CRB would be self-financed through the fees charged for providing the Disclosure service, and that the fee levels would be regularly reviewed. When the last fee increase was announced in June 2003, we re-affirmed the requirement that the CRB should be self-financing in the medium term&mdash;that is, from 2005&ndash;06 onwards. The CRB continues to make efficiency savings. However, as the CRB moves towards full cost recovery, it is necessary to reduce the substantial subsidy that the CRB currently receives from the general taxpayer and to make a compensating increase in the Disclosure fee.</p>
	<p pid=".863W.3/3">Disclosures continue to be issued free to volunteers, saving the voluntary sector some &pound;12 million in 2004&ndash;05. We have had no discussions with the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) specifically on the latest fee increase. But we agreed earlier to meet representatives of the NCVO to discuss its concerns about the previous fee increase, amongst other issues. In addition, the NCVO is represented on the CRB Voluntary and Community Sector Working Group which provides a forum to raise any CRB-related issues affecting the sector.</p>

The balance between police officers and police staff and other resources, such as IT systems, in the Gwent Police is a matter for the Chief Constable. It is not therefore possible to estimate the number of police officers that Gwent Police will have Over the next two years.

	<p pid=".869W.0/2">There are no overall complement levels set, as the demand for door supervisors is to a large extent market led.

	<p pid=".874W.14/1">There are already a number of measures in place to help lower earners build up their entitlement to state pension.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.14/2">Employees who earn above the lower earnings limit (LEL) but less than the lower earnings threshold (LET) are treated as having earnings at the LET. Certain carers and people who are disabled or long-term ill who earn less than the LET, including those with no earnings at all, are also treated as having earnings at the LET. Because the LET is set at a higher amount than the LEL, some employees do not have to pay national insurance contributions (NICs) but are treated as if they have paid them. This means that they continue to build up entitlement to contributory benefits such as state pension and incapacity benefit even though they are not paying NICs.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.14/3">In addition, people with earnings below the level at which they are treated as paying NICs or no earnings can have their state pension entitlement protected by home responsibilities protection (HRP). HRP helps to protect the basic state pension position of people whose opportunities to work are limited because of caring responsibilities at home. It is available to eligible people for complete tax years and reduces the number of qualifying years they would otherwise need for a basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.14/4">Also, recipients of working tax credit whose earnings are below the level at which they are treated as paying NICs can be credited with contributions for state pension purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.14/5">Further, the state second pension focuses help on those with low to moderate earnings and on qualifying carers and long term-disabled people who have broken work records. 20 million people have started to benefit from the reform of state earnings-related pension scheme (SERPS) through the state second pension, introduced in April 2002. Low earners will get at least double what they would have got from SERPS, while carers and disabled people with broken work records will be entitled to an additional state pension for the first time.</p>

	<p pid=".877W.0/1">The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) published guidance on the organisation and delivery of services for people with urological cancers, including prostate cancer, in September 2002. The guidance states that the option of brachytherapy should be discussed with men with early prostate cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".877W.0/2">However, the NICE guidance also acknowledges that, the place of brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer is uncertain and notes the importance of research to evaluate the effectiveness of brachytherapy for prostate cancer. The guidance refers to a randomised intergroup trial comparing brachytherapy with radical surgery that is being organised by the National Cancer Institute of Canada and the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group, and strongly encourages UK participation in this study. As a result, the Department of Health has made available &pound;900,000 through the National Cancer Research Network (NCRN) to enable national health service patients to enter this trial. The National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) prostate cancer clinical studies group and the NCRN are working closely together to take this trial forward in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".877W.0/3">As more evidence on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of brachytherapy becomes available, the Department will consider whether this treatment is a suitable topic for referral to NICE as a technology appraisal. The Government are devolving power from the centre to enable primary care trusts to use the extra resources for the NHS to deliver on both national and local priorities for their communities, accounting publicly for how they have used them.</p>

	<p pid=".877W.3/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-04">4 December 2003</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".877W.3/2">Comparable statistics on cancer survival in the United Kingdom and most other European Union countries have been produced in three studies funded by the European Commission (the EUROCARE studies). Cancer registries in the UK, including staff from the National Registry at the Office for National Statistics, have been involved in these studies since they began in 1989.</p>
	<p pid=".877W.3/3">The recently published findings of the EUROCARE 3 study, covering patients diagnosed in 1990&ndash;94, showed that cancer survival rates in England, in general, lag behind those in Europe. However, the study also shows that the gap in survival rates between England and other comparable countries is now beginning to diminish. For patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the early 1990s, differences in the stage at diagnosis were a key explanation for the differences in survival between Western European countries.</p>
	<p pid=".877W.3/4">It is important to note that these studies predate the introduction of the NHS Cancer Plan by more than five years. The improvements in waiting times, treatment and the introduction of specialist teams for breast cancer patients now being delivered by the NHS Cancer Plan will help to ensure survival rates for breast cancer patients continue to improve. Indeed, Cancer Research UK have noted that in the past decade British women have had the worlds biggest decrease in deaths from breast cancer thanks to better diagnosis and treatment. Indeed, deaths from breast cancer among the under 70s have decreased more sharply in Britain than anywhere in the world, by 30 per cent., in the last 10 years.</p>

Patients may also be offered advice on how to make lifestyle changes, for example, smoking cessation or dietary advice, which will improve their quality of life and reduce the risks of their condition deteriorating.</p>

To help support this activity, the LTCCGWT in the summer of 2002, commissioned Skills for Health to develop competence frameworks for diabetes. The frameworks are intended to describe the quality of service a person with diabetes needs, whether that service is provided by a diabetes specialist nurse, a practice nurse, a general practitioner, a dietician, or any of the other professionals who provide diabetes care. They cover the key activities of:</p>

This guidance proposes strengthening existing checks for tuberculosis and hepatitis B and introducing new checks for HIV and hepatitis C for new healthcare workers who will perform exposure prone procedures&mdash;where injury to the healthcare worker could expose a patient to the risk of infection from the healthcare worker's blood. Such procedures occur mainly in surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, dentistry and midwifery.</p>

	<p pid=".886W.5/1">The Government have made clear its position on the use of genetic test results for underwriting life and health insurance in the October 2001 Government response to the report from the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee: Genetics and Insurance.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.5/2">The Genetics and Insurance Committee (GAIC) is responsible for the evaluation of specific genetic tests and their relevance to particular types of insurance. GAIC also provides independent scrutiny of compliance with the terms of the moratorium on the use of genetic test results by insurance companies, which runs until November 2006. If there is evidence of non-compliance with the moratorium by the insurance industry, then the Government is prepared to enforce it through legislation, if necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.5/3">The Human Genetics Commission (HGC) has been asked to work closely with GAIC to provide Government with further advice in developing a longer-term policy on the use of genetic information by insurance companies. GAIC and HGC will also monitor the effectiveness of the Association of British Insurers (ABI) Code of practice on Genetics which is mandatory for all ABI members.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.5/4">HGC and GAIC held a well-received joint public meeting in September 2003. A number of interested groups, members of the public, attended this meeting, including representatives from organisations concerned with genetic disorders, as well as from insurance and re-insurance companies, and non-Governmental organisations with an interest in this area. HGC and GAIC are planning a further such meeting in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".886W.5/5">Research is also under way to consider the use of genetic information in insurance underwriting. This research will be completed by 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".888W.5/1">One of the main reasons why we have supported the development of the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products is the difficulty companies sometimes experience at present in providing evidence that their products fully satisfy all the criteria for a marketing authorisation, and in particular the requirements relating to efficacy.</p>
	<p pid=".888W.5/2">The current text of the proposed Directive provides that, where the competent authorities judge that a traditional herbal medicinal product fulfils the criteria for a marketing authorisation, the product will not be eligible for a traditional use registration. Our view is that it is likely that only a very small proportion of unlicensed herbal remedies currently on the United Kingdom market would be affected by this provision in a situation where an applicant was seeking a traditional use registration. However, it is not practicable for the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency to give a more specific estimate in advance of the launch of the proposed traditional use registration scheme or to conduct a detailed survey that would be burdensome to the industry.</p>

	<p pid=".891W.3/2">The Department of Health supports the target on waste prevention and reduction. We believe women and their families should be given information on the use of both re-useable and disposable nappies to make an informed choice. &quot;The Pregnancy Book&quot; and &quot;Birth to Five&quot; are two comprehensive information booklets produced by the Department of Health and given free to all first time mothers. Both these publications give detailed information on both reusable and disposable nappies.</p>

	<p pid=".892W.6/2">The Government recognised in the NHS Cancer Plan (2000) that national health service support for specialist palliative care services needed to increase. We pledged to increase NHS investment in specialist palliative care by &pound;50 million per annum by 2004. Ministers also made available an additional &pound;10 million from central budgets in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".892W.6/3">We have now set up a &pound;50 million per annum central budget for specialist palliative care to ensure that our pledge in the NHS Cancer Plan is met. This extra &pound;50 million over and above what is already being invested, is to help tackle inequalities in access to specialist palliative care and to enable the NHS to increase their contribution to the cost hospices incur in providing agreed levels of services. All 34 cancer networks have submitted investment plans for the use of their allocation to the National Partnership Group (NPG) for palliative care (a joint NHS/voluntary sector group). The NPG has assessed the investment plans. Plans have been approved and allocations have been made to local cancer networks which will result in an additional 71 whole time equivalent consultants, an additional 162 whole time equivalent cancer nurse specialists and an extra 86 specialist palliative care in-patient beds. The &pound;50 million represents a significant increase of nearly 40 per cent. in NHS funding for specialist palliative care over 2000 levels.</p>

	<p pid=".898W.2/1">The long term conditions care group work force team (LTCCGWT) is responsible for increasing the capacity of the work force supporting the delivery of neurology, diabetes, renal and dermatology services. The LTCCGWT is a multi-disciplinary advisory body working in support of the National Workforce Development Board and the Workforce Numbers Advisory Board in drawing up national workforce strategies. It takes a national view of the health and social care workforce pressures and priorities for the long-term conditions client group. Each year the LTCCGWT produces a report setting out its recommendations on work force issues, such as the need for increased numbers of staff and also new ways of working, including skill mix, role extensions and multi-disciplinary working, based around patient needs. This report, along with those from the other six CGWTs forms the overall report to the June meeting of the Workforce Numbers Advisory Board. The 2003 reports from the CGWTs will be published shortly for distribution to strategic health authorities and workforce development confederations. The reports will also be available on the CGWT website, together with details of the group's membership and terms of reference.
