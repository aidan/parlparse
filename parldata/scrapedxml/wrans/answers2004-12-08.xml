	<p pid=".509W.3/1">My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 22 and <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-23">23 November 2004</phrase>. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Ministers with responsibility for agriculture and fisheries were also present.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.3/2">The Council opened on the first day in office of the new Commission. The Council welcomed Commissioners Mariann Fischer-Boel, Markos Kyprianou and Joe Borg to their new posts.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.3/3">The Presidency secured qualified majority support for a political agreement on a compromise text updating the current rules on the welfare of animals during transport. I supported the proposal, which contains significant improvements to the current rules, including a strengthening of the enforcement rules in Europe, stricter rules for journeys of more than eight hours and new rules for the transport of horses. The proposal also sets out a clear timetable for the review of the new rules together with a commitment to address the issue of journey times, space allowances and rest periods no later than four years after they have come into effect.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.3/4">The Council had a lengthy exchange of views on reform in the sugar sector, based on the Commission's communication of July 2004. The Commission indicated that it would not make formal proposals until May or June next year when the result of the EU's appeal against a WTO panel ruling on the sugar regime had been received. The Commission would press for political agreement before the WTO Ministerial scheduled for Hong Kong in December 2005. A majority of member states were critical of the Commission's approach thus far and argued for minimal change, principally aimed at maintaining production in all those areas of the EU where it is currently found. I argued that the current regime was unsustainable and that reform was inescapable. The EU needed to honour its external obligations and I welcomed the Commission's commitment to bringing forward a draft action plan for assistance to the ACP countries by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.3/5">In a brief discussion of the rural development and CAP financing proposals, there was general support for the rural development measures, although concerns were expressed on a number of specific issues such as the proposed structure for the new regulation and the treatment of less favoured areas. I stressed the importance of further transfers to Pillar 2 measures, the case for a more objective allocation of funds and the need for equitable treatment of the non-euro member states. Discussion will continue at official level.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.3/6">The Presidency drew attention to its initiative for member states to co-operate on agricultural research in order to avoid duplication and to maximise value for money. I supported this initiative and expressed our readiness to co-operate with Luxembourg in taking it forward next year.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.3/7">Under Other Business, Estonia described its problems relating to a Russian ban on imports of plant material, Spain called for collaboration with Morocco in the field of animal health, Germany asked the Commission to bring forward legislation on the marketing of seeds of plant varieties of conservation importance, and Slovakia requested funding under the natural disasters heading following gales in the High Tatras national park.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.3/8">The Commission reported progress in the bilateral negotiations on a 2005 fisheries agreement with Norway. Good progress had been made in a first round of negotiations on 15&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">19 November</phrase>, including provisional agreement on some of the more contentious issues. My hon. Friend and other member states congratulated the Commission on progress so far while underlining the importance of concluding the negotiations rapidly so that EU fishermen are able to fish in Norway waters from <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.3/9">The Council had a first debate on the Commission's proposals for a European Fisheries Fund (to replace the existing fund for structural improvements in the fisheries sector from 2007). My hon. Friend made clear that the proposal from certain other member states that this should provide for subsidies for fleet renewal would mean going back on a key plank of the 2002 reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and was not acceptable. Discussions will continue next year.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.3/10">The Council reached agreement by qualified majority on a proposal to allocate quotas to deep sea species to certain new member states, based on a presidency compromise tabled at the meeting. Although the compromise went some way towards requests from the United Kingdom and others that new allocations should be on the same basis as allocation to the EU15, the UK abstained in the vote because the proposal had not cleared Parliamentary Scrutiny and because the Government have concerns about the management regime for deep sea species.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.3/11">The Council held a discussion on management measures for fisheries in the Baltic Sea.</p>

Consultation on the draft Gangmaster Licensing Authority Regulations has been completed and it is anticipated that the regulations will be presented to the House for consideration immediately after Christmas.

	<p pid=".512W.8/2">Street lighting in England is the responsibility of local highway authorities in respect of local roads and the Highways Agency in respect of the trunk road network. The electricity supply for public lighting is not normally metered, but is based on notional lamp wattages and hours of use. The actual electricity consumption is therefore unknown. It is for local highway authorities to decide whence to source their electricity supply so, even if the power consumption could be established, calculations about the carbon dioxide emissions produced by street lighting would be impossible without knowing what proportion of authorities have contracted for &quot;green&quot; energy sources.</p>

	<p pid=".521W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-06">6 December 2004</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".521W.5/2">Clause 17 gives the Secretary of State the power to prohibit the fitting of, or the use of vehicles carrying, speed assessment equipment detection devices. It defines such devices as a device one or more of whose purposes is to interfere with or detect the operation of equipment used to assess the speed of motor vehicles. The precise subset of the devices which will be prohibited will be identified in regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".521W.5/3">The Government do not intend to prohibit the use of equipment which usefully gives drivers information on the location of published camera sites and does not detect or interfere with the operation of speed assessment equipment. Thus complementing the measures we took in 2001 to ensure that camera sites are visible and conspicuous to drivers, and so help deter excessive and inappropriate speeds on the roads.</p>
	<p pid=".521W.5/4">The sole purpose of detection devices to be covered by the proposed law is to tell drivers when they can break speed limits and get away with it. This is unacceptable, prevents the police from carrying out their duties, and is a danger to other law-abiding drivers and road users.</p>
	<p pid=".521W.5/5">There is overwhelming evidence from both UK and international literature that speeding results in more collisions and more severe casualties. As regards safety cameras, the evidence from the independent review of the safety camera programme by University College London and PA Consulting found that cameras significantly reduced the number of people killed or seriously injured at camera sites. This evidence demonstrates why the provisions of Clause 17 of the Bill would enhance road safety.</p>

The number is increasing at a steady rate and we expect it to continue to do so. In 2004/05 across England we expect the number of 16 to 18-year-olds participating in education to increase by 35,000 (3.8 percentage points) as a direct result of EMA. By 2006/07, when EMA is available to all eligible 16 to 18-year-olds, an additional 72,000 young people will be in further education. If the same participation increase is applied to the east of England region an additional 7,900 16 to18-year-olds will be participating in further education by 2006/07. Estimates are not available at local authority level.</p>

	<p pid=".529W.3/1">It is government policy that all decennial census returns should remain closed for 100 years. This is in order that public confidence continues to be maintained through the confidentiality assurances that are provided when citizens are required to complete their census forms.</p>
	<p pid=".529W.3/2">It would be premature to consider what revenue might be raised from making the 1911 and 1921 censuses available online so far in advance of their release dates. There have been no meetings between Treasury and DCA Ministers on this matter and it would not be appropriate to prepare revenue estimates at this time.</p>

	<p pid=".535W.3/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to two of your recent Parliamentary Questions on the 2003 PISA survey. (203174 and 203176)</p>
	<p pid=".535W.3/4" class="indent">PISA is a survey co-ordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which was conducted in 41 countries in 2003. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) conducted the survey in England and Wales on behalf of the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency in Northern Ireland on behalf of Department of Education, Northern Ireland. The survey in Scotland was conducted by the Scottish Centre for Research in Education on behalf of the Scottish Executive.</p>
	<p pid=".535W.3/5" class="indent">The survey involves a two-hour written assessment, as well as completion of a questionnaire by a representative sample of students aged 15. In the UK, PISA depends on the voluntary co-operation of both schools and students. Compared with other surveys conducted through schools, PISA is quite disruptive as it takes a long time to complete and is conducted in the Spring term when schools are preparing for examinations.</p>
	<p pid=".535W.3/6" class="indent">Minimum criteria for response rates are set by OECD, and the response rates in the UK, in particular in England, fell short of the required minimum. ONS conducted the survey according to current best practice and, with the DfES, made every effort to persuade schools to participate. In spite of this, the survey response rates fell short of the threshold set by the OECD.</p>

	<p pid=".541W.17/2">In designating Hereford and Worcester Fire Authority for capping in 2004&ndash;05, the Government took into account representations made by the authority, including the costs of retailing. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is confident that the authority can deliver a good service and carry out all its statutory functions within its revised budget requirement. The authority could have avoided the costs of retailing by not setting an excessive budget increase. It increased its budget requirement by 19.4 per cent. and council tax by 29.4 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".554W.8/81">1. This information was obtained from the Prescribing Analysis and Cost (PACT) system, which covers prescriptions prescribed by GP practices in England and dispensed in the community. Prescriptions written within a GP practice but dispensed outside the strategic health authority will be included in the SHA in which the GP practice is based. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions written in hospitals/clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data. It is important to note this as some British National Formulary (BNF) sections have a high proportion of prescriptions written in hospitals that are dispensed in the community. For example, BNF chapter 4, &quot;Central Nervous System&quot; has a fair proportion of items written in mental health clinics that are dispensed in the community&mdash;these prescriptions are not included in PACT data.</p>
	<p pid=".554W.8/82">2. Net ingredient cost (NIC) is the basic cost of a drug. It does not take account of discounts, dispensing costs, fees or prescription charges income.</p>

	<p pid=".561W.10/1">There are currently no plans to make a transcription service available to members of the public free of charge, as the cost to the Department would be prohibitive. Currently transcripts are available for purchase to all parties involved in a case. Those who are not involved can also purchase a transcript if the judge deems the request for wanting one reasonable.</p>
	<p pid=".561W.10/2">However, the Government do understand that, in some circumstances, victims of crime or their families have a strong desire to review trial proceedings. As a result, my Department is therefore currently funding research into the level of demand for the provision of transcripts to victims. The results of this research will better inform us on development of policy into the issue of provision of transcripts to victims and the benefits this can bring.</p>
	<p pid=".561W.10/3">This area may also be assisted by longer-term advancements in recording technology. Currently the Department is working up proposals to test digital audio recording in court, which if successful would use voice recognition to enable spontaneous transcripts to be produced at a fraction of the existing cost.</p>

	<p pid=".562W.5/1">The Government believe that expert witnesses should be suitably qualified in the subject upon which they assist the court with expert opinion, have achieved a suitable level of specialist knowledge and up to date experience to act as an expert and be recognised by their peers. The recent report &quot;Sudden death in infancy&quot; recommended systems of accreditation and training for experts. Active consideration is being given to this recommendation by all agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".562W.5/2">As for legally aided cases, the Legal Services Commission published a consultation paper: &quot;The Use of Experts(Quality, Price and Procedures in publicly funded cases&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-26">26 November 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".562W.5/3">In relation to fees paid to experts, the paper proposes that rates need to be controlled in the same way as the rates paid to lawyers, and the paper sets out proposed guidance on fee levels in criminal and civil legally aided cases. The guidelines for civil cases are similar to those for legally aided criminal cases, but have a higher maximum and lower minimum.</p>
	<p pid=".562W.5/4">In relation to the accreditation of experts, the paper proposes that solicitors should be encouraged to use experts and interpreters who are on accredited registers such as: the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners; the National Register of Public Service Interpreters; or the register of the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People. The long-term aim is that all experts instructed in legally aided cases will be accredited.</p>
	<p pid=".562W.5/5">The LSC is not able to provide the information on disbursement spend in the requested format. In 2003&ndash;04, however, the LSC paid over &pound;200 million for disbursements overall; around &pound;140 million on civil cases and &pound;60 million on criminal. They estimate that experts' fees account for approximately two thirds, (or &pound;130 million) of disbursements.</p>

The ICO has recouped from notification fees &pound;7.7 million in 2002&ndash;03 and &pound;8.8 million in 2003&ndash;04. This money is returned to Government and effectively offsets the grant in aid. This means that the net expenditure by DCA on the ICO has been &pound;0.5k for 2002&ndash;03 and &pound;1.8 million for 2003&ndash;04. The number of staff employed by the Information Commissioner has increased from 198 in 2002&ndash;03 to 208 by the end of the financial year 2003&ndash;04. The Department's grant in aid allocation to the ICO over the course of the last two financial years (2002&ndash;03 to 2003&ndash;04) has increased by &pound;1.2 million, primarily because ICO have taken on more staff to deal with the case work likely to be generated when the Freedom of Information Act comes into force.</p>

	<p pid=".564W.0/1">At the end of the financial year 2003&ndash;04 the value of debt due to the Legal Services Commission (LSC) under the statutory charge was &pound;264 million. This included &pound;50 million of interest that had accrued upon the debt.</p>
	<p pid=".564W.0/2">The debt is secured by the registration of a statutory charge against property and is not generally collectable immediately. Under existing regulations, the LSC has no discretion to enforce repayment of the debt until the charged property is re-mortgaged, sold or upon the death of the client. When one of these events occurs, the Land Registry notifies the LSC and recovery procedures commence.</p>
	<p pid=".564W.0/3">In order to keep funded clients informed about their debt, and to facilitate early repayment, the LSC has commenced sending out annual statements to clients setting out amounts owed, including accrued interest and offering clients the opportunity to make payment in full or by instalment of their debt.</p>

	<p pid=".573W.0/1">Winter fuel payments are one of several measures in place to help alleviate fuel poverty. The majority of payments are made automatically without the need to claim. People who have not previously received a payment and who do not receive a Social Security benefit other than child benefit, housing benefit or council tax benefit must claim. Every effort is made to try and contact those who are newly eligible. For those people who do need to make a claim an extensive publicity campaign is carried out. This begins three months before the qualifying week in September and continues to the end of March. The campaign includes advertisements in national and local press, a leaflet and poster made available in a variety of venues, a dedicated winter fuel payment helpline and information on the internet.</p>

DFID is providing &pound;500,000 to support the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross which has been able to gradually increase its access within Burma over the last three years and is now operating in significant areas of Shan and Karen states and Tenassarim division.</p>

	<p pid=".580W.5/1">The UK has not made an independent estimate of the number of people displaced from their homes in eastern Burma. However, in October 2004, the Thailand Burma Border Consortium (TBBC) estimated that the number of people displaced from their homes in eastern Burma was at least 526,000. The TBBC estimated that of these people, 365,000 were living in temporary settlements in areas administered by the ethnic minority cease-fire groups; 77,000 were living in designated relocation sites in areas administered by the Burmese authorities; and 84,000 were in hiding in conflict areas.</p>

But access to education and primary health care is limited, and poverty is widespread.

	<p pid=".581W.0/1">The UN and the Vulnerability Assessment Committees (VACs) have estimated that around 5.6 million people in southern Africa will be food insecure until June 2005. There is, however, some debate as to how many of these require emergency food relief and how many are part of the caseload of people who are affected by structural, long-term food insecurity outside crisis situations, and for whom short term food aid is an inappropriate and unsustainable response.</p>

The situation varies quite considerably for individual countries both at national, sub national and household levels however, and VAC assessments will remain important in determining the appropriate level of short-term, emergency response.</p>

	<p pid=".581W.3/1">In many southern African countries, significant numbers of poor people are food insecure even when there is no food crisis. Ill health, unemployment, and lack of other means to obtain food (production, welfare payments, or family and non-governmental support) all contribute to a longer-term, structural food insecurity problem.</p>
	<p pid=".581W.3/2">DFID is increasing its support for income generating initiatives, and is encouraging the development of cash transfer programmes (as part of wider poverty reduction efforts in partnership with Governments), in order to address the long-term vulnerability issue underlying the present food insecurity in the region.</p>
	<p pid=".581W.3/3">In Zambia, DFID is working with Government to implement cash transfers as part of a wider social protection policy aimed at vulnerable, food insecure groups. In Lesotho, DFID is supporting agricultural income generating programmes as an alternative to food aid provision. DFID is also keen to explore how the Government of Lesotho's plans to pay pensions to senior citizens can be developed to provide cash transfers for a wider group of vulnerable, food insecure people. In Malawi, DFID is supporting the development of Government's new National Food and Nutrition Security Policy. This builds on experience in Ethiopia and Zambia in order to tackle the underlying causes of chronic food insecurity by raising agricultural productivity and providing more efficient safety nets to people who are predictably food insecure.</p>

	<p pid=".582W.2/1">DFID is very concerned and aims to ensure that short-term responses to food insecurity does not jeopardise longer-term approaches to sustainable development.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/2">In southern Africa, DFID has been important supporters of the Vulnerability Assessment Committees (VAC) at county and regional levels. This support has given us detailed information on the numbers of food insecure people who will require emergency assistance and, equally important, enables us to understand what responses are most appropriate to long-term food insecurity in the region. The VAC reports clearly underline that food aid alone is not an appropriate solution to underlying food insecurity conditions in southern Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/3">DFID's support for these country-owned VACs has stimulated discussions about longer-term responses to vulnerability, moving beyond food aid.

	<p pid=".582W.8/1">Earlier this year the Government of Zimbabwe announced a bumper maize harvest of 2.4 million metric tonnes and declared that international food aid will not be required in the period up to the next harvest, around April 2005. Several independent surveys have suggested that the actual harvest was considerably less than the Government has claimed. The recently released Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment (ZimVAC) indicates that 2.3 million people in the rural areas and 2.5 million people in urban areas will be unable to meet their food requirements in the 'hungry season' preceding the next harvest. Meanwhile, the Government of Zimbabwe appears to be importing substantial amounts of grain. Without accurate information about production or imports, it is difficult to assess food security prospects for the coming months. Donors, UN agencies and others are monitoring the situation closely.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.8/2">After the last harvest, the Government of Zimbabwe restricted the UN World Food Programme (WFP) to distributing only limited amounts of food aid, mainly through schools and clinics, reaching approximately 600,000 people per month. At this rate, there was a danger that the WFP grain stocks in Zimbabwe carried over from last year's humanitarian operations would spoil before distribution. Faced with the alternative that the WFP would export the grains to other countries in the region where they are needed, the Government of Zimbabwe recently authorised the WFP to undertake a large-scale &quot;one-off&quot; food distribution to 1.8 million of the poorest people in areas experiencing the most severe food shortages, to take place as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.8/3">This food distribution, likely to be the only donor-funded food distribution at scale during the present season, will be implemented using the same procedures as applied in previous WFP humanitarian operations. Political pressure on agencies implementing relief programmes may increase over the coming months; however, to date such donor-funded programmes have remained relatively free of political interference. DFID Zimbabwe is working closely with the WFP, the UN system and our partner organisations to emphasise adherence to procedures that ensure assistance reaches those in most need. Any incidences of irregularity will be comprehensively reported, investigated and dealt with appropriately, as in previous years.</p>

	<p pid=".586W.5/1">I attended the Competitiveness Council on <phrase class="date" code="">25 November</phrase> and my noble Friend Lord Sainsbury of Turville attended on <phrase class="date" code="">26 November</phrase>. Lord Sainsbury also attended the first ever Space Council, a joint meeting of the Council of the European Union and Council of the European Space Agency, on <phrase class="date" code="">25 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/2">The Council took note of a report from the presidency on the current EU economic situation and welcomed the Commission's Competitiveness Package, consisting of the Commission's Competitiveness Report 2004, the Innovation Scoreboard and the Enterprise Policy Scoreboard. In discussion, Ministers emphasised the need to progress the regulatory reform agenda, particularly in developing more robust competitiveness impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/3">Ministers discussed the Council's approach to the Lisbon Mid Term Review and their views on the recent report of the High Level Group chaired by Wim Kok. The Council broadly welcomed this report as a helpful basis for the Mid Term Review and agreed with the recommendation that stressed the need to focus on growth, employment and productivity as preconditions for social cohesion and sustainable development. Ministers also recognised that the Competitiveness Council had a lead role to play in three out of the five priority areas identified in the Kok report (the knowledge society, the business climate, and the internal market) and co-responsibility for the other two (an inclusive labour market and an environmentally sustainable future). Member states agreed the need to take steps at all levels, particularly at member state level, to ensure the Lisbon goals are realised.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/4">The Council adopted conclusions on Better Regulation and simplification of legislation. The UK welcomed the recent Commission progress report on improving impact assessment procedures, including boosting assessment of competitiveness impacts, and stressed again the importance of regulatory reform, with support from a number of member states. The Council also approved a list of 15 simplification priorities, which will now be sent to the Commission for further consideration.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/5">The Council had a policy debate on the draft REACH regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals), based around a presidency report of discussions so far in the ad hoc Working Group on Chemicals. A number of issues were discussed, including REACH impact assessment, data requirements for low-volume substances and the joint submission of data (including cost sharing). On the latter, the UK presented a paper jointly with Hungary promoting the One Substance, One Registration (OSOR) principle. In conclusion, the Council instructed its preparatory bodies to consider these key issues in greater detail, taking account of competitiveness issues (particularly for SMEs) human health and environmental issues, simplification of administrative processes and efficient use of resources.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/6">The Council had its first discussion on the draft directive establishing a general legal framework for services in the internal market designed to eliminate obstacles to freedom of establishment for service providers and free movement of services between member states. In discussion, Council underlined the political and economic significance of the proposed directive in the context of the Lisbon Strategy and the realisation of an internal market in services. Member states also discussed the country of origin principle, administrative simplification and administrative cooperation. I reiterated the UK's support for the market opening objectives of this proposed directive and our support in principle for the country of origin principle, subject to certain assurances on health and safety issues. The Council will return to this dossier at future meetings.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/7">The Council agreed on a general approach to a directive on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies governed by the laws of different member states. UK voted in favour.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/8">The Council unanimously agreed a proposed regulation on the monitoring of trade in drug precursors between the Community and third countries. UK supported this measure, which regulates trade in chemicals that can be used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/9">The Council had an exchange of views on the textiles and clothing industry, taking into account the Commission's communication of the recommendations of the High Level Group for this sector, which looked at improving the industry's competitiveness. Council conclusions were adopted.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/10">The Council discussed developments in international negotiations on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) and approved a modification to the Commission's negotiating mandate. This revised mandate should enable the Commission to finalise negotiations with international partners. The modified negotiating directives also confirm European support for Cadarache in France as the preferred site for ITER. The UK agreed with these modifications.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/11">Ministers held a policy debate on future European research policy. The presidency's conclusions emphasised the importance of research policy in the context of the Lisbon Strategy. There was broad agreement on the principles for the next Framework Programme (FP7) and a high degree of support for funding of basic research as part of this programme. Lord Sainsbury emphasised the need for a formal Commission proposal on FP7 as early as possible in 2005 and outlined the UK's vision for FP7, stressing the need to create world-class centres of excellence in Europe to attract the best young researchers. The Commission said that they hoped to present formal proposals on FP7 by April 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/12">Five items were taken under Any Other Business. Commissioner Verheugen gave a progress report on the shipbuilding-related LeaderSHIP 2015 initiative. The presidency gave Council information on the fifth Euro-med Conference on Industry, held at Caserta in October, at which the Euro-Mediterranean Charter for Enterprise and &quot;Caserta declaration&quot; were adopted. Further to discussion at the last Competitiveness Council, the presidency provided information regarding efforts by member states to improve their records on timely transposition of internal market legislation. The presidency provided information on conferences held during the Dutch presidency relating to competitiveness. The Council took note of a UK paper reminding the Commission of March 2004 Council Conclusions that invited the Commission to consider establishing a European Centres of Enterprise award scheme, with a view to the scheme's introduction during 2005. Commissioner Verheugen expressed support for taking the scheme forward.</p>
	<p pid=".586W.5/13">The first ever Space Council took place (a joint and concomitant meeting of the Council of the European Union and European Space Agency (ESA) at ministerial level). Ministers discussed the development of a European Space Policy and a set of orientations were agreed that set out the general approach and some next steps. These highlighted the strategic importance of space activities to a broad spectrum of European policies and stated that the European Space Programme (ESP) would provide a flexible, common and inclusive framework for EU, ESA and other stakeholders to operate within. UK supported the orientations and the development of a realistic and affordable ESP as a way of coordinating European space activities. Further meetings of the Space Council may take place during 2005.</p>

Since August 1997, the DTI has increasingly made use of the central Mobile Telecommunications contract managed by the Office of Government Commerce. This contract allows DTI users access to mobile telephone services and products at advantageous prices ensuring that the Department obtains good value for money. Due to the devolved responsibility for mobile telephone management the only information that can be provided at non-disproportionate cost is the total expenditure with DTI's main suppliers of mobile telephones and the number of handsets supplied through the central OGC contract since 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".591W.3/1">We expect the EU Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) to encourage generators to switch from using high carbon fuels (e.g. coal or oil) to lower or zero carbon fuels (e.g. gas or hydro). Such switching will have an effect on forward markets for the different fuels. The extent of this switching will be determined by the price of carbon, as well as the relative fuel prices and other costs associated with power generation from different types of plant. The price of carbon will be determined across the whole of the EU. The differences in behaviour of individual UK market participants are expected to have only a minimal impact on the price of carbon. The potential effect of differing assumptions about the ETS on the generation fuel mix was assessed in the study (Implications of the EU ETS for the Power Sector&mdash;Annex C), for DTI, by ILEX in September 2003: <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/euets.shtml">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/euets.shtml</a></p>

	<p pid=".595W.8/2">DTI is developing a Carbon Abatement Technology Strategy to address the future requirements for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from large-scale power generation in the UK using fossil fuels, including coal. The issue of retrofitting of cleaner-coal technology to UK power stations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions is being considered within this strategy which is due to be published in the new year.</p>
	<p pid=".595W.8/3">In addition, the EU emissions trading scheme comes into effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>. This scheme will encourage UK power stations to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions. The retrofitting of cleaner coal technologies is one of many options available to power station operators to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid=".595W.8/4">The actual carbon dioxide emissions reduction from retrofitting of more efficient cleaner coal technologies to UK power stations would depend on the specific design and operating conditions of the technology fitted and that which it was replacing. However, as an indication, savings in the range of 10&ndash;20 per cent. of carbon dioxide emissions should be possible with the retrofitting of such technologies to coal power stations.</p>

Radioactivity was released to the environment. The main public health concern was the contamination of locally produced milk by the short-lived isotope iodine 131.

	<p pid=".596W.2/3">The correspondence continued for some months, culminating in an exchange of letters between the Chairman of Rowntree and Sir Donald Perrott of UKAEA. Rowntree acknowledged &quot;we fully accept your advice that, as a matter of scientific fact, the 90 tons of crumb do not represent a radioactive hazard&quot;, but stated that in the interest of customer relations and commercial prudence, they wished to have the crumb destroyed or disposed of. They sought the UKAEA's help to do so, and offered to meet the costs incurred. UKAEA agreed &quot;to accept responsibility for destroying this material&quot; on Rowntree's behalf.</p>

	<p pid=".597W.3/1">As Minister for Energy and E Commerce, I represented the UK at the EU Energy Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.3/2">The Council considered several matters of interest to the United Kingdom. Chief among these were the Energy Services Directive and the Security of Electricity Supply Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.3/3">A general approach on the Security of Electricity Supply Directive was agreed, though the Commission, which seeks a more interventionist regulator-led approach to promote actively new interconnector build and thereby competition, maintained a reserve on Article 7 on interconnector construction.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.3/4">Council conclusions were agreed on the Commission's Communication on the share of Renewable Energy in the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.3/5">An orientation debate was held on the proposed Energy End Use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive. Member States expressed a strong preference for indicative not mandatory energy saving targets though views were mixed on whether a uniform target at EU level would be helpful; many delegations preferred.individually set targets. There was general recognition that the public sector could play a leading role in promoting energy efficiency but the majority of Member States opposed specific targets for the sector. On the question of the placing of obligations on suppliers there was a clear preference for a broader more flexible approach rather than a focus on one energy efficiency approach&mdash;energy services. There was broad agreement that a harmonised approach to measuring energy savings was needed, but there was a split on whether a top down or bottom up approach was best.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.3/6">The UK noted our support for a uniform, but indicative, six-year target taking account of already captured efficiency gains; a more broadly defined obligation on energy suppliers to actively offer and promote energy efficiency; and agreement with the Presidency proposal for either a top down or a hybrid approach to measuring efficiency gains.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.3/7">The Commission's preference for a mandatory target reflected what they saw as the poor record of achievement against indicative targets and they suggested that flexible mandatory targets might be the way forward. The Presidency concluded by proposing an annual debate on progress towards achieving indicative national targets, the first of which would fall to the UK Presidency, and looked forward to concluding the dossier in the Luxembourg Presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.3/8">The Commission reported progress on the negotiations of the Energy Community for South East Europe Treaty, which it hoped would be a model for other sectors. Signature was foreseen for 2005. Some Member States had substantive comments on the language regime, others on the distinction between participating and observing Member States. The next negotiation meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">13 December</phrase> will be an opportunity to discuss outstanding matters.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.3/9">The Commission reported on its communication on progress on the EU/Russia energy dialogue 2000&ndash;04, claiming it showed positive outcomes across a range of fields. More progress in Russia was needed on the reform process, energy efficiency and Kyoto implementation, promoting and protecting investment and positive developments in the gas and oil markets. The Commission undertook fully to involve Member States.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.3/10">The Presidency concluded by noting, in the context of the recent &quot;Energy in Motion&quot; conference aimed at improving cleaner road traffic, that transport accounted for a third of energy consumption. The conference conclusions would be discussed at the next Transport and Environment Councils and the Commission were urged to take account of them.</p>
	<p pid=".597W.3/11">Luxembourg finished by saying they would take forward the Dutch Presidency approaches and singled out Energy TENS as a priority dossier.</p>

	<p pid=".606W.9/1">In August 2004 the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) wrote to all Government Departments requesting assistance with funding to establish and maintain a Central Point of Expertise on Timber (CPET). At that time, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was unable to identify funds to support this Defra initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.9/2">However, following a further request from Defra, we are now reconsidering this decision, and will be writing to Defra shortly to clarify the situation. We support the objectives of the CPET, which will make a crucial contribution to UK efforts to procure legal and sustainable timber, as part of our wider policy addressing illegal logging.</p>

	<p pid=".611W.8/2">Trust management and professional staff have identified a number of significant benefits that should arise from the use of hand held technologies including; the ability to access high quality information where and when it is needed; more timely capture and sharing of information; and reduction in professionals' time spent travelling to their base to access or record data, leading to more time with patients/clients.</p>

The Southern Health and Social Services Board, in considering the provision of out-of-hours cover for the Kilkeel/Annalong area has sought to address access difficulty by investigating the provision of out-posted GP services, developing a nurse led minor injury unit in Kilkeel and making transport available to those without access to private transport.</p>
	<p pid=".613W.8/2">The board has advised that prior to <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-06">6 December 2004</phrase>, out-of-hours services in the Kilkeel/Annalong area, were provided by GPs who work in the area and residents did not have access to the out-of-hours centre which is situated in Newry. However, from <phrase class="date" code="">6 December</phrase> the population of Kilkeel/Annalong has access to the full range of services provided by the out-of-hours centre.</p>

Internationally accepted guidance from the World Health Organisation on the completion of death certificates requires only those conditions that contribute directly to death to be recorded. The recorded cause of death may be the underlying disease or injury with MRSA infection noted as a contributory factor.</p>
	<p pid=".616W.3/2">The General Register Office classifies the cause of death and contributory factors using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). ICD does not have a specific code for MRSA. The World Health Organisation recently recommended introducing codes for antibiotic resistance to the ICD from 2006. This should allow death caused by or contributed to by MRSA to be more easily identified.</p>

Upon being re-housed such applicants will be entitled to claim an intimidation grant of &pound;692 to enable them to resettle in their new home. In the first six months (April to September) of the current financial year 556 applications for re-housing were made due to intimidation and of these 207 were accepted. Figures for the last two financial years show a decrease in such claims. The Housing Executive has set a performance target to fully assess 95 per cent. of all homelessness applications, (including those from applicants claiming intimidation), within 33 days. In the year to date 97 per cent. of all homelessness applications have been fully assessed within the target. The Housing Executive treats seriously all requests for housing assistance from those claiming to have been intimidated from their homes and investigates these before accepting the request.</p>

During this period, EHS has taken enforcement action in relation to 14 of the pollution incidents which have affected the River Strule, ie, nine warning letters have been issued and five prosecutions have been taken under the Water (Northern Ireland) Order 1999. Fines imposed by the courts have ranged from &pound;300 to &pound;3,000.</p>

Over 4,000 fixed penalty notices were issued and over 9,500 alcoholic containers were confiscated with more than one-third of these being confiscated from children.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.6/4">Prior to the start of the AMEC, the Home Office published &quot;Violent Crime&mdash;Tackling Violent Crime in the Night-Time Economy&mdash;Guidelines and Tactical Options&quot;. The document set out a selection of successful initiatives that were readily transferable to police forces, Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) and local partners in helping to tackle alcohol-related violence and disorder.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.6/5">Following the campaign, a &quot;Lessons Learned&quot; document was published and launched at a joint Home Office and ACPO conference on <phrase class="date" code="">8 November</phrase>. The document is intended to assist those who are responsible for the continued drive to tackle alcohol misuse and its associated harms in relation to crime and disorder. A second campaign will take place over the Christmas period from <phrase class="date" code="">17 December</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-03">3 January 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.6/6">The Government and the police are building on existing good crime-cutting work and developing best practice in the local areas and CDRPs that still have a high volume of violent crime. This strategy will develop further the work begun by the Government and police over the summer to tackle alcohol-related disorder.</p>
	<p pid=".623W.6/7">In addition, the Government have introduced new fixed penalty notice offences for selling alcohol to a person under 18, the purchase of alcohol for a person under 18 on licensed premises, consumption of alcohol by a person under 18, and allowing delivery of alcohol to a person under 18. These offences came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase>. Local authorities have also introduced around 120 Designated Public Places Orders to help tackle anti-social drinking.</p>

Responsibility for this was considered to rest with the project license holder and with the personal licensees, who were also clinicians. In mitigation, the licensees' decisions were based upon clinical judgment, rather than undisputed or unambiguous facts and the Chief Inspector's view was that they did not indicate any fundamental disregard for the welfare of the animals. The infringement was dealt with by means of letters of admonishment to those responsible.</p>

	<p pid=".640W.3/1">The Police Standards Unit (PSU) plays an important role in driving the effective use of National Automated Fingerprint Identification System (NAFIS). The Home Office has invested approximately &pound;150 million in the system and the PSU has a team working within the police service to ensure the best use is made of this investment. This includes making recommendations on the working practices of fingerprint officers using, to those on setting force policy for LiveScan, which scans and transmits fingerprints directly to the system. The PSU is working with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) to implement these recommendations nationally.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.3/2">The unit also has an important NAFIS performance-monitoring role that is essential to drive usage and challenge those that are not making enough use of it. Since 2003, when the reporting commenced, there has been an increase in identifications from recently arrested persons of nearly 80 per cent. The PSU reports progress on usage of the system to Ministers quarterly.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.3/3">In addition, the PSU acts as a consultant to promote the use of NAFIS in individual forces and ensure that the efficiency benefits of the system are maximised.</p>
	<p pid=".640W.3/4">NAFIS became fully operational nationally in 2001. The system provides more than 4,000 fingerprint identifications a month and it makes a significant contribution to the number of detections.</p>

	<p pid=".641W.2/1">We have a comprehensive and robust package in place to tackle the misuse of fireworks. The Fireworks Regulations 2004 came into force in August and in October we extended the Penalty Notices for Disorder Scheme (PND) to include three new firework offences. Breach of the fireworks curfew is one of these new PND offences. The new PNDs allow police to punish offenders immediately by issuing on-the-spot fines and offer an additional disposal that has been widely welcomed by police forces across the country.</p>
	<p pid=".641W.2/2">I was keen to ensure all relevant agencies were aware of the new arrangements. In early October I wrote to all chief constables to provide guidance ahead of the fireworks season and to ensure the new arrangements were made an integral part of their fireworks strategies. We have published a TOGETHER fact sheet on the misuse of fireworks and this has been widely distributed to practitioners. DTI are also in regular contact with individual police forces and other enforcement agencies, such as Trading Standards, to provide advice on the Fireworks Regulations 2004. They expect to publish comprehensive guidance shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".643W.5/1">The various bodies concerned with delivering improved policing outcomes work together to ensure that consistent advice is provided to the police. The Police Leadership and Powers Unit (PLPU) works closely with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. Consistency with the National Centre for Policing Excellence (NCPE) is ensured by PLPU's role as the sponsor unit for CENTREX, the national police-training provider, of which the NCPE is a directorate.</p>
	<p pid=".643W.5/2">The 'Improving Performance through Applied Knowledge' (IPAK) programme of work, led by the Police Standards Unit, is aimed at improving the development and dissemination of good practice in the policing community. This includes working approaches to avoid overlaps or gaps between the work of stakeholder organisations, including the NCPE, HMIC, and PLPU. In the field of science and technology, a consistent approach is co-ordinated through the Police Science and Technology Strategy Group, which is chaired by the Director of Policing Policy in the Home Office. This group includes the director of the NCPE, the heads of the Science Policy and the Information Communications Units, and a senior representative from HMIC. The Group will also include an appropriate representative from the National Policing Improvement Agency when the detailed composition and scope of the Agency has been agreed.</p>
	<p pid=".643W.5/3">Finally, an important driver behind the Improvement Agency will be to rationalise the number of bodies that provide advice and assistance to the police service, thereby further ensuring consistency. The details of this are still being considered.</p>

	<p pid=".644W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-29">29 November 2004</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".644W.2/2">The efficiency target for the police service was set in the Spending Review 2004 taking account of the Efficiency Review carried out by Sir Peter Gershon. It takes into account the police service's very good record of achievement of average efficiency gains of 2.6 per cent. per year from 1999&ndash;2000 to 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.2/3">The Home Office, the Association of Police Authorities and the Association of Chief Police Officers have worked together to develop an efficiency strategy for the service. They are committed to work in partnership to deliver cumulative year-on-year improvements in the value for money obtained from expenditure on the police service in pursuit of the very challenging targets set in SR 04.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.2/4">An efficiency strategy implementation group is leading work to determine priorities for making efficiency gains, including in corporate service functions, such as human resource management and finance. A working group led by the Association of Police Authorities has already identified opportunities for substantial gains to be achieved through better procurement of goods and services.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.2/5">A key element of the strategy is to increase the proportion of time which police officers spend on front-line policing. In 2003&ndash;04 the average proportion of officer time spent on front-line duties for all forces was 63.6 per cent.; the range between forces was from 53.8 per cent. to 70.2 per cent. Increasing the average to around 72.5 per cent. would deliver nearly half of the efficiency target.</p>
	<p pid=".644W.2/6">Bureaucracy reduction, exploiting new technology, more effective deployment of officers and more effective use of support staff will all help to increase the amount of front-line policing. A recent report, commissioned by the Home Office from Accenture, indicates the potential to improve the efficiency with which officers are rostered for duty.</p>

	<p pid=".648W.8/1">Following the publication of the Stewart Report &quot;Mobile Phones and Health&quot; in May 2000, we took expert advice from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB)'s independent Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation (AGNIR) on the health and safety aspects of TETRA technology. The AGNIR experts suggested a number of areas where further research would be useful. These suggested have been taken forward as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".648W.8/2" class="indent">The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) is assessing the effects of TETRA on various types of cell. Dstl has concluded that TETRA has no effect on calcium exchanges in cells. Further work on epileptiform activity and cognitive performance is under way;</p>
	<p pid=".648W.8/3" class="indent">Imperial College is carrying out a long-term health monitoring study of police users of Airwave;</p>
	<p pid=".648W.8/4" class="indent">The Universities of Birmingham and Manchester are looking at patterns of use of Airwave among police users;</p>
	<p pid=".648W.8/5" class="indent">Microwave Consultants Ltd. (MCL) has been looking into Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) levels from TETRA equipment. MCL have found that SAR level from hand-held and hands-free equipment are within international safety limits. Work on SAR levels in vehicles is under way;</p>
	<p pid=".648W.8/6" class="indent">The NRPB has completed additional work on modelling SARs.</p>
	<p pid=".648W.8/7" class="indent">The Radiocommunications Agency (now part of Ofcom) checked emission levels from TETRA base stations.</p>
	<p pid=".648W.8/8">In addition we are funding research on TETRA as an adjunct to the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research (MTHR) programme. Studies funded under this arrangement are selected and managed by the MTHR Programme Management Committee. These studies include the Burden Neurological Institute's examination of possible effects of microwave radiation on the electrical activity of the brain and the University of Bradford's study of possible non-linear and demodulation mechanisms in biological tissue.</p>
	<p pid=".648W.8/9">These extensive studies have so far found no evidence of any particular risk to health from TETRA.</p>
