Modern conflict has seen UK Armed Forces deploying an increased number of senior officers in support of NATO and other coalitions far more than in the recent past; moreover, there has also been the requirement for senior officer support for host nations in a variety of advisory roles. Appropriate military representation is required at many levels to command operations, provide staff support in coalition headquarters, and effect coordination. Our operational commitments have demanded increased number of officers at the rank of colonel and above to deploy, and hence numbers have increased in these higher ranks.</p>

	<p pid="b.300W.10/1">We received reports of people fleeing from Burma to Thailand since January 2010 but the numbers are unconfirmed. Following news that Thailand was intending to force 3,000 refugees to return to Burma, our ambassador to Thailand raised this matter with the Thai authorities stressing the importance of adherence to international standards and to Thailand's international obligations. We understand that the Royal Thai Government decided not to deport the 30 families it had initially identified for removal. We continue to closely monitor the situation are coordinating closely with UN High Commission for Refugees, US and EU partners and will continue to raise the issue with Thai authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.307W.2/1">There are no regulatory provisions that prohibit local authorities collecting waste from household and business premises at the same time. However, we are aware that the Landfill Allowances Trading Scheme (LATS) has been cited as a barrier to the collection of waste from business premises by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.307W.2/2">The consultation 'Meeting EU Landfill Diversion Targets' published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-18">18 March</phrase> asks for views on the effectiveness of existing policies, including LATS. Responses from this consultation and further work by DEFRA will inform a second consultation later in the year on the most effective combination of policies to ensure that England meets its landfill diversion targets. We anticipate that the impact of LATS on council provision of waste services for businesses will be a consideration in this wider assessment of the policies needed to ensure England meets its landfill diversion targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.307W.2/3">Meanwhile, DEFRA is looking at ways to encourage greater recycling of waste from business premises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. In particular, we are funding the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to test a number of trade waste 'Bring Banks' and trade waste collection schemes to establish how some of the barriers to higher recycling can be most effectively overcome.</p>

Average marginal cost is based on a one-month sample of all Written parliamentary Questions answered by those departments with the highest volume of questions. Such samples are taken on a quinquennial basis. In years between quinquennial samples, the Treasury applies indexation to the DCT, but only increases it in &#163;50 steps to avoid the need for frequent small changes. HM Treasury has established the average cost of answering of a written PQ as &#163;154.00 and an oral question as &#163;425.00.</p>
	<p pid="b.323W.0/5" class="indent">7.28 Where officials are recommending that a question is not answered due to disproportionate cost, a note setting out the reasons, justifications and the full costs should be provided to the responsible Minister. The cost estimate should be based on a calculation of the cost of civil servants of the relevant grade working for the required length of time to assemble the information. Cabinet Office guidance for officials drafting answers to PQs refers to the fact that 'where information is being refused on the grounds of disproportionate cost, there should be a presumption that any of the requested information which is readily available should be provided.' A Minister may still decide to answer a question, even if providing the answer results in costs above the DCT, for example, on public interest grounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.323W.0/6" class="indent">7.29 It is practice in some departments to agree to provide a Member information initially refused (on disproportionate cost grounds) by paying the balance over the disproportionate cost threshold. However, this option may not be available if the relevant officials would not in practice be available to do the work.</p>
	<p pid="b.323W.0/7" class="indent">7.30 It should be noted that the 'disproportionate cost' answer is intended to be used where the information is held in an accessible form but is expensive to identify. It is not for cases where the information is not held at all (in the latter case the answer would say 'the information is not held' or similar).</p>
	<p pid="b.323W.0/8" class="indent">7.31 The suggested wording for a disproportionate cost answer is:</p>
	<p pid="b.323W.0/9" class="indent">&quot;The information is not readily available/held centrally and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.326W.2/3">We know from evaluation undertaken in 2006 that residential courses tend to exclude some customers, including those who have caring responsibilities.

	<p pid="b.326W.2/4">Currently coverage is uneven; there is no provision in Scotland, Wales and the North West of England. The new contracts offer an important opportunity to provide a better geographical coverage, which will be an important aim of the open competition.

We want to use this opportunity to increase the focus on employment, seeing more people helped into work, as well as obtaining better value for money.</p>

This is done through its Commissioning Strategy and by using open competition to procure any new provision. We recognise that the existing residential training providers funding may be affected by the open competition but, in the same way as other potential providers, they will be able to submit a bid to deliver the provision if they wish to do so. We have given current residential training providers over two years notice so that they can plan ahead.</p>

In line with the Government's principles for Better Regulation, inspections are performed with a frequency based upon a risk assessment of each designated establishment. The risks are regularly reviewed by the local inspector in the light of fresh information such that the frequency of inspections to each establishment may be altered at any time to match the perceived risk. Overall, it is not expected that this will result in a significant change in the total number of inspections carried out by an inspector over the course of a year.</p>

	<p pid="b.343W.2/2">The longest period for which a child has been detained by the UK Border Agency at an immigration removal centre in the last five years is 190 days. The child was detained at Yarl's Wood.</p>
	<p pid="b.343W.2/3">I should stress this particular case relates to a family held in 2005 and was in part due to several failed removal attempts following the family's disruptive behaviour at the point of removal. Since then the UK Border Agency has radicalised the way in which case working of families with children is managed. We now only ever detain families where they have refused to leave the UK voluntarily and their departure has to be enforced, all legal barriers have been concluded, they have a valid travel document and a flight has been booked in a few days. It is therefore our intention that children are only ever in detention for no more than a few days.</p>

	<p pid="b.347W.3/2"><i> </i>The UK Border Agency takes the health and emotional wellbeing of those in its care very seriously. This is particularly true of children who are regrettably detained-with their parents-pending their removal after they refuse to leave the UK voluntarily. We introduced a new duty in November 2009 contained in the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, which requires the agency to protect and promote the welfare of children. The Office of the Children's Champion, which includes professional advisers, is responsible for challenging the agency to ensure it meets its obligations, and they provide constant advice and support to those responsible for detention and escorting matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.3/3">Children can only be held in three immigration removal centres. Tinsley house currently holds families for 24 hours and Dungavel house for up to three days.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.3/4">Those families who will be held for longer periods are taken to Yarl's Wood, as are those families in Scotland whose flights are departing from London.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.3/5">Prior to detention, the agency conducts a formal assessment of each child to identify any particular medical; safeguarding or welfare needs in order to make the necessary arrangements to support them while in detention. On site independent social workers contribute to this initial assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.3/6">Once in detention the social workers continue to make regular weekly welfare checks on each individual child throughout the entire period of detention. In addition to these regular welfare checks, the independent social workers carry out a formal welfare needs assessment between 14-21 days of detention for any child whose detention extends beyond 28 days. A copy of the completed assessment is submitted to the head of Bedford Children's Services; thereby ensuring independent oversight is maintained for the welfare assessments of children held in detention.</p>

Our procedures, called Assessment Care in Detention and Teamwork (ACDT), provide an holistic approach to suicide and self harm prevention within the broader context of decency, safety, and the concept of a healthy centre. It also brings existing policy in line with similar changes implemented by the Ministry of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.347W.6/3">The ACDT process starts as soon as an individual has been identified as being at risk. It involves an initial risk assessment and assessment interview conducted by specially trained individuals. A specific care map tailored to the issues faced by the individual is produced to ensure provision of multi-disciplinary support, including input from both health care professionals and staff at the centre. The ACDT document is reviewed at regular intervals to ensure the correct support is provided while the individual is thought to be at risk.</p>

	<p pid="b.350W.8/1">Because the UK Border Agency's work is national and international in scope, it is necessary in some cases for staff to travel in order to facilitate that work. This is only undertaken when other forms of business interaction such as video or voice conferencing have been considered first. All travel is undertaken in accordance with the civil service management and ministerial codes and is approved in advance by a line manager. Over 90 per cent. of the work force of the UK Border Agency have no contractual entitlement to travel first class.</p>

	<p pid="b.350W.8/4">Entitlement is not an indication as to the actual numbers who travelled. Information provided by the company which supplied UKBA with travel services for the period shows that, of the individuals who would have been contractually entitled to travel first class in 2009, less than 40 per cent. made use of any first class travel in 2009. The agency encourages officials to incur the lowest practicable cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.350W.8/5">The UK Border Agency is focused on driving down the cost of travel expenditure. In addition the Home Office has a travel contract that enables significant savings to be achieved compared with the standard price of UK rail travel.</p>

These data have been taken from the Ministry of Justice Court Proceedings database. These data are presented on the principal offence basis.

Sentences at the Crown Court are categorised according to the police force that prosecuted the offence including those sentences that may be given at a court outside the prosecuting police force's area. The statistics are presented by criminal justice area. Police force areas correspond to criminal justice areas except for the Metropolitan and City of London Police, which are combined to form the London criminal justice area. Prosecutions brought by agencies other than the police are categorised according to the criminal justice area of the sentencing court.

Sentences given at courts using the Libra system are categorised according to the criminal justice area of the court while sentences given at courts not yet using the Libra system are categorised in the same way as at the Crown Court. By the end of 2006, all magistrates courts were using Libra. This change will have almost no impact on the categorisation by area; only around 0.01 per cent. of sentences at magistrates courts could have been affected in 2007 and 2008. Police forces do not prosecute minor offences (those that are sentenced at magistrates courts) in courts outside their areas.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Justice Statistics-Analytical Services.

	<p pid="b.361W.5/2">The Department has made no estimate of the number of children who regularly wear the kirpan on school premises; this information is not collected by schools. We have received representations concerning a case involving a Barnet school last year; it is for individual governing bodies to make their own policies on the carrying of the kirpan, taking account of pupil safety and religious practice. Because of concerns arising from this case, we are currently discussing issues around the wearing of the kirpan with other interested Government Departments, the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Sikh community, with a view to issuing guidance in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.367W.4/1">The Department has set a national standard that all patients should not wait more than four hours in accident and emergency (A and E) departments from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge. A 98 per cent, minimum operating figure allows for the minority of patients who clinically need more than four hours in A and E. Trusts are able to set a more challenging waiting time target should they wish to do so.</p>

The number of episodes where this diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once, even if the diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record. 3. Data provided are for Southend-on-Sea PCT of residence (the PCT containing the patient's normal home address). This identifies patients who resided within Southend-on-Sea and were in hospital with a primary and/or secondary diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. These patients may not have been treated in Southend-on-Sea. 4. From 1 October 2006, Southend-on-Sea PCT merged with Castle Point and Rochford PCT to create South East Essex PCT. 5. HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so are no longer included in admitted patient HES data. 6. To protect patient confidentiality, figures between one and five have been replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk). Where it was still possible to identify numbers from the total an additional number (the next smallest) has been replaced.  <i> Source:</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

Any one patient can have multiple attendances, which may be in the same or different time period, for the same or different condition. An attendance can be split into whether the attendance was either a new or a follow-up attendance, using the 'Attendance Category' data field.<br/> 2. A and E data quality<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by a number of NHS providers across England. The NHS Information centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seek to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. A and E HES data are available for the year 2007-08, which covers attendances reported between April 2007 and March 2008. The A and E HES data for 2007-08 are the first record level national A and E attendance data to be available within HES. The current coverage and quality of A and E data in HES is poor and for this reason the dataset has been labelled as 'experimental'. Allowing access to this data will also help stimulate discussion and encourage trusts to improve quality for subsequent releases. The 2007-08 A and E HES publication addresses some of the key data quality and coverage issues.

	<p pid="b.387W.2/1">The Department acknowledges that prisoners leaving prison with a diagnosed medical condition such as tuberculosis require ongoing care from primary and specialist care services in the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.2/2">This is a challenge given the often complex social and personal circumstances of prison-leavers. Issues around homelessness are a particular concern as it can lead to loss of contact with locality based care services. Recognising the need for cross-organisation working, the Department has committed itself to improving care pathways for offenders in prison and in the community in the cross government Health and Criminal Justice Delivery Plan &quot;Improving Health, Supporting Justice&quot; (November 2009, Department of Health). A copy has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.387W.2/3">In the interim, through-care and after-care programmes in prisons endeavour to ensure that ongoing care requirements are met and planning for discharge occurs so that prison-leavers are referred to services in their home community. Our partners recognise this challenge too and are actively engaged in working through the issues with us.</p>

	<p pid="b.388W.2/1">The Department has made no specific assessment of the effectiveness of the national health service in diagnosing tuberculosis. The Care Quality Commission, as part of its Annual Health Check of NHS organisations, monitors the implementation of National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines and assesses how the NHS implements delivery of services, including TB services. The organisation and running of local services are matters for local NHS management. Primary care trusts are responsible for procuring TB services to fit their local demography and incidence of TB in their area, and ensuring that those standards are monitored, met and reviewed as part of the commissioning process.</p>
	<p pid="b.388W.2/2">The Department published a toolkit in June 2007 for the NHS recommending that the NICE clinical guidelines (published 2006) on the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis should be followed by all NHS service providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.388W.2/3">The diagnosis of TB is made from a combination of context, symptoms, clinical signs and investigation. NICE recommends that clinical investigation for pulmonary TB (the only infectious form) comprise a chest X-ray, followed by multiple sputum samples for TB microscopy and culture. These represent the current 'gold standard' diagnostic tools, and NICE advises that if the clinical signs and symptoms are consistent with pulmonary TB then treatment should be started without waiting for further tests.</p>
	<p pid="b.388W.2/4">NICE identified areas for future research, one of which concerned Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) tests, to assess whether interferon-gamma tests are acceptable to patients and more effective than tuberculin skin tests for predicting subsequent development of active TB, or diagnosing or ruling out current active TB. Research proposals have been set in motion for these, but results of these studies are likely to be some years away.</p>

	<p pid="b.390W.9/1">The Planning Policy Statement: eco-towns (PPS), that we published last July, sets out the standards that eco-towns must achieve. The primary focus is to set targets for innovation across the development as a whole, rather than an individual building approach, but it does include minimum performance levels for individual dwellings, including that they should meet at least level 4 of the Code for Sustainable Homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.9/2">On energy efficiency and carbon, the PPS will require dwellings in eco-towns to demonstrate high levels of energy efficiency in the fabric of the building, having regard to proposals for standards to be incorporated into changes to the Building Regulations between now and 2016, and to meet at least 70 per cent. carbon reduction on site relative to Part L 2006 of the building regulations. This level of onsite carbon reduction is more demanding than Code level 4, is consistent with the zero carbon homes standard announced last year and will take effect significantly earlier than the general zero carbon homes requirement. In addition, over a year, the net carbon dioxide emissions from all energy use within the buildings on the eco-town development as a whole must be zero or below. This too is consistent with (and, depending on policy decisions to be made on allowable solutions for zero-carbon homes, may be more demanding than) the definition of Zero Carbon Homes which the Government have adopted for introduction in 2016.</p>
	<p pid="b.390W.9/3">The Eco-towns PPS includes a range of ambitious standards on other aspects of sustainability including high Code levels, for example in relation to water consumption, which taken together are the toughest standards ever required for new development. Copies of the PPS are available in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.405W.8/1">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills allocates funding to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) for the provision of further education (FE) and training for adult learners aged 19 and over. For 2008-09 financial year the total LSC adult participation budget was &#163;3.17 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.405W.8/2">Investing in FE and skills training for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities (LLDD) remains a priority and we remain committed to maintaining the opportunities for these learners. This means making sure the right level of support is available so that FE colleges and training organisations are able to meet the needs of these learners to access mainstream provision or employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.405W.8/3">There is no separate budget for the delivery of provision for adult learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities (LDD). They are supported through a range of provision depending on the level of skills and support they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.405W.8/4">Additional Learning Support (ALS) funding is provided to FE colleges and training organisations to support the additional costs associated with learners with LDD to undertake mainstream provision. It is not possible to disaggregate this information between those who have a learning difficulty or a disability. Investment in ALS for post-19 learners in each of the last three academic years for which information is available (2006/07 to 2008/09) is approximately &#163;160 million. This includes ALS claims recorded on the Individual Learner Record. However, the recording of claims below &#163;5,500 is not a mandatory requirement and some smaller ALS funding will therefore not be included within the figure referred to above.</p>

The Government declined this request on the grounds that we have extensively examined the economic case for UK wage subsidies and concluded that this is not a feasible, cost effective or sustainable option, nor would it guarantee that plants, like Teesside Cast Products would stay open in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="b.406W.5/5" class="indent">Export subsidies-Coras raised the issue for potential export subsidies in July 2009 to help bridge the gap between cost of producing slab at Teesside Cast Products and the price that could be achieved for the product on the world market.
