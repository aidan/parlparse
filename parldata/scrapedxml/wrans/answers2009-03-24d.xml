	<p pid="d.185W.13/1">The cost of the Tebbit Review was &pound;112,000. It is difficult to distinguish the costs of implementing the Tebbit Review from the costs of improved service delivery and organisational change, some of which was already under way before the Tebbit Review but to which the Review gave additional impetus. A preliminary analysis suggests that the additional direct costs of implementing the Tebbit recommendations, to the end of the current financial year, have been &pound;395,000, which have been met out of existing budgets from efficiency savings. This figure does not include the cost of service improvements since the Tebbit Review (for example, improvements to the parliamentary website and to internal communications).</p>

Facing up to and dealing with the human rights abuses committed by both sides during the conflict is the key to concluding the peace process and laying the foundations for a sustainable democracy based on the rule of law and respect for human rights.

	<p pid="d.191W.12/1">The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) of November 2006 paved the way for successful elections in April 2008 for a Constituent Assembly, the most inclusive and representative institution in Nepal's history. This has given Nepal the opportunity to write a constitution which will enshrine in law a democratic system which will guarantee respect for human rights. Unfortunately, the consensus among political parties which allowed the elections to take place is fracturing, and progress has been slow both on drafting the constitution and on addressing the commitments given in the CPA on issues such as land reform and the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p>
	<p pid="d.191W.12/2">We are particularly concerned at the lack of progress on the future of Maoist ex-combatants in the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The government has still not made any progress on the discharge of the almost 3,000 child soldiers identified by the UN Mission in Nepal (UNMIN), or the other ex-combatants disqualified by UNMIN. We and other international partners have voiced our concerns about this and about the recent recruitment campaigns by both the Nepal Army and the PLA in violation of the CPA. We acknowledge that integration of the two armies will be a difficult issue to resolve, but have told the government that a failure to make progress risks endangering the peace process and that we, UN agencies and other donors stand ready to assist.</p>

By setting out our position unambiguously on the status of Tibet it allows us to speak clearly on the subject of human rights there, without allowing others to claim that we are denying China sovereignty over a large part of its territory.</p>

The Security Policy Framework, the Data Handling Report and the National Information Assurance Strategy produced by the Cabinet Office provide a strategic framework for protecting information that Government handle and put in place a set of mandatory measures which Departments must adhere to.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/2">The Department for Transport has IT security policies to protect its IT systems to an appropriate level so as to maintain the availability, integrity and confidentiality of the information they contain. These policies are subject to internal audit processes to ensure they are being followed. The Department has specific policy to ensure that all sensitive information leaving the Department is protected, through the use of secure channels, specific handling instructions or by the use of appropriate encryption. The Department is currently reviewing its IT security policies, procedures and compliance mechanisms to ensure compliance with the security policies contained in the Government Security Policy Framework including those for information security and assurance. Depending upon the circumstances, a range of sanctions are available including disciplinary or administrative action, and in extreme or persistent cases, termination of employment/services and, if appropriate, criminal proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/3">It is not in the interest of the security of the Department, or that of the public, to disclose detailed information pertaining to its security hierarchy or electronic breaches of security of Department's IT systems. Disclosing such information would enable criminals and those who would attempt to cause disruptive threats to the Department to deduce how to conduct attacks and therefore potentially enhance their capability to carry out such attacks.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/4">Except in exceptional circumstances the Department does not comment on specific technical measures it employs to protect its networks. However, the Department follows CESG guidance on the use of the Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) communications security protocols in order to protect wireless networks carrying protectively marked (up to restricted/IL3) traffic. The configuration and operation standards for WPA2 are set out in CESG's Infosec Manual Y, Use of WPA2 Wireless Security in Government Systems. The Department is compliant with HMG 1A Standard No. 4&mdash;Communication, Security and Cryptography for the encryption of data.</p>
	<p pid="d.197W.5/5">Compliance arrangements comprise a system of self assessment, accreditation, assurance reporting, audit and review. Records held centrally show that in the last 12 months IT security policies have been broken by staff on 34 occasions and seven staff members have been sanctioned for such breaches.</p>

In relation to foundation systems this can include reusing materials. In addition, in April 2007 we introduced the Code for Sustainable Homes to encourage the development of more sustainable homes. To reach the minimum Code Standards, homes need to consider the environmental performance of all materials used in all elements of the building, which includes the foundations.</p>

	<p pid="d.211W.2/1">Regarding support that has been provided by my Department, Coventry was allocated &pound;125,000 in 2008-09 through its area based grant to support work on preventing violent extremism. It has been allocated &pound;150,000 and &pound;162,000 in 2009-10 and 2010-11 respectively to develop activities outlined in their recently developed prevent action plan.</p>
	<p pid="d.211W.2/2">I understand that a Prevent Working Group has been developed in Coventry, made up of senior representatives from the police, council, other public agencies, universities and colleges, that will meet for the first time in April. The group will continue to steer and develop understanding of the national preventing violent extremism agenda; local issues and good practice from elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="d.211W.2/3">Coventry has also recently developed a communications strategy to help mainstream messages to counter extremism and it is currently developing a programme of activities for young people from diverse communities, which explores issues of identity and challenging extremist ideology, and provides support to the most vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="d.211W.2/4">West Midlands authorities will be allocated just under &pound;5.5 million through area based grant between 2008-09 and 2010-11 to support activities to prevent violent extremism.</p>
	<p pid="d.211W.2/5">Examples of projects in the West Midlands that are helping to prevent violent extremism include work in Birmingham. The Capacity Building and Governance of Mosques programme aims to help build the capacity of Mosque Committees to improve leadership and ensure that women and young people participate in the development of the Mosque. In addition, the programme ensures that Mosques are in compliance with charity law and aware of the laws and regulations of the UK covering areas of Health and Safety, Child Protection and Criminal Record Bureau checks.</p>
	<p pid="d.211W.2/6">In addition since 2007, Communities and Local Government has funded over 70 projects to tackle violent extremism through the Preventing Violent Extremism Community Leadership Fund. Many of these projects have a national reach, however at least fifteen are working specifically in the West Midlands region. One of these projects has undertaken some focus groups with Muslim women in Coventry to discuss access to mosques for women. Further information on the Community Leadership Fund can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="d.229W.5/1">A number of measures are in hand which should improve the accuracy of this data.</p>
	<p pid="d.229W.5/2">One of the aims of Public Service Agreement 19: &quot;Ensure Better Care for All&quot; (2007) is to:</p>
	<p pid="d.229W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;increase the percentage of women who have seen a midwife or a maternity health care professional for a health and social care assessment of needs, risks and choices by 12 weeks of completed pregnancy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.229W.5/4">This assessment will include a dating scan that will be used to calculate the gestational age of the foetus during pregnancy and at birth. As more women benefit from these assessments the accuracy of recorded information on gestational age should improve and together with this the plausibility of weight for age data.</p>
	<p pid="d.229W.5/5">A maternity data quality dashboard was published by the NHS Information Centre for health and social care (IC) in February 2009 for use by national health service trusts and commissioners, enabling them better to monitor progress using the data they have submitted. The dashboard specifically identifies gestation length and birth weight as data fields. Increased local scrutiny of this data should also encourage improvements in data quality.</p>
	<p pid="d.229W.5/6">In addition, the NHS IC is taking steps to improve the accuracy of maternity data in hospital episode statistics (HES). This should have a positive effect on other information in this area such as that used by the Office for National Statistics to link to registration data.</p>
	<p pid="d.229W.5/7">The IC now contacts NHS trusts directly when they submit data for HES which contains a high proportion of blank or unknown values in key maternity fields. The IC encourages trusts to investigate why these fields are not being populated and to resubmit data with correct values. The IC has also begun introducing improvements to the annual NHS Maternity Services publication, which includes data on gestational age and birth weight, while ensuring that data problems are transparent so that there is an incentive to improve data quality.</p>

This lending facility will be run by the Treasury. All projects in procurement, meaning the 110 PFI schemes which have issued a notice to go out to tender in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) but have not yet reached financial close, will be eligible for this finance from the Government. The &pound;475 million North Bristol NHS trust Southmead hospital redevelopment is one of these schemes.</p>
	<p pid="d.232W.2/2">The North Bristol scheme is not at the stage where the private sector counterpart needs to raise finance.

	<p pid="d.232W.2/3">Funding for this lending facility will be provided from across Government, including initially from unallocated funds and Departmental under spends on previous projects. The Treasury Budget Report published in April this year will contain information on the year end position for the 2008-09 Department capital budget. The Department's capital plans for 2009-10 and 2010-11 are still being finalised</p>

Data quality: hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 5. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> 6. Ungrossed data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Hospital episode statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.241W.5/1">There are no dedicated national health service psychiatric beds within the prison service. However, as part of the Government's commitment to improving the mental health of high risk offenders with personality disorder, the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) currently provides 168 beds which provide specialist psychological interventions in three prison pilot sites.</p>
	<p pid="d.241W.5/2">The responsibility for prison mental health care transferred fully to primary care trusts (PCTs) in 2006. All prison mental health services are now mainstreamed within the NHS, where the Offender Assessment System reception-screening tool can assess quickly all prisoners with health concerns, including mental illness, and, where appropriate, refer them to mental health inreach teams.</p>
	<p pid="d.241W.5/3">NHS prison mental health services are provided through 102 inreach teams, to which all prisons have access. Not everyone with a severe mental illness needs care in a psychiatric bed, even in an emergency. Most mental health treatment and care is delivered in prison primary care settings, as is other NHS treatment (e.g. for prisoners with diabetes or heart disease) unless urgent treatment is needed, when prisoners can be transferred to the NHS outside of the prison service.</p>
	<p pid="d.241W.5/4">A person whose mental illness is too severe to justify their remaining in prison is transferred to NHS secure services. In 2007, 934 prisoners with severe mental illness were transferred to hospital, compared to 723 in 2002, an increase of 29 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.241W.5/5">The Government asked Lord Bradley in December 2007 to carry out a review into diversion away from prison of offenders with mental health or learning disability problems. We expect to publish Lord Bradley's report by the end of April 2009, and to issue the Government's response at the same time. The Department, Ministry of Justice and Home Office will publish &quot;Improving Health, Supporting Justice&quot; an offender health strategy later this year, which will take account of the recommendations that Lord Bradley will make.</p>

	<p pid="d.243W.0/1">No. The Healthcare Commission is an independent regulator. In view of their thorough investigation and report, together with the resulting recommendations, we do not consider it necessary to hold a public inquiry into events at the Mid Staffordshire National Health Service Foundation Trust. We are satisfied that the Healthcare Commission's report covered all the key issues and is the result of a robust investigation.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.0/2">Professor Sir George Alberti, one of the country's most respected experts in emergency care, has been asked to independently review the Trust's procedures for emergency admissions and treatment and its progress against the recommendations in the report. In addition, Dr. David Colin-Thom&eacute;, National Director for Primary Care, will in parallel review the circumstances that occurred at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust prior to the Healthcare Commission's investigation in order to learn lessons nationally about how the commissioning system failed to expose and prevent the failings which have been identified.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.0/3">Both of these reviews are not intended to duplicate the work already undertaken by the Healthcare Commission and the findings are expected to be published following the Easter recess. The letters to both Professor Alberti and Dr Colin-Thom&eacute; have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.0/4">The National Quality Board has also been asked to look at the alignment of the national systems and processes in place for detecting and responding to potential serious failings in patient care in light of the Healthcare Commission's report. The detailed terms of reference are in development and will be finalised shortly when they will be made public. This work is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="d.243W.0/5">The new leadership team at the Trust is also committed to carrying out an independent review of the case notes where this is requested by relatives of patients in order to determine if the care provided was appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="d.245W.0/1">We are informed by the chairman of Monitor (the statutory name of which is the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts) that as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-20">20 March 2009</phrase> there are 20 applicants for NHS foundation trust (NHS FT) status in Monitor's assessment process.

	<p pid="d.245W.0/3">A detailed description of the assessment process for NHS FT applicants is set out in the document &quot;Applying for NHS Foundation Trust Status&mdash;Guide for Applicants&quot; (Monitor and the Department of Health, November 2008).

	<p pid="d.245W.0/9">Monitor's intensive assessment process takes approximately three months. Trusts must submit a wide range of information as evidence to support each category. Monitor reviews all the evidence submitted triangulating with key trust stakeholders including primary care trusts, strategic health authorities, and the Healthcare Commission and probes the boards of each applicant trust to examine their capability to operate autonomously by questioning different aspects of their application, examples of which include:</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.0/10" class="indent">Does the board have arrangements in place for monitoring and continually improving the quality of health care provided to its patients?</p>
	<p pid="d.245W.0/11" class="indent">How is the board assured that it has action plans in place to meet existing targets and national core standards?</p>

	<p pid="d.248W.2/1">Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for funding, developing and delivering end of life care services locally and it is for them to decide on the adequacy of the resources they allocate.</p>
	<p pid="d.248W.2/2">To support the End of Life Care Strategy, published in July 2008, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library, a survey was conducted of PCT expenditure on specialist palliative care, including hospices. This showed the level of local resources used in these services and provides a helpful benchmark for PCTs. However, the resources used for 'generalist' palliative care, that is, care which could be provided by any health or social care practitioner, are impossible to determine.</p>
	<p pid="d.248W.2/3">Work to develop the strategy showed that money spent in end of life care is not always as well used as it might be. A key aim of the strategy is, therefore, to ensure better use of existing resources. In addition, the Government are investing an extra &pound;286 million in end of life care services over the two years 2009-10 and 2010-11. This will help support those areas, such as training and the development of community services, that need special attention.</p>

Eligible customers are those in receipt of pension credit or income-related employment and support allowance that includes a work-related activity or support component. Those in receipt of income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance or income-related employment and support allowance in the assessment phase are also eligible if they have a pensioner or disability premium included in their benefit or they have a child who is disabled or under the age of five in the family.

	<p pid="d.260W.5/1">While there is no specific sentencing policy in relation to domestic violence offences, the Government aim to ensure that legislation provides an appropriate range of offences, and make available the right level and type of sentencing options, so that the Public Prosecution Service and the courts can respond effectively to violent crimes including those arising out of a domestic violence incident. In the case of domestic violence, these include penalties for breaches of civil orders.</p>
	<p pid="d.260W.5/2">The legislation is kept under review: for example, the Criminal Justice (NI) Order 2008 was the result of a fundamental review of sentencing law and made available new public protection sentences for dangerous violent and sexual offenders.</p>
	<p pid="d.260W.5/3">Once legislation is in place, sentencing in an individual case is of course a matter for the judge, taking into account the specific circumstances of the particular case. The Northern Ireland Court of Appeal delivers guideline judgments on sentencing in Northern Ireland which encourage consistency in sentencing throughout the courts of Northern Ireland and support sentencers in their decision-making.</p>
	<p pid="d.260W.5/4">The courts have found that domestic violence cases should be regarded as particularly serious because of the vulnerability of victims to the infliction of violence. The Court of Appeal has also commented that guidance from the Sentencing Guidelines Council in England and Wales may be applied in this jurisdiction where it is appropriate to local conditions. The Council issued guidance entitled &quot;Overarching Principles: Domestic Violence&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-18">18 December 2006</phrase> and this sets out the principles to be applied in passing sentence for these types of offence.</p>

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Guidelines on Security System Reform and Governance, agreed by OECD Ministers in 2004, define the security system as including: core security actors, security management and oversight bodies, justice and law enforcement and non-statutory security.</p>

Security sector reform helps create a secure environment conducive to other political, economic and social developments, through the reduction of armed violence and crime.

Making people's lives safer, ending wars, and preventing new wars from starting or re-starting requires a joint effort. To achieve these objectives we work closely with other parts of the UK Government including the FCO and MOD. For example, in Sierra Leone, major DFID, FCO, and MOD investments have built the capacity of the armed forces, police and other bodies to deliver security on the ground.

On this basis, it was estimated that it would cost &pound;90 million to deliver the Prime Minister's pledge to provide 20 million additional bed nets for Africa during the period 2008-11. This estimate is close to the &pound;5 total costs per bed net quoted during the recent Comic Relief appeal. However, costs vary depending on the delivery agent and the quantities being ordered: for example, UNICEF, which buys a very large number of bed nets globally, can command very favourable prices.</p>
	<p pid="d.264W.11/2">It will not be possible to calculate the costs in every African country concerned until all of the various programmes through which bed nets are being supplied have been fully costed and approved. However, an example where figures are available is Nigeria, where we are funding the supply of 2.5 million bed nets through the Malaria Consortium. In this case, each bed net costs US$4.46 to buy and ship, with distribution and associated costs of US$1.40 per unit, totalling US$5.86 (about &pound;4 at current exchange rates).</p>

	<p pid="d.265W.5/1">Data on the levels of demand for bed nets are not available by country. The World Malaria Report, issued by the World Health Organisation in September 2008&mdash;which is available at:</p>
	<p pid="d.265W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.who.int/malaria/wmr2008/malaria2008.pdf">http://www.who.int/malaria/wmr2008/malaria2008.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="d.265W.5/3">includes detailed data on the levels of bed net ownership and use worldwide. Demand for bed nets is very dependent on the level of knowledge about malaria that prevails in a community, often something that can be encouraged through health education programmes. People in malarial areas need to be informed about the benefits of using bed nets before increased demand develops.</p>
	<p pid="d.265W.5/4">There is a huge need for bed nets across Africa. In 2006, an average of 27 per cent. of African households owned an insecticide treated bed net, but only 17 per cent. of children slept under one. Where malaria is endemic, it is important for all children to sleep under a net. There is wide variation among countries however; around 49 per cent. of children sleep under a net in Gambia whereas in Kenya coverage has, with our help, increased from 7 per cent. in 2004 to 67 per cent. of children in 2006. It is intended that our various programmes that supply bed nets, and similar programmes by national governments and by other donors and NGOs, will considerably increase the availability and usage of bed nets with the aim of making a positive impact on the incidence of malaria in Africa over the next few years.</p>

	<p pid="d.279W.2/1">As the December 2006 White Paper, &quot;The Future of the UK's Nuclear Deterrent&quot; (Cm 6994), made clear, our current estimate is that the total procurement costs of the new submarines and associated equipment and infrastructure will be in the region of &pound;15 to 20 billion (at 2006-07 prices) for a four-boat fleet, mainly spread over the period 2012-27. The Main Gate decision is expected to be taken in 2014.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.2/2">Spending plans for the years immediately following this decision will need be to be set as part of the Government's Spending Review process and as part of the Main Gate approval. It is not therefore possible to be sure what the size of the defence budget will be over the timescales involved, but procurement costs are likely on average to be the equivalent of around three per cent. annually of the current defence budget over the main period of expenditure. This is around the same as for the Trident programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.279W.2/3">Once the new fleet of submarines comes into service, annual in-service capital and running costs of the deterrent, which includes the costs of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, are expected to be similar to today (around five to six per cent. of the annual defence budget.</p>

	<p pid="d.284W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.284W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated March 2009:</p>
	<p pid="d.284W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Questions asking how many people have been made redundant in (a) Hemel Hempstead and (b) Hertfordshire in the last six months; how many people under the age of 21 years were identified as unemployed in (a) Hemel Hempstead and (b) Hertfordshire in each of the last five years; how many people identifying themselves as disabled have been employed in (a) Hemel Hempstead and (b) Hertfordshire in each year since 1997; how many people identified as unemployed in (a) Hemel Hempstead and (b) Hertfordshire had been out of work for 12 months or more in each of the last five months. (265801, 265806, 265818 &amp; 265804)</p>
	<p pid="d.284W.2/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles labour market statistics for local areas from the Annual Population Survey (APS) and its predecessor the annual Labour Force Survey (LFS) following International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions. Estimates of the number of people in employment identifying themselves as disabled have been compiled from this source. However, this source does not support analysis of redundancies at these geographic levels and no alternate source is available. It is also not possible to analyse unemployment by small age groups, or for specific durations, for small geographic areas from this source. As an alternative to that, analyses of the count of claimants of Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) for the areas requested has been provided.</p>
	<p pid="d.284W.2/5" class="indent">Table 1 shows the number of persons claiming JSA who are under the age of 19 and resident in the Hemel Hempstead constituency or Hertfordshire. Statistics of the count of claimants of persons claiming JSA are not available for persons under the age of 21.</p>
	<p pid="d.284W.2/6" class="indent">Table 2 shows the number of persons of all ages claiming JSA for more than 12 months, who are resident in Hemel Hempstead or Hertfordshire.</p>
	<p pid="d.284W.2/7" class="indent">Table 3 show the number of persons resident in Hertfordshire, who identified themselves as having a limiting health problem lasting more than 12 months, and were employed. Figures have been provided for periods up to June 2008, the latest period for which figures are available. Estimates for Hemel Hempstead have not been supplied as they are statistically unreliable.</p>
	<p pid="d.284W.2/8" class="indent">As even the estimates quoted are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty. A guide to the quality of the estimates is given in Table3.</p>
	<p pid="d.284W.2/9" class="indent">National and local area estimates for many labour market statistics, including employment, unemployment and the claimant count are available on the NOMIS website at</p>

There is no compulsion for member states to be involved in individual European e-Justice projects and the decision about whether or not we will fund participation in particular projects will be made by the appropriate budget holding Department on a case by case basis.</p>

	<p pid="d.316W.8/1">NOMS reviewed its forward spending plans for the period to 2010-11 as part of a prudent efficiency programme. As a result, it was possible to reduce planned future spending in certain areas, freeing resources for other essential front line work with offenders.</p>
	<p pid="d.316W.8/2">Specifically, wider economic changes allowed lower assumptions for funding non-recoverable VAT and inflation increases. In addition:</p>
	<p pid="d.316W.8/3" class="indent">Probation Services are working to accommodate volume growth within available budgets for the SR period. The overall reduction in probation budgets next year is 2.2 per cent. which has to be seen in the context of sustained investment in probation &mdash; budgets have increased by almost 70 per cent. in real terms since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="d.316W.8/4" class="indent">Non-essential maintenance work in prisons was deferred.</p>
	<p pid="d.316W.8/5" class="indent">Plans to refurbish some mothballed cells were cancelled because current and ongoing investment in the prison estate is bringing supply and demand better into balance, delivering more fit-for-purpose accommodation and represents a much better value-for-money approach. The capacity programme is on target to increase total prison capacity to 96,000 places by 2014.</p>

This will change with the introduction of P&mdash;NOMIS IT system which contains specific data entry field for ex-service offenders and trials are underway.

All new prisons constructed after the introduction of the DDA have been commissioned to be DDA compliant. However, we are aware that a number of prisons, being of Victorian or older design, offer some difficulties to prisoners with severe mobility issues. The policy is that prisoners with such difficulties should not be allocated to prisons which cannot provide the appropriate reasonable adjustments.</p>
	<p pid="d.322W.3/2">There is a process called the access survey which assesses what difficulties might be encountered with physical access to buildings and the work that is needed to address these difficulties. However, this information is used practically to inform local improvement work and is not collated centrally. It does not constitute an assessment of compliance with the DDA.</p>

	<p pid="d.324W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.324W.8/2">The Youth Crime Action Plan (YCAP), published in July 2008, set out the Government's plans for tackling offending by young people. It detailed our plans for a 'triple track' approach of tough enforcement, non-negotiable help and support, and early intervention and prevention. It also states our ambition to reduce the rate of young people entering the criminal justice system by one fifth by 2020. This is supported by close to &pound;100 million over the next three years, in addition to the existing investment in children's and youth services, to support local authorities in making inroads into youth crime locally.</p>
	<p pid="d.324W.8/3">In 2008-09, under YCAP, 69 local authorities each received &pound;65,000 to implement a selection of measures set out in the YCAP. These were: Operation Staysafe; Street Based teams; After-Schools patrols; YOT Workers in Custody Suites; Reparation in Leisure Time; YCAP Family Intervention Projects and; Think Family.</p>
	<p pid="d.324W.8/4">As further support, in the current year, funding amounting to &pound;6.5 million has been targeted in 15 local authority areas of high gun, knife, gang and violent crime to help prevent young people becoming engaged in this sort of activity and to prevent poor outcomes in general.</p>
	<p pid="d.324W.8/5">In addition, the Youth Justice Board are investing &pound;32 million this year to deliver targeted prevention programmes such as youth inclusion programmes (YIPs), youth inclusion and support panels (YISPs) and parenting programmes.</p>
	<p pid="d.324W.8/6">All of these programmes build on the significant investment committed to other wider prevention programmes which make a contribution to preventing young people's involvement in criminal activity in deprived areas. Key examples of this are the work done to help young people take part in structured positive activities and to improve facilities in deprived areas through the Positive Activities for Young People and Myplace programmes and additional parenting support such as the Parenting Early Intervention programme, family intervention projects and expert parenting practitioners.</p>

	<p pid="d.332W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.332W.6/2">Some support groups for people with certain light sensitive skin, autoimmune and neurological conditions have raised concerns that some low energy light bulbs, particularly compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), could aggravate light sensitivity symptoms.</p>
	<p pid="d.332W.6/3">The Health Protection Agency (HPA) advises the Department on scientific matters concerning optical radiation including low energy light bulbs. The HPA tested a sample of CFL light bulbs and found that some emitted ultraviolet radiation which could, under certain conditions, expose people above international guidelines. As a result of its findings the HPA issued precautionary advice on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-09">9 October 2008</phrase> to the general public concerning the use of open CFLs in close-working situations. The HPA's advice can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="d.332W.6/5">The HPA's research was considered alongside other available evidence to inform a report by the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR). SCENIHR's Opinion on light sensitivity can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="d.332W.6/7">Nowadays CFLs each contain up to around four milligrams of mercury. The HPA advise that the mercury cannot escape from an intact lamp and, even if the lamp should be broken, the very small amount of mercury contained in a single, modern CFL is most unlikely to cause any harm. The HPA's advice on disposal of CFLs can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="d.332W.9/1">We are working closely with Indonesia and Brazil to include forestry in a future climate change agreement and were pleased with their association with the Poznan Forestry Statement that pledged early action on reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation. More specifically:</p>
	<p pid="d.332W.9/2"><i> (a)</i> A new Memorandum of Understanding was signed with Indonesia in late 2008 for co-operation on Climate Change and the Environment, renewing earlier commitments to work together to address deforestation. The first Working Group meeting is expected to take place in London in early summer. The UK has long supported action to improve forest governance through the work of the Department for International Development's Multi-stakeholder Forestry Programme and work to address demand side measures. The UK is working within the EU to negotiate an Indonesia-EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Partnership Agreement.</p>
	<p pid="d.332W.9/3">The UK is also providing expertise to help the Government of Indonesia prepare for the UN climate negotiations in Copenhagen in December. The support includes the appointment of a specialist assigned to the British embassy to assist with climate change work, including Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD).</p>
	<p pid="d.332W.9/4"><i> (b)</i> Co-operation with Brazil on forestry issues takes place through the Working Group on Climate Change and the High Level Dialogue on Sustainable Development through which we are supporting a number of projects. The next Working Group meetings are expected to take place in Brazil in mid-March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.332W.9/5">Of particular note is scientific co-operation on the development of joint UK-Brazil satellite monitoring, beginning with the announcement of the Amazonia-I satellite and camera to be launched in 2011. DEFRA has funded a workshop in Brazil for UK and Brazilian satellite monitoring experts to further develop this co-operation. DEFRA is also supporting the development of state level plans to combat deforestation in the Amazon, working closely with the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment.</p>
	<p pid="d.332W.9/6">Last year Brazil also launched a new fund aimed at supporting sustainable development of the forest called the Amazon Fund. The Department for International Development is providing support to the Brazilian National Development Bank (BNDES) on the management of this fund.</p>

	<p pid="d.340W.3/1">The Government remain committed to widening participation in higher education and to securing fair access for gifted and talented students. It is an economic as well as a social imperative that everyone who can benefit from higher education has the opportunity to do so. Widening participation is about spotting and nurturing talent, with schools, colleges and universities working together to ensure that all those with the potential and merit to benefit from higher education are able to do so.</p>
	<p pid="d.340W.3/2">The gifted and talented flag was not introduced into the National Pupil Database until 2006 and we do not yet have data on HE destinations that can be linked to this flag.</p>
	<p pid="d.340W.3/3">The National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth (NAGTY) catered for the national top 5 per cent. of 11 to 19-year-olds from 2002 to 2007. It has now been replaced by the Young Gifted and Talented (YG and T) Learner Academy.</p>
	<p pid="d.340W.3/4">NAGTY's 2006 Student Exit Survey Questionnaire showed that, of those completing the questionnaire:</p>
	<p pid="d.340W.3/5" class="indent">87 per cent. said they went straight on to continue their education at university</p>
	<p pid="d.340W.3/6" class="indent">8 per cent. were taking a gap year before going into higher education.</p>

It is expected that the bulk of these funds will be committed to projects by the end of financial year 2009/10.

Institutions are not always able to record the precise reason for leaving. Furthermore, HESA allows only one reason for withdrawal to be recorded, however it is likely that many students leave for a combination of reasons.</p>

Specifically, the interest rate for an academic year is the annual movement in the RPI for the year to the previous March. Therefore, the interest rate of 3.8 per cent. for the 2008/09 academic year reflects movements in the RPI for the year to March 2008.</p>

However, once set each September, the rate of interest must not exceed 1 per cent. above the highest of the base rates of a specified number of banks (the 'low' interest cap). The low interest cap was triggered in December 2008 when the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England reduced the bank base rate 'in year' to 2 per cent. and further reduced it in January, February and March of 2009.</p>

	<p pid="d.346W.9/2">This Department is always willing to meet business organisations to discuss the implications of Government policy on the businesses they represent, but does not keep comprehensive records of all such meetings. The British Brands Group and the Anti-Counterfeiting Group have met officials a number times over the last five years to discuss a range of issues affecting their members, including implementation of the unfair commercial practices directive, amendments to Part 9 of the Enterprise Act 2002 and the Competition Commission's report on groceries. The British Brands Group also had a meeting with a Special Adviser. I recently took part in the launch of the British Branch exhibition in the Upper Waiting Hall of the House of Commons.</p>

	<p pid="d.353W.5/1">In September 2008 the Government launched the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS) as part of its commitment to implement the recommendations of the Byron review. The Council consists of over 100 organisations from across industry, government, law enforcement and the third sector. An Executive Board to the Council has been appointed which has agreed the immediate priority activities and established a number of working groups to draw together expertise and assist in the implementation of the report.</p>
	<p pid="d.353W.5/2">The Council will publish the first ever Child Internet Safety Strategy later this year to provide an overview of how the Byron recommendations will be met. Significant progress has already been made on a number of specific recommendations including the publication of new advice to parents and teachers, commissioning research to develop the evidence base for policy making and providing support for initiatives to reduce cyber-bullying and promote European Safer Internet Day.</p>

Boards should be chaired in a way that most effectively meets the needs of children and young people. That is a matter for local determination. Proposals to strengthen children's trust boards in the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill&mdash;which is currently before Parliament&mdash;will be supported by guidance which will cover the process for appointing the chair and the chair's role on the board.</p>
	<p pid="d.356W.8/2">Current information suggests that about 80 per cent. of children's trust boards are chaired either by the lead member for Children's Services or the director of Children's Services.</p>
