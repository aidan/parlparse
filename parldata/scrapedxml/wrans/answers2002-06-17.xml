	<p pid=".2W.9/2">The Sex Discrimination Act (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999 amended the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 in the fields of employment and vocational training to give protection against discrimination to people intending to undergo, undergoing, or who have undergone gender reassignment. The regulations help individuals who undergo reassignment to either sex. The Equal Opportunities Commission's powers were extended by the regulations so it can help people experiencing discrimination on these grounds. The commission is taking this forward effectively, and about two thirds of the requests it receives relate to employment or vocational training. A few individuals have taken cases to employment tribunals under the normal process for sex discrimination claims.</p>

	<p pid=".13W.2/1">None, specifically in connection with garrison towns. Within the data collected by the Department annually from schools, the proportion of pupils known to be eligible for free school meals is an established indicator of socio-economic disadvantage. It has been used by the Department as one measure for grouping schools to allow comparisons of the performance of similar schools in the autumn package of pupil performance. This package is provided to assist them in the process of target setting and school improvement.</p>
	<p pid=".13W.2/2">The Department is now engaged in a programme of establishing measures of pupil progress from one Key Stage to the next, and it is proposed that this year's secondary schools performance tables will contain two indicators of 'value added' based on such information.</p>

	<p pid=".18W.0/1">The information requested is not available. Government funding of higher education institutions in England through the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) takes account of the cost to universities and colleges of administering tuition fees. The forecast income that institutions receive from student contributions to fees is abated by 5 per cent. for collection of fees and any default. For 2001&ndash;02, that amounts to an estimated &pound;18.2 million. The latest survey of the non-payment of fee contributions, published by Universities UK in November 2001, found that the amount unpaid at July 2001 across the UK was well within the 5 per cent. set aside for administration and default.</p>

My officials have been working with the Authority's officers as the Authority has developed its Post-Inspection Action Plan. The inspection report was critical of the delay in the Authority's development of an inclusive approach to meeting special educational needs [and noted that the process of special school re-organisation had been slow]. It recommended that the Authority should produce a strategy for special educational needs (SEN), which has a swifter timetable for implementation, shows how it will raise standards for pupils and incorporates the Authority's different reviews in a coherent plan.</p>
	<p pid=".20W.2/3">The report also recommended that the Authority should work with health authorities and the counties social services department, to reduce the number of cases where exceptional needs prevent the completion of SEN statements within 18 weeks.</p>

DTI has undertaken considerable work to support constructive procurement principles. However this issue will only be fully resolved when the whole construction industry changes by providing quality, defect-free work that fully meets the needs of contractors and clients.</p>

Since the Fax Preference Service was put on a statutory basis in 1999, total registrations have risen from under 15,000 to over 1,000,000; the FPS currently receives about 1,500 complaints a week about faxes, compared to some 700 a week at the end of last year.

	<p pid=".24W.5/18">Latest available figures are for 2000. The numbers of used tyres disposed of each year and their weight is estimated based on data supplied by tyre manufacturers and importers on replacement tyre sales, statistics from Customs and Excise on import and export trade in used tyre casings and information from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders on the numbers of end-of-life vehicles.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.5/19">The method of compiling the statistics was refined in 1998 to improve their accuracy. Accordingly, figures from 1998 forward are not directly comparable with earlier years.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.5/20">The numbers of tyres landfilled over the period 1996&ndash;99 remained consistent at around 30 per cent. of all tyres disposed of. With the closure of the single largest facility for handling used tyres in 2000, around 37 per cent. of tyres were landfilled that year.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.5/21">It is difficult to gather accurate information on the illegal disposal of tyres, with incidences widely dispersed geographically and affecting a variety of local authorities, businesses and individuals. Research undertaken by the Environment Agency indicates that most local authorities experience low levels of fly-tipping, but the cumulative effect can lead to significant total numbers. The Agency has estimated that tyre fly-tipping is collectively costing local authorities around &pound;2 million per annum. There is also substantial local fly-tipping of tyres on agricultural land. Not all tyre fly-tipping is immediately obvious, with significant numbers of tyre retailers experiencing fly-tipping on their forecourts overnight, and subsequently picking up the costs for ensuring responsible disposal and recovery.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.5/22">There are occasional large-scale deposits, which in extreme cases can amount to several tens of thousands of tyres. There are generally only one or two incidents of this magnitude each year. A recent survey by the Environment Agency estimated that there are around 21 million tyres in long-term storage. Not all of these will have been illegally deposited.</p>

However, some elements of the Rural Business Recovery Fund were used to assist businesses with interest relief on existing loans. The Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme (operated by high street banks) was extended to bring in scope businesses affected by foot and mouth disease.

	<p pid=".26W.0/1">In 1998 my Department HQ entered into a Private Finance Initiative partnership with a consortium led by ICL (now Fujitsu) in conjunction with CMG, known as UNITAS. This arrangement included the transfer of ownership of the vast majority of our computer assets to UNITAS and part of the contractual arrangements in place are that the responsibility for replacing equipment and its disposal when this is necessary lies with them. Part of our normal monthly service charge paid for the provision of our computers includes an element to meet any costs incurred by UNITAS in carrying out this disposal service.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.0/2">Where equipment becomes surplus to requirement UNITAS always tries to re-cycle it and, accordingly, the number of PCs disposed of by UNITAS in the last three years has been negligible. Their environmental policy also dictates that any disposals are done in an environmentally friendly manner and appropriate security measures are applied to ensure hard discs are always erased before disposal. Where disposal is necessary UNITAS use a company known as STARS.</p>

	<p pid=".27W.8/2">The UK's Climate Change Programme, issued in November 2000, sets out the Government's approach to the challenge. It is estimated that the proposals in the programme could reduce UK greenhouse gas emissions to about 23 per cent. below 1990 levels in 2010. This is well beyond the Kyoto target. Longer term, the Government believe that global emissions of greenhouse gases may need to be reduced by 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. if we are to avoid dangerous climate change. This will require a major transformation in the way we generate and use energy&mdash;essentially a move away from the substantial use of fossil fuels emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to a low carbon economy.</p>
	<p pid=".27W.8/3">The possible nature of such an economy and the means for achieving it was one of the issues considered in the Performance and Innovation Unit's Energy Review report to Government. The Government are currently consulting on the Energy Review and the responses to the consultation will help to shape an energy White Paper, by around the turn of the year.</p>

	<p pid=".31W.2/1">One Bill introduced by my Department in the last five years contained a sunset clause. Section 16(41) of The Electronic Communications Act 2000 provides for the repeal of Part 1 of the Act five years from Royal Assent if no order is made before then under Section 16(2). The use of such clauses in future Bills will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

However, national contingents within the ISAF have been involved in a number of humanitarian projects. United Kingdom service personnel, in conjunction with the Department for International Development, have contributed to the rebuilding of Kabul' s education system through helping with repairs to its schools. The ISAF has also on occasion responded to critical emergencies to help save lives. There has been no expansion in ISAF's mission as defined in the authorising United Nations Security Council Resolutions.</p>

	<p pid=".33W.8/1">British military operations in Afghanistan have involved both warfighting and security assistance tasks. The task force based around 45 Commando Royal Marines has performed valuable work in denying remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban elements opportunities to regroup and commit terrorist attacks, especially around the time of the vital Loya Jirga process. British forces in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) have also played a valuable role in helping the Afghan Interim Administration maintain security in Kabul. As I have already said in my answer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/918" name="Paul Goodman">the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase>, at column 33W today, I hope to make a fuller statement to the House on our forces in Afghanistan later this week.</p>

	<p pid=".34W.5/1">The Defence Housing Executive (DHE) is constantly looking for ways to further improve its repairs service. Current response requirements for unplanned maintenance are: within 24 hours for emergencies, within five working days for urgent repairs and within two months for routine repairs. DHE achieved 99 per cent. of routine repairs within the required timescale against a target of 95 per cent. On urgent repairs, 87 per cent. were achieved on time against a target of 90 per cent. Against a target of 95 per cent. for emergency repairs, the achievement was 93 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".34W.5/2">The DHE is trialling a call centre in the north-east which allows the occupants of service families' housing to notify their requirement for response repairs directly. An appointment is then made with the occupant for the contractor to call and effect the repair. The contractor is incentivised to meet response repair targets and to reach a higher level of customer satisfaction. Failure to achieve the targets set by DHE will mean that fees will be withheld. The results of the trial will be used to inform the planned move to a prime contract for housing maintenance and works services, which is in line with a wider Government initiative.</p>

However, for one category of service leaver not eligible to receive standard career transition services, those being compulsorily discharged, the MOD has under consideration a change to the current rules to allow them to receive some specialist advice about finding jobs and accommodation, and accessing further support should the initial advice fail. A six-month trial to assess the feasibility of this initiative is under way.</p>

	<p pid=".36W.5/1">On current plans the first Fleet Air Arm Sea Harrier squadron will be withdrawn in 2004 and the remainder of the force will be withdrawn by 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.5/2">An investment plan has been agreed to take forward Joint Force Harrier (JFH) into the era of Future Joint Combat Aircraft (FJCA) and Future Carriers.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.5/3">The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) included a commitment to establish JFH, building on the success of Royal Navy and RAF Harrier aircraft operations in joint carrier air groups. This was a radical initiative to form a truly joint, flexible and deployable force optimised for the demands of the new strategic environment. JFH currently operates two aircraft types&mdash;Sea Harrier FA2, an air defence aircraft flown by RN personnel, and Harrier GR7, a ground attack/reconnaissance aircraft flown by RAF personnel. The plan has been for both the Sea Harrier FA2 and Harrier GR7 to be replaced by a common aircraft type. This is currently designated the FJCA with an In-Service Date of 2012.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.5/4">Work has been taking place on a migration plan to take forward JFH into the era of the FJCA and the future aircraft carrier. We have concluded that JFH should migrate to an all Harrier GR force, maximising investment in one aircraft type. It is planned to upgrade the GR7 to GR9 standard to ensure a credible expeditionary offensive capability until the aircraft leaves service. To achieve this, aircraft systems will be enhanced to ensure their longevity and give the Harrier the capability to operate with smart weapons.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.5/5">Given the Harrier GR9' s ability in future to employ smart weapons world-wide by day and night from land and sea and the increased emphasis on carrier based offensive air-power in the SDR and confirmed by the emerging conclusions of our post-<phrase class="date" code="2002-09-11">11 September</phrase> work, the Sea Harrier FA2 will be withdrawn earlier than planned, by 2006. The Sea Harrier entered service in 1979, and will start to become obsolescent as this decade progresses.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.5/6">As a consequence of its earlier withdrawal from service, the planned relocation of Sea Harrier FA2 aircraft from RNAS Yeovilton to RAF Cottesmore and RAF Wittering in 2003 will not now proceed. However, the relocation of RN personnel will go ahead but slightly later than currently planned, over the period 2004 to 2006. By <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, JFH will have migrated to an all Harrier GR9 force by roughly equal numbers of RN and RAF personnel. These proposals will be subject to consultation with the trade unions in the normal way.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.5/7">This plan will significantly enhance the offensive strike capability of our aircraft carriers pending the introduction to service of the FJCA.</p>

Various disorders/symptoms were certified as attributable to service with an award paid but &quot;Gulf Syndrome&quot; was rejected as &quot;not found&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".41W.5/4">In December 1996 Mr. Rusling appealed against the rejection of &quot;Gulf Syndrome&quot;. Mr. Rusling's case was governed by the relevant war pensions legislation which requires disablement to be accepted unless it can be shown &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot; that there is no service link. His case was reviewed and to reflect then emerging evidence and medical understanding of Gulf illness and the war pension standard of proof, the rejected &quot;Gulf Syndrome&quot; was replaced by the WHO International Classification of Diseases 10th ed. diagnostic category, Signs, Symptoms and ill-defined Conditions. This included the symptoms previously claimed under &quot;Gulf Syndrome&quot;. Mr. Rusling's award of war disablement pension was increased accordingly. Mr. Rusling was notified of the details of the decision at that time.</p>

Between 1996 and 2000, just over 5 per cent. of agreements were subject to such checks by MAFF staff each year. The Rural Payments Agency assumed responsibility for these checks in April 2001, after the Regional Service Centres of MAFF were disbanded. Since then, no compliance checks have been undertaken on Countryside Stewardship agreements. The foot and mouth epidemic prevented Agency staff undertaking any checks during the majority of the last calendar year and the early part of 2002. Arrangements for resuming checks on Countryside Stewardship agreements are well advanced.</p>

	<p pid=".48W.9/3">There is an obvious risk to navigation, especially when we consider that a vessel undertaking a &quot;great circle&quot; sailing in the southern ocean will be drawn into high latitudes. However, the risk is minimised by knowledge of the location, size and movement of the icebergs from satellite remote sensing devices, the provision of Maritime Safety Information (MSI) services to ensure that mariners are aware of the danger and the contribution from modern navigation systems.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.9/4">The breaking away of C10 and C19 will not have an impact on global warming. While the break-up of ice shelves is consistent with a warmer world, it is still not clear the degree to which global warming has contributed to the recent break-up of parts of the Antarctic ice shelf.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.9/5">C10 and C19 will not cause sea levels to change as the ice was floating in the sea prior to breaking off the ice shelf.</p>

	<p pid=".49W.2/4">The Isle of Wight adopted its unitary development plan in May 2001, which had received input from the former MAFF. Any further input on behalf of DEFRA for a review will be made through the Government Office for the South East (GOSE), in conjunction with the interests of other Departments. Some dialogue is expected in respect of implementing national Planning Policy Guidance, notably PPG3 on housing and PPG7 which sets out the Government's objectives for rural areas.</p>
	<p pid=".49W.2/5">The South East Rural Affairs Forum has been set up following recommendations in the Rural White Paper. The First meeting of the Group was on the <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-15">15 April</phrase> in Guildford.

	<p pid=".49W.2/8">Clinics for the promotion of good quality applications under the ERDP are held regularly by the DEFRA Rural Development Service in Reading and Guildford, and have been attended recently by potential applicants from the Isle of Wight who are bringing forward new schemes for rural development.</p>
	<p pid=".49W.2/9">In addition to the ERDP there are continuing CAP payments supporting most farms in the constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".49W.2/10">Under the Market Towns Initiative a partnership development programme for the Island has recently been supported, including information and advice on Rural White Paper policies in the context of the developing Local Strategic Partnership, and the Vital Villages grant scheme run by the Countryside Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".49W.2/11">The Isle of Wight is one of five areas in the South East region that has been awarded new funding under the LEADER+ programme, with European Union support, for experimental development of rural projects and community initiatives.

From <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-01">1 April 1999</phrase>, the agency recorded whether an incident involves the unlawful deposit of waste and whether prosecutions led to convictions or acquittals.

	<p pid=".56W.9/1">Since July 2001 the Department for International Development has completed one public consultation process on a strategy paper for achieving the Millennium Development Goal on hunger. The Department received <i>(a)</i> 119 written replies, which represented <i>(b)</i> about 10 per cent. of those specifically consulted.

Responses to these consultations are still being received.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.9/3">The Department pursues more focused consultation exercises with outside bodies and experts on particular issues. Recent examples include a strategy for the Department's partnership with the World Health Organisation, and a policy paper on research for poverty reduction. The Department is also participating in a joint international consultation exercise with the World bank, the United Nations Development Programme and the European Commission on policies for linking poverty reduction with environmental management.</p>

Delegations also regularly consult representatives of civil society during the course of such meetings.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.9/5">The Department is currently engaged in its third round of development policy forums across the UK, to share thinking and ideas on key development issues. Over 2,000 representatives from across society&mdash;including from NGOs, trade unions, private sector, faith organisations and universities&mdash;are participating in the 11 forums in 2002, which are focusing on globalisation and its potential to reduce world poverty. Specifically, participants are debating the themes of trade, environment and the private sector.</p>

	<p pid=".57W.2/1">DFID's aim is the elimination of poverty. The framework for our action is set out in the 1997 and 2000 White Papers and the recent International Development Act. The UN Millennium Development Goals are the main yardsticks against which we continue to measure progress towards this aim.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.2/2">At the country level we believe progress towards development goals is principally the responsibility of African Governments, in partnership with the donor community. The international community is working with developing countries, including in Sub-Saharan Africa, to promote country-led and participatory poverty reduction strategy processes. These processes are intended to develop coherent national policies, agree priorities, and help to develop an institutional framework in which Governments can be held to account by their own citizens and stakeholders. The role of donors is to provide financial and technical support to enhance Governments' capacity to develop and implement these strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.2/3">Last October the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) was formally launched. This is one of the most important initiatives to come from Africa in recent years, and has been strongly welcomed by the Government. We are currently working to try to ensure that the response to NEPAD from the international community is both positive and sustained. In particular, we are working within the G8 to develop an Action Plan for Africa which focuses on the key areas of conflict resolution, aid, debt, health, education and trade.</p>

	<p pid=".57W.5/1">My Department is working with the international community and African Governments both to assess the number of people in sub-Saharan Africa who are hungry and to build capacity to assess vulnerability. FAO estimates from 1997 indicate that around 187 million people in sub-Saharan Africa do not have enough food. Excluding the on-going conflict in Angola, the immediate emerging crisis is in southern Africa where around 13 million people in six countries are estimated to be unlikely to grow or buy enough food by next March. My Department has recently published a strategy paper &quot;Eliminating Hunger&quot;. This sets out our strategy to meet the millennium development goal for hunger and is relevant to the current problems in Africa. Humanitarian relief is only one part of our response, as the principal cause of hunger and starvation in Africa is poverty and the failure of institutions and Governments to provide for the poor and vulnerable and react to natural disaster. In the last complete financial year (2000&ndash;01) my Department provided &pound;632 million to sub-Saharan Africa. Included within this figure was &pound;44 million for humanitarian assistance. This represents an increase of 31 per cent. in funds allocated to sub-Saharan Africa from the previous financial year. In addition to this, DFID is providing &pound;58 million specifically to help address the current crisis in southern Africa. It is, unfortunately, not possible to provide more detailed figures of the assessments of hunger and humanitarian expenditure in each country in southern Africa without disproportionate effort.</p>

	<p pid=".58W.5/1">The information is as follows.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/2" class="italic">Food Aid</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/3">In Lesotho DFID will be providing &pound;1.5 million to the WFP emergency programme and another additional &pound;1.0 million to support the longer-term rehabilitation of agriculture in the three worst affected districts. Mozambique has a surplus of maize in the north, although logistics and traditional trading patterns will result in most of this surplus being exported to adjacent countries mainly Malawi. Several donors are already funding food relief where it is needed in the south. DFID is assessing the needs, but it is likely that we can add more value in Mozambique by assisting with the management of food aid or by focusing on agricultural inputs to improve food security for the next harvest. At the moment we are not engaged in food aid in Zambia.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/4" class="italic">Agriculture</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/5">In Lesotho, we are supporting a three year Agricultural Policy and Capacity building Programme (&pound;750,000) in collaboration with other donors to restructure the Ministry of Agriculture and improve its operational effectiveness. We are providing support to CARE (&pound;1.9 million) in two districts where they have been developing a more appropriate extension model that meets the needs of the rural people and empower households and communities. We are providing support to a Pilot Agro-forestry Programme (&pound;214,130), to strengthen the capacity of small-scale nurseries.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/6">DFID is a key supporter of the Mozambique Government's sector programme in agriculture, ProAgri, which seeks to promote growth and poverty reduction by creating a dynamic agricultural sector. We have also been working for some years with NGOs in agricultural development in Zambezia Province. Much of the impact of the very successful feeder roads programme in Zambezia has also been felt in the agricultural sector, where transport and access to markets are key constraints on growth.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/7">In Zambia we have provided support for civil society groups working in the drought-prone southern province.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/8" class="italic">HIV/AIDS</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/9">DFID has committed &pound;7.6 million over five years to fund a Regional HIV/AIDS Programme channelled through the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Health Sector Co-ordinating Unit (HSCU), specifically earmarked for Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho and Namibia. The programme focuses on developing the capacity within each country and across the region to mount an effective response to the epidemic. The initiative complements an EU funded programme also channelled through the SADC HSCU which is to benefit all member states.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/10">Mozambique's national HIV prevalence is 12.2 per cent. 1.1 million people are HIV positive. DFID supports the Mozambique National AIDS Council in its multisectoral response (&pound;3.8 million); supports key civil society organisations (&pound;7.6 million), and is supporting the Government to work with young people in and out of school to prevent HIV infection. We are working with the Ministry of Health to provide a broader health sector response to HIV/AIDs (&pound;1.85 million). Jointly with other donors, we are currently providing additional support (&pound;25 million) to the health sector and this funds a significant proportion of Mozambique's essential medicines requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/11">In Zambia the main support to date has been through the health and education sectors, however, DFID is currently preparing a programme that will provide an additional &pound;20 million to support the national strategic framework.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/12" class="italic">Trade</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/13">Considerable DFID effort is allocated towards trade capacity building for developing countries and lobbying for greater market access with EU member states and with the WTO.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/14">Lesotho, as a member of the Southern African Customs University is part of the recently agreed SACU Free Trade Agreement, it is also a recipient of the Cotonou Agreement trade preferences. DFID has offered support to Lesotho in trade policy negotiations and capacity building through the Africa Trade and Poverty Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.5/15">Mozambique and Zambia as least developed countries, both benefit from duty and quota free access for their products into the UK under the EU 'Everything But Arms' initiative, the introduction of which the UK Government strongly supported. They also benefit from the Cotonou Agreement. DFID is working with the Governments in these countries in ways that will help them take advantage of these and new market opportunities.</p>

They are prepared to continue funding food distribution through non- governmental channels, but it is clear that this can only provide part of the solution and that Government must take steps to allow greater participation in the import effort and make the necessary adjustments in economic policy for this to be effective.</p>

Partnerships involving the public and private sectors and civil society will be essential to achieve this. Our focus is to support the structuring of these partnerships in a way that responds to the needs of, and ensures benefits for, poor people through pro-poor contracts, good regulatory frameworks, and appropriate tariff structures.</p>

	<p pid=".69W.3/1">Further research has been commissioned by the Department to reassess attitudes to aircraft noise in England; their correlation with the Leq noise index; and to examine (hypothetical) willingness to pay in respect of nuisance from such noise, in relation to other elements, on the basis of stated preference (SP) survey evidence.</p>
	<p pid=".69W.3/2">The consultation document &quot;The Future of Aviation&quot; (DETR December 2000) explained that further research into the monetary valuation of the effects of noise may be needed to inform charging strategies. The research is designed to underpin the Government's stated principle set out in &quot;A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone&quot; (Cm3950) that the aviation industry should meet the external costs it imposes.</p>
	<p pid=".69W.3/3">The research contract was awarded to a consortium led by the MVA Consultancy last November and is expected to last approximately three years. The work is split into two stages with Phase I focusing on i) the development of the sampling strategy and assessment of the feasibility of using Stated Preference techniques and ii) an initial assessment of the Leq/annoyance relationship. This phase is expected to last until the end of the year. A decision to proceed to Phase II will depend on the Phase I findings. The results of the research will be disseminated widely.</p>

Key areas included recruitment, training, ongoing maintenance of drivers' fitness and competence, safety briefing and monitoring and audit of systems.</p>
	<p pid=".70W.6/3">Each TOC received a report containing agreed actions which HMRI required them to pursue. These TOCs are being visited by HMRI during 2002&ndash;03 as part of the normal inspection plan to ensure that they have adequately addressed the matters raised.</p>

	<p pid=".72W.3/1">The road haulage industry is responsible for recruiting, retaining and training the workforce it needs, including LGV drivers.</p>
	<p pid=".72W.3/2">The Government has discussed on many occasions the challenges the industry is facing through the Road Haulage Forum, and set up over a year ago a separate training sub-group which includes representatives of the Freight Transport Association, the Road Haulage Association, and the Transport and General Workers Union. The sub-group, which is chaired by Edward Roderick, Chief Executive of Christian Salvesen, met most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-24">24 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".72W.3/3">Through the main Forum the training sub-group has access to funds from the Road Haulage Modernisation Fund. We have already committed an initial &pound;5 million to a package of measures including an expansion of the Young Drivers Scheme, a demonstration project under Modern Apprenticeships and a feasibility study on transferable training loans. The measures are aimed at helping the industry recruit more young people and protecting employer investment in training.</p>

The Disabled Persons Transport Committee (DPTAC) were asked to look at those responses and they submitted their recommendations to Ministers at the beginning of May.

The role of GPs in this procedure is being considered as part of the current review of the Scheme and I would not want to pre-empt our full consideration of DPTAC's report at this stage.</p>

	<p pid=".73W.5/6" class="indent">it is an offence under section 47 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to park a vehicle which is not displaying a badge in a designated disabled persons' parking bay.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.5/7">The issues of abuse and misuse of badges are a major part of a review of the scheme that we are currently undertaking.

I regret that it is not possible to identify spend solely on the motorway network.

Funding for quieter surfaces is allocated as part of our Roads Renewals budget. Last year we spend &pound;252.4m, marginally more than our allocation of &pound;249.3m.</p>

	<p pid=".78W.0/1">The Comptroller and Auditor General has recommended, in his report &quot;Dealing with pollution from ships&quot;, that the Merchant Shipping legislation be revised to ensure that pollution incidents may be prosecuted under the UK's oil pollution regulations, wherever incidents occur within the UK Pollution Control Zone. This recommendation relates to the Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Oil Pollution) Regulations 1996, SI 1996/2154.</p>
	<p pid=".78W.0/2">As the report explains, the 1996 Regulations are concerned with areas seaward from the baseline from which the United Kingdom's territorial sea is measured. Illegal discharges of oil in the internal waters landward of that baseline (including estuaries) can be prosecuted under section 131 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. Defences are available under both the 1996 Regulations and the 1995 Act. However those under the 1995 Act are different in some key details from those provided under the 1996 Regulations. In the light of the concerns raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department will consider the alignment of the defences under both the Regulation and the Act. This may involve subsequent amendment of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 as the defences in the 1996 Regulations derive from an International Convention.</p>

	<p pid=".81W.5/2">The former Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions was responsible for major programmes of capital investment in transport, housing and urban renewal, and implementing strategic policy objectives, many of which have long-term horizons&mdash;the transport 10-year plan, the programme for modernising local government, the urban renewal agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.5/3">Many of these programmes will impact on the hon. Member's constituency. For example: Wycombe district council received a Housing Capital Guideline allocation of &pound;1,455,000 for 2002&ndash;03 plus an additional Basic Credit Approval of &pound;100,000 based on performance. Wycombe district council received a Disabled Facilities Grant allocation of &pound;228,000. The Secretary of State approved spending on the Cash Incentive Scheme of &pound;154,162 for 2001&ndash;02 and &pound;134,417 for 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.5/4">The hon. Member's constituency would also have benefited from a part of the local single capital pot allocation to Buckinghamshire county council for 2001&ndash;02, which totalled &pound;15.171 million. It is for the county council to decide how best to use these funds and what proportion should be used within the hon. Member's consistency.</p>

	<p pid=".83W.8/1">The ONE pilots are significantly closer to the Jobcentre Plus model than other Jobcentres and social security offices. However, some changes will be necessary to enable them to deliver the full Jobcentre Plus service.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.8/2">The main changes to ONE will be the introduction of new management structures and the movement from operating the ONE Work Focused Interview regulations to the Jobcentre Plus regulations that exclude housing benefit and council tax benefit from the range of benefits covered.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.8/3">We are encouraging Jobcentre Plus and local authority managers to build on the framework of liaison and service level agreements that already exist. This will help to ensure that the efficient administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, which is so important for many of the people using our services, not least in helping the transition to work.</p>

	<p pid=".84W.3/1">The Department for Work and Pensions was formed in June 2001 from the former Department of Social Security and parts of the Department for Education and Employment. We are currently undertaking a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it from a passive organisation paying out benefits to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent. This is making a significant contribution to the Government's overall objectives of eradicating child poverty in 20 years, and halving it within 10; promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age while protecting the position of those in greatest need and combating poverty and promoting security and independence in retirement for today's and future pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.3/2">Child benefit is now worth &pound;15.74 a week for the eldest child and &pound;10.55 a week for other children; nationally about 7 million families receive child benefit, and in Wycombe 12,220 families benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.3/3">The number of people in work is at record levels of 28.4 million. Nearly three quarters of working age people are in employment and in Wycombe the proportion in employment currently stands at 80.5 per cent. Unemployment is around its lowest level since the mid 1970s. Our New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. Nationally well over 600,000 people have been helped into work by the New Deals and in Wycombe over 550 have been helped into work.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.3/4">Through Jobcentre Plus we are delivering a single, integrated service to people of working age claiming benefits, with a clear focus on work. In addition to the 56 integrated Jobcentre Plus offices which are already open, we intend to introduce around 225 more integrated offices by April next year including offices in the Wycombe constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.3/5">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2001&ndash;02) we have made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household to help with their heaviest fuel bill. We estimate that around 17,000 older people in Wycombe have received a payment this winter.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.3/6">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country. Our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.3/7">From April 2002 we will be spending an extra &pound;6 billion a year in real terms on pensioners as a result of our policies. This includes &pound;2.5 billion more on the poorest third of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.3/8">2,000 pensioner families in Wycombe are receiving the minimum income guarantee which helps our poorest pensioners. Some 14,700 pensioners in Wycombe will benefit from this year's increases in the basic state pension of &pound;3 a week for single pensioners and &pound;4.80 for couples. Those over 75, of whom we estimate there are about 6,000 in Wycombe, may qualify for free TV licences.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.3/9">Other reforms include the new pension credit in 2003 designed to ensure that pensioners benefit from their savings and the introduction of the state second pension from this April. Both of these initiatives will help provide greater security for tomorrow's pensioners. We have also announced that from October 2003 benefits currently reduced after a hospital stay of six weeks will not be reduced until 13 weeks. This will benefit both pensioners and people of working age.</p>

	<p pid=".89W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-10">10 June 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".89W.5/2">The Department for Work and Pensions was formed in June 2001 from the former Department of Social Security and parts of the Department for Education and Employment. We are currently undertaking a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it from a passive organisation paying out benefits to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent. This is making a significant contribution to the Government's overall objectives of:</p>
	<p pid=".89W.5/3" class="indent">eradicating child poverty in 20 years, and halving it within 10;</p>
	<p pid=".89W.5/4" class="indent">promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age while protecting the positions of those in greatest need; and</p>
	<p pid=".89W.5/5" class="indent">combating poverty and promoting security and independence in retirement for today's and future pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.5/6">Child benefit is now worth &pound;15.75 a week for the eldest child and &pound;10.55 a week for other children; nationally about 7 million families receive child benefit, and in the Isle of Wight 14,550 families benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.5/7">The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.2 million, and in the Isle of Wight the proportion of working age people in work currently stands at 70.9 per cent. Unemployment in the Isle of Wight has fallen by 2.5 per cent. over the last year while the number of long-term unemployed, has been cut by over a quarter. Our New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployment, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over-50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. Nationally well over 600,000 people have been helped into work by the New Deals and in the Isle of Wight over 1,900 have been helped into work.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.5/8">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2001&ndash;02) we have made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household to help with their heaviest fuel bill. We estimate that around 33,000 older people in the Isle of Wight have received a payment this winter.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.5/9">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country. Our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.5/10">From April 2002 we will be spending an extra &pound;6 billion a year in real terms on pensioners as a result of our policies. This includes &pound;2.5 billion more on the poorest third of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.5/11">4,600 pensioner families in the Isle of Wight are receiving the minimum income guarantee which helps our poorest pensioners. Some 31,400 pensioners in the Isle of Wight will benefit from this year's increases in the basic state pension of &pound;3 a week for single pensioners and &pound;4.80 for couples. Those over 75, of whom we estimate there are about 14,800 in the Isle of Wight, may quality for free TV licences.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.5/12">Other reforms include the new pension credit in 2003 designed to ensure that pensioners benefit from their savings and the introduction of the state second pension from this April. Both of these initiatives will help provide greater security for tomorrow's pensioners. We have also announced that from October 2003 benefits currently reduced after a hospital stay of six weeks will not be reduced until 13 weeks. This will benefit both pensioners and people of working age.</p>

	<p pid=".91W.3/2">As a basis for future financial projections, the Government Actuary has assumed that in 2001&ndash;02 there were 13.3 million people contracted out of the additional state pension, rising to 13.7 million people in 2004&ndash;05. However, many factors can effect the actual level of contracting out and this assumption will be reviewed and updated as necessary as further data become available.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.3/3">Projections of national insurance contribution income and benefit expenditure require assumptions of the future level of contracting out from the state second pension. The assumed level of contracting out is estimated by considering data on the level of contracting out through different routes in past years and potential influences on the numbers contracting out in future years, such as the introduction of stakeholder pensions. As with any projections, the assumptions used should not be regarded as precise forecasts of future experience. The potential for change in the projections resulting from variability in the future level of contracting out is considered through sensitivity analysis where appropriate, rather than the use of confidence intervals.</p>

	<p pid=".97W.8/2">From April 2002, benefits are paid through Jobcentre Plus and the Pensions Service. The percentage of staff aged over 55 in these agencies is 7.32 per cent. and 7.48 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.8/3">Since the Department's creation last year, staff in DWP, (other than senior civil service) have had the opportunity to continue their employment beyond the age of 60 up to 65.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.8/4">The Department's Diversity and Equality policy statement makes an explicit commitment to non- discrimination on age grounds. DWP is keen to make the most of the talents and experience of older staff and offers a range of working arrangements such as flexible working hours, part-time working patterns and other options which may suit their needs.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.8/5">We have been looking at ways of further encouraging the recruitment of older workers. At the end of last year the Employment Service worked with colleagues in the Benefits Agency to develop a customised &quot;gateway&quot; to prepare New Deal 50plus customers for jobs in DWP. The initiative proved successful with 20 of the 21 participants subsequently taking up jobs in DWP with the Benefits Agency. The success of the initiative has been widely communicated internally throughout the Department, and promoted to other civil service Departments. Under the new Deal 50plus programme we are able to specifically target people from that age group and give them fixed term contracts with us, and permanent posts subject to them passing a fair and open recruitment competition.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.8/6">In July 2002 DWP will be extending its use of the New Deal 50plus programme to support its staff recruitment. Guidance will be issued across DWP to raise the profile of the programme and to encourage managers to use this alternative form of recruitment.</p>

	<p pid=".101W.3/1">The Government recognise that plastic card fraud has been a large and rapidly growing problem in the United Kingdom (UK) since the mid-1990s, with losses having increased from &pound;165 million in 1992 to &pound;411.4 million <sup>1</sup> in 2001. The steep rise has been caused by high levels of organised card crime alongside increases in the number and usage of payment cards.</p>
	<p pid=".101W.3/2">Significant work is under way to combat plastic card crime. The Home Office has held discussions with the finance and retail sectors and the police to establish and promote best practice in protecting cards. A major initiative which has emerged is the planned introduction of microchips into payment cards to help authentication. This is to be combined with the introduction of PIN codes in place of signatures. The banking industry foresees that by 2005 the technology will have eliminated up to 80 per cent. of plastic card fraud in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".101W.3/3">The Government are pleased that the banks and retailers are committed to introducing new technology that is so vital in fighting plastic card fraud. The UK has been leading the world in creating a global standard for chip and design that guarantees very high levels of security whenever consumers use their cards. It is vital that we use this technology to combat fraudsters who find it all too easy to forge genuine cardholders' signatures.</p>
	<p pid=".101W.3/4">The Home Office is also supporting a two-year pilot of a unique policing unit, the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit. The unit, based in London, is working closely with the banking industry to reduce organised card and cheque fraud across England and Wales. It is estimated that savings of up to &pound;16 million per year may be achieved in each year of operation.</p>

Short intensive enforcement campaigns are occasionally conducted to deal with persistent cycling offenders.</p>

The cycling infrastructure and environment are currently being improved as part of our National Cycling Strategy, and the improvements will help reduce the incentive to cycle on the pavement.</p>

Studies, such as the MORI Youth Survey published by the Youth Justice Board, provide a useful picture of the association between frequent drinking, drugs misuse and offending behaviour among young people. The 2002 MORI Youth Survey, published in May, while showing that a large proportion of young people have tried alcohol, shows clearly that those who admit to committing a criminal offence are likely to drink more regularly than those who do not. The survey similarly shows that young people who have committed a criminal offence within the previous 12 months are significantly more likely to have taken illegal drugs than those who have not offended.</p>

	<p pid=".109W.5/1">It is not our policy to grant routinely exceptional leave to remain to victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation. Each case is considered in the light of its own individual circumstances, including any compassionate factors which may be put forward.

	<p pid=".109W.5/2">The White Paper &quot;Secure Borders, Safe Haven&quot; outlined proposals for supporting victims of exploitation. Where such people are willing to assist the authorities in bringing traffickers to justice, special arrangements may be made for their protection. The Government intends to develop &quot;best practice&quot; to distinguish victims in genuine need and to provide them with appropriate help and support, whether they are allowed to remain here or are returned to their own countries.</p>

	<p pid=".110W.3/1">The Immigration Service deploys a range of new detection technology to combat clandestine entry through the channel tunnel and other routes. Carbon dioxide and heartbeat detectors are in operation in Dover and Coquelles and two x-ray scanners deployed there by Her Majesty's Customs and Excise for the purpose of detecting contraband have regularly found clandestine entrants during their searches. These two scanners are shortly to be supplemented by two gamma ray detectors purchased by the Immigration Service and all four scanners will be manned by joint Customs/Immigration Service teams.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.3/2">In addition, the Immigration Service is about to begin the next phase of its procurement programme and is looking to deploy additional detection devices in the United Kingdom and some continental ports. Searches are already conducted in some of those ports by ferry and port operators and the Immigration service is currently considering how best to assist them in their efforts, possibly by lending additional detection equipment.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.3/3">The recent resurgence of clandestine entry via the SNCF rail freight site at Frethun requires additional security measures to be taken to secure the site. Following discussions, SNCF have undertaken to introduce measures to improve security as a matter of urgency.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.3/4">In the forthcoming Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill the Government are seeking to amend the Civil Penalty provisions of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to bring about a more flexible, but enforceable penalty regime. The object of the Civil Penalty is to persuade those responsible for vehicles and other transport to secure and check them properly to prevent the carriage of clandestine entrants. The Civil Penalty provisions apply equally to rail freight and freight shuttle wagons operating through the tunnel and since its introduction in clandestine entry on the Eurotunnel freight shuttle service has reduced dramatically.</p>

	<p pid=".113W.0/1">With respect to questions <i>(a)</i> and (b), (i) and (ii), and A, B and C, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) advises that it does not have a classification on its casework database corresponding to these specific types of case. To answer those questions accurately would accordingly require the individual examination of every case where the victim was a young child at the time of injury. That could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/2">It can take a considerable time to complete the assessment of compensation payable in individual cases that involve severe or complex injuries. However, once eligibility has been established in principle, CICA may make interim awards, for example in respect of the care needs of a severely injured child.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/3">CICA obtains and meets the cost of all the reports it considers necessary to inform a fair and accurate assessment of an application. No applicant is required to provide reports. However, some do provide reports in support of their view of the award that they should receive. Where the Authority considers reports or other information submitted by an applicant to be inaccurate, inadequate, or out of date, it may propose that supplementary information be provided at the applicant's expense.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/4">Generally, CICA does not reimburse the cost of care or other reports, commissioned by applicants or their representatives. However, CICA will make interim awards of compensation so that an applicant has the funds to pay for any specialist report that he or she may wish to obtain. The Authority is not routinely told the cost of care reports commissioned by third parties. And the records held by CICA of the cost of reports that it has paid for do not differentiate between care reports and others. Consequently CICA has no centrally held data from which to derive the average cost of a care report.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/5">Where it appears that the combination of the tariff award and the assessment of special expenses is highly likely to exceed the Scheme limit of &pound;500,000 per case, CICA will usually concentrate on the main heads of claim to shorten the process involved in reaching the determination. However, where the victim is a severely injured young child the process of assessment may be complicated by considerations such as life expectancy and difficulty in reaching a firm long-term prognosis.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.0/6">In such cases the local authority's assessment of care needs and details of what it will provide free of charge are an essential part of the corresponding assessment of costs under the Tariff Scheme. This is because local authorities tend to provide services to children without charge, and paragraph 35(d) of the Scheme specifies that the reasonable costs of care services may be provided for in an award of compensation only where they are not available free of charge from the national health service, local authorities or any other agency.</p>

The test of success will be whether the measures being put in place will make a real difference to the quality of life of individuals and communities up and down the country.</p>

The project, between the Northumbria police and Newcastle city council, received a grant of &pound;137,000 to cover the costs of a range of interventions, including Close Circuit Television (CCTV) schemes and other target hardening measures. Out of the grant, a total of &pound;133,493 has been claimed.

	<p pid=".128W.8/35">Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-31">31 March 2000</phrase> disposals were at local management discretion. A national scheme was established whereby charities in each region were invited to request replaced equipment and collect it at their own expense. Unusable equipment was discarded. Security and environmental factors were taken into consideration at all times. The cost incurred in disposal was minimal and related mainly to the time of the departmental staff involved.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.8/36">On <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-31">31 March 2000</phrase> ownership of HMCE desktop and laptop computers passed to ICL (now Fujitsu Services) under a PFI contract. The contracted service charge covers replacement and disposal costs as well as provision of the day to day services. Fujitsu Services operate a Second Time Around Replacement (STAR) system, whereby renovated equipment is deployed as far as economically possible to reduce costs. During 1999, the Inland Revenue replaced all its PCs, laptops, servers and printers under a major programme known as Infrastructure 2000 (i2K). The aims of the programme were to introduce a common, market-centred infrastructure platform and to meet Year 2000 security requirements. Some 60,000 terminals were installed during this period (the largest NT installation in Europe at the time). Under i2K, a large percentage of the Department's existing IT kit was upgraded, refurbished and redeveloped as part of the deals negotiated with equipment suppliers. Because of this and the massive scale of the i2K programme (cost over &pound;200 million), specific costs on disposal of individual items for the financial year 1999&ndash;2000 would be available only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.8/37">Since the successful delivery of i2K, the Department has operated a rolling programme of replacing IT kit. During the last two financial years, we have replaced the following numbers of PCs:</p>
	<p pid=".128W.8/38" class="indent">2000&ndash;01: 4,957</p>
	<p pid=".128W.8/39" class="indent">2001&ndash;02: 23,297.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.8/40">During this period, the Department has employed RD Computers Ltd. and DataServ-CES to dispose of IT equipment. The cost of disposals was:</p>
	<p pid=".128W.8/41" class="indent">2000&ndash;01: &pound;55,158</p>
	<p pid=".128W.8/42" class="indent">2001&ndash;02: &pound;199,751.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.8/43">However, income from sales of redundant IT kit during the same period were:</p>

Companies that are late in filing their CTSA returns are charged &pound;100 if they file less than three months after the filing date, &pound;200 if they are between three and 18 months late (if the company files late on three consecutive occasions, these penalties increase to &pound;500 and &pound;1,000 respectively), 10 per cent. of their unpaid tax if they are 18 months to two years late and 20 per cent. of their unpaid tax if they are more than two years late in filing.</p>

	<p pid=".154W.0/1">The procedures for adopting a child from Macedonia are broadly the same as for adopting a child from any overseas country. Before any person may adopt a child they must first be assessed by an approved adoption agency as being suitable to adopt. As part of the approval process a home study report is prepared and presented to an adoption panel for approval. Following this, the report is then endorsed by the agency's decision maker and forwarded to the Department where a certificate of eligibility to adopt is prepared in line with the Adoption of Children from Overseas Regulations 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".154W.0/2">In the case of an application to adopt a Macedonian child, the completed home study and the certificate of eligibility to adopt are sent to the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy in Macedonia. The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy will then seek to identify a suitable child for the applicants. If a match is made, the applicants may then make arrangements to travel overseas and adopt the child. The applicants will then apply for entry clearance, in the normal way, to enable them to bring the child into the UK for the purposes of adoption.</p>
	<p pid=".154W.0/3">On their return to the UK the applicants must notify their local social services department of their intention to adopt with 14 days. As Macedonia is not included on the list of countries whose adoption orders are recognised in the UK, an application will need to be made to a UK court to re-adopt the child.</p>

	<p pid=".166W.0/1">The National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) took over responsibility for the regulation of all care homes in England on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, including care homes not previously required to register. The NCSC is responsible for regulating care homes in accordance with national minimum standards to ensure consistency and improve the quality of life and level of protection for the most vulnerable people in society.</p>
	<p pid=".166W.0/2">The NCSC is currently dealing with a heavy load of applications under the new arrangements and there is some delay in dealing with some applications. The NCSC is taking steps to deal with this and expects the average time for processing applications to reduce as the number of applications comes down to more normal levels.</p>
	<p pid=".166W.0/3">The NCSC's staffing establishment is 2,352 of which 1,874 staff are currently in post. As this is the NCSC's first year of operation, we have no historical data as yet on actual running costs of the NCSC. However, the NCSC is planning its work for 2002&ndash;03 on the basis of a budget of &pound;131 million revenue and &pound;1.5 million capital. The NCSC's programme of inspections was not expected to get fully under way before June 2002 due to factors such as completing office accommodation moves and information technology set-ups, transferring staff, finalising inspector training and giving due notice to providers of the inspections. Nevertheless, from the information currently available, 66 inspections were carried out in April and 612 in May. 2,034 inspections are planned for June.</p>
	<p pid=".166W.0/4">Application forms for registration are usually sent out by first class post. Information is not available on the times taken to send out packs containing application forms. Requests for packs are responded to within two working days where possible, although some delays have occurred due to a higher than planned volume of demand requiring forms to be reprinted. Information is currently not available on the times taken to inspect nursing and residential homes which have applied for registration, but this will become available later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".166W.0/5">Details of registration procedures and application forms for nursing and residential care homes are available on the NCSC's website <a href="http://www.carestandards.org.uk">www.carestandards.org.uk</a></p>
	<p pid=".166W.0/6">Regulatory fees for care homes increased on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year. This is the first increase in fees since <phrase class="date" code="1998-05-01">1 May 1998</phrase>. The increase reflects the effects of inflation on the value of fees but also our longer-term aim of moving to full cost recovery. Despite this increase, care homes currently only pay 31 per cent. of the actual cost of registration and inspection. We recognise that fees are not the only extra cost of the new regulatory system to care homes. We are increasing total resources available for social services by an average of six per cent. a year in real terms over the next three years (2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06). These increases follow average annual real terms increases of more than three per cent. between 1996&ndash;97 and 2002&ndash;03 including a 3.6 per cent. real terms increase this year (2002&ndash;03). These substantial increases in resources, in particular over the next three years, will enable local authorities to deliver the improvements to social services to which the Government are committed. It also means that local authorities have the resources they need to purchase services at realistic prices.</p>
	<p pid=".166W.0/7">Under the previous regulatory system, care homes were inspected by around 250 local authorities and health authorities each applying its own, sometimes contradictory, local conditions for registration. This system had been criticised over several years for lacking independence, consistency and coherence. The NCSC will, by contrast, inspect care homes using national standards. Due to the large number of different standards set under the previous regulatory system, I cannot say in detail how national standards may differ from them. This will vary from area to area. However, national standards were widely consulted on and the finalised standards were set at a level already being met or exceeded by many providers and which others should be able to meet over time.</p>

This will ensure that councils have the resources that they need to purchase good quality services for the people that they serve.
