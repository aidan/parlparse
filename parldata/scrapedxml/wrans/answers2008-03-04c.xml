Police enforcement regarding drug-related crime spans all business areas of the organisation. It is not only the drugs squad within crime operations that combat 'illicit drugs'. TSGs, organised crime, districts, special operations, roads policing etc., all have their part to play and a breakdown of the costing within each of these areas for this particular aspect of the roles they provide is not readily available.</p>

	<p pid="c.2253W.2/1">The calculation of acceptable dioxin levels in soil/sediment or in humans is complex. For soil or sediment, the Atlanta Centre for Disease Control in the US uses 1,000 parts per trillion Toxic Equivalence Quote (ppt TEQ) as being the maximum allowable level of dioxin contamination permitted before some form of corrective action must be taken to mitigate TEQ exposure. For the human body, the UK Foods Standards Agency has set the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of dioxin at 2 picogram (pc)/kilogramme (kg) of body weight. This is based on World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="c.2253W.2/2">The concept of a dioxin &quot;hotspot&quot; was developed by Hatfield Consultants Ltd (Canada) while working with the Ministry of Health in Vietnam. They found that the current level of dioxin contamination in and around the former US air bases where dioxin was stored, mixed and loaded onto planes&mdash;the hot spots&mdash;was much higher than current levels in the areas sprayed during the war. The three major hotspots are in Southern Vietnam at the former US air bases at Da Nang, Bien Hoa, and Phu Cat. Studies conducted between 2000 and 2004 by the Vietnamese Ministry of National Defence found an average dioxin level of about 35,000 ppt TEQ at Da Nang and Bien Hoa airports. This is 35 times higher than acceptable levels recommended by the Atlanta Centre for Disease Control in the US.</p>

	<p pid="c.2257W.9/1">The &quot;Future of Air Transport&quot; White Paper set out our key aim to limit and where possible reduce the number of people in the UK significantly affected by aircraft noise.</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.9/2">In the White Paper, we highlighted the importance of promoting research and development into quieter aircraft and airframe technology. We are pursuing this aim through both international and national fora.</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.9/3">Although technological change is a long-term issue, the aviation industry has made encouraging progress in addressing the noise of the airline fleet. For example, the newest generation of wide bodied aircraft is expected to make significantly less noise on arrival than the largest aircraft currently operating. We have also seen the introduction of new engines which include innovations to reduce noise and improve fuel efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.9/4">Possible future technological change and related impacts are taken into account in our forecasting. For example, the current consultation on the future expansion of Heathrow (Adding Capacity at Heathrow Airport) has been prepared against this background. Paragraph 3.82 of the consultation document notes that although there were 73 per cent. more aircraft movements in 2005 compared with 1975, the number of people significantly affected by noise has fallen by 87 per cent. and the area affected reduced by 86 per cent. In addition, the night flights regime introduced in October 2006 at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted recognises technological change by providing incentives for introducing quieter aircraft. The regime was only introduced after an extensive two stage public consultation exercise.</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.9/5">All major UK airports (i.e. 50,000 annual movements or above) have been required to map aircraft noise in compliance with the European environmental noise directive. Later this year, the airports will have to prepare strategic noise action plans setting out noise mitigation measures. These plans will have to be prepared in consultation with the local community and as such provide an opportunity for relevant local issues to be considered. In addition, we regularly receive representations on aircraft noise issues which help inform the Department's policy making.</p>

This is because information on the feedstocks from which the fuels were produced, and on their country of origin, is not currently collected.</p>
	<p pid="c.2259W.6/4">This is one of the reasons why the Government are introducing the renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO) in April. Under the RTFO, transport fuel suppliers who wish to earn renewable transport fuel certificates in respect of their biofuels will have to report to the Renewable Fuels Agency (RFA) on matters such as the country of origin, the wider sustainability and the carbon intensity of those fuels. The Renewable Fuels Agency will be required to report regularly on these matters, and this will allow the Government to monitor very closely the carbon dioxide savings associated with the policy, as well as its wider environmental impacts.</p>

	<p pid="c.2262W.11/2">There are no regulations that deal specifically with loading goods, including scrap metal, on to road vehicles. However, this activity is covered by the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, and where the loading of scrap metal is done using lifting equipment, the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 will also apply. All these are enforced by health and safety inspectors. Regulation 100 of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations covers the safety of loads being transported on vehicles, and this is enforced by the police.</p>

The airport already enjoys good surface transport links including an express bus service from the city centre, and the Liverpool South Parkway rail-bus interchange opened in 2006. The airport's draft master plan, published in 2006, explored a range of possible further options for transport links, and the airport's operator continues to work with local statutory agencies and other partners to evaluate them.</p>

The latest estimates were published last year in the Energy White Paper. These have been used for latest road traffic, aviation and rail forecasts and are currently being integrated into the advice and software the Department provides to transport promoters preparing business cases for schemes. These long-term price projections are to 2020 which for the latest transport modelling are projected further usually assuming no changes beyond 2020.</p>
	<p pid="c.2263W.8/3">The current oil price projection (in 2006 prices) can be seen in the following table. DBERR produce a low, central and high price projection. These are real prices and the nominal prices&mdash;that include the impacts of forecast inflation&mdash;would be higher, for example, the real price of $53 in 2025 is approximately $88 in nominal prices.</p>

Also relevant is funding to the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), which have received ringfenced BREW programme throughout the programme period, to co-ordinate business resource efficiency activities at the regional level and to conduct various regionally-specific projects. This was in addition to the DEFRA contribution to the RDA single programme (&quot;single pot&quot;), which gives RDAs the ability to address national priorities, on which they are tasked by Government (including activities to promote business resource efficiency), as well as regional objectives. With Government tasking and funding now fully aligned through the single pot, RDAs will no longer receive separate funding for resource efficiency activities. Total funding for RDAs from DEFRA in 2008-09 is &pound;53 million.<br/> 2. In 2006-07, DEFRA funded nine pilot projects to conduct innovative work in the area of business resource efficiency. Seven of these activities were scaled up in 2007-08. Following a review of the activities, the three identified activities will continue to be funded by DEFRA in 2008-09, with the remaining four no longer receiving specific DEFRA funding. DEFRA is working with the latter four projects, listed , to ensure that learning is embedded in wider activity on business resource efficiency:<br/> (i) Business Link Kent: Business Link Diagnostic Tool;<br/> (ii) Community Recycling Network: Compost Doctors;<br/> (iii) Environment Practice: Mentoring for Success in Construction; and<br/> (iv) White Young Green: Sector specific environmental best practice programmes using a BS8555-phased approach.<br/> 3. The title of the BREW Centre for Local Authorities is under reconsideration, given that the BREW programme has been amalgamated into a single, more focused approach of allocating DEFRA funding to increase resource efficiency and reduce carbon emissions.<br/> 4. Activities undertaken by the waste and resource action programme (WRAP) and the Carbon Trust cover a range of areas, including but not restricted to business resource efficiency. For example, in the case of the Carbon Trust, &pound;47.4 million is being provided from the domestic environmental transformation fund to support the development and deployment of low carbon technologies. DEFRA is in discussions with WRAP and the Carbon Trust about the appropriate spread of work between these various areas.<br/> 5. In 2006-07 and 2007-08, the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts (RSWT) has managed the business reuse fund, which provides grant funding for activities involving the third sector to promote materials re-use among businesses. Following discussions with DEFRA, RSWT chose not to bid for future funding for the continuation of the fund.<br/> 6. The technology programme, overseen by the Technology Strategy Board, has received funding throughout the period of the BREW programme. The funds have been used to promote research and development into environmental technologies. BREW funding is additional to funds provided by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS), the sponsoring department of the board. From 2008-09, DEFRA will no longer provide funding to the programme, but will work with DIUS to seek opportunities for integrating environmental sustainability considerations into the work of the programme.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.2278W.5/1">The European Court of Auditors report has highlighted a number of weaknesses in the control regime applicable within the European Community. Those weakness undermine the overall effectiveness of the common fisheries policy and the achievement of its objective of sustainable fisheries. We therefore welcome its publication. We also welcome the positive stance taken by the Commission in response to the report and the measures that it has already announced to simplify and harmonise the control regime. Those measures include, in the short term, improving the vessel monitoring system, introducing electronic logbooks and sales notes, improving member states' and the Commission's databases, enhanced cross-checking of data and the application of more effective and consistent sanctions throughout the Community. In the medium term, the Commission is working towards the publication, in October 2008, of a proposal to replace the existing Control Regulation with one designed to rationalise and standardise rules, strengthen cooperation and collaboration between member states and help to develop a culture of compliance among the industry. We intend to play an active part in the discussions to ensure that these objectives are met.</p>

	<p pid="c.2279W.8/2">The Government continue to take steps through their Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative (PSFPI) to encourage and help public bodies to increase opportunities for small and local food producers.</p>
	<p pid="c.2279W.8/3">Further guidance, tools, case studies and other information is available on the DEFRA website. An updated procurement toolkit on the website explains how public sector bodies can break their catering contracts into lots and sets out how to specify seasonal and fresh food. This approach can create opportunities for small and local producers to do business with the public sector.</p>

	<p pid="c.2282W.0/1">As part of our preparations for the comprehensive spending review (CSR) during the summer of 2007, DEFRA asked the Housing Corporation to provide advice on the feasibility of a potential revenue funding programme to support activity to improve the delivery of affordable rural housing at local level. We always made it clear that this would be considered in the light of the CSR settlement.</p>
	<p pid="c.2282W.0/2">That advice has now been carefully considered. However, given the Government's undertaking on increases in housing supply generally&mdash;which will benefit rural as well as urban areas&mdash;we have concluded that the value of a small challenge fund would not be enough to merit a switching of resources away from other priority areas of DEFRA's business.</p>
	<p pid="c.2282W.0/3">The Government have already set out proposals to increase the supply of housing and will be allocating &pound;8.4 billion across the regions over the next three years. The Housing Corporation will be tasked with spending this money most effectively. The Government's long-term housing supply and affordability public service agreement (PSA) target specifically covers rural as well as urban affordability.</p>
	<p pid="c.2282W.0/4">In addition, the Housing Green Paper sets out the Government's intention to establish a national target for rural affordable housing. The Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) is in the process of developing this target, based on advice from the Regional Assemblies and the Housing Corporation. It is much more important to ensure that these measures work for rural areas, rather than to focus attention on small packets of funding from DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid="c.2282W.0/5">Together with CLG, we remain committed to addressing the affordable rural housing problem. At a national level, the policies and funding to deliver are largely in place, but we want to ensure that they feed through into delivery. That is why my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has asked <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> to carry out a review to find out how land use and planning can better support business and deliver affordable housing in rural areas. The hon. member will report to both DEFRA and CLG in the summer.</p>

	<p pid="c.2283W.2/1">Seal conservation is a devolved issue. The most recent estimates of seal populations in Great Britain are between 50,000 and 60,000 for common seals and between 107,000 and 171,000 for grey seals. Of these, 85 per cent. of common seals and 90 per cent. of grey seals occur in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="c.2283W.2/2">The most significant threat to the common seal population was posed by the outbreaks of Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV) in 1988 and 2002. This greatly reduced the common seal population on the east coast of England.</p>
	<p pid="c.2283W.2/3">Under the Conservation of Seals Act 1970, the Natural Environment Research Council has a duty to provide the Government with scientific advice on matters related to the management of seal populations. Such advice is provided annually and the latest report, for 2007, can be found on the Sea Mammals Research Unit website.</p>

	<p pid="c.2283W.5/1">Since the new provisions are designed only to confirm existing Community powers as they relate to the common fisheries policy, I have not seen the need to undertake any substantive discussions with colleagues in other Government Departments. Experience in areas already subject to co-decision has shown that proposals can be improved. The additional scrutiny and debate in the European Parliament will offer new opportunities for the UK and other member states to secure better regulation. We have a lot of experience of dealing with the European Parliament and we will certainly draw on this&mdash;and our good reputation&mdash;when it comes to engaging with them on fisheries. But this will not apply to all aspects of the CFP, in particular the setting of annual catch limits, which will continue to remain the exclusive preserve of the Commission and member states acting in concert.</p>

	<p pid="c.2283W.8/1">The 10 water and sewerage companies in England and Wales have a statutory duty to keep records of the location of every public sewer, lateral drain or disposal main which is vested in them. They must also keep a record of the location of those that are subject to a declaration of vesting and those where an agreement to make such a declaration has been made.</p>
	<p pid="c.2283W.8/2">There is no requirement to keep, and no comprehensive record exists, of the location of private sewers or drains. In March 2007, the Government published a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) to accompany the announcement of its decision to proceed with the transfer of private sewers and drains in England and Wales into the ownership of the water and sewerage companies. The RIA recorded that the unpublished 2002 UK Water Industry Research report, 'The Real Cost of Taking Over Private Sewers and Drains', estimated that a mapping exercise for private sewers would cost &pound;118 million.</p>

An unpublished analysis of the size of enterprise shows that, where employee size was known, around 15 per cent. of commercial waste was produced by those with fewer than 10 employees and around 37 per cent. was produced by enterprises with 10 or more, but fewer than 100 employees.</p>

	<p pid="c.2286W.8/1">The available information is given in the tables placed in the House Library. Data from 2002-03 has been used in the calculations rather than using data from five years ago (i.e. 2001-02). This is because data for 2001-02 is not directly comparable with that for later years.</p>
	<p pid="c.2286W.8/2">Some forces have re-structured their Basic Command Units which has resulted in many comparisons not being possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.2286W.8/3">It should be noted that non-sanction detections that contribute to the percentage change in detection rates have fallen in recent years reflecting a significant shift by many police forces away from recording detections of crime where no further action is taken. For this reason overall detections rates over time are not fully comparable. From <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they can be claimed to a very limited set of circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="c.2287W.0/1">The Government are committed to improving the life chances of children and young people, by having fewer young people affected by crime and reduce youth victimisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.2287W.0/2">There is already a great deal of work going on across Government to tackle offenders and help vulnerable young people achieve the Every Child Matters outcome to 'Stay Safe'. Initiatives include Safer School Partnerships, Youth Inclusion Support Panels and the Youth Inclusion Programme and since 2004, we have invested over &pound;45 million in youth offending teams which have pioneered antisocial behaviour prevention activities for young people at most risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.2287W.0/3">Safer Schools Partnerships (SSPs) were launched in 2002 in England and Wales and they help tackle criminal activity at or near school entrances. SSPs are a successful mechanism for ensuring joint working between schools and police, to identify and support children and young people regarded as being at high risk of victimisation, offending and social exclusion. There are now about 500 SSPs of one form or another. Evaluations have shown that they are proving effective in improving behaviour and attendance, developing strong and positive relationships between the police and young people, and to help young people develop a sense of being part of the local community.</p>
	<p pid="c.2287W.0/4">Reports from front-line staff suggest that the introduction of school-based officers under SSP have gone some way to improve the overall safety of the schools in Coventry and the wider community. One school has suggested that crime fell between 70-80 per cent. since the introduction of these measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.2287W.0/5">There is also a local scheme (Operation Rhyme) encouraging schools to stagger the end of school days in an effort to minimise potential problems between pupils. The school entrances are patrolled by uniformed police officers with the assistance of police community support officers.</p>
	<p pid="c.2287W.0/6">The use of metal search archways and the use of a police dog have also been used as a deterrent in some Coventry schools. This has been at the consent of the schools involved as well as the pupils and parents. Local police officers involved in the scheme say it has lead to a greater well-being and safer school environment.</p>

	<p pid="c.2287W.3/1">The main initiative to tackle crime on school premises in the last 10 years has been the Safer School Partnerships (SSPs).</p>
	<p pid="c.2287W.3/2">SSPs are a successful mechanism for ensuring structured joint working between schools and police. Evaluations have shown they are proving effective in improving behaviour and attendance, with truancy falling significantly and pupils and staff feeling much safer. Originally launched in areas targeted by the Street Crime Initiative in 2002, there are now over 500 SSPs in one form or another across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.2287W.3/3">Because of the proven success of SSPs, the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) has been working closely with the Home Office, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the Youth Justice Board (YJB) to encourage more schools and police to engage in this type of early intervention and preventative work which is so vital to achieving the outcomes we are all committed to.</p>
	<p pid="c.2287W.3/4">DCSF also announced, in October 2006, that schools had a power randomly to screen pupils using metal detectors in arches or hand-held wands. The use of screening arches in schools and other places was introduced in May 2007 by the Government and brought in force a new power for schools to search without consent, pupils suspected of carrying a weapon.</p>
	<p pid="c.2287W.3/5">The great majority of schools don't have a problem with knife crime. Nevertheless, in a very small number of schools it may be necessary, at the discretion of the school and working with the police, to search pupils. The Government introduced in May last year new measures to enable the searching of weapons by teaching staff to ensure schools continue to be safe and secure places to learn. The use of search arches&mdash;in schools and other places&mdash;is currently being considered by the Government as part of a range of measures to tackle knife crime, which will be featured in the Violent Crime Action Plan to be published in February.</p>
	<p pid="c.2287W.3/6">The Government have also launched various wider initiatives which contribute to reducing crime in schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.2287W.3/7">Since 2004, it has invested over &pound;45 million in youth crime prevention funding to youth offending teams which have pioneered crime prevention activities for young people at most risk. Their work includes:</p>
	<p pid="c.2287W.3/8" class="indent">Youth Inclusion Support Panels; and</p>
	<p pid="c.2287W.3/9" class="indent">Youth Inclusion Programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.2287W.3/10">The Home Office has invested in other prevention programmes such as Positive Futures. Around 22,000 young people are currently involved in Positive Futures projects nationwide.</p>

	<p pid="c.2288W.5/2"><i> </i>The Government have undertaken a wide-ranging programme to tackle violent crime which has resulted in a reduction of 31 per cent. since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.2288W.5/3">For example, through the Tackling Violent Crime Programme, the Home Office has been working intensively with practitioners in a small number of local areas with high levels of more serious violent crime, to support their efforts to reduce alcohol-related crime and domestic violence, to improve police and other agencies' performance and partnership working, and to improve local strategies. The Tackling Gangs Action Programme is also working in four cities (London, Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham) to tackle gangs and associated issues, in particular firearms.</p>
	<p pid="c.2288W.5/4">As a further example, in the context of domestic violence, we have developed the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) process, whereby a range of agencies work together to share information about known domestic violence victims and develop co-ordinated multi-agency action plans to reduce the risk of repeat victimisation. In Cardiff, an independent evaluation has shown that MARACs there have cut repeat victimisation from over 30 per cent. to below 10 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.2289W.5/1">Significant violence at football matches is now extremely rare. The multi-agency football disorder strategy introduced after Euro 2000 has been highly successful in reducing levels of English and Welsh football violence both at home and abroad. Arrests for offences of football violence, both inside and away from grounds, have decreased by 46 per cent. over the past three seasons and are now the lowest on record. Last season around 39 million spectators attended football matches involving English and Welsh club and international teams and on average there was just one arrest in connection with each match. The arrests were for a wide variety of football-related offences committed inside and away from grounds and included a total of 41 arrests for possession of an offensive weapon. In view of the reduced risk of violence or disorder, and on the basis of a police risk assessment in respect of each match, 43 per cent. of all League and Cup matches in the 2006-07 season were played with no police in attendance.</p>
	<p pid="c.2289W.5/2">The success of the Home Office co-ordinated strategy is a result of a number of factors, including tough but proportionate football banning order legislation, intelligence-led policing operations, integrated in-stadia safety and security arrangements and the dedication and commitment of all parties, including the fans. There is no complacency. Preventing and tackling the lingering, if much reduced, threat of football violence will continue to be treated as a high priority.</p>

	<p pid="c.2293W.9/2">The 2002 update to the UK's Drug Strategy highlighted knowledge gaps in relation to the dynamics of the illegal drug markets. In particular, there was a dearth of evidence on the supply chain from importation to street-level sale; the routes and methods used to supply the market; and, the way in which interventions affected the key players in the supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="c.2293W.9/3">By interviewing a sample of convicted drug traffickers and dealers, the study commissioned by the Research, Development and Statistics Directorate (RDS) aimed to fill this gap in the knowledge base and provide us with a crucial insight into the dynamics of the drug market.</p>
	<p pid="c.2293W.9/4">The findings from the research, which have been published, includes information on how dealers and traffickers enter the market, how they run their enterprises and how they respond to the risks they perceive. The findings are very useful for the further development of policy and practice to disrupt the supply of illegal drugs.</p>

It has the aims of making the UK the best and safest place in the world for children to use the internet.</p>
	<p pid="c.2297W.5/2">There are excellent working relationships with the internet industry, and they have developed strong working practices and guidelines relating to services they offer and content they host. Where a UK ISP is advised&mdash;usually by law enforcement&mdash;that they are hosting material, which is illegal, they have an excellent record in removing it.</p>
	<p pid="c.2297W.5/3">In September 2007, the Prime Minister announced a review into the risk to children of exposure to harmful or inappropriate content in video games and online. The review will also assess the effectiveness and adequacy of existing measures to help prevent children from being exposed to such material and help parents understand and manage the risks of access to inappropriate content.</p>
	<p pid="c.2297W.5/4">Dr. Tanya Byron is conducting this review and will report to Ministers in March 2008. The Home Office looks forward to hearing the recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="c.2298W.6/1">In December 2005, the Home Office Task Force on the Protection of Children on the Internet published the &quot;Good Practice guide for search providers and advice to the public on how to search safely&quot;. This document was produced in conjunction with representatives from the search provider industry and other UK experts, and is aimed at the public and at companies who provide search across all platforms. It provides a model of good practice to search providers and gives advice to help the public, especially parents and carers, make good use of search engines and reduce the risk of being exposed to unwanted and unsuitable results.</p>
	<p pid="c.2298W.6/2">Furthermore, the major search provider companies work closely and effectively with UK self-regulatory body, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), to promote online safety. The IWF provides a dynamic list of child sexual abuse websites to search providers which enables them to better manage the quality of search returns, blocking those that feature on the child sexual abuse list, to help protect internet users.</p>
	<p pid="c.2298W.6/3">The IWF is also in a position to provide intelligence around the number and nature of search returns regarding potentially illegal and potentially inappropriate online content. It has provided this intelligence recently, for example, to the Government's consultation on Extreme Pornography legislation, the Byron Review and the DCMS Select Committee Review regarding online content such as adult pornography, child sexual abuse 'cartoons', and mutilation, bestiality and necrophilia websites.</p>

	<p pid="c.2299W.5/1">On the rare occasion child sexual abuse content reported to the Internet Watch Foundation is found to be hosted in the UK, the organisation's successful self-regulatory partnership with the online industry means it is removed expeditiously; typically within a matter of hours. It is worth noting that in 1997 18 per cent. of child sexual abuse content was found to be hosted in the UK and that this figure has been less than 1 per cent. since 2003 because of the work of the IWF with the online sector and the success of their universal notice and take-down initiative ensuring any such abuse of UK online services is dealt with swiftly and effectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.2299W.5/2">As regards incitement to racial hatred and criminally obscene content, there have been no instances of UK hosted incitement to racial hatred content between 2005 and 2007 and just two instances of UK hosted criminally obscene content in the same period which were removed.</p>
	<p pid="c.2299W.5/3">In relation to fraudulent websites, ISPs are required to shut down these sites within a reasonable amount of time once they have been informed about its existence by law enforcement under the e commerce directive. The directive offers ISPs protection from liability for hosting, transmitting or caching illegal material of which they have no knowledge (this would include fraudulent content). Once the material is brought to the attention of the ISP (by law enforcement), they lose their protection unless they take the material off their site as quickly as possible. There are excellent working relationships between the internet industry and law enforcement, and they have developed strong working practices and guidelines relating to services they offer and content they host. The internet industry has an excellent record in removing websites operating illegally.</p>
	<p pid="c.2299W.5/4">The Government do not hold information on the time taken to remove these sites.</p>

	<p pid="c.2302W.3/1">Since 1997, the Government's aim has been to make the UK a more hostile environment for organised crime.</p>
	<p pid="c.2302W.3/2">In 2002 we introduced the Proceeds of Crime Act. Since the Act came into force in 2003 we have recovered over &pound;360 million of criminally derived assets and there has been a five-fold increase of moneys recovered annually. We have targets to recover more; doubling the annual amount to &pound;250 million by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.2302W.3/3">In 2004, we issued a White Paper &quot;One Step Ahead - A 21st Century Strategy to Defeat Organised Crime&quot; from which flowed the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. This Act introduced new measures to help disrupt criminal activity and convict those responsible.</p>
	<p pid="c.2302W.3/4">The Act also established the Serious Organised Crime Agency which became operative on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>. It brought together the main national agencies for tackling organised crime into a single unit with the aim of reducing the harm caused to the UK by organised crime. It is already demonstrating its success as described in its annual report for 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="c.2302W.3/5">In October 2007 the Serious Crime Act 2007 gained Royal Assent. The Act introduced new measures to prevent and detect serious crime, including Serious Crime Prevention Orders which allow courts to impose restrictive conditions on those proved to be involved in serious crime. The Act will also merge the Asset Recovery Agency with the Serious Organised Crime Agency from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.2303W.2/1">The Internet Watch Foundation's (IWF) last published figures (Annual Report 2006) show that 54.3 per cent. of all child sexual abuse domains known to the IWF appeared to be hosted in the US, and 62 per cent. of commercial child sexual abuse domains. The IWF passes intelligence relating to US hosted child sexual abuse websites to its Hotline partner in the US (Cybertipline, part of National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)) and via Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre (CEOP) and Interpol, to US law enforcement. The IWF recently hosted a visit from associates at NCMEC who were keen to learn from IWF experience. The IWF has also recently visited the US Hotline for a similar sharing exercise.</p>
	<p pid="c.2303W.2/2">A US Congress delegation visited the UK in 2007 on a fact finding tour. This led to the publication of the Congress Report by the US House of Representatives 109<sup>(th)</sup> Congress following their inquiry into child sexual abuse content on the internet last year. The main references to recommended best practice and the IWF are on pages 6-8. Key issues mentioned are NCMEC and IWF sharing lists of child sexual abuse websites; the US emulating the UK/IWF blocking initiative; and pressure being put on ICANN to combat false and illegal domain names which have been selling illegal images for many years on the same website address:</p>

Applications are due in June and successful authorities for 2009 will be announced early next year.</p>

	<p pid="c.2316W.2/6" class="indent">The table attached, shows the numbers of working age in employment who were not born in the UK and were resident in each UK county, Unitary Authority and Metropolitan County, during the twelve month periods ending in March for 2005, 2006, 2007 from the APS and, for the 12 month periods ending in February for 2003 and 2004 from the Annual LFS.</p>
	<p pid="c.2316W.2/7" class="indent">When interpreting these figures, it is important to bear in mind that the APS/LFS are not designed to cover everyone who is present in the UK. The survey may undercount the numbers of people who were born overseas. The reasons are set out in the table footnote.</p>
	<p pid="c.2316W.2/8" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid="c.2343W.8/1">Question 184828 referred to the cash flows arising from the Chelsea disposal. Defence expenditure is based on the overall spending settlements agreed with the Treasury. Within 2007-08, some &pound;250 million will be invested in single living accommodation (SLA) and as outlined in the recent comprehensive spending review (CSR) White Paper some &pound;550 million of the Chelsea receipt is ring-fenced for investment in service accommodation over the next three years. A further &pound;159 million will be programmed over future CSR periods. I have therefore set out in the following table both the cash flow profile arising from sale of Chelsea and the investment profile for SLA and service family accommodation (SFA) contained in the defence financial plans.</p>

	<p pid="c.2343W.8/11">The balance of the investment is directed at SLA, as half of the worldwide stock is currently at the lowest acceptable condition. Under current plans, 30,000 new or improved SLA bed-spaces will be delivered by 2013. This Department plans to invest a total of &pound;134 million on SFA in Great Britain over the next three years, of which &pound;50 million is capital from the Chelsea receipt.</p>

	<p pid="c.2358W.5/1">We continue to believe that the elections to a Constituent Assembly in Nepal, currently planned for <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-10">10 April</phrase>, are key to sustaining the momentum of the current peace process. It is important that all political parties in Nepal, with the support of the international community including the UK, work to ensure that they are credible, free and fair and that they allow a voice to all marginalised groups. We have maintained our wide-ranging backing for the electoral process, including through co-funding the Election Commission and supporting voter education programmes. In addition, we have provided funding to allow the Carter Centre and Asia Foundation to provide international and local non-governmental organisations to monitor elections. As part of our efforts to encourage wider international support, we have pressed the EU to increase the number of election monitors it will deploy to Nepal. Through the UK's Global Conflict Prevention Pool, we have recently approved funding for a number of hon. Members to travel to Nepal to take part in an election observation mission.</p>

	<p pid="c.2358W.8/1">The question of Madhesi rights and engagement in the political process has risen sharply up the agenda through the last year, following significant disturbances and violent protests across the Terai region. Throughout this period, the UK, with our international partners, has continued to urge the Government of Nepal to engage with Madhesi groups, to address their legitimate concerns and to bring them into a fully representative electoral process. The UK joined with our EU partners in welcoming the <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-28">28 February 2008</phrase> agreement between the Government of Nepal and the United Democratic Madhesi Front, which addresses many of the main Madhesi demands and which has allowed Madhesi parties to start the process of nominating candidates to the elections.</p>
	<p pid="c.2358W.8/2">Through the UK's continuing support of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal and local and international non-governmental organisations, the UK has worked to reduce human rights violations in the Terai and elsewhere in Nepal. While the agreement of <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-28">28 February 2008</phrase> will go some way to ensuring the recognition of Madhesi rights, the UK will continue to work with human rights defenders across Nepal to help promote respect for international human rights standards.</p>

The UN Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 1783 on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-31">31 October 2007</phrase>, which renewed the mandate of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara until <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-30">30 April 2008</phrase>. The resolution also calls upon the parties to continue negotiations under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General, without preconditions and in good faith. The UK fully supports these negotiations, with a view to achieving a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution, which will provide for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.</p>

The figures are broken down by month in the following table. As the table demonstrates there has been a decrease in drug finds year on year from 86 in 2005 to 52 in 2007. The assessment is that the reduced number of drug finds has coincided with a drop in the Positive Mandatory Drug Testing rate at Norwich to 5.67 per cent. (April 2007&mdash;January 2008), which indicates that a significant proportion of drugs coming into the establishment are being intercepted. Norwich has strategies in place to maximise mobile phone finds, and the number of such finds suggests the strategy is generating some success. It is not Prison Service policy to disclose details of individual establishment strategies for intercepting contraband.</p>

	<p pid="c.2373W.12/1">In 2006 the male death rate was 18.3 deaths per 100,000 population, and the female death rate was 8.8 deaths per 100,000 population.</p>
	<p pid="c.2373W.12/2">These latest figures for alcohol-related deaths show that much more needs to be done to address the chronic and acute harms that are caused by alcohol misuse. It is vital that we ensure that everyone understands the sensible drinking message and that the public drinks within the low risk levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.2373W.12/3">That is why &quot;Safe. Sensible. Social.?the next steps in the National Alcohol Strategy&quot;, seeks to implement key actions to raise awareness, by:</p>
	<p pid="c.2373W.12/4" class="indent">promoting a culture of sensible drinking;</p>
	<p pid="c.2373W.12/5" class="indent">raising unit awareness&mdash;the Department of Health and the Home Office will jointly launch a much expanded, &pound;10 million sustained national communications campaign in spring that will raise the public's knowledge of units of alcohol and ensure that everyone has the information they need to estimate how much they really do drink;</p>
	<p pid="c.2373W.12/6" class="indent">providing more help for those who want to drink less, through a &pound;3.2 million investment to establish a series of intervention and brief advice 'Trailblazer' projects in health and criminal justice settings to identify people who are drinking at harmful or potentially harmful levels and to offer them help and advice; and</p>
	<p pid="c.2373W.12/7" class="indent">supporting harmful drinkers&mdash;the Government will support the development of a range of new kinds of information and advice aimed at people who drink at harmful levels and their families and friends. These will run alongside other kinds of support and advice from the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="c.2373W.12/8">We have put in place a new NHS indicator to measure the change in the rate of hospital admissions for alcohol related harm (Hospital Episode Statistics data)&mdash;the first ever national commitment to monitor how the NHS is tackling alcohol health harms. This indicator is expected to encourage primary care trusts to invest in earlier identification of people who drink too much linked to advice and support from general practitioners or hospitals&mdash;shown to be the best way of reducing the kind of 'everyday' drinking which over time leads to liver disease and other problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.2373W.12/9" class="indentitalic"> Notes:</p>
	<p pid="c.2373W.12/10" class="indent">The ONS definition of alcohol-related deaths (which includes causes regarded as most directly due to alcohol consumption) was revised in 2006. Details can be found at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=14496">www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=14496</a> and link on this page to 'Alcohol-related deaths in the UK'. ONS has agreed with the GROS and NISRA that this definition will be used to report alcohol-related deaths for the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="c.2373W.12/13">The introduction of the Tenth Revision of the &quot;International Classification of Diseases&quot; (ICD-10) for coding cause of death means that data following its implementation are not completely comparable with earlier years. Mortality data for England and Wales show that the introduction of ICD-10 resulted in a difference in the number of alcohol-related deaths below one per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.2377W.2/1">The national Advanced Communication Skills Training (ACST) programme has been rolled out, via cancer networks, over the last three years with over 1,500 senior health care professionals within cancer being trained and with 250 facilitators appointed to support delivery of the programme. The course has recently been reviewed and enhanced with the new programme being launched nationally from July 2008. Educational grants are being made to cancer networks to enable the introduction of the updated model locally.</p>
	<p pid="c.2377W.2/2">It is for cancer networks working in partnership with strategic health authorities, national health service trusts and postgraduate deaneries to put in place a sustainable process to assess, plan and review their workforce needs and the education and training of all staff linked to local and national priorities for cancer. A number of networks are already looking to deliver communication skills courses to community based and generalist staff groups and it is anticipated that the &quot;End of Life Care Strategy&quot;, which is due for publication in summer 2008, will contain further information on communication skills training for the wider workforce.</p>
	<p pid="c.2377W.2/3">An adaptation of the ACST programme for children and young people with cancer were piloted and successfully evaluated in April 2007. When the updated model for the ACST programme is introduced in July 2008, training facilitators to deliver programmes for senior staff working in children's and young people's cancer services will commence.</p>

	<p pid="c.2378W.2/1">It is important to remember that no screening method is perfect and anyone invited to be screened for cancer must be aware of both the benefit and harm of being screened and be able to make an informed decision on whether to take part or not.</p>
	<p pid="c.2378W.2/2">However, we do recognise the important role that screening plays and, as set out in the 'Cancer Reform Strategy', we are taking steps to build on and improve our existing screening services.</p>

	<p pid="c.2380W.2/3">In practice, these powers are rarely used, and usually as a last resort when other efforts to encourage an individual with tuberculosis to comply with drug therapy have failed. The Health Protection Agency estimate that there are approximately 10 to 20 orders made under the 1984 Act provisions each year.</p>

	<p pid="c.2382W.5/1">Action to address age discrimination in the provisions of health services and social care was a central aspect of the 'National Service Framework (NSF) for Older People', published in 2001. Since then there has been steady progress in eliminating age discrimination including an increase in the proportion of older people receiving intensive help to maintain a high quality of life independently at home rather than in residential care. In addition, specialist services for age related needs such as stroke and falls continue to improve and increasing numbers of older people are taking advantage of health promotion opportunities, for example stopping smoking.</p>
	<p pid="c.2382W.5/2">Local national health service organisations and social services departments are responsible for the management and investigation of complaints, including those of age discrimination; as such, this information is not collected centrally by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="c.2382W.5/3">We are committed to the principle of mental health services that meet people's needs regardless of their age. As new policy is developed it is assessed for its potential impact of different age groups, and existing policy and practice is kept under review.</p>

	<p pid="c.2389W.8/1">The National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) was established in 2001 as a nationally co-ordinated but regionally focused organisation to support local implementation of mental health priorities across health and social care. NIMHE has provided a dedicated focus on policy implementation and support for service improvement in relation to a wide range of mental health issues that challenge services and commissioners across health and social care. Much of NIMHE's work has been done at a local level through its regional development centres and the objectives for this work are agreed with and monitored by local stakeholders in the national health service, local authorities and the third sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.2389W.8/2">The resources supporting NIMHE are predominantly contained in the funding transferred from the Department to the NHS within the 'NHS Bundle'. For 2008-09, the planned resource allocation from the NHS bundle is &pound;19.375 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.2389W.8/3">There are 108, or 90.64 whole-time equivalent, staff either with full or fixed term contracts are directly employed on NIMHE work programmes and another 113, or 59 whole-time equivalent, are working on a seconded or temporary basis on specific projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.2389W.8/4">Approximately one third of costs go on staff, most of whom work in regional development centres. The majority of expenditure is used to fund policy implementation and capacity development initiatives at national, regional and local levels, for example supporting the delivery of improving access to psychological therapies pilots, delivering race equality community engagement projects, promoting new ways of working among mental health staff.</p>

	<p pid="c.2398W.2/1">The review of eligibility has been requested because of the varying approaches being taken by local authorities (LAs) to eligibility to services. Some authorities are helping many more people than others even with tighter eligibility criteria, others are developing alternative new preventative services which aim to reduce the numbers of people who need care services. The review will look at the experiences across England and look to how we might better set a framework that will assist all LAs in getting the best outcomes for people who have care or support needs. Until the review is completed, we will not be able to estimate how many people will be helped or the way in which they might be helped.</p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.2/2">The Government have not yet published the Green Paper. It is therefore not possible to say what impact any proposals that may be contained in the Green Paper will have on the number of people who are eligible for services'.</p>

	<p pid="c.2416W.3/3">We cannot estimate how many people will experience a restriction in their rent as a consequence of the local housing allowance because we do not know in advance what their accommodation choices and hence their contractual rent will be. Consequently, we do not know how their rent will compare with the local housing allowance rate appropriate for them.</p>
	<p pid="c.2416W.3/4">The allowance is a more transparent way to calculate housing benefit entitlement. As a result, claimants should find it easier to shop around to find a property which has a rent set at or below the appropriate local housing allowance rate. The extent to which they do this will determine the proportion of claimants who have their rent restricted. In the Pathfinder areas the percentage of claimants with a shortfall fell from 59 per cent. to 40 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.2418W.3/4" class="indent">Existing learning products are being amended to reflect the introduction of local housing allowance and the consequent changes to our IT systems. In addition communications have been published to increase awareness among Jobcentre Plus staff.</p>

We are putting in place a comprehensive package of learning and development products to fully equip Jobcentre Plus staff to deliver ESA. Detailed learning routeways are being developed for each of the roles affected. In addition, communications are being planned to ensure all Jobcentre Plus staff are aware of ESA as a new benefit and new regime to assist customers into work.</p>
	<p pid="c.2418W.3/6" class="indent">All Jobcentre Plus staff will receive information to raise awareness of the changes to the child maintenance arrangements being introduced in July 2008 and October 2008.

	<p pid="c.2418W.3/7" class="indent">A full learning needs analysis is currently being conducted to assess what learning staff need as a result of the forthcoming changes to lone parents' eligibility for Income Support. All staff are likely to require some communication to raise their awareness. More detailed information will be focused on those whose roles are more directly affected. In particular advisers will be given clear advice on the existing and new flexibilities that are applicable to lone parents claiming Jobseeker's Allowance.</p>
	<p pid="c.2418W.3/8" class="indent">The development and delivery of the training for staff on local Housing Allowance, child maintenance and lone parents' eligibility for Income Support are being contained within core Jobcentre Plus Learning and Development resources which exist to support the implementation of change.

	<p pid="c.2419W.2/1">Poverty is a complex and multidimensional issue and, as such, there are many possible measures of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="c.2419W.2/2">It is generally accepted that low income is central to any poverty measurement. Definitions of low income households are set out in the annual National Statistics publication Households Below Average Income. This reports numbers of individuals in households below or persistently below 50 per cent., 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median household income before and after deducting housing costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.2419W.2/3">Statisticians have made a number of methodological improvements since 1997 in line with international best practice, following full consultation with users and National Statistics protocols. Improvements have been explained in the relevant publications. HBAI presents a consistent time series reflecting all changes that have been made.</p>
	<p pid="c.2419W.2/4">As no single measure captures all aspects of poverty, the new public service agreement &quot;Tackle poverty and promote greater independence and wellbeing in later life&quot; includes a range of indicators related to low income for pensioners. These are relative low income (below 50 and 60 per cent. contemporary median household income), and absolute low income (below 60 per cent. of 1998-99 median income uprated in line with prices). Further information is given in the Government's PSA Delivery Agreement 17, which is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.2419W.2/5">The public service agreement (PSA) to halve child poverty sets out indicators of child poverty. These are relative low income (below 60 per cent. of contemporary median household income) absolute low income (below 60 per cent. of 1998-99 median income uprated in line with prices), and combined low income and material deprivation (based on below 70 per cent. of contemporary median household income). The three indicators of child poverty reflect that income is a key aspect of child poverty. The combined low income and material deprivation indicator provides a wider measure of families' living standards. Further information is given in the conclusions document of the Department's &quot;Measuring Child Poverty&quot; consultation, which is available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.2421W.2/1">In March 2007 Dame Carol Black was commissioned to carry out a review of the health of the working age population. The review, which will contain recommendations for Government and stakeholders, will help us to better understand the impact of ill-health in working age people and how best we can tackle this and support people to stay in work. It will help steer the Government's strategy for the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="c.2421W.2/2">To help her in taking forward her review, Dame Carol launched a &quot;Call for Evidence&quot; which ran until <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-30">30 November 2007</phrase>. There has been a significant and very positive response, with over 260 submissions received and a number of very successful stakeholder events held across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.2421W.2/3">Dame Carol and her review team are currently in the latter stages of analysing the evidence gathered and drafting the report. She is currently hoping to submit her report to Ministers in March.</p>
	<p pid="c.2421W.2/4">In addition to the salary costs of a small team of civil servants supporting her work, the stakeholder events cost approximately &pound;75,000. The review will also be informed by a number of pieces of external research which Dame Carol has commissioned in partnership with the Government's Health Work and Well-being Strategy. The cost of this research to date is around &pound;250,000 and is ultimately expected to total around &pound;300,000. As well as informing Dame Carol's review, this research will be published separately and support the ongoing development of the Health, Work and Well-being Strategy.</p>

	<p pid="c.2424W.2/1">The online training tool is an educational programme developed in partnership with Cardiff university. It has been designed to help GPs develop their skills in handling issues around fitness for work during consultations with patients. 263 GPs completed the programme as part of an independent evaluation during the development process. The results from this evaluation showed that of the GPs that took part, there was a significant change in their attitudes towards dealing with their consultations around fitness for work.</p>

	<p pid="c.2428W.7/1">In our January 2008 Grant Letter to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), we confirmed annual funding of &pound;47.9 million for the Aimhigher Programme for each of the 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 financial years. Traditionally, HEFCE have supplemented this funding. In addition there is a health care strand which at &pound;1.8 million per annum is jointly funded with the Department of Health. This means that, for the 2008/09 academic year, the total funding allocated to Aimhigher will be &pound;78.0 million. Figures for 2009/10 and 2010/11 are still to be finalised.</p>
	<p pid="c.2428W.7/2">The Aimhigher programme brings together universities, colleges and schools in partnership to raise the attainment levels of young people and their aspirations towards higher education. The programme provides opportunities and experiences for learners which helps to widen their horizons, develop talents, increase motivation and maximise potential.</p>
	<p pid="c.2428W.7/3">HEFCE guidance on targeting disadvantaged learners, published in 2007, defined priority groups for Aimhigher to ensure utmost effectiveness. These groups are people from lower socio-economic groups; people from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds who live in areas of relative deprivation where participation in HE is low; 'looked after' children in the care system; and people with a disability or a specific learning difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="c.2428W.7/4">In this next phase of the programme, HEFCE is working with Aimhigher partnerships further to develop targeting of those with the talent and ability who might not consider that higher education is for them and provide a sequenced and challenging range of learning opportunities linked to a future in higher education.</p>

	<p pid="c.2430W.5/1">No students currently studying equivalent or lower qualifications (ELQs) will be affected by these changes. In future, our policy of redistributing grant will widen participation and mean that more of the million people of working age who do not have a first higher-level qualification, especially those from non-traditional backgrounds, will be able to benefit from participating in higher education. However, in finalising our proposals in the light of consultation we have decided to make a number of adjustments. In particular, there will be a review mechanism each year starting in December 2008 to look at individual subjects of particular economic or social importance. We are sure it would be wrong for us to rush into making special arrangements for any subjects, other than those which had already been identified, before any changes to ELQs, as requiring support in the public interest (such as medicine, initial teacher training teaching, science, technology, engineering and maths subjects, area-based studies, and modern foreign languages). But we are asking the Funding Council each year to look at levels of demand both for exempt or protected subjects and at any other subjects which might in future be regarded as key because of their economic or social significance, and in cases where there is evidence of a fall in demand advise us on the best way forward. That will provide an opportunity to consider the issue raised by the hon. Member.</p>

	<p pid="c.2431W.2/1">Drafting replies to parliamentary questions is an integral part of the jobs of a significant proportion of the Department's staff and therefore to respond to this question would incur disproportionate cost. The Department's PQ Tracking System is currently unable to break down the average response time in answering parliamentary questions. The PQ tracking IT system is being upgraded and is close to implementation. It will produce accurate statistics and a wider range of management information making it possible to manage and monitor PQs more closely.</p>

	<p pid="c.2432W.2/1">We are not cutting funding to higher education. There is no cost to the Exchequer because we are redistributing funding away from students doing equivalent or lower level qualifications in order to fund more new entrants to higher education than would otherwise be possible. First and foremost, we took this decision as a matter of fairness and social justice, but it also has an economic rationale. The additional lifetime earnings &quot;premium&quot; associated with getting a first degree in this country remains comfortably over &pound;100,000 in today's prices which makes it among the highest in the developed world. Given that, it is clear that enabling 20,000 more new students (or students progressing to a higher level) to enter higher education will bring considerable long-term benefit to both individuals and the economy, through having a larger number of more highly qualified, more productive workers than would otherwise be the case.</p>

	<p pid="c.2437W.2/2">Priorities for Success published in 2005 established the principle that employers should bear the full cost of specific stand alone training for staff to meet their statutory or other obligations. Therefore, from 2006-07 we ceased to fund courses such as stand alone first aid and health and safety as well as stand alone training required by staff to update qualifications in order to comply with health and safety regulations.</p>

	<p pid="c.2438W.5/2">The Student Loans Company has established payment arrangements for borrowers from other European Union countries who dropped out of their studies and became due to make repayment in April 2007, or who have graduated and become eligible to repay from April 2008. These existing arrangements will continue to apply when the first full cohort of borrowers from EU countries enters into repayment in April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.2438W.5/3">The SLC has written to all EU borrowers due to start repayment and asked them to confirm the address where they expect to reside after graduation. If they are staying in the UK they will be expected to obtain a national insurance number and make repayments through the UK tax system. If they are going abroad they will be asked to supply an address and complete an overseas assessment form to allow repayments to be scheduled. These borrowers have been made aware of the variety of methods of repayment available to them.</p>
	<p pid="c.2438W.5/4">So that all who can pay contribute to the costs of their education we have put in place variable threshold bands which are dependent on where the borrower lives. Effective collection across the EU is underpinned by EC regulation 44/2001, which allows the SLC to obtain judgments in UK courts, which can be enforced by courts in other EU countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.2438W.5/5">In support of the EU repayment process the SLC is developing an enforcement strategy for borrowers who move abroad but who do not provide income details. This work is focussing on the collection of penalties, arrears and the movement of borrowers into litigation where this is appropriate. The SLC is piloting work in these areas and expects to have final arrangements in place by April 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.2441W.0/1">We took this decision first and foremost as a matter of principle on grounds of fairness and social justice. But it will also benefit employers and professional bodies by expanding the supply, to a greater degree than would otherwise be possible, of highly skilled, more productive workers with higher level qualifications. We consulted on the details and no-one has seriously challenged the priority of putting first-time students first. All professional higher level qualifications will continue to attract institutional funding as now when studied by students either entering HE for the first time or progressing to a higher level qualification to ones already obtained.</p>
	<p pid="c.2441W.0/2">The level of institutional grant paid by HEFCE in 2007-08 to teach full-time undergraduate students, whether studying for equivalent or lower level qualifications or not, varies according to the cost of teaching different subjects. Funding ranges from over &pound;14,000 for medicine and dentistry, which are exempt subjects under the ELQ policy, to around &pound;2,600 for the least costly subjects to teach. However, there is no necessary connection between these figures and fee levels. Tuition fees for students studying equivalent and lower level qualifications are already and will continue to be unregulated, subject only to the forces of supply and demand. Each HE provider will need to continue to set tuition fees at a level which remains competitive in a system in which there are over 250 HE providers.</p>

	<p pid="c.2442W.2/1">It is not possible to say what proportion of students overall received a bursary. However, we know that the Student Loans made 81,000 payments in 2006-07 via the Higher Education Bursary Scholarship System (HEBSS) that they manage. HEBSS allows students to apply for a bursary via the Local Authority at the same time as they apply for financial support. It is also important to note that 38 out of 125 institutions do not use this system, so we do not hold data on the number of payments they made. Nevertheless, OFFA report that no student who was eligible and applied for bursaries failed to receive one.</p>

	<p pid="c.2451W.5/1">'Working Together to Safeguard Children', the main interagency guide to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, contains information for practitioners about domestic violence and forced marriage. It makes clear that those who work with children should know how to recognise and respond to the possible abuse or neglect of a child. This will include childminders and everyone working in early years provision. 'Working Together' advises that if anyone has concerns that a child is in danger of a forced marriage, they should contact the Forced Marriage Unit. The guidance also asks Local Safeguarding Children Boards to involve children's centres in their work to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in their local areas. The Government have also published a shorter guidance document, 'What To Do If You're Worried A Child Is Being Abused', which is used widely by those who work with children and which provides an accessible guide to the steps to take when someone has concerns about a child.</p>
	<p pid="c.2451W.5/2">The Sure Start Children's Centres Practice Guidance highlights families experiencing domestic violence among those groups of families that find it hardest to access the services they need. It encourages children's centres to ensure that parents or other family members have access to appropriate support. The statutory framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage, which will be statutory from September 2008, makes clear that all practitioners should have an up-to-date understanding of safeguarding children issues and be able to implement the safeguarding children policy and procedure appropriately. Policies should be in line with LSCB local guidance and procedures.</p>

In any event, neither this Department nor the Training and Development Agency for Schools prescribe the content for courses of initial teacher training or the time that should be spent on particular components of it. Training providers have discretion over this, but the outcome of their course must be that trainees are, on completion, able to demonstrate the various standards the Secretary of State has set out for awarding of Qualified Teacher Status.</p>

	<p pid="c.2459W.2/2">The Department commissioned an international research review in 2004 on the impact of secondary school size on student, teacher and school outcomes. The research was conducted by the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating (EPPI) Centre at the Institute of Education, University of London on behalf of the Department. The research found no consistent relationship between the size of the school and pupil outcomes and was based mainly on studies from the US.

	<p pid="c.2463W.6/2">The NHS Information Centre recently published the results of the National Child Measurement Programme for the 2006-07 school year. The main purpose of the programme is to inform trend analysis and the effective development, planning and delivery of children's services at national and local levels. The NCMP data also underpin the local indicators in both the national indicator set for local authorities and the vital signs indicators for primary care trusts. Guidance has been issued to local areas on how they can use NCMP data to inform goal setting for these child obesity indicators. The national PSA target will be monitored through the Health Survey for England.</p>
	<p pid="c.2463W.6/3">The NCMP is one of the largest collections of child height and weight data in the world and we are keen to ensure effective use of the data gathered, while ensuring the confidentiality of individual children who participated, including to inform the strategy for school sport. Within this constraint, the national anonymised dataset has already been made available to public health observatories to enable more detailed regional and local data analysis, including at school level.</p>

	<p pid="c.2467W.2/1">The information requested by the hon. Member is not available on a national basis. A new statutory duty commenced in February 2007 for local authorities to put robust systems in place to identify children missing from education. Local authorities have been busy implementing these systems over the past year and they should now be able to provide local level data on how many children are missing in their area. However, reliable information on how many children are missing from education cannot be produced nationally using current methods of collection. This information has never been collected. The Department is considering how to collect appropriate information on children missing from education in the future.</p>

Their approach has therefore been to encourage better joint working and co-operation between FRAs on a voluntary basis including, where there are clear efficiency and effectiveness benefits to be gained, the combination of two or more FRAs.</p>

	<p pid="c.2476W.2/1">As part of the &quot;Fire Kills campaign&quot; we have run a series of fire safety advertisements in some of the main Polish newspapers in England to promote smoke alarm ownership and maintenance messages. The Government have also implemented management regulations that apply to all houses in multiple occupation (HMOs). The management regulations impose a variety of duties on landlords of such properties, including requirements to keep means of escape from fire free from obstruction and in repair and to maintain fire fighting equipment and alarms. Under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, 'responsible persons' are required to carry out and implement a fire risk assessment for the commons and shared parts of an HMO. The Government have also introduced mandatory HMO licensing of properties of three or more storeys, housing five or more persons who form two or more households. Landlords of licensable HMOs are required to install smoke alarms and to keep them in proper working order. Landlords who fail to comply with either the management regulations or licence conditions are subject to a fine of &pound;5,000.</p>

	<p pid="c.2478W.2/2">Local involvement networks (LINks) will enable genuine involvement of a far greater number of people than is currently available under patients' forums, ensuring local communities have a stronger voice in the process of commissioning health and social care and enabling them to influence key decisions about the services they both use and pay for.</p>
	<p pid="c.2478W.2/3">LINks offer several key benefits over patients' forums:</p>
	<p pid="c.2478W.2/4" class="indent">they will cover health and social care services (rather than just health);</p>
	<p pid="c.2478W.2/5" class="indent">they will give more people the opportunity to become involved;</p>
	<p pid="c.2478W.2/6" class="indent">they will build on the work of voluntary and community sector groups; and,</p>
	<p pid="c.2478W.2/7" class="indent">they will be flexible to local circumstances (rather than being centrally prescribed).</p>
	<p pid="c.2478W.2/8">These changes are aimed at promoting open and transparent communication between communities and the health service, and will develop trust and confidence, increasing accountability to local people.</p>
	<p pid="c.2478W.2/9">We know from the experience of patients forums that the statutory nature of membership has limited their diversity. We are clear that LINks must be able to be flexible and reflect the nature of local communities. We therefore do not wish to centrally prescribe details on membership. However, we do think it is important to provide models of good practice in terms of recruitment, support and conduct of those involved in LINk activity and these will be set out in LINks guidance.</p>
	<p pid="c.2478W.2/10">The Department received an allocation of &pound;84 million over three years from HM Treasury to fund the establishment and costs incurred by LINks and has no plans to bid for any further funds.</p>
	<p pid="c.2478W.2/11">Although the remit of LINks and levels of involvement will be greater than those of forums, we believe that they will be able to make better use of existing levels of funding by drawing on the resources and activities, which are already present in local communities.</p>

	<p pid="c.2481W.5/2">Due to the way various sales are disclosed within the accounts, it is not possible to arrive at the complete figure for sales of properties.
