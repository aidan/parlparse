	<p pid="c.1117W.0/1">The Government recognise the damaging economic impact of copyright theft and infringement, and unlawful peer-to-peer file-sharing in particular, on the creative sector. Although the music industry is currently affected most by this, other industries&mdash;such as film, computer games and publishing&mdash;will be increasingly affected as higher broadband speeds are introduced. Last year we set up a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Government, internet service providers (ISPs) and rights holders, as a first step to finding agreement on a way forward. Outcomes from the MOU informed the proposals set out in the Digital Britain Interim Report (DBIR) in January. The DBIR proposed a requirement for ISPs to notify their customers when rights holders identified them as engaging in unlawful file sharing. Information on the most serious infringers would then be made available to rights holders (based on the collection of data on the notification requests from rights holders, and subject to a court order) to help them prioritise legal action against those infringers. This would provide a form of graduated response up to prosecution for the most serious infringers. Other forms of graduated response have been suggested to us in response to consultations on this issue, and we are considering the merits of these. We have also consulted on the idea of creating a rights agency, the establishment of a code of practice and Ofcom's possible involvement in this. We have discussed these issues and ideas at ministerial and official level both between Departments and with many interested parties, including ISPs, the UK Film Council and other rights holders' representatives. We will issue a further consultation on the legislative proposals shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.0/2">More generally, the DBIR acknowledged the structural and cyclical pressures on the UK's media industry and the threats to continued investment in UK-originated content in the digital world. We recognise the challenges and opportunities presented by the transition to digital, and the DBIR made a commitment to investigate ways to address these issues further. Our conclusions will be published in the final Digital Britain report.</p>

	<p pid="c.1119W.3/2">We are fully committed to ensuring that everyone in the UK can be part of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games. The Legacy Action Plan which I published in June last year sets out more details on how we propose to deliver this vision. I am especially keen for regions to identify what is important to them. At a regional level this work is being taken forward by the Nations and Regions Group (NRG) who are working hard to optimise local benefits of the games.</p>

I regularly attend meetings with the London councils and meet the five London host borough representatives. I also undertake a programme of regional visits where I meet with local representatives and businesses to highlight the potential benefits and opportunities of London 2012.</p>
	<p pid="c.1119W.3/4">We are already seeing great progress in a lot of these areas, for example 23 of the Olympic Delivery Authority's suppliers are businesses registered in Essex. 66 facilities from the region, including Southend Leisure and Tennis Centre in Essex are included in the official London 2012 Pre-Games Training Camp Guide. Additionally, I am delighted that Southend Unitary Authority is offering free swimming to the over 60s and under 16s.</p>

	<p pid="c.1125W.0/2">If this option was chosen following the consultation, the Department would need to undertake further detailed assessment of the administrative and financial consequences of such a model.</p>

A move to central administration and reimbursement would bring with it a number of complexities, including the potential for duplication of reimbursement negotiations if enhanced concessions continue to be offered at a local level. In addition to any transitional start-up costs, the Department currently estimates a move to central administration would have an average annual cost of &pound;8 million, offset by average annual savings to local authorities of &pound;10.6 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.1134W.5/2">Reduced uptake during 2009 may leave the national herd and flock vulnerable to further incursions of BTV-8. The Government hold unused stocks which are reaching their expiry dates, leaving the tax payer with a potential liability of &pound;3.3 million if unsold.</p>
	<p pid="c.1134W.5/3">The decision to cut the price of Government-owned vaccine has not been taken lightly. The situation is now very different to early 2008, when Government-owned vaccine was the only product available to protect livestock from BTV-8. Government-owned surplus is now competing against vaccines available on the open market, and the pricing is extremely competitive. There is also a need to remove Government-owned stock from the supply chain to allow the market place to operate as normally as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.1134W.5/4">A number of options were investigated and after careful consideration with industry and veterinary stakeholders on the Bluetongue Core Group, we decided that dropping the price of the vaccine was the best approach in order to mitigate financial losses to the taxpayer and reduce vaccine wastage.</p>

	<p pid="c.1134W.8/1">DEFRA has not commissioned any research into the spread of bovine TB from wildlife to pigs and other domestic animals. However, DEFRA has been funding passive surveillance in domestic and zoo animal species for several years. This consists of a free post-mortem and culture service for suspect cases of TB provided by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.1134W.8/2">The principal species affected by bovine TB in Great Britain are cattle and badgers. While small numbers of companion animal species and many wild animal species have been shown to be infected with bovine TB, most are spillover hosts. There is some indirect evidence of transmission from spillover hosts though it is uncertain how often this is occurring.</p>
	<p pid="c.1134W.8/3">TB is not normally considered to be particularly contagious amongst pigs or to spread easily from pigs to other animals. In most cases, the disease is self-limiting and no extensive TB control measures are required. We are, however, likely to continue to observe sporadic incidents of porcine TB due to M. bovis on farms where pigs and cattle are co-located and in outdoor breeding-fattening units in the south-west of England and west midlands.</p>
	<p pid="c.1134W.8/4">Even in areas where TB in cattle and badgers is quite common, not all badgers or family groups will be infected. Even in areas of high TB incidence in cattle and badgers, TB in domestic animals is rare.</p>

	<p pid="c.1135W.2/1">Mastitis is not a notifiable disease hence reporting of mastitis diagnoses is voluntary. The levels of endemic diseases, such as mastitis in the cattle population of Great Britain (GB) are monitored through the DEFRA-funded Veterinary Laboratories Agency's (VLA) Endemic Disease Surveillance Programme. This is performed by analysis of test results from clinical diagnostic samples (usually milk samples in the case of mastitis cases) submitted by veterinary surgeons to the VLA regional laboratories and to the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) disease surveillance centres for investigation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1135W.2/2">The VLA surveillance provides information on the causes of mastitis and their trends. The relative proportions of GB mastitis diagnoses attributed to a specific pathogen are monitored&mdash;results for 2008 are shown in the following table. The proportions of infection were similar for recent years.</p>

	<p pid="c.1135W.2/17">The data available shows the mastitis pathogens isolated as a result of veterinarians submitting samples to these government laboratories and therefore do not provide an unbiased or comprehensive estimate of the occurrence of the condition in GB. The VLA is not contracted to determine the cost of mastitis to the dairy industry and cost cannot be determined from this data.</p>
	<p pid="c.1135W.2/18">The control of endemic diseases such as mastitis, that mainly affect the health and productivity of individual cattle herds, are primarily the responsibility of the owner and his veterinary surgeon. Industry milk recording organisations provide recording through monitoring of somatic cell counts in milk samples, which gives an indication of the presence of mastitis when somatic cell counts are elevated. DairyCo is the relevant levy-funded industry body with responsibility for promotion of the dairy industry and they keep national data on milk recording results.</p>

	<p pid="c.1140W.12/1">Non-consolidated performance payments for Northern Ireland Office senior civil servants (SCS) are distributed in line with Cabinet Office guidance. The size of the consolidated performance pot is based on recommendations of the independent senior salaries review body. In 2008, 42 members of the SCS received end of year performance payment totalling &pound;371,200 which is 8.6 per cent. of the pay bill. In line with current economic conditions the SCS non-consolidated performance payment pot for 2008-09 has been frozen.</p>
	<p pid="c.1140W.12/2">Non-consolidated performance payments for staff below the SCS have been awarded to 20 per cent. of staff who are considered to meet the criteria for an award. In 2008, 367 staff received an end year performance payment totalling &pound;292,675 which is 0.54 per cent. of the pay bill. Awards to be made in respect of 2008-09 remain at 0.54 per cent. and are funded within existing pay bill controls, have to be earned each year against pre-determined targets and as such do not add to future pay bill costs. The award of performance payments help drive high performance.</p>

	<p pid="c.1152W.11/2">Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and off the Coast of Somalia is a symptom of the ongoing instability and lack of economic opportunities in the horn of Africa. Although the security situation makes it difficult to access the region to conduct a full assessment, it is likely that poverty in rural communities in Puntland is one of several contributing factors.</p>

	<p pid="c.1153W.5/1">We have received a number of reports from non-governmental organisations (NGOs) stating that the trials of those connected with the disturbances in Tibet in March 2008 were not compliant with international standards, and that the evidence against the individuals concerned was unsound and the convictions therefore unsafe. We have consistently expressed our concern at the need for proper due process for all those detained, and our belief that any trials should be conducted justly, fairly and transparently. The fact that independent observers were not allowed at these trials means that we have been unable to verify that the human rights of the defendants were respected, and that the trials were free from political interference. This, together with the reports from NGOs, does give us real cause for concern, as does the verdict of the death penalty, to which the UK is opposed in principle. As a consequence, and working closely with our EU counterparts, we are urging the Chinese authorities not to carry out the sentences imposed on those convicted. I made these points in similar terms in my written response to Free Tibet and the Tibet Society at the beginning of May.</p>

The long-term aim of the Contest strategy is to reduce the risk to the UK and its interests overseas from international terrorism, so that people can go about their lives freely and with confidence. All communities continue to play a role in helping to ensure the success of the strategy by rejecting violent extremism and challenging it. Strong and empowered communities are better equipped to effectively reject the ideology of violent extremism, isolate apologists for terrorism and provide support to vulnerable individuals and institutions.</p>

	<p pid="c.1160W.17/1">There is no agreement between all member states of the European Union to monitor the movements of known criminals within the EU but the UK does contribute to the Europol Information System (EIS), a database where each member state can input details of any known criminal that it wishes to share with other European States. If a person is wanted in any member state, that country can also issue a European arrest warrant which will ensure that if the person comes to the notice of the law enforcement authorities in any member state they can be arrested and returned to the country that issued the European arrest warrant. In addition, SOCA has been appointed to operate the UK Sirene Bureau which will have access to the European wide Schengen Information System. This contains details of all wanted persons throughout the European Union. It is planned that the Sirene Bureau will go live in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.1160W.17/2">The Interpol Notice system also provides a monitoring facility. Green Notices are used to provide warnings and criminal intelligence about persons who have committed criminal offences, and are likely to repeat those offences in other countries. A Green Notice is often issued by the UK for known travelling sex offenders. The Notice system is not limited to Europe and 187 states have access to it.</p>

	<p pid="c.1162W.2/2">Gamma butyrolactone (GBL) is a precursor chemical. It is not a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.</p>
	<p pid="c.1162W.2/3">The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) provided advice on the classification of GBL in its 2008 report 'GBL &amp; 1,4-BD: Assessment of Risk to the Individual and Communities in the UK'. This advice can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1162W.2/7">No advice on GBL was received from the ACMD in either 2006 or in 2009 to date.</p>
	<p pid="c.1162W.2/8">The Government will shortly be publishing a three-month public consultation which brings forward options to control GBL and its like precursor chemical, 1,4-butanediol. Consultation will look to elicit a better understanding of the scale and scope of the availability for misuse of GBL and 1,4- butanediol in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.1168W.11/1">We have previously sought to measure our ability to bring force elements from their peacetime readiness levels up to the level required to deploy on potential contingent operations at the most demanding scale of effort, known as force generation, and to deploy them on such operations, sustain them there and recover them to their home base thereafter. This system has been predicated on the assumption that, for the most part, the armed forces will be operating below the concurrency level envisaged in defence planning assumptions and that they should therefore be working to maintain their capacity to deploy on potential contingent operations. The longer we have been operating above that concurrency level, the more theoretical this has become. By definition we have consistently, over several years, been successfully generating, deploying, sustaining and recovering force elements above the long term concurrency levels assumed in our long term planning. The metrics we have been using to measure and report our hypothetical capability have consequently provided little or no meaningful management information. We are therefore working to develop a more useful way of measuring and reporting performance in this area for the time when the operational tempo has reduced and the forces structure is recuperated to the point where it is appropriate once more to seek to measure our contingent as opposed to our current capability.</p>

	<p pid="c.1174W.8/1">There has been much collaboration and co-operation between the UK shipping industry, the military and from across Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.1174W.8/2">The UK military is working alongside the shipping industry to provide safe passage of traffic in the Gulf of Aden. International naval forces are expending significant effort on counter-piracy operations, and are playing a role in protecting vulnerable shipping. For instance, the UK-commanded EU naval operation is utilising an internationally recognised transit corridor through the Gulf of Aden. All merchant shipping, including UK-registered vessels, are encouraged to use this route.</p>
	<p pid="c.1174W.8/3">Best practice guidelines have been agreed with industry bodies on speed, self-protection, and registration with the Maritime Security Centre (Horn of Africa) website. Those ships registered with the website and following best practice have been considerably more successful in evading pirate attacks.</p>
	<p pid="c.1174W.8/4">Moreover, the UK Maritime Trade Office acts as the interface between merchant shipping and the military, and has become the focal point for UK-registered vessels seeking advice and guidance.</p>

	<p pid="c.1178W.8/1">The aim of HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) Workforce Change regional review programme was to match its accommodation with its future business needs. The following table provides a list of the HMRC offices announced for closure under the regional review programme. Decisions made to close these offices remain unchanged.</p>
	<p pid="c.1178W.8/2">HMRC has however looked again at the timing of the closures of a number of these offices in the light of budgetary constraints, and has decided that the vacation of some offices will not now take place in 2009-10 as originally planned. This does not affect the strategic decision to close these buildings, which HMRC aims to complete in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="c.1178W.8/3">Where an office housing an inquiry centre closes, the inquiry centre services will be retained at or near the current location so face to face services to HMRC's customers will not be affected.</p>

	<p pid="c.1184W.2/1">Tax avoidance has the potential to damage the public finances and the provision of public services in the UK. For this reason, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) monitors tax avoidance closely at all times.</p>
	<p pid="c.1184W.2/2">Since 1997, the Government have been taking steps to tackle avoidance, by reforming the tax system, closing loopholes and introducing the disclosure regime. Anti-avoidance measures brought in as a result of the disclosure rules have closed over &pound;11 billion in avoidance opportunities. The disclosure regime ensures that should further avoidance schemes emerge, the Government can quickly take action to protect tax revenues.</p>
	<p pid="c.1184W.2/3">The Government agree that more action is still needed to mitigate the effects of tax avoidance. Budget 2009 sets out measures to close down avoidance schemes, including principles-based legislation on financial product avoidance, the successful introduction of which could facilitate this approach being applied to other areas, and work to further extend and improve the disclosure regime. These measures raise over &pound;1 billion during the period 2009-10 to 2011-12, and protect a further &pound;3 billion per year of tax receipts by 2010-11. The Government keep the need for further measures under review.</p>

The Department for International Development (DFID) has so far provided &pound;12 million for humanitarian assistance to help those who have been displaced from their homes.

	<p pid="c.1196W.2/2">The protection of wharves for river-related use is a matter for the Mayor of London and the relevant local authority, which in this case is the London borough of Newham. The London Plan contains policies to protect a number of safeguarded commercial wharves on the Thames and the Lower Lea and to require referral to the Mayor of any proposals for non river-related uses of these wharves, including housing development. The borough development plans are required to reflect the strategic policies through the inclusion of detailed development control policies. In the case of the Lower Lea, north of Prescotts Lock, there are two safeguarded wharves, Mayer Parry and Priors wharves and these are protected through the saved policies of the Newham Unitary Development Plan of 2001. Change of use of unprotected wharves would be subject to the borough's general policies and, in determining applications for housing development, it would be for the council to judge the suitability of the proposal.</p>

	<p pid="c.1213W.6/12">To date, no orders have been made under part 3 and so local authorities cannot yet access the new powers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1213W.6/13">Part 2 of the Act, which commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April 2009</phrase>, established the primary authority scheme. The scheme allows businesses, charities or other organisations that operate across more than one site, to enter into a partnership with a local authority for it to become a primary authority. As well as promoting consistency, the scheme is intended to help local authorities decide what action will be necessary and proportionate in a given circumstance to bring about a successful outcome with the minimum burden to an organisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1213W.6/14">Where the Local Better Regulation Office has registered a primary authority, any other local authority that proposes to take enforcement action against an organisation must contact the primary authority first. The primary authority can then block the proposed enforcement action if it believes that it is inconsistent with advice or guidance that it has previously given. In situations where action is urgently required to prevent harm, the Act allows local authorities to proceed immediately and inform the primary authority as soon as possible after taking the action. Under the scheme, a local authority may reclaim costs incurred while acting as a primary authority on a cost recovery basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.1214W.2/1">The UK does not have a national mandatory retirement age. The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 introduced a default retirement age of 65, which allows employers to use retirement at 65 as a tool for workforce planning. However, employers do not have to retire employees once they reach 65. They are free to continue to employ them for as long as they like, and employees are entitled to request to continue working beyond 65.</p>
	<p pid="c.1214W.2/2">As the Government clearly stated when the regulations were introduced, we are committed to undertaking an evidence based review of the default retirement age five years after its introduction. This provides sufficient time for the regulations to bed in and helps business to plan with certainty. We will be gathering the evidence needed to enable us to undertake this review in 2011. If the conclusion of the review is that the evidence demonstrates a default retirement age is no longer necessary, we will take the necessary steps to remove it.</p>

	<p pid="c.1216W.2/1">The figures requested are shown in the following table. The increase in the level of payments in 2005-06 was principally caused by one fraudulent transfer which resulted in payments of more than &pound;8.1 million. The raised level of payments in subsequent years is attributable to a range of factors&mdash;including increasing numbers of registered transactions, greater availability of credit providing more opportunities for fraudsters, increases in property values resulting in the losses from each fraud being higher, and more professional as opposed to domestic frauds. The number of frauds must be seen against the overall numbers of transactions processed in each year. For example, in 2007-08, Land Registry processed 5,638,226 applications to alter the register and there were 60 successful indemnity claims based on fraud.</p>

	<p pid="c.1217W.5/2">Ex-service personnel, including those within the criminal justice system, have access to national health service treatment and services. Prison mental health care transferred fully to primary care trusts in 2006, and all prison mental health services are now mainstreamed within the NHS. On entering custody, the reception screening tool assesses all prisoners' health concerns, including mental illness, and can refer them to mental health in-reach teams within the criminal justice system. A person whose mental illness is too severe to justify their remaining in prison can be transferred to NHS secure services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1217W.5/3">In its response to Lord Bradley's report on people with mental health problems or learning disabilities in the criminal justice system, the Government make it clear that veterans involved in the criminal justice system is an important group, and whose needs will also be taken into account as the delivery plan to address Lord Bradley's recommendations is developed.</p>

	<p pid="c.1227W.5/1">We have already introduced legislation to protect whistleblowers. The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (PIDA) gives the full protection of the law to national health service staff who blow the whistle. The Department has made it clear that every NHS trust must have in place local policies and procedures that comply with the Act. The Government expect a climate of openness and dialogue in the NHS that encourages staff to feel able to raise concerns about health care matters sensibly and responsibly without fear of victimisation. The NHS constitution published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-21">21 January 2009</phrase>, also sets out how staff should have &quot;protection from detriment in employment and the right not to be unfairly dismissed for 'whistleblowing' or reporting wrongdoing in the workplace.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.1227W.5/2">We have taken out a contract with the charity &quot;Public Concern at Work&quot; to provide a helpline that is manned by lawyers with expertise on whistleblowing law who can provide confidential advice and support to NHS staff.</p>

	<p pid="c.1235W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1235W.2/2"><i> (a)</i> This Government are fully committed to ensuring every young person has a fair chance of attending university. We are making progress with the proportion of young entrants from lower socio economic groups going to university increasing steadily, reaching almost 30 per cent. in 2007. This year we are investing &pound;89 million in the Aimhigher programme which raises the aspirations of young people to progress further and enter HE, and launched Aimhigher Associates across England with 5,500 undergraduates from state schools mentoring 21,000 learners to promote progression to HE from state schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.1235W.2/3">As part of the New Opportunities White Paper, we also announced further measures to ensure every young person from a low income background, who could benefit from going to university, is given the opportunity to do so. This includes a group of 11 research intensive universities working together to look at ways to reach out to talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="c.1235W.2/4"><i> (b)</i> Around two-thirds of new students are expected to benefit from a non-repayable maintenance grant of up to &pound;2,906 (2009/10 figure).</p>
	<p pid="c.1235W.2/5">Students are also able to take out a loan for their living costs. Student loans have a more favourable interest rate compared to commercial loans, and borrowers are not required to make repayments until they are earning over &pound;15,000 a year once they have left university.</p>
	<p pid="c.1235W.2/6">Bursaries are an extra source of non-repayable support that universities are required to provide to all students entitled to the full maintenance grant.</p>
	<p pid="c.1235W.2/7">Other help is available for students with disabilities, and for students with children or adult dependants. The access to learning fund (available through universities and colleges) provides help for students in hardship who may need extra financial support for their course and to stay in higher education.</p>

	<p pid="c.1236W.3/1">Apprenticeship frameworks typically take between one and three years to complete depending on the level and type of framework, the prior attainment and needs of the apprentice. These factors and an individual's speed of learning mean that length of time as an apprentice can vary enormously. Our primary measure of quality is the completion rate which last year was 64 per cent.; up from 37 per cent. in 2004/05.</p>
	<p pid="c.1236W.3/2">The Government are committed to rebuilding apprenticeships. Since 1997, we have witnessed a renaissance in apprenticeships from a low point of 65,000 to a record 225,000 apprenticeship starts in 2007/08.</p>

	<p pid="c.1237W.2/1">The cost of implementing the Partnership for Literacy scheme nationwide has not been estimated. However, Sir Jim Rose is taking into account the evaluation report of the programme's first two-years, which was published in February, as part of developing recommendations on the identification and teaching of children with dyslexia. We are looking forward to Sir Jim Rose publishing his recommendations in June.</p>

	<p pid="c.1242W.2/1">As we said in the Children's Plan, over 60 per cent. of head teachers are now over 50, which means that within the next decade a whole generation of head teachers will be retiring. Of the number of head teachers in post in 2009 we estimate that by 2010, 6 per cent. will have retired, by 2015 this will have risen to 38 per cent. and by 2020 it will have reached 55 per cent.<sup>(1)</sup> Dealing with the loss of their skills and experience will be a challenge but also an opportunity for innovation and reform. We have invested &pound;30 million in the National College for School Leadership's succession planning strategy which is working with schools, local authorities and faith bodies around the country to develop local solutions to find, develop and keep great head teachers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1242W.2/2" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> The estimates assume that the head teachers in post in 2009 will choose to retire at the current average age of 58 years. This estimate is therefore a predictive trend of retirement as we cannot forecast with certainty the future retirement behaviours of individuals.</p>

	<p pid="c.1242W.5/1">We asked Sir Jim Rose to review the primary curriculum in order to reduce prescription and give schools more time to teach essential knowledge and skills in greater depth. In the revised primary curriculum, it is proposed that, from 2011, schools will be required to teach children the broad chronology of major events in the UK, from ancient civilisations to present day. At least two key periods of history that were significant to the locality and the UK must be studied in depth. A consultation on these proposals will run until <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-24">24 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1242W.5/2">More specifically on support for teachers, the Training and Development Agency (TDA) has supported History initial teacher training (ITT) by providing access to specialist subject knowledge for ITT tutors and mentors. This is delivered via the History subject resource network, led by the Historical Association. In 2008 TDA also funded the Historical Association to develop subject specific online CPD opportunities. The e-CPD modules offer a package of support and a programme of professional development activity for history tutors and teachers undertaking subject development or improvement projects in their own schools.</p>

	<p pid="c.1243W.6/3">Temporary accommodation is appropriate where there is too little time to construct permanent accommodation, or where the need is likely to be short term. In such circumstances, modern, high-quality temporary buildings provide a good environment for teaching and learning. Where they are new or relocated, they are required to meet building environmental standards similar to those which apply to permanent buildings.</p>

	<p pid="c.1244W.2/1">In the year since the &pound;372 million &quot;Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives: a Cross Government Strategy for England&quot; was published there has been substantial progress. The &quot;Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives: One Year On&quot; annual report was published last month, which sets out in detail our progress to date and also the areas we need to focus on over the next year. A copy of the report is available on the DCSF and Department of Health websites.</p>
	<p pid="c.1244W.2/2">The two main sources of data on childhood obesity are the Health Survey for England (HSE) and National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP). In 2008, the HSE data showed that the estimated prevalence of overweight among 2 to 15-year-olds was 14.0 per cent. and the prevalence of obesity was 16.5 per cent. The 2007/8 NCMP results showed that in reception year 13.0 per cent. of children were overweight and 9.6 per cent. were obese and that in Year 6 14.3 per cent. of children were overweight and 18.3 per cent. were obese.</p>

	<p pid="c.1244W.5/1">The Government's strategy for addressing overweight and obesity is set out in &quot;Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives: A Cross-Government Strategy for England&quot; and in the recent progress report &quot;Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives: One Year On&quot;. The latter report sets out how we can continue our drive to combat obesity by helping people to make healthier choices, creating an environment that promotes healthy weight, providing quality services that identify, advise, refer and treat those at risk, and strengthening the delivery system. The initial focus of the strategy is on children.</p>
	<p pid="c.1244W.5/2">The most recent data from the National Child Measurement Programme for 2007/08 and from the Health Survey for England for 2007 suggests that the trend in obesity prevalence may have begun to flatten out over the last two to three years. The Cross-Government Obesity Unit provides primary care trusts and schools with annual guidance on the National Child Measurement Programme which includes information on sending the results from the programme back to parents.</p>
	<p pid="c.1244W.5/3">There is no evidence that there are large numbers of children who need special arrangements for their education on the grounds that they are obese, and the Department has not issued guidance on the specific topic of education of obese children. If school nurses or other health professionals are concerned about a child's health because of his or her apparent weight status they should take action according to standard local care pathways. However, children with health problems related to obesity may need support at school in managing these conditions, and for these pupils schools should have policies in place on the management of pupils' medicines and on supporting pupils with medical needs. The Department for Children, Schools and Families and Department of Health have published joint guidance, &quot;Managing Medicines in Schools and Early Years Settings&quot;, to help schools and their employers develop such policies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1244W.5/4">There may be a small number of children whose weight gives rise to mobility problems and who might also meet the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 definition of a disabled person. Guidance has been issued to schools and local authorities on their responsibilities under the Act: this and can be found at</p>

	<p pid="c.1248W.2/1">Between 2001 and 2009 the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) has supported a significant number of initiatives to increase both the number and quality of school based mentors in initial teacher training (ITT) and in continuing professional development. Since 2001 the number of trainee teachers has risen from 27,000 to over 36,000 this year. In order to ensure that all trainees have a well trained mentor in their placement schools the TDA has invested in significant programmes:</p>
	<p pid="c.1248W.2/2" class="indent">2002 to 2006&mdash;the National Partnership Project (over &pound;20 million over the lifetime of the project)&mdash;a wide-ranging programme of support for mentor training, including sharing of best practice; direct funding for higher education institution mentor training with schools and support for the building of regional sharing of mentors and training between ITT providers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1248W.2/3" class="indent">2006 to 2009&mdash;Partnership development schools (over &pound;6 million)&mdash;worked with over 600 schools on national priority areas focusing on mentoring on a local level.</p>
	<p pid="c.1248W.2/4" class="indent">From 2009&mdash;Beyond Partnership&mdash;the TDA is opening out a consultation process with the ITT sector to explore best use of the investment made and how further support can be developed and delivered.</p>
	<p pid="c.1248W.2/5">Evidence of Ofsted inspections and feedback from ITT providers, schools and regional field-forces indicates that this investment has had a significant impact ensuring that all trainees receive high quality training during their school experience, including the support of a well-trained mentor.</p>
	<p pid="c.1248W.2/6">In response to the recommendations made in Lord Sainsbury's report &quot;The Race to the Top&quot;, the TDA has put into place an Early Career Mentoring project for science and mathematics teachers. This project is a two-year evaluative pilot, being delivered by the Learning and Skills Network that will provide face-to-face, telephone and e-mentoring for 600 (rising to 800 in the second year) science and mathematics trainee teachers, newly qualified teachers and teachers in their second year of teaching. The programme will start in September 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.1248W.2/7">The Professional Standards for Teachers also make clear that being a coach and mentor are key aspects of teacher professional development, and this is referenced more strongly as the individual progresses up the career ladder. The Government are committed to the introduction of the Masters in Teaching and Learning programme from 2009/10, an initiative that will establish teaching as a masters-level profession. A key element of that will include the identification and training of in-school coaches.</p>

	<p pid="c.1250W.0/1">The Department's strategy on school attendance aims to reduce all forms of absence, not merely absence which schools do not authorise (which includes truancy). Our particular focus is on individual pupils who are persistent absentees, who miss 20 per cent. or more of their schooling, whether with permission or not.</p>
	<p pid="c.1250W.0/2">This year the Department is working closely through the National Strategies with 42 local authorities with high levels of persistent absence. The National Strategies are providing intensive support and challenge to minimise absence, particularly in 360 secondary schools in those authorities with high persistent absence. A further 102 local authorities with lower rates of persistent absence are receiving support to reduce persistent absence in 795 secondary schools with high levels of persistent absence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1250W.0/3">Our work on reducing absence, and persistent absence, has been successful. Overall absence rates in 2007-08 were 6.29 per cent., down from 7.41 per cent. in 1996-97, equivalent to some 70,000 more pupils in school every day.</p>
	<p pid="c.1250W.0/4">The total number of persistent absentees in 2007-08 was 233,000, down from 273,000 in 2006-07, a reduction of 14.5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.1251W.9/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1251W.9/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated May 2009:</p>
	<p pid="c.1251W.9/3" class="indent">.</p>
	<p pid="c.1251W.9/4" class="indent">Migration assumptions for national population projections are conventionally expressed in terms of net migration (immigration less emigration). The 2006-based principal (or central) projection assumed a long-term annual net inflow to the UK of +190,000 persons a year. The attached table shows the projected number of births in the UK for each year from mid-2008 to mid-2031 according to this 2006-based principal national population projection which is included for the sake of completeness.</p>
	<p pid="c.1251W.9/5" class="indent">The 2006-based 'zero migration' variant projection makes the same assumptions about future fertility and mortality as the principal projection, but assumes that immigration will equal emigration, and thus net migration will be zero, at all ages from mid-2006 to the end of the projection period. The projected numbers of births in the UK for each year from mid-2008 to mid-2031 according to this variant projection are also shown in the table.</p>
	<p pid="c.1251W.9/6" class="indent">To fully answer your question, further population projections have been produced by reducing the nominal immigration totals applied in the 2006-based principal projection, but leaving the fertility, mortality and emigration assumptions unchanged. It should be noted that, in practice, this may not be a realistic scenario: if immigration fell permanently to levels well below those experienced in recent years, it is likely that this would, in time, lead to a reduction in the level of emigration as well.</p>
