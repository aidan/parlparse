	<p pid="b.907W.3/20">The current &pound;5 note in issue (featuring Elizabeth Fry) is printed on heavier weight paper than the previous &pound;5 note design and is also the first Bank of England note to be coated with a varnish. This was done to improve the durability of the &pound;5 note, recognising that it is subject to more wear and tear than other denominations.</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.3/21">The Bank of England is continually investigating ways to improve the quality and quantity of &pound;5 notes in circulation. One option could be to introduce a &pound;5 note printed on a more durable substrate, such as polymer (a type of plastic). A number of factors need to be considered in the selection of an alternative substrate, in particular that it provides acceptable protection against current and likely future counterfeiting threats. At present, the Bank has no plans to change the substrate.</p>
	<p pid="b.907W.3/22">The Royal Mint, which is responsible for producing and issuing UK coins on behalf of HM Treasury, reviews from time to time the structure of the UK coinage. At present, there is little evidence of any significant public interest for introducing a new &pound;5 circulating coin.</p>

	<p pid="b.914W.3/2">The Department has supported photovoltaics since 2000 through the PV Field Trials Programme and also through the &pound;31 million Major Photovoltaics Demonstration Programme. These programmes have contributed to the development of the microgeneration industry in the UK, including an installer base. We plan to continue support for photovoltaics and other building scale renewables through a low carbon buildings programme, which is currently under development. This was recommended in the Renewables Innovation Review (February 2004), which looked at the viability of photovoltaics and other renewable technologies. It suggested that the environmental benefits in buildings could be maximised by developing an appropriate mix of building integrated renewables and energy efficiency. The new programme will have a budget of &pound;30 million over three years and will start in April 2006 subject to EU state aids clearance.</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.3/3">The new programme and the wider microgeneration strategy currently under development will aim to introduce further measures to help develop a sustainable market for all the buildings renewable technologies. In addition PV installations are eligible for support under the renewables obligation. The current renewables obligation review is looking to simplify the way in which small-scale generators can claim renewable obligation certificates. International reports on photovoltaics, including developments in Japan and Germany, are undertaken by the International Energy Agency, <a href="http://www.iea.org">www.iea.org</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.916W.2/4">A couple with one child, working 30 hours a week and earning an annual income of &pound;15,000 informs HMRC of a change in income that will increase their income for the 2005&ndash;06 tax year to &pound;19,500 (of which &pound;2,500 is disregarded).

	<p pid="b.916W.2/5">Before the change the family would be entitled to an annual tax credit award of &pound;2,495 or &pound;47 per week. The change in income implies that new annual tax credit entitlement is &pound;1,755 or &pound;33 per week. So, for the first 26 weeks the family has been paid &pound;370 more than they were entitled to. This amount will be deducted from tax credit payments for the remainder of the year, reducing weekly payments to &pound;19.</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.2/6">If in-year recovery was suspended, then the family would be paid their entitlement for the rest of the year. Given their new income, this would be &pound;33 per week.</p>

A simple one- page leaflet on biosecurity and surveillance for smaller concerns and back yard keepers has also been produced and is being distributed widely including to all veterinary practices and placed in trade and specialist press targeting the same audience. All this information is available on my Department's website.</p>

	<p pid="b.921W.2/1">Licences for quarantine premises do not specify the maximum capacity of the centre or facility. This is due to the fact that the capacity of a quarantine premises will vary depending on the type and size of the birds and the behavioural characteristics of different species. Certain species enjoy 'clumping' in dense groups, whereas other species are uncomfortable in close proximity to each other. Judgments about the welfare of the birds in quarantine will be a matter for clinical and professional veterinary judgment.</p>

	<p pid="b.925W.5/106"><sup>(11)</sup> In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. When testing resumed in 2002, resources were concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds tested immediately after the FMD outbreak was greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, data for 2001 and 2002 are not comparable with other years.</p>

These ensure import conditions are met and that the products remain in a satisfactory condition during transport.</p>

	<p pid="b.934W.2/3">It should be noted that while this was the formal number of REIAs notified to the Home Office, which monitors this area of work across Government, it is not possible to give a precise number. In Defra, multiple assessments have been carried out in a single policy area with the results being published under a single heading. Defra's Diversity Strategy is seeking to embed diversity into the business ensuring that impact assessments are intrinsic to business management, therefore, in some areas the impact assessment process is so embedded that they are not recorded separately. Therefore the numbers provided are lower than actually took place.</p>

We have asked the Countryside Agency, working together with its Natural England confederation partners English Nature and the Rural Development Service, to undertake research and analysis to identify possible options to improve access to the coast. One of the options to be investigated will include possible improvements to the rights of way network using existing rights of way legislation.</p>

They will report on their findings in 2006 in advance of a public consultation document which we aim to issue in October 2006. At that stage I will be in a better position to estimate the extent to which public rights of way would need to increase, if that was the option chosen as the best way to improve access to the coast.</p>

	<p pid="b.937W.2/1">Many schools already provide a good range of after school clubs on their premises.

	<p pid="b.937W.2/2">The Government want all schools to provide access to extended services, including child care, a varied menu of study support, and before and after school clubs, by 2010, with half of all primaries and a third of all secondaries doing so by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.937W.2/3">To support schools in setting up and embedding extended services, we have committed &pound;840 million up to 2008. These funds can be used flexibly to help address any practical issues that schools may be facing to develop extended services.</p>
	<p pid="b.937W.2/4">We have also asked the National Remodelling Team (NRT) within the Teacher Development Agency, working with voluntary sector partners such as Continyou and 4Children to support LAs and schools nationally as they implement extended services.</p>

	<p pid="b.938W.0/2">It is for local authorities to decide how to deploy the funds available to them to meet the needs of children with special educational needs (SEN), including those children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs). Budgeted expenditure by local authorities on meeting children's SEN in 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;4.1 billion, some 13 per cent. of all education spending. In 2004 the Department published guidance &quot;The management of SEN expenditure&quot; providing information and suggested approaches to managing this expenditure. In 2002 the Department, with the Department of Health, published Good Practice Guidance on ASDs which gave pointers to good practice, including pointers on funding and home-based provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.938W.0/3">Local authorities have a duty to keep their arrangements for special educational provision under review and it is for them to take decisions about SEN provision in their schools, in consultation with the schools including special schools, and fund that provision appropriately. Funding for individual pupils with autism in special schools is through their SEN statements, which set out their needs and the provision required to meet those needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.944W.2/1">This Government wants all schools to provide access to a core offer of extended services by 2010, with half of all primary and a third of all secondary schools doing so by 2008. We want to see at least 2,500 schools providing access to the core offer by September 2006. The core offer, which should be available to all parents and pupils of the school, comprises: high quality childcare; a varied menu of study support activities; parenting support programmes; swift and easy referral to a wide range of specialised support services; and wider community access. It will be for individual local authorities, in discussion with all schools in their area, to take a strategic approach to developing access to the core offer through schools. This will include determining how many primary and secondary schools develop access to the core offer in each year. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-29">29 September 2005</phrase> my Department published its report on the baseline survey of extended services in schools which it commissioned earlier in the year. The survey showed that nationally the vast majority of schools were providing access to some form of extended activity. The survey did not provide figures at local authority level.</p>

	<p pid="b.944W.8/1">Our 14&ndash;19 and Skills White Papers clearly articulate our priorities for post-14 education and training. Higher participation among young people must have the highest priority, alongside helping disadvantaged adults gain basic and Level 2 skills for employability and progression to Level 3. Starting from these strategic objectives we have reviewed the SR2004 settlement announced in April 2004 and we have agreed a funding strategy with the LSC for the next two years that is driven by policy priorities and the successes of the sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.944W.8/2">On the <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October</phrase>, I made an announcement, setting out the Government's strategic direction for the learning and skills sector for the coming period. My main purpose for doing so was to ensure the 2006/07 funding allocations process began with a clear and concise message on the principles that will underpin funding over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.944W.8/3">In addition, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) published 'Priorities for Success'-a document that sets out the funding strategy for the next two years in more detail. This document is available on the LSC's website.</p>
	<p pid="b.944W.8/4">Although more funding will be going into the sector, we will focus funding even more strongly on key priorities of raising participation and achievement 14&ndash;19 and driving down the skills deficit in the adult workforce. This will mean that less provision outside these priority areas can be supported at previous levels, and that there has to be a new balance of responsibilities between government, employers and learners to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="b.944W.8/5">We confirmed our overall funding to the LSC for 2006&ndash;07 in our grant letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-30">30 October 2005</phrase> and the LSC published its annual statement of priorities in November. The LSC as part of its business cycle conducts an annual stock-take of learning and skills in England and at regional level, working with Regional Skills Partnerships, identifies regional skills needs. Building on this national and regional activity, local LSC teams analyse anticipated demand and prepare local plans which are then reviewed at regional and national level before budgets are confirmed.</p>
	<p pid="b.944W.8/6">These processes ensure that within our available funding we address the needs of learners, employers and partners in a framework that meets our strategic objectives.</p>

	<p pid="b.946W.5/1">Universities are autonomous and responsible for determining their own academic and administrative affairs, including deciding what to pay their own staff. Pay and conditions of service are subject to negotiations between employers, their staff and their representative trade union bodies. The Government play no part in this.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.5/2">There are many reasons underlying our higher education reforms, of which the variable fees policy forms a part: one is to provide institutions with a secure income stream, which is under their own control. The Government are not in the business of micro-managing how institutions' fee income is spent; institutions are best placed to make these decisions&mdash;including, for example, how much to put into student bursaries, to enable more students to participate in HE, and how much to put into staff pay and conditions. They will also want to consider how best to invest in their infrastructure to meet the needs of today's and tomorrow's learners. Only institutions can sensibly decide on the balance between different priorities, in the light of their individual circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.950W.6/16">The hon. Member may wish to know that I am today publishing my response to the fifteenth report of the School Teachers' Review Body (STRB). Copies are available in the Vote Office and in the Library of the House of Lords and at <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk">http://www.teachernet.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/17">In making its recommendations, the STRB was required to have regard to the matters set out in the remit letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-10">10 March 2005</phrase>, which included, among other matters, the need to have regard to the enhancement of recruitment and retention. The fifteenth STRB report deals with some very important matters affecting teachers' pay, including the pay award from 2006&ndash;08, and I am most grateful for the careful and detailed attention the STRB has given to these matters. The STRB recommendations are set out followed in each case by my response.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/18">I am seeking consultation comments on the report and my response by <phrase class="date" code="">10 January 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/19" class="italic">Pay Award</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/20">The STRB has recommended the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/21">We recommend:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/22" class="indent">an increase of 2.5 per cent. from September 2006 and a further increase of 2.5 per cent. from September 2007 in the values of the leadership group pay scale;</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/23" class="indent">an increase of 2.5 per cent. from September 2006 and a further increase of 2.5 per cent. from September 2007 in the values of the main pay scale and upper pay scale for qualified teachers, the pay scale for unqualified teachers and the new 18 point pay scale for Advanced Skills Teachers;</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/24" class="indent">a slightly enhanced pay increase for certain points on the main pay scale in bands A and B, as outlined in Appendix C; and</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/25" class="indent">that should the average rate of headline inflation for the 12 months preceding April 2007 (i.e. April 2006 to March 2007) or April 2008 (i.e. April 2007 to March 2008) fall below 1.75 per cent. or exceed 3.25 per cent., any of the consultees can ask the STRB to consider the case for seeking a remit from the Secretary of State of State to review teachers' pay.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/26">This is a central recommendation, which is key in terms of recruitment to and retention in the teaching profession as well as its impact on schools' budgets. It is of crucial importance that the significant investment this Government has made in public sector pay in general and in the pay of teachers in particular continues to produce dividends. We must be confident that any further increases can be justified and afforded.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/27">An award of 2.5 per cent. could not be considered acceptable on the basis that it represented anticipated inflation over the period to which the pay award relates, or that an award at this level is necessary to protect teachers from a real terms pay cut. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank of England forecasts CPI inflation to fall to just below the 2 per cent. target next year and then to be close to the 2 per cent. target in subsequent years.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/28">However, it is clear from the report that the STRB has given close consideration to a range of evidence relating to the overall labour market position of teachers and has reached a balanced judgment as to a suitable level of award for the next period, taking into account both appropriateness and affordability. In particular, the STRB has noted its concerns about the need to ensure a continuing supply of high quality teachers, consolidating the improvements made in recruiting and retaining good teachers at a time of change, and some emerging evidence of recruitment and retention issues in relation to specific groups of teachers.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/29">In the light of this analysis, I propose to accept the recommendation for teachers, including the slightly enhanced increase for teachers at certain points on the main scale in Inner and Outer London. I also accept the STRB's argument regarding leadership group pay and agree that the same rise for this group is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/30">I also accept the basis of the review mechanism as set out above.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/31" class="italic">Leadership Group</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/32">The STRB has recommended the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/33">We recommend:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/34" class="indent">that the Secretary of State remit us to look fundamentally at the leadership group and how its changing role and responsibilities should be reflected in its future pay structure;</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/35" class="indent">to provide a sound evidence base for that remit, that a comprehensive independent study be carried out by December 2006 on the roles, responsibilities, structures and reward systems for the leadership group, looking at both current practice and likely future developments, and including at least the following issues:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/36" class="indent">new models of headship;</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/37" class="indent">the role and functions of deputy and assistant heads;</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/38" class="indent">administrative support;</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/39" class="indent">recruitment planning;</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/40" class="indent">type of contract; and</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/41" class="indent">reward.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/42">I very much welcome the STRB's recommendation for an independent study into the developing roles and responsibilities of the leadership group. This is very timely given the need for schools to respond effectively to Government priorities in England such as greater personalisation, extended schools, Every Child Matters and the 14 to 19 agenda, and to initiatives in these and other areas in Wales. Schools will need to become more outward facing, more flexible and, as we have set out in the Schools White Paper for England, work far more collaboratively with others, including parents, if we are to make the next step change in raising attainment and opening opportunities. I want to make sure that we can support our leadership teams effectively and have the right people in place to take forward these changes. For this reason I will wish to explore with partners the extent to which the terms of reference for such a review should not only encompass but also go further than those outlined by the STRB. I will also wish to consider the arrangements for handling the review, including whether the proposed timetable is appropriate, or whether it should be run in parallel with a general review of teachers' duties.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/43" class="italic">Excellent Teacher Scheme (ETS)</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/44">The STRB has recommended the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/45">We recommend that:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/46" class="indent">the Excellent Teacher Scheme be reviewed by December 2008 at the latest and that the results of the review be remitted to this Review Body for appropriate consideration and recommendation;</p>

	<p pid="b.950W.6/50" class="indent">the minimum and maximum of the ETS salary range and ETS spot salaries determined prior to September 2007 be increased by 2.5 per cent. in September 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/51">The remit to the STRB invited it to make recommendations on what the appropriate spot salary for Excellent Teachers should be in the respective pay regions, following the recommendations in its Fourteenth Report. I am grateful to the STRB for its advice.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/52">The Excellent Teacher Scheme is a welcome career pathway for teachers who are excellent classroom practitioners and is an important addition to the teacher's career structure, to which I remain committed. The STRB has suggested that the Excellent Teacher scheme should be reviewed by December 2008.1 believe it would be helpful to keep the scheme under review but that it would be most helpful to do so in the context of our wider plans for a new teacher professionalism and the development of the career structure of the profession as a whole. I will give further thought to the arrangements and timing.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/53">The STRB has made a number of recommendations about the salary for Excellent Teachers. The first Excellent Teachers will be appointed from September 2006 and schools are already considering whether to include Excellent Teacher posts in their staffing structures and how many Excellent Teacher posts they need. It is important that schools have a clear understanding about the potential salary implications of Excellent Teacher posts so they can plan effectively; that the arrangements for determining Excellent Teacher salaries are unambiguous and can be implemented effectively; and that the approach to Excellent Teacher salaries is consistent with our approach to teachers' pay more generally.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/54">In the light of these considerations, I propose to defer introduction of the salary ranges proposed by the STRB until September 2008. I propose that in the interim there should be a single salary rate for each pay region for those holding excellent teacher posts. The level of these salaries should be those proposed by the STRB in its Fourteenth Report, increased in line with the general increases to teachers' pay scales. I believe that this approach will give schools the early clarity they will need to help with the introduction of ETS posts. It will also allow us the opportunity to develop the guidance they will need to help introduce the greater flexibility which the STRB proposes&mdash;and which in principle I welcome&mdash;in the light of our ongoing review of the operation of the scheme and of further work to be done on standards and duties for the profession as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/55" class="italic">Teaching and Learning Responsibility (TLR) Payments</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/56">The STRB has recommended the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/57">We recommend:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/58" class="indent">an increase of 2.5 per cent. from September 2006 and a further increase of 2.5 per cent. from September 2007 in the minimum and maximum of the two TLR ranges;</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/59" class="indent">an increase of 2.5 per cent. from September 2006 and a further increase of 2.5 per cent. from September 2007 in the value of individual teachers' TLR payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/60">I welcome these recommendations, which will enable all those receiving TLRs over this period, at whatever level in the relevant ranges those TLRs have been set locally, to receive the same percentage uplift.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/61" class="italic">Special Educational Needs (SEN) Allowances</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/62">The STRB has recommended the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/63">We recommend:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/64" class="indent">an increase of 2.5 per cent. from September 2006 and a further increase of 2.5 per cent. from September 2007 in the value of SEN allowances;</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/65" class="indent">that the Department draw up guidance, in consultation with all interested parties, including BATOD, on how the payment of higher-level SEN allowances might take account of the enhancement of the teaching of SEN pupils brought about by specialist qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/66">I welcome the recommended application of the same percentage uplift to SEN allowances as to the other parts of the pay system. I note that the STRB has repeated its recommendation about guidance on specialist qualifications, which was made in 2004 and which was put on hold pending the review of the management allowance system. I am content that this matter should now be discussed with relevant parties.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/67" class="italic">Unattached Teachers</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/68">We recommend that:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/69" class="indent">the Department investigate the pay and conditions of unattached teachers (including such teachers in the leadership group) in comparison with other teachers. The investigation should be completed in time to inform our next review of teachers' pay.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/70">The STRB has taken the view that that the pay and conditions of unattached teachers need investigation, because of concerns that unattached teachers do not progress as quickly as other teachers. I recognise this concern and agree that an investigation would be helpful. I propose therefore to arrange such an investigation in the course of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/71" class="italic">Part Time Teachers</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/72">The STRB has recommended the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/73">We recommend that:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/74" class="indent">the Department undertake further work in association with interested parties to consider the issues in standardising pay and conditions for part time teachers and identify possible solutions;</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/75" class="indent">the conclusions of this work come back to this Review Body for consideration and recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/76">I welcome the STRB's consideration of the issues facing part time teachers; and note its recommendation that further work should be undertaken on this. I will want to consider, with partners, the most effective way of undertaking this work.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/77" class="italic">Teachers' Professional Development and Pay Progression</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/78">The STRB has recommended the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/79">We recommend that:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/80" class="indent">the outcomes of teachers' CPD and, if appropriate, their contribution to others' development, be taken into account as part of a range of evidence when schools assess performance for pay progression purposes; and</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/81" class="indent">the Department require schools and services to include details in their pay policy about how performance is assessed for pay purposes and how different factors, including the outcomes of CPD and contribution to others' development, are taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/82">I welcome the STRB's recommendation that the outcomes of teachers' CPD should be taken into account as part of a range of evidence when schools assess performance for pay progression purposes. I want all teachers to be engaged in effective, sustained and relevant professional development throughout their careers. CPD should not be a &quot;bolt-on&quot;, short-term experience or narrowly defined as &quot;going on courses&quot; but a continuous planned series of activities designed to improved a teacher's knowledge and skills. Some of the most effective professional development is teachers learning from other teachers in the classroom and I want all teachers to be able to benefit from and contribute to coaching and mentoring as they progress in their careers as part of their professional development. I believe the approach recommended by the STRB will help to incentivise, recognise and reward teachers' participation in effective CPD and help to ensure that the professional development activities are planned and evaluated in schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/83">It is important that the arrangements for reflecting assessments of performance in decisions about pay are fair and transparent and can operate effectively at school level without being onerous. I strongly agree that details about how schools and services will assess performance for pay purposes should be included in their pay policy, though I have reservations about introducing a requirement. I will therefore want to give further thought to how best to support this, and invite further views.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/84" class="italic">Teachers' Professional Responsibilities</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/85">The STRB has recommended the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/86">We recommend that:</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/87" class="indent">consultees consider the fundamental question of whether a description of teachers' professional role and responsibilities is needed (specifically whether it is needed in the STPCD), and present us with their written evidence and views by the end of August 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/88">I am grateful to the STRB for its advice. I accept the STRB's recommendation that consultees should consider the fundamental question of whether a description of teachers' professional role and responsibilities is needed. The current approach of describing professional duties in the STPCD is intended to provide a national framework for local decision-making and to help to clarify the range of responsibilities that are appropriate to different roles. I invite comments on whether it is appropriate to move away from the current approach of describing professional duties in the STPCD at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/89">I also believe that there is a need to review the description of teachers' professional duties provided in the STPCD to reflect the recent changes in school and the role of the profession in the 21st century and that further thought should be given to this. I intend to discuss how this can be taken forward with partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/90" class="italic">Pay of Advanced Skills Teachers in Mathematics and Science in Secondary Schools</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/91">I note that the STRB has not made any recommendation in relation to the remit request that they consider if any changes should be made to the pay of mathematics and science ASTs in secondary schools. However, in noting this I maintain that there are very strong reasons for continuing to pursue the objective behind the remit which was to raise both the quantity and the quality of graduates in these subjects entering and remaining in the teaching profession. Also, I would not wish this to constrain the use of such a focused approach to the determination of pay in the future in appropriate circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/92" class="italic">Pay arrangements for Fast Track teachers</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/93">I note that the STRB has not made any recommendation in relation to the remit request to recommend whether any modifications are required to the pay arrangements of Fast Track teachers. I agree with the suggestion that we continue to encourage Fast Track teachers to undertake at least one post in a challenging school, but how to recognise the leadership impact of Fast Track teachers, and the way in which this can help to raise standards in our schools, remains an important objective for us.</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/94" class="italic">Pay of Teachers in Challenging Schools</p>
	<p pid="b.950W.6/95">Finally, I note that the STRB has not made any recommendation in relation to the remit request that they consider other factors which should be taken into account in determining career and pay progression, specifically accelerated pay progression for teachers working in more challenging circumstances. The STRB highlighted the need for schools to make greater use of the flexibilities already in the pay system. This matter remains a significant concern and I will want to consider whether more can be done to raise awareness of the flexibilities provided by the current provisions and how they could be applied in this context.</p>

Between April and November 2005, two full and one partial race impact assessments were completed. No changes in policy occurred as a result of the assessments. In order to assist staff in carrying out these assessments, the Equality and Diversity Unit (EDU) ran a series of 32 workshops, which were attended by several hundred staff members.

The contract's aim is both to conduct race equality impact assessments, and to build capacity in ODPM officials to carry them out subsequently.</p>

	<p pid="b.983W.0/1">The quick wins targets were introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-01">1 November 2003</phrase> by the inter-departmental Sustainable Procurement Group. From this date all government departments' contracts were expected to apply the minimum environmental standards when purchasing certain types of product and services including paper.</p>
	<p pid="b.983W.0/2">It has been recommended that the purchase of recycled paper products is phased in over a period of time and targets will be developed as part of the &quot;Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate&quot;. The Home Office will work with its current suppliers in order to meet these targets. The department's current three-year stationery contract to supply paper and paper products as well as other stationery products was awarded prior to <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-01">1 November</phrase>, in September 2003. This followed a competitive tender exercise in line with Home Office policy that the procurement of goods and services is based on value for money principles. The provision of recycled paper is part of the agreed contract with Office depot.</p>
	<p pid="b.983W.0/3">In June 2002 the Home Office mandated all offices within the Department to use A4 recycled paper which has an 80 per cent. unspecified recycled paper content in photocopiers, fax machines and printers, unless technical reasons precluded them from using this paper. The Prison Service mandated the use of the same A4 recycled paper from September 2003 and following successful trials are also procuring only A3 recycled paper.</p>
	<p pid="b.983W.0/4">The Home Office makes use of various stocks of paper/board in our publications. Most of our internal facing material is printed on recycled paper and all of these are at least 60 per cent. recycled with a content of 75 per cent. post-consumer waste. The majority of our external facing work is printed on totally chlorine free paper/board. Although this is not made from recycled pulp, this is 'environmentally friendly' because the pulp is bleached without the use of chlorine chemicals.</p>

	<p pid="b.992W.2/1">These re-offending rates are not available. The following table shows reconviction rates, a commonly used proxy for re-offending rates, for juveniles released from custody. Local authority secure children's homes and secure training centres are included in the reconviction rate, but these cannot be distinguished from other juvenile custodial disposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.992W.2/2">Owing to the administrative costs of matching criminal histories, the results shown relate to the reconvictions for samples of offenders, those juveniles discharged in the first three months of the year. Reconviction rates should be used with caution as a number of different factors can influence them. Reconviction rates can be adjusted to take account of the changing characteristics of offenders and these adjusted rates are published annually on the Home Office's website (<a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/index.htm">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/index.htm</a>). The most recent adjusted figures for the 2003 cohort show a reduction in reoffending of 2.4 per cent. against the 2000 baseline.</p>

	<p pid="b.998W.2/2">The increase from 2004 is a reflection of the change to the RIA process whereby we now complete RIAs in relation to the public sector as well as the private, voluntary and charitable sectors. In preparing RIAs, we follow the Better Regulation Executive (Cabinet Office) guidance in assessing costs and benefits and the economic, social, and environmental impacts of the proposal. RIA requirements have developed over the years since its introduction in 1998 but now also cover a wider range of issues including competition and impact on small firms. This information is recorded in the individual RIAs and generally includes comments on the consultation process, both formal and informal. We also routinely consult publicly on our proposals, with an accompanying Partial RIA, and publish a summary of the views received and our response. The 65 individual RIAs are listed in a regular Command Paper House prepared by Cabinet Office and laid before the House.

	<p pid="b.1004W.8/3">Contracts should set out key performance measures via, for example, 'Service Level Agreements', which specify the deliverables and timescales to be met by the consultant. In the event of these targets not being met contracts may provide for the payment of liquidated damages by the contractor. This will be agreed on a case by case basis.</p>

In return for this commitment, the countries undertook to meet the political and economic requirements, including regional co-operation, that are set for all aspirants. The Government fully support the commitment made at Thessaloniki towards Albania, and hopes that Albania will take steps to meet the necessary conditions.</p>

The UK and the broader international community have focused efforts in Darfur on responding to the humanitarian needs there; until there is a political resolution to the conflict it is unlikely that significant development work will take place in Darfur. However, we welcome recent efforts by the UN to look at how peace would be consolidated in Darfur through a range of political, humanitarian, recovery and reconstruction work, after a peace agreement.</p>

	<p pid="b.1042W.9/1">DFID's public service agreement (PSA) target 2 for the 2005&ndash;08 PSA seeks 'Progress towards the MDGs in nine key countries in Asia'. Detailed progress is measured against five indicators and the PSA Technical Note sets out the various sources of data which underpin these indicators. It can be seen that the information required is drawn from authoritative international data series. Despite every effort to secure accurate data for all PSA focus countries, DFID recognises that there are limitations to the data available for reviewing progress. A detailed note on methodology and data issues is found as an annex to DFID's 2004 Autumn Performance Report (APR) and a similar annex is included within our 2005 APR, which will be published shortly. DFID is at the forefront of the international effort to improve the availability and quality of data for measuring progress towards the MDGs and some of the work we are doing in this area is also mentioned in our APR annex.</p>
	<p pid="b.1042W.9/2">I am pleased to note that the National Audit Office (NAO) is confident that the systems we use to measure progress against this target are sufficiently robust and well explained that they have been awarded a 'green' traffic light in their recent assessment. We are currently looking at comments from a useful report by the Statistics Commission which also looked at the targets used for measuring PSA progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.1043W.2/1">In both the 2003&ndash;06 and 2005&ndash;08 public sector agreements (PSAs), DFID has targets seeking progress towards the millennium development goals (MDGs) in countries in Africa and Asia. For the 2003&ndash;06 PSA baseline positions were set out, however over time, the baselines were revised due to new data becoming available and ongoing work within the international statistical organisations who provide the data we use. In response to this, for the 2005&ndash;08 PSA DFID has not published baseline figures, but rather has set percentage point changes, or directions of travel sought and will make an assessment of progress during the PSA focus period, based on the difference between the prevalence figure for the baseline year (in many cases 2000) given when the assessment is made, and the latest data available. This is explained in the Technical Note which accompanies our PSA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1043W.2/2">The Joint United Nations Programme of HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), is the United Nations body which provides statistical data to measure progress in the area of HIV/AIDS and difficulties with these data are set out in DFID's PSA Technical Note. At the time the Technical Note was written, new data on HIV/AIDS were anticipated. These figures were supplied in 2004 and used in DFID's 2004 Autumn Performance Report. This stated that the average HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women aged 15&ndash;24 years, in the 11 African countries for which data were available, was 14 per cent., although prevalence rates range from 4 per cent. in Ghana to more than 28 per cent. in Lesotho. Most data in this assessment dated from 2003 and it is likely that this will represent the best baseline position for monitoring against the 2005&ndash;08 PSA. However DFID will continue to monitor methodological work in this area and seek the inclusion of data for the five PSA countries that were not included in the assessment made in 2004.</p>

	<p pid="b.1045W.0/1">Immediately after the events in Andijan in May 2005, DFID suspended, and subsequently terminated, its support to a poverty statistics project being implemented jointly with the World Bank, which involved close co-operation with the central Government. DFID has since decided to end its bilateral programme with effect from March 2006 when our remaining bilateral project-working with the United Nations Development Programme and local government on a cross-border sustainable livelihoods programme with Tajikistan-comes to an end. Given the policies of the Uzbek government the potential impact on poverty reduction of our small bilateral programme is very limited.</p>

	<p pid="b.1047W.6/4">The new child support scheme is more straightforward, the amount of a disability benefit or allowance is ignored in the calculation of a non-resident parent's income.

	<p pid="b.1049W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the performance of the Customer Management System (CMS) for Jobcentre Plus benefit claims. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.0/4" class="indent">Since 2003 Jobcentre Plus has been introducing a new process for taking claims for benefit, supported by CMS. Information to support claims for benefit is gathered from customers through Contact Centres and recorded in CMS, before being transferred, electronically for Income Support and Jobseekers Allowance, to benefit processing IT systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.0/5" class="indent">When the system was first introduced, we experienced some difficulties with system performance and reliability. Following a series of &quot;performance releases&quot; designed to tackle these problems, the computer system now performs to agreed service levels. Since February 2005, there has only been one occasion where a CMS failure has affected all offices and made it necessary to invoke business continuity procedures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.0/6" class="indent">We have, however, experienced some difficulties in call handling in some of our Contact Centres. Some of our customers have found it difficult to get through on the telephone, and we have had to introduce clerical contingency procedures in a number of sites in order to maintain customer service. This has not been caused by any failure on the part of the computer system itself, but relates to the administrative processes that have been introduced alongside the new computer system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.0/7" class="indent">Since introducing a number of temporary adjustments to these processes and taking urgent measures to recruit and train staff, there have been encouraging signs of recovery in our call handling. We are keeping the position under review on a site-by-site basis and each site has a plan for returning to the full process, supported by CMS, as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.0/8" class="indent">I hope this reply has been helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.1049W.3/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-05">5 December 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.3/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning how many CMS2 contact centres have been unable to process cases on CMS2 in each of the last 24 months and the average time taken to start payments from CMS2 contact centres and nationally. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.3/4" class="indent">In answering the first part of your question, there are two circumstances where claims would not be processed through CMS:</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.3/5" class="indent">1. in the event of a full CMS failure, contingency processes to issue clerical claim forms would be invoked. Information on this has only been recorded from February 2005. There has only been one single day instance between February 2005 and October 2005 where this affected all contact centres; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.3/6" class="indent">2. when a business decision is taken to ensure that customer service is maintained; for example, a decision to introduce temporary process adjustments. Across all 22 CMS contact centres this happened in:</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.3/7" class="indent">August 2005 in 3 contact centres;</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.3/8" class="indent">September 2005 in 5 contact centres; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.3/9" class="indent">October 2005 in 9 contact centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.3/10" class="indent">Turning to the second part of your question about the average time to start payments from CMS2 contact centres and nationally, Jobcentre Plus keeps statistics about the number of claims cleared and how long it takes. The statistics only show where the claim was processed, not where it originated so it is not possible to differentiate between claims that have been initiated through CMS2 enabled contact centres and existing service outlets. This means we cannot provide the specific information you have requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.3/11" class="indent">I can say, however, that in September, Income Support claims were cleared in an average of 10.8 days against a standard of 12 days, Incapacity Benefit claims were cleared in an average of 15.2 days against a standard of 17 days and Jobseeker's Allowance claims were cleared in an average of 13.5 days against a standard of 12 days.</p>

	<p pid="b.1070W.2/2">At its core the policy is about promoting sharing over separation. Its aim is to establish over time a normal, civic society, in which all individuals are considered as equals, where differences are resolved through dialogue in the public sphere, and where all people are treated impartially.</p>

	<p pid="b.1079W.5/1">The chief executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Lady in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="b.1079W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Malcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-05">5 December 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1079W.5/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding what assessment he has made of the impact of the reduced funding to the Department for Regional Development Roads Service on the completion of Northern Ireland's Regional Transport Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1079W.5/4" class="indent">I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1079W.5/5" class="indent">In terms of the capital budget, I can advise that by the mid-way point on the Regional Transportation Strategy (RTS) ten-year strategy period i.e. in 2006&ndash;7, investment on strategic improvements, local transport and safety measures, minor network development schemes, bridge strengthening, street lighting, etc. will have reached approximately 50% of the total envisaged in the RTS. Thus I can reassure you that the overall capital investment in the road network is in line with the increased level of investment that the RTS proposed for initiatives to address the bottlenecks and upgrade the key transport corridors in the network. Indeed, the investment plans outlined in the Draft Investment Strategy for Northern Ireland (ISNI) embodies proposals which would take capital spending to levels beyond those of the RTS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1079W.5/6" class="indent">From the maintenance point of view, while average expenditure increased substantially following approval of the RTS, the scope to allocate resources is constrained by the amounts that can be made available from new sources or by reallocating funds from other areas. In order to help create scope to release resources for other priorities, including Health and Education, Ministers have agreed to reduce the amounts in the Draft Budget allocations from those previously allocated for roads. This will result in maintenance levels, which, although above those prior to the RTS, will be short of the total levels envisaged by the RTS. Nevertheless, it is important to note that in the last three years (2003/04&ndash;2005/06), over &pound;220 million has been allocated to this structural maintenance of roads and when assessing maintenance investment it is important to consider this figure over the full cycle.</p>
	<p pid="b.1079W.5/7" class="indent">I assure you that Roads Service will continue to make the best use of resources available taking proper account of both safety issues and the need to achieve value for money.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-12-05b.34445.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-12-05b.1080W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1530" speakername="David Hanson" colnum="1080W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051205/text/51205w47.htm#51205w47.html_spnew5">
	<p pid="b.1080W.2/1">There are a number of measures in place to protect the elderly from the effects of severe winter weather. The warm homes scheme offers a range of heating and insulation measures to make homes more energy efficient and help save on fuel bills. Since it began in 2001, the warm homes scheme has assisted over 25,000 vulnerable households in the private sector and continues to make a major contribution towards improving the quality of life of those in fuel poverty. To strengthen our commitment to warm homes, funding for the scheme has increased from just under &pound;3 million in 2001 to just under &pound;15 million in the current financial year and despite the many pressures on public funding the target of 8,250 participants each year continues to be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="b.1080W.2/2">Those who live in public sector homes are also supported by the Housing Executive's maintenance and improvements programmes which include measures to address fuel poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1080W.2/3">Winter fuel payments are available to people aged 60 or over who are ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland. These payments of &pound;200 are paid to all eligible households. Households which include people aged 80 or over can receive an extra payment of &pound;100. During the winter 2004/05, 230,553 households in Northern Ireland benefited from winter fuel payments amounting to &pound;49.7 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1080W.2/4">In addition cold weather payments provide extra help towards heating costs for the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society, including pensioners receiving pension credit, in periods of exceptionally cold weather.</p>
	<p pid="b.1080W.2/5">The cold weather payment is made automatically to people awarded pension credit when the average temperature is recorded as, or forecast to be, 0 degrees Celsius or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the customer's postcode. Savings are not taken into account and Cold Weather Payments are paid in addition to winter fuel payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1080W.2/6">This year the Government are also making Age-Related Payments to help pensioners with their rates bills or other living expenses. People aged 65 or over and not in receipt of the guarantee credit element of pension credit, could receive &pound;200 per household to help with rates bills. Pensioners are free to use it towards heating costs. People aged 70 or over and in receipt of the guarantee credit element of pension credit could receive 50 to help with their living expenses such as heating bills. Age-Related Payments will be paid together with winter fuel payments.</p>
