	<p pid=".722W.16/1">The UK is committed to measures aimed at helping poor countries to develop their economies and take a more active part in international trade. To this end, we are considering the special and differential treatment and development box proposals made by certain, so called &quot;like-minded&quot; developing countries in the WTO's Agriculture Committee. These proposals contain some interesting elements, including developing countries reducing tariffs more slowly, extension of the safeguard mechanism and maintaining the flexibilities for developing countries agreed in the Uruguay Round. We will actively consider these ideas in the context of the agriculture negotiations.</p>

	<p pid=".725W.3/1">It is clear that drought has played a large part in the failure of the maize harvest this year. However, the Government of Zimbabwe's policy failures in mishandling food markets; agricultural prices; the exchange rate; and the chaotic land reform programme have also been much to blame, and continue to make matters worse. While it is not possible to attribute between causes with any accuracy, the UNDP estimate that maize production may have been 30 to 60 per cent. affected by land reform alone. The expected drop of at least 60 per cent. in wheat planting this season is almost entirely attributable to disruption of commercial farming activities and state control of prices and markets.</p>

	<p pid=".727W.2/1">My Department has allocated more than &pound;11 million for work in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2002&ndash;03. Much of this is to meet urgent humanitarian needs and we expect to make contributions to ICRC and UN appeals. Other sums have been designated for support to different aspects of the Peace Process, including supporting the World bank regional demobilisation programme, and grassroots peace-building initiatives. Expenditure to meet humanitarian need and aspects of the peace process is incurred at very short notice and it is not possible to list projects in advance.</p>

	<p pid=".728W.9/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-02">2 May 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".728W.9/2">Sections 35 and 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provide that the Law Officers may refer sentences passed in the Crown Court for a limited range of serious offences to the Court of Appeal for review if it appears to the Law Officer that the sentence passed is unduly lenient. The Law Officers must give notice to the Registrar of Criminal Appeals of an application for leave to refer within 28 days from the day on which the sentence was passed. This time limit is fixed by statute and cannot be extended.</p>
	<p pid=".728W.9/3">It is most often the relevant prosecuting authority, such as the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the Serious Fraud Office, etc., that gives consideration as to whether the sentence passed in a particular case is so lenient that the matter should be brought to the attention of the Law Officers, for consideration of a referral to the Court of Appeal as an unduly lenient sentence.</p>
	<p pid=".728W.9/4">In addition, both the Law Officers and the CPS receive complaints from victims of crime, Members of Parliament, members of the public, through the media or otherwise that particular sentences passed were lenient. If, in response to such a complaint, the CPS decides that the sentence does not merit submitting the matter to the Law Officers for consideration it will write to the complainant to complain direct to the Law Officers.</p>
	<p pid=".728W.9/5">Complaints received by the Law Officers are considered in person by a Law Officer, often with advice from counsel experienced in sentencing law. A reply explaining the Law Officer's decision whether or not to refer the case to the Court of Appeal will be sent to the correspondent.</p>
	<p pid=".728W.9/6">Since 1988 the CPS, being the principal prosecuting authority in England and Wales and responsible for the vast majority of prosecutions brought before the courts, has identified a substantial number of suitable cases to submit to the Law Officers for consideration of a reference. Advocates acting for the CPS in the Crown Court are instructed to consider whether sentences passed should be submitted to the Law Officers for consideration of a reference.</p>
	<p pid=".728W.9/7">Experience suggests that victims who are at court at the time of sentencing and who are concerned about the sentence passed will express that concern to the police or prosecution representatives who would be expected to explain the options that may be available in taking those concerns forward.</p>
	<p pid=".728W.9/8">Under the victim's charter the police have a responsibility for advising victims of the outcome of cases. CPS prosecutors will often advise victims of the case outcome in cases where there is a pre-existing line of communication between the CPS and the victim.</p>
	<p pid=".728W.9/9">In addition, since 1988 there have been many references to the Court of Appeal, a large proportion of which result in sentences being increased and often receiving national and local media coverage.</p>

The value placed on the spectrum already released to the Radiocommunications Agency is &pound;3.5 million per annum. The remainder should be released in 2003 and has a current value of &pound;4.3 million per annum. About 36 MHz of currently MOD managed spectrum is also to be made available for the extension of the 800/900 MHz bands for digital mobile phones and other digital personal mobile radio services. This would be valued at &pound;4.3 million per annum. Spectrum for fixed wireless services in the 3.4 GHz band has very recently been released, with a value of &pound;80,000 per annum. These valuations are based on current spectrum charges that apply equally to civil and military users.</p>

Similarly there are no such plans for the Landing Platform Dock (Assault) ships HMS Intrepid and HMS Fearless which were withdrawn from service in July 2001 and March 2002 respectively.

It is, therefore, in good shape, although there are some specific areas where numbers fall short of target, most notably the Army Medical Service (TA). The &quot;Time to get fitTA&quot; awareness campaign launched in December last year received a good response, although the overall effectiveness of the campaign will not be known until the new figures come out later this year. The annual National Recruiting Campaign which concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-18">18 May</phrase> with TA Day, and a further Regional Recruiting Campaign to be launched in the autumn, are excellent opportunities for the general public to find out more about the TA. The aim of these campaigns is to keep the TA in its currently healthy state and under current plans they will continue to be a significant feature of the TA recruiting operation.</p>

	<p pid=".739W.0/1">The assistance the Ministry of Defence provides to Governments and armed forces overseas is co-ordinated closely with that provided by other Government Departments. In the case of Angola, no assistance has been offered or given by MOD to the Government and armed forces, either during the time frame in question or in support of the planned integration of UNITA forces. However, Her Majesty's Government remain in close contact with the Angolan Government, the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative for Africa, and international partners, and have offered to the Government of Angola an opportunity to visit Sierra Leone to see at first hand the challenges of integrating ex-combatants. MOD will, of course, be involved as appropriate with this initiative, should it go ahead.</p>

	<p pid=".740W.5/1">The Skill Force scheme forms part of the Ministry of Defence's contribution to our wider Government social exclusion policies. The initiative aims to prevent young people from feeling long-term disaffection with school and society. It is currently being piloted in 11 areas and in 47 schools in England and Scotland. Discussions are currently being held with a view to extending the pilot to Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".740W.5/2">A feature of the scheme is the use of recently retired service personnel as instructors for selected children in years 10 and 11 in a number of state secondary schools; and this has proved very effective. Skill Force emphasises instruction in vocational subjects with the aim of acquiring the Award Scheme Development and Accreditation Network modular vocational award at bronze/silver level. Participants also take part in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award; St. John's Ambulance Young Life Saver's award and the OCR First Certificate in Preparation for Employment. The Skill Force scheme is funded by MOD, Department for Education and Skills (DfES), HM Treasury's Invest to Save Budget and local partners.</p>
	<p pid=".740W.5/3">An integral part of the Skill Force pilot scheme has been rigorous and independent evaluation by the British Market Research Bureau. The most recent evaluation report, based on the two original schemes that started in September 2000 in Newcastle and Norfolk, has been completed. The report has shown that Skill Force has helped to maintain attendance rates of over 90 per cent. among children who would otherwise have been expected to display sharply declining attendance, sometimes leading to exclusion, through years 10 and 11. Exclusions from these schools have been reduced by 72 per cent. compared with those predicted by the head teachers at the start of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".740W.5/4">The Skill Force initiative has been supported by DfES from the outset, with the Invest to Save Budget bid being made jointly by the MOD, Home Office and DfES. In response to the Government's Street Crime Initiative, Skill Force is one of the schemes 11 local education authorities have been invited to consider to help them to deliver part of DfES's Behaviour Improvement Programme. A decision from the London education authorities on whether they wish to use Skill Force is expected shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".741W.5/1">The Ministry of Defence has few research programmes that specifically address non-lethal weapons. There are, however, a wider variety of research programmes that might be considered to contribute to non-lethal capabilities, details of which I am withholding under Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. The MOD's main non-lethal weapon is the baton round which is employed in forces world wide.</p>
	<p pid=".741W.5/2">Work into alternatives to baton rounds and a broader range of public order equipment is currently under way and is being led by the Northern Ireland Office. This is in response to recommendations in the Patten report and from the Association of Chief Police Officers, who are looking to enhance the police's range of less lethal weaponry.</p>
	<p pid=".741W.5/3">On the question of international partnerships, the United Kingdom does not collaborate with any Government on non-lethal technologies. However, it does have information exchange agreements with both the US and our European partners. No research programmes in the fields of non-lethal weapons or new techniques and equipment for use in urban warfare are being carried out by the Ministry of Defence in partnership with foreign Governments.</p>
	<p pid=".741W.5/4">On the development of techniques and equipment for use in urban warfare, it is not yet clear to what extent the UK will be involved in fighting in these areas in the future. We are, however, undertaking a number of studies into how existing and planned equipment and doctrine could be developed for use in an urban environment.</p>

It is made routinely clear to all armed forces personnel that forcing compliance with initiation rites is classed as bullying and is quite unacceptable. The new armed forces diversity policy goal will aim to achieve an environment free from harassment, intimidation and unlawful discrimination, in which all have equal opportunity and encouragement to realise their full potential. This position is reinforced through single service values and standards and equal opportunities policies, and was reflected in the Armed Forces Code of Social Conduct issued to all personnel in January 2000, where clear guidance was given on what is considered inappropriate personal behaviour within the armed forces.

	<p pid=".747W.5/1">A number of factors influence rotor head life including the helicopter's operational role and weight, any changes to capability during its service, the vibration environment of the helicopter and the cost and ease of maintenance. We continue to work closely with industry to improve the techniques and materials used in the manufacture of rotor heads, and gain a better understanding of the stress under which the rotor head operates. These initiatives are designed both to increase the life of the rotor heads and reduce manufacture lead times. Helicopters now entering service, for example Merlin, benefit from this work.</p>
	<p pid=".747W.5/2">We are also embarking on a number of innovative partnering arrangements with industry that focus both on greater reliability and improved component performance. More broadly based work to improve the responsiveness of the Defence Supply Chain will also enhance helicopter logistics, and ensure that we are better able to support front line forces.</p>

	<p pid=".749W.8/2">When advertising for civilian staff it is the MOD policy that age limits do not appear in adverts, except when they can be fully justified in terms of allowing the MOD time to benefit from any training investment it might need to make.</p>
	<p pid=".749W.8/3">The Armed Forces regard the ability to recruit sufficient people of the right age as critical in order to retain the correct balance of youth and experience required to maintain operational effectiveness. All three Services keep the age limit criteria for entry under regular review. Maximum age limits are imposed in order to maintain a balanced age/rank structure, with individuals benefiting from a visible career structure. The Services wish to recruit individuals who are operationally fit and are likely to give a good return of service. When considering upper age limits, the length and cost of training an individual is also taken into consideration.</p>

	<p pid=".750W.2/1">Since 1998, when the Ministry of Defence first recognised the current problem with the mistaken taxation of attributable service invaliding pensions, it has sought legal advice on a number of aspects of the application of the Income and Corporation Tax Act (ICTA) 1988, or preceding laws. These have centred on establishing clearly the nature and extent of our responsibilities for remedying the effects of the error, in particular in the following areas:</p>
	<p pid=".750W.2/2" class="indent">Clarification of the specific application of the Act and its predecessors to those receiving a pension under the armed forces pension scheme as a result of being invalided from service.</p>

	<p pid=".750W.2/5" class="indent">The extent of the Government's legal responsibility to backdate refunds, outside the normal Inland Revenue six-year time limit.</p>
	<p pid=".750W.2/6">Where the MOD has required more general advice on the implications of tax law for pensions paid under the AFPS, such as on the original legal basis of the tax exemption of invaliding pensions, this has been sought from the relevant Inland Revenue policy branch, who have the primary responsibility for tax law.</p>

	<p pid=".752W.3/1">The flight plan indicated a route to the Mull of Kintyre lighthouse and then a course change to port on a track following the western shore of the Mull. The first waypoint or landmark the pilots entered on the on-board navigation computer was the Mull of Kintyre lighthouse. At 0.95 nautical miles, or about 20 seconds from impact the crew released the computer from the fix on the lighthouse and set it to indicate the bearing and distance to the next waypoint at Corran 87 miles to the north. The preserved data held by the navigation system indicated that the aircraft was very close to the direct track from RAF Aldergrove to the lighthouse when the waypoint change was made. There is no evidence of any significant change of course before the impact.</p>

The House of Lords Select Committee was critical of certain aspects of these simulations, which did not include full FADEC parameters. As part of our promised full response to the Select Committee's report, Boeing have been tasked to revisit their original analysis to include a full FADEC simulation.</p>

	<p pid=".754W.3/2">Acclimatisation for operations in mountain terrain depends, in the first instance, on personal physical fitness. As the British armed forces mountain and cold climate specialists, the Royal Marines pay particular attention to this at all times. More specifically, they undertake annual mountain training in climbing, navigation and 'living' techniques, and every year a detachment spends three months training in Norway.</p>
	<p pid=".754W.3/3">It is standard requirement for units to undertake pre- operational acclimatisation training. Prior to commencing operations, personnel of 45 Commando were deployed to Afghanistan for up to 10 days. This period ended with Operation Ptarmigan, which gave our forces vital experience of operating in Afghanistan.</p>

The night sorties must be undertaken within 72 hours of the last day time sortie. The length of time to complete this training can vary, as it is aircraft carrier availability and weather dependent. It would be rare for the training to be completed within 16 days, however, on occasions when optimum operating conditions have been experienced, some pilots have qualified in a slightly shorter time.</p>

	<p pid=".756W.5/1">The maximum full front line strength of the three operational Harrier GR7 squadrons is 48 pilots and it is unlikely that there would be a requirement to train more than that number. 36 pilots are currently qualified to fly operations from aircraft carriers. Training to enable Harrier GR7 pilots to conduct aircraft carrier based operations is usually conducted as part of a Squadron's routine training programme. The maximum number of pilots that could be trained for aircraft carrier operations at any one time is dependent on a wide range of factors. These include aircraft carrier availability, operational tempo, pilot requirement for such training, weather conditions and completing training priorities, themselves dictated by anticipated operational requirement.</p>

It welcomes the EU initiative, which will aid compliance and views many of the amendments proposed by the European Parliament as useful clarification.</p>

It is for aerodromes and airlines to decide how best to comply with the regulation within the context of the UK National Aviation Security Programme, and how associated costs are passed on to the user. This system has been used to good effect in the UK for many years.</p>

Her stability information booklet (SIB) had been approved in 1992 by the French classification society Bureau Veritas (BV) on behalf of her previous flag administration, the Bahamas. As BV are a classification society authorised by the UK, and the Bahamas is a reputable flag, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) followed established procedures and accepted the stability information on the basis of the previous approvals, and without any further detail checks, by marking the document &quot;provisionally approved&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".762W.8/3">The vessel was preparing for a programme of model testing to demonstrate compliance with the &quot;Stockholm Agreement&quot; standards for stability with the car deck flooded, and a routine displacement check was carried out in November 2000. A number of amendments to the SIB were eventually required and the owner's consultant submitted a &quot;SIB Addendum&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-08">8 November 2001</phrase> which was approved on <phrase class="date" code="">16 November</phrase>, within the MCA's charter standard time for document approval.</p>

Separate arrangements, which are outside my Department's responsibility, apply in the rest of the UK and in London this would be a matter for the Mayor and Transport for London.</p>

	<p pid=".768W.0/4" class="indent">The Transport Minister, David Jamieson, has asked Tim Matthews to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the projected cost of the Birmingham Northern Relief Road (now known as the M6 Toll Road), the changes to road usage that will arise from the opening of the road and estimates of total annual revenue from it. I am replying in Tim's absence on official business.</p>
	<p pid=".768W.0/5" class="indent">Under the Concession Agreement between the Department and the consortium building the road, Midland Expressway Ltd. (MEL), the cost of constructing the M6 toll falls to MEL as the concessionaire, MEL has awarded a Design and Construct contract for the project to the CAMBBA Construction Group at a cost of &pound;485.5m. MEL will also bear additional costs to cover scheme preparation, land acquisition and financing. The total costs are a commercial issue for MEL and no total projected cost has been agreed with either the Department or the Highways Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".768W.0/6" class="indent">Estimates of changes to road usage because of the M6 Toll were presented in evidence at the Public Inquiry for the scheme. Briefly, it is expected that much of the long distance traffic presently travelling through the West Midlands on the very congested M6 motorway will transfer to M6 Toll. That transfer will allow released capacity on the M6 to be used by traffic currently using congested trunk and local roads within the M6 corridor, thus relieving their overall traffic burden. Traffic flows are expected to increase on some routes which provide access to the new motorway; for example, some sections of the A453 and A5127.</p>
	<p pid=".768W.0/7" class="indent">Estimates of the total annual revenue from the M6 Toll are a commercial matter for MEL as Concessionaire and no details are available.</p>
	<p pid=".768W.0/8" class="indent">If you require any further information, Richard Willson, the Highways Agency's Project Manager for the M6 Toll scheme, would be pleased to help.

As part of the consultation, the four Ministers held a major discussion seminar with all the stakeholders in the shift to low-carbon transport, including vehicle manufacturers. We are very grateful for their input to the development of the strategy, which includes the setting up of a Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership, involving vehicle manufacturers and other stakeholders in the strategy's implementation.

The Government expect this figure to rise substantially with the introduction of a 20p fuel duty reduction for biodiesel. Preliminary projections collected from the industry suggest that existing and planned production would represent around 1.5 per cent. pure biodiesel by 2003, likely to be used as a 5 per cent. blend with conventional diesel. The Government have made no further estimates beyond this date.</p>

The West Midlands to North West multi-modal study has recommended on-line widening of the M6 between junctions 11a and 19 (a distance of 81 km). The north/south movements in the East Midlands multi-modal study as recommended on-line widening of the M1 between junctions 21 and 28 (40 km). Neither recommendation includes new sections of road.</p>

	<p pid=".772W.2/3">In the five years up to July 2001 67 personal injury accidents have been reported at this junction. Of these five have been serious and the rest slight. There have been no fatalities. Some 72 per cent. of the accidents over this period have been nose to tail shunts.</p>

	<p pid=".772W.2/5">Last summer the Highways Agency took action to improve driver awareness of the layout by enhancing the signing at this junction. It is too early to conclude how effective this has been in reducing the number of accidents. Traffic signals are due to be installed at the junction as part of the widening of the M25 between Junctions 12 to 15. The road markings are to be renewed shortly and further improvements to the signing are currently being considered. In the meantime the Highways Agency will continue to monitor the situation.</p>

	<p pid=".772W.5/4" class="indent">The Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) monitored use of the Bus lane during its first year of operation including the effects of the bus lane on off-peak traffic and congestion to the west of Junction 4. A copy of their report was placed in the House of Commons Library in January 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".772W.5/5" class="indent">The effectiveness of the bus lane has been closely monitored by the Highways Agency. They reported that it continues to alleviate peak congestion on this busy section of the motorway. However they recommended that the scheme could be improved by raising the speed limit between junction 4 and the elevated section to 60 mph and allowing motorcycles to use the lane designated for buses and taxis.</p>
	<p pid=".772W.5/6" class="indent">Accident monitoring since the bus lane was introduced in June 1999 indicate that motorcycles are now slightly more at risk in peak periods. The numbers involved are small, but we believe that safety for motorcyclists will be improved by allowing them to use the bus lane.</p>

	<p pid=".773W.2/3" class="indent">The Transport Minister, David Jamieson, has asked me to reply to your three recent Parliamentary Questions about the cost of building a new motorway link between the M6 in the vicinity of J19 and the M56 in the vicinity of J7, plans to reduce traffic flows on the A556, and the cost of making Junction 20 of the M6 Motorway fully directional.</p>
	<p pid=".773W.2/4" class="indent">At the time of the Government's trunk roads review of 1998 the estimated cost of constructing the A556(M) was &pound;100m. The cost-estimate is currently under review as part of the A556 Area Study being carried out to inform the West Midlands to North West Conurbations Multi-Modal Study (MIDMAN) consideration. The purpose of MIDMAN was to develop an overarching strategy for transport between the conurbations.</p>
	<p pid=".773W.2/5" class="indent">The Highways Agency is currently undertaking the A556 Area Study in support of the MIDMAN Multi-Modal Study, which is also exploring different options for a link between Junction 19 of the M6 and Junction 7 of the M56. Reduction of traffic flows and the associated environmental relief to communities along the A556 are key aims. That report is expected to be completed this Summer.</p>
	<p pid=".773W.2/6" class="indent">A scheme, which would make Junction 20 of the M6 fully- directional is currently being investigated as part of the A556 Area Study. The cost-estimate is currently being developed and will form part of the final report on that Study.</p>
	<p pid=".773W.2/7" class="indent">I hope this is helpful. If you would like any further information about these issues, please contact Gerald Cooper, Room 703, Sunley Tower, Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester, M1 4BE (telephone 0161&ndash;930 5640).</p>

	<p pid=".779W.5/4" class="indent">the development of good practice guidance on measures to help manage risk at specific sites.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.5/5">Our first priority is the protocol on responsibilities and costs which we aim to have agreed by the end of June 2002 and the Minister for Transport has asked for a report on progress on all streams of work by the end of July 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".779W.5/6">We have also endorsed the prioritisation tool produced by Railtrack and the CSS (formerly the County Surveyors' Society) and have encouraged highway authorities and rail infrastructure authorities to use it on the bridges for which they are responsible.</p>

The involvement of contractors and sub- contractors in the decision-making processes of RISB forms part of ORR's consultation.

	<p pid=".781W.3/146">Level crossing accidents in Great Britain are among the lowest in Europe. However, as about 33 per cent. of railway collisions occur on level crossings they still present a significant area of risk. Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) are currently developing plans for a level crossing working party to critically look at all level crossing issues from first principles.</p>

This will be a permanent appointment on standard civil service terms. The post was advertised in the national and specialist press, interviews have taken place, and the recruitment process, overseen by the Civil Service Commission, will be completed shortly. An announcement will be made by the HSE in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".789W.3/2">The job specification for the post includes requirements to lead and direct the Railway Inspectorate in ensuring that all relevant duty holders carry out their health and safety responsibilities to employees, passengers and others; contribute to the health and safety strategy for railways; ensure that all targets to improve health and safety on the railways are fully met; and to maintain strong links with stakeholders in driving forward the health and safety strategy and improving public confidence.</p>

	<p pid=".791W.8/1">It is not possible to establish precisely how many asylum seekers have entered the United Kingdom after travelling through the channel tunnel on freight trains. Some illegal entrants do not claim asylum on arrival. Some illegal entrants are detected inland and cannot be attributed to a particular port of entry and some claim to use the channel tunnel but have in fact entered by a different route.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.8/2">Information on the number of illegal entrants who have arrived in the United Kingdom after travelling on freight trains via the channel tunnel is not held centrally. However, local provisional management information is collated on a monthly basis although is not yet available for 2002. The locally collated figures for the two months in 2001 including these periods are as follows: 150 (March 2001), 288 (November 2001).</p>
	<p pid=".791W.8/3">Security arrangements near the entrance to the channel tunnel have not been subject to any bilateral agreement with France. We have repeatedly stressed to SNCF and all levels of the French Government the need for rapid security improvements. We are monitoring the situation and we will take further concerted action until the overall policing and security levels are adequate. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary (Mr. Blunkett) has made clear that addressing the problem of cross-channel asylum seekers in its totality will be a priority for discussions with the new French Government after their elections.</p>

	<p pid=".798W.3/1">Research shows that there is a strong link between drugs and acquisitive crime, and that treatment can play a significant part in reducing both drugs misuse and associated crime. The National Drugs Treatment Monitoring System provides data on trends in the use of drug treatment services to assist planning on how best to provide services to meet the needs of drugs misusers. It is though, a matter for local decision between the Probation Service and other stakeholders within Joint Commissioning Groups whether the clinical treatment element of the Drug Treatment and Testing Order is delivered through the National Health Service or by another provider.</p>

	<p pid=".799W.5/1">Tackling street crime is now a top priority for the Government. However, it is recognised that it cannot successfully be tackled by the police and criminal justice agencies alone. That is why the Government set up the Street Crime Action Group in March of this year. This group, chaired by the Prime Minister, has brought together all relevant Government Departments, criminal justice and other agencies to work together to identify and address weaknesses in the current systems. This includes preventative action as well as action designed to detect offenders and deal effectively with them through the courts.</p>
	<p pid=".799W.5/2">The programme of action has been targeted and accelerated in 10 police force areas accounting for over 80 per cent. of street crime, since April 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".799W.5/3">The Government have to date announced a number of measures to help tackle the issue of street crime. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".799W.5/4" class="indent">the funding of the roll-out of VIPER video identification equipment to enable video ID parades in the 10 areas;</p>
	<p pid=".799W.5/5" class="indent">the nomination of 67 specialist street crime courts in the 10 areas to fast-track street crime cases and provide separate facilities and support to victims and witnesses;</p>
	<p pid=".799W.5/6" class="indent">the launch of a CPS Premium Service for Street Crime offenders with experienced prosecutors working with police in a dedicated investigation and prosecution service;</p>
	<p pid=".799W.5/7" class="indent">the extension of bail powers through the greater use of electronic tagging, ISSP orders, new curfew conditions and the provision of more secure accommodation places for juvenile repeat offenders;</p>
	<p pid=".799W.5/8" class="indent">greater powers to remand into custody persistent young offenders aged 12 to 16;</p>

The police are investigating allegations that articles in the <i>al-Akhbar</i> newspaper, an Egyptian newspaper available in the United Kingdom, incited racial hatred. We would encourage anyone to report to the police any material they believe breaches the incitement to racial hatred laws.</p>

NASS is responsible for meeting the direct costs of providing support to asylum seekers who are destitute. NASS is not responsible for providing funding for other services such as education and health. Asylum seekers returning to London can apply to NASS to change their support package from subsistence and accommodation to subsistence only. But asylum seekers could not, as a matter of routine, request that accommodation be provided in London. London is not a dispersal area. Accommodation will be provided in London only in exceptional circumstances.</p>

Video identification provides a fast and effective alternative to live identity parades. Problems in arranging &quot;live&quot; identification parades within a reasonable period of time have contributed significantly to delays in processing cases and such delays impact upon the quality of evidence and compromise the whole process of justice. Making better use of video identification technology will free up officer time to tackle crime and standardise police practices. It will also result in more positive identifications and benefit witnesses and victims, who will no longer have to re-live their ordeal by coming face-to-face with their attacker in a live identity parade.</p>

	<p pid=".814W.3/1">The peaceful conduct of presidential and parliamentary elections in Sierra Leone was a remarkable achievement for a country just emerging from a brutal civil war. The elections mark an historic milestone on Sierra Leone's return to peace and democracy. Britain can be proud of its part in their success. The people of Sierra Leone have given President Kabbah a clear mandate to eradicate corruption, deliver good governance and rebuild the country's shattered institutions and infrastructure. This is an enormous challenge, which will require efforts by the new Government to foster a spirit of national unity, and the sustained commitment of the international community. Britain will continue to play a full part in helping the new Government of Sierra Leone to meet the aspirations of its people.</p>

	<p pid=".834W.0/1">The EU has external agreements with a large number of third countries. These agreements include an article establishing an official level committee to oversee implementation of the agreement. This committee is known as a joint or association committee depending on the nature of the agreement (ie whether it is a Trade and Co-operation Agreement or an Association Agreement). The mandate of the committee is to ensure the effective implementation of the agreement. Specific provisions for the powers or provisions of the committees are set out in the individual agreements.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.0/2">The range of work covered by such committees includes economic and trade issues, technical co-operation and, in the case of Association Agreements, political dialogue. The committees are required to meet at regular intervals, usually annually. The UK is represented at the committee at official level, normally by officials from the UK Permanent Representation in Brussels (when the meeting is in Brussels) or by British embassy or high commission officials (when meetings take place in the third country concerned). It is not possible to disaggregate the cost of the committees to public funds as they are part of the EU's wider relations with third countries. Parliament has the opportunity to scrutinise each third country agreement. Mixed competence agreements have to be ratified by all member states. Community-only agreements are considered by the parliamentary Scrutiny Committees prior to their conclusion.</p>

	<p pid=".835W.2/2">It was intended that a Committee for Protection Against the Effects of the Extraterritorial Application of Legislation Adopted by a Third Country and Actions Based Thereon or Resulting Therefrom (anti-boycott) would be established in Brussels to assist EU companies affected by extraterritorial jurisdiction by third countries, and in particular those affected by the extraterritorial aspects of the US trade sanctions against Cuba, Iran and Libya.</p>
	<p pid=".835W.2/3">Thus far, the Committee has not been convened. UK companies are obliged to inform Her Majesty's Government and the European Commission of any extraterritorial action taken against them, but while it is clear who would be responsible for representing the UK at any meeting of the Committee, in these times of improved electronic communication, it has not been necessary in practice for it to meet.</p>
	<p pid=".835W.2/4">In addition, as part of the 1997 Understanding between the EU and the US, the US undertook to exempt European individuals and companies from the extraterritorial aspects of US legislation drastically reducing the number of cases occurring, thus further reducing the need for the Committee to meet.</p>

Contributory benefits are financed on a pay-as-you-go basis, so it is not appropriate to quote a value for the total benefits foregone by married women paying at the reduced rate. This comparison is possible for the self-employed because the main element of the difference between the benefits they receive and those to which employees are entitled is SERPS (now state second pension) and the value of this is represented by the contracted-out rebate. No equivalent valuation, consistent with the nature of the national insurance fund, is possible for the rights to basic retirement pension forgone by married women optants.</p>

	<p pid=".843W.12/1">Since the special taxation regime for UK oil and gas was introduced in the 1970s, oil and gas pipelines associated with particular fields have received the same tax treatment as the fields themselves. This reflects the fact that the pipelines are an integral part of the overall development of the fields concerned. Because the tax regime that applies to a field, and therefore its associated pipelines, depends on the date on which the filed was given development consent, pipelines associated with different fields can have different tax treatments.</p>

	<p pid=".849W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what information businesses are required to supply to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and in what legislation this requirement lies. (59192)</p>
	<p pid=".849W.2/4" class="indent">The ONS requires businesses to supply information on their structure, level of employment and the earnings of its employees, and financial data such as their turnover, sales, prices, stocks and capital expenditure. This information is collected through a range of monthly, quarterly and annual business surveys, with the short term surveys asking for aggregate level data, while the annual surveys seek more detailed structural data. Each business survey is subject to regular review to reassess its continued need. The sample size for each survey is set at the minimum level consistent with the need to produce aggregate statistics for use by the Government in its economic monitoring and planning. Full details of all the business surveys carried out by the ONS are included in the ONS Compliance Plan for 2002 to 2004 which will be available on the ONS website <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/other">www.statistics.gov.uk/other</a> on the 29th of May.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.2/5" class="indent">The information sought from businesses by the ONS is collected under the provisions of the Statistics of Trade Act 1947. The Schedule to the 1947 Act allows for the collection of the following:</p>
	<p pid=".849W.2/6" class="indent">The nature of the undertaking (including its association with other undertakings) and the date of its acquisition; the persons employed or normally employed (including working proprietors), the nature of their employment, their remuneration and the hours worked; the output, sales, deliveries and other services provided; the articles acquired or used, orders, stocks and work in progress; the outgoings and costs (including work given out to contractors, depreciation, rent, rates and taxes, other than taxes on profits) and capital expenditure; the receipts of and debts owed to the undertaking; the power used or generated; the fixed capital assets, the plant, including the acquisition and disposal of those assets and that plant and the premised occupied.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.2/7" class="indent">The Statistics of Trade Act (Amendment of Schedule Order) 1963, allows for the collection of data relating to assets (other than fixed capital assets) and liabilities of the undertaking, including the acquisition and disposal of those assets and the incurring and discharge of those liabilities; prices of articles and services.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.2/8" class="indent">The Statistics of Trade Act (Amendment of Schedule Order) 1987 allows for cases where the undertaking is related to a body situated outside the United Kingdom: the nature and extent of the relationship; the nature and extent (and any changes therein) of the financial interest of the one body in the other; the country in which the related body is situated; particulars in respect of issued share capital, minority shareholders' interests, loans, reserves and provisions as recorded in the accounts of the undertaking or such particulars in respect of the related body where it is under the control of the undertaking; net gains or losses of the undertaking attributable to changes in exchange rates, being gains or losses arising out of the relationship; where the undertaking is not a company incorporated in the United Kingdom, its net value to the related body and where the related body is not a body corporate, its net value to the undertaking.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.2/9" class="indent">The Statistics of Trade Act (Amendment of Schedule) Order 1990 allows for the collection of data relating to income (including rents, interest and investment income) received or receivable by the undertaking; dividends and interest paid or payable; profits; losses; taxes paid or chargeable on income or gains; services acquired or used.</p>

	<p pid=".854W.3/1">In the last 40 years those developing countries which have managed to be more open and trade more in the world economy have seen faster growth rates than those which have remained closed. From the early 1970s to the early 1990s, developing countries that were able to pursue growth through trade grew at least twice as fast as those that kept their tariffs high and their doors closed to imports and competition.</p>
	<p pid=".854W.3/2">Full trade liberalisation could lift at least 300 million people out of poverty by 2015. Even diminishing protection by 50 per cent. in agriculture and in industrial goods and services would increase the world's yearly income by nearly $400 billion: a boost to growth of 1.4 per cent. All countries and regions stand to benefit, with developing countries gaining an estimated $150 billion a year and higher than average increases in GDP growth.</p>
	<p pid=".854W.3/3">The WTO's new trade round, referred to as the Doha Development Agenda, contains a package of commitments to progress in areas that will lead to major gains for developing countries and the poorest people in these countries.</p>
	<p pid=".854W.3/4">We need an approach which ensures that Poverty and Social Impact Assessments are undertaken of key reforms, including trade, to ensure that policy options and trade-offs are discussed, and that reforms are properly designed. Where negative consequences exist, appropriate measures should be put in place to protect vulnerable countries and people from an overly rapid transition to a system of liberalised trade. The IMF and World bank have committed to undertake Poverty and Social Impact Assessments of reforms, and to promote the integration of trade into developing countries' poverty reduction strategies. We are working hard to support this process.</p>

	<p pid=".862W.0/1">All of the committees listed have been set up by the council in accordance with obligations under agreements between the EC and the third country or economic grouping in question. They normally meet annually (one year Brussels, the following year in the subject country). Their aim is to maintain co-operation agreements in the customs field, particularly in exchanging information.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.0/2">HM Customs attends preparatory council meetings (approximately six per year) which co-ordinate, as part of a wide ranging agenda, for the bilateral EC/third country committee meetings.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.0/3">Travel expenses for two officials are reimbursed by the Commission. The usual cost of overnight accommodation and subsistence per day per official is 217.95 euro (&pound;134.70). HM Customs officials do not normally attend the bilateral meetings.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.0/4">In the Customs area, the EC has exclusive competence and leads in the bilateral meetings, normally accompanied by the member state holding the presidency. If, exceptionally, there is a point of direct interest to the UK, representatives from the permanent representation in Brussels would attend the meeting.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.0/5">Accountability and transparency to Parliament are ensured by the regular EU scrutiny process. Prior to agreement at the various councils (ECOFIN, JHA, GAC), documents are submitted to Parliament along with explanatory memoranda and are examined by the European Scrutiny Committees.</p>

We are working closely with the European Commission to progress matters as quickly as possible. Those purchasing property for amounts up to &pound;150,000 in the areas which qualify for the relief are already benefiting from the measure. In addition to the stamp duty relief, the Urban White Paper fiscal measures package provided a cut in VAT to 5 per cent. to encourage renovation and conversion of existing property; 100 per cent. capital allowances for creating flats over shops, 150 per cent. accelerated tax credits to help clean-up contaminated land; and the Government are now implementing the Community Development Venture Fund which will also support enterprise and regeneration in these areas.</p>

However, senior executive officer grades and above who are a minority of the total number of staff undertaking business journeys in DWP are entitled to travel first or executive class as one of their 'Terms and Conditions' of Employment. This is approved on the basis that the additional space and less crowding enables these people to work while they are travelling as well as affording greater privacy for the handling of sensitive papers. For long distance peak-time services the additional cost involved is more than offset by the work produced and time saved. All staff are expected to travel standard class when the length of the journey is insufficient to enable them to work productively.</p>

The functions of the Audit Board are set out in Article 102 of that Regulation. Its duties in practice relate exclusively to health care costs. Specifically, it is tasked to collect the data and perform the calculations required by Title V of Regulation 574&ndash;72, to give the Administrative Commission details of the implementation of Regulations (EEC) 1408&ndash;71 and 574&ndash;72 particularly as they relate to health care finance, to submit to the Administrative Commission proposals on the calculation of annual average healthcare costs in respect of each member state, to lay before the Administrative Commission each year a statement of the healthcare costs claims position between the member states, and to carry out such other work as may be referred by the Administrative Commission.</p>
	<p pid=".873W.2/2">The Audit Board normally meets twice a year in Brussels. It is chaired by the presidency of the day, and UK representation is normally two or three officials from the Department of Health.

	<p pid=".873W.2/3">The next meeting of the Audit Board will last one day and will consider the annual average cost papers submitted by seven member states together with work on the annual statement of claims. Any proposals made by the Audit Board to the Administrative Commission would, if subsequently adopted by the European Commission, then be subject to UK parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

This involved discussions with research organisations, academics, and a meeting with representatives of organisations of and for deaf people. The work identified concerns about the robustness of the data which such a project might produce, its acceptability to stakeholders including deaf people themselves and the length of time it would take.

These do not, however, provide a comprehensive record of interpreters both active and available for assignment.

	<p pid=".878W.8/1">When a homeless person in temporary accommodation provided by a local authority claims housing benefit, the local authority must pay the full amount of benefit in respect of the rent for which the homeless person is liable. However, the amount of subsidy paid to reimburse local authorities for benefit paid in these circumstances is subject to a threshold above which only a proportion of benefit is reimbursed, and a cap, above which nothing is reimbursed. These limits are intended to ensure that the tax-payer does not subsidise unreasonably expensive accommodation. However, there are no circumstances in which we will &quot;claw back&quot; subsidy.</p>
	<p pid=".878W.8/2">From April 2002, we introduced changes to the subsidy limits to encourage local authorities to use better quality accommodation in housing homeless people, and to ensure that even more families have the chance of a more permanent home. From that date, the subsidy rate for privately-leased accommodation was increased, while the rate for board and lodging accommodation remained the same.</p>

	<p pid=".893W.8/1">Big leaf mahogany (Swietenia Macrophylla) is listed on Appendix III by certain range states. This means that it is not classified by CITES as endangered but is subject to regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".893W.8/2">Our main line of defence against the use of illegally logged big leaf mahogany is the CITES and European Union controls on the import of such mahogany. All imports into the Community for the first time must be accompanied by appropriate CITES documentation. Mahogany requires a valid export permit or certificate of origin and a completed import notification. Failure to present such documentation could render any cargo liable to seizure, and illegal trading in CITES listed timber is subject to strict penalties. We are also exploring with our EU partners whether there are changes in EU regulations which would secure better regulation of this trade; and we have made clear to the Brazilians our concern to support their efforts to prevent illegal logging. The Government's Green Guide for Buyers, first issued in 1998 and updated last year, gives detailed guidance on implementing the Government's policy to purchase its timber and timber products from legal and sustainable sources.</p>

Their expenses are met by the European Commission and therefore the work of the group makes no demands on public funds in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".910W.0/3">Within the past 12 months the Commission have received 14 submissions from EU member countries of general data under Article 37 on which it has requested the views of the group. Six of these submissions were from the UK. Copies of the Commission's opinions on UK Article 37 submissions are placed in the Library of the House. The Group of Experts' reports are attached as an annex to these opinions.</p>

	<p pid=".915W.3/1">The Drinking Water Directive 1998, requires the Commission to review drinking water quality standards in Annex I to the directive &quot;in the light of scientific and technical progress&quot; and to make proposals for any necessary amendments. At least every five years, the Commission is to adapt Annexes II and III (monitoring and methods of analysis) to scientific and technical progress. A management committee was established under Article 12, to assist the Commission.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/2">The Article 12 Committee has met three times: in June 1999, when the Committee adopted its rules of procedure, in November 2001 and in April 2002. It is too soon to carry out full reviews of the Annexes. However, the directive also stipulated that certain provisions, particularly on sampling methods for the lead, nickel and copper parameters, and some radioactivity provisions, remained to be added.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/3">The additional work, carried out by the Committee, has included:</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/4" class="indent">producing a guidance document on standardised methods of sampling and analysis for lead</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/5" class="indent">advice on sampling for the copper and nickel parameters</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/6" class="indent">advice on monitoring for radioactivity</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/7" class="indent">advice on pesticides breakdown products [relevant metabolites].</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/8">The Committee's Rules of Procedure permit a delegation of three officials from each member state. At the meetings in November 2001 and April 2002, the UK's membership comprised a technical assessor from the Drinking Water Inspectorate, a DEFRA policy administrator, and a representative of the Scottish Executive.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.3/9">The costs incurred by my Department in contributing to the Committee's work are largely travel and subsistence costs of approximately &pound;1,000 per meeting. Officials consider a wide range of matters in connection with the directive. Therefore it is not possible, except at a disproportionate cost, to identify or apportion the costs arising out of the particular technical issues on which the Article 12 Committee assists and advises the Commission.</p>

The main annual cost of its work to UK public funds which can be quantified is made up of travel and subsistence costs totalling around &pound;14,000, part of which was reimbursed by the Commission.

Advice was also sought from a specially convened Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) Working Group on <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-24">24 May 2001</phrase>, attended by experts from the Department of Health, Food Standards Agency, Environment Agency, Health and Safety Executive and MAFF.</p>
	<p pid=".922W.2/2">The working group recommended that the choice of disposal option should be made on a site-by-site basis. Leaving the ash unburied in-situ was likely to be associated with a higher risk than alternative routes such as incineration, on-site burial or burial in landfill. Disposing of ash from pyres by on-farm burial was regarded as a preferred low risk option. Where on-site burial was not possible, SEAC's preferred disposal option was re-incineration. The working group noted however that landfilling also represented a low-risk option and that the limited availability of high temperature incineration capacity in the UK meant that incineration of pyre ash might not be practical. Given that leaving the material unburied in-situ or in storage prior to incineration was not a risk-free option, the working group's advice indicated that landfill also represented an appropriate risk minimisation option.</p>

	<p pid=".925W.5/1">The 20 day standstill is at the centre of the interim livestock movement restrictions currently in force to guard against a future outbreak. Scientific and veterinary advice is that it aids detection of disease and slows disease spread. A number of exemptions from the standstill have been introduced, on veterinary advice, in order to help livestock farmers without causing an unacceptable increase in disease risk. These interim arrangements are currently under review, but whatever changes may be made to the interim rules this summer the Government intend to take full account of any relevant findings from the FMD inquiries before it reaches a final view on the role that a 20 day standstill might play in the long-term controls over livestock movements.</p>

In order to ensure effective co-ordination and help resolution of differences, Agriculture Ministers of the devolved Administrations meet regularly, normally in advance of EU Agriculture Councils, under the chairmanship of the DEFRA Secretary of State.

In particular, the felling of any type of woodland is controlled through felling regulations. Additionally, many woodlands are subject to further controls because they are within designated areas such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest or Special Areas of Conservation.</p>

	<p pid=".936W.5/1">Reform of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) was agreed at the Berlin Council in March 1999. This reform, known as the Agenda 2000 agreement, represented a significant shift from price support to direct payments; reduced the economic distortions of the CAP; helped agriculture meet the challenges of further trade liberalisation; and enabled the formulation of an integrated EU rural development policy, shifting the emphasis from production support to environmental and rural economy measures in the future. It also went some way towards helping our ambitions for EU enlargement and the WTO round.</p>
	<p pid=".936W.5/2">A further reform of the sheepmeat regime was agreed by the Agriculture Council in December 2001, simplifying the regime and making it more flexible. The ewe premium will in future be paid on a flat rate basis, and the introduction of national envelopes provides a valuable mechanism for targeting extra support for the sheep sector and for encouraging environmentally beneficial farming practices.</p>
	<p pid=".936W.5/3">At the Berlin Council in 1999, it was agreed that elements of the Agenda 2000 package would be subject to mid-term review. We await the Commission's mid-term review proposals, which are expected this summer. In the mid-term review we will be looking to build on the Agenda 2000 reform, which we do not believe went far enough, and arguing for a further shift away from production linked support (pillar 1 of the CAP) to agri- environment and rural development measures (pillar 2 of the CAP).</p>

	<p pid=".939W.8/1">Regional foods can be registered as EU protected food names under a system set up under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2081&ndash;92. The application process for registering such products involves a number of steps including checks by both this Department, the agriculture Departments of the devolved Administrations and the Commission to ensure that the applications meet the necessary criteria for registration. Participation in the scheme is voluntary. No fee is charged on producers wishing to register a product.</p>
	<p pid=".939W.8/2">In the last 12 months no UK regional food has been registered as a protected food name although a number have been lodged with the European Commission who are currently considering whether they meet the criteria for registration. Officials from this Department work closely with colleagues from the agriculture Departments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as the applicant themselves in handling applications. The work involves advising applicants, both in writing and face- to-face, on the application process, the consideration of application and liaising with the European Commission. It is estimated that the staff costs to the Department for this work in the last 12 months is &pound;15,106.10.</p>

	<p pid=".942W.5/1">Veterinary and scientific advice is that livestock shows pose a risk of the transmission of Foot and Mouth or other notifiable diseases because large numbers of animals, vehicles and people are brought together from a number of different farms. Hence strict biosecurity is needed. Animal faeces may contain Foot and Mouth virus and other animal pathogens, which may survive in faeces for a period of time. Show organisers are required to draw up a biosecurity operating plan and appoint a biosecurity officer to ensure that the show licence conditions are followed. These conditions include that if animals cross a public area, any faeces is removed as far as possible and the spot covered, for example with sawdust, as is normal hygienic practice.</p>

	<p pid=".945W.0/5">In response to the increased number of breaches of the carbon monoxide limit in 2001 the Agency issued an enforcement notice requiring the operator to analyse the causes of the breaches and report the results of the analysis to the Agency. The reports show that if there is a loss of waste feed to the incinerator the resulting excess air cools the flame resulting in increased carbon monoxide emissions. The most common causes of a loss of waste feed are failure of the waste feed ram, bulky items blocking the waste feed chute and blockages of the ash removal mechanism. The enforcement notice and the operator's responses are on the Public Register maintained by the Agency which can be viewed at the following address:</p>
	<p pid=".945W.0/6" class="indent">North East Area Office (Thames Region)</p>
	<p pid=".945W.0/7" class="indent">Apollo Court</p>
	<p pid=".945W.0/8" class="indent">2 Bishops Square Business Park</p>
	<p pid=".945W.0/9" class="indent">St. Albans Road West</p>
	<p pid=".945W.0/10" class="indent">Hatfield</p>
	<p pid=".945W.0/11" class="indent">AL10 9EX.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.0/12">With regard to the impact of such breaches on local air quality, both the operator and the Agency have carried out dispersion modelling of emissions from the plant. The Agency has modelled emissions from the plant under worst case breach conditions in comparison with current standards. It was concluded that at the highest recorded level of emissions there would not be a breach of an air quality standard.</p>

	<p pid=".948W.6/2">Catering waste as defined in the Animal By-Products Order 1999 includes domestic kitchen waste. Following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, the order was amended in May 2001 to make it an offence to allow livestock and poultry to have access to any catering waste which contains meat or most other products of animal origin, or which originates from premises which handle such products. The aim was to prevent livestock and poultry from having access to material which might introduce or spread animal diseases.</p>

	<p pid=".948W.9/1">&quot;Zero waste&quot; is a term that is used in different ways in different countries. Some use it to mean no waste to landfill; others use it to mean that no waste is sent to any form of final disposal. Some claim that in nature there is no such thing as waste; that what is waste for one species is a resource for another. They believe humans should emulate nature and build a society in which all &quot;wastes&quot; can be reused as resources.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.9/2">This Government have not adopted a goal of zero waste, but many of the policies and actions necessary to achieve zero waste are outlined in 'Waste Strategy 20'. The challenge is to develop policies that reduce the waste we generate, while at the same time ensuring the safe disposal of wastes for which efficient re-use, recycling or recovery solutions have not yet been found.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.9/3">Under the Best Value regime local authorities should set targets for waste reduction and produce Municipal Waste Management Strategies, in line with the national waste strategy, which prioritise waste minimisation wherever practicable. Each Municipal Waste Management Strategy should clearly set out the local authority's proposals for collection, treatment and disposal of waste, its plans for achieving the statutory recycling and composting targets and its proposals to meet waste reduction targets.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.9/4">In March last year DETR issued guidance to local authorities on the development of Municipal Waste Management Strategies. This guidance contained a section on implementing the Waste Minimisation Act 1998 and included a case study on a waste reduction project.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.9/5">The principal means for funding local authority waste management functions, including waste reduction, is through general grant. This is distributed through Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs). Waste management is within the Environmental Protection and Cultural Services (EPCS) SSA. The EPCS SSA increases over the three years of the Spending Review from 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04 by &pound;1.1 billion. Consistent with the general local authority financial framework, it is for individual local authorities to decide the proportion of their budget that should be directed to waste management work.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.9/6">Local councils in England also have access to a &pound;140 million household waste minimisation and recycling fund to help them meet their recycling and composting statutory targets. The Government hope the money will help move local authorities away from traditional landfill dumping in favour of recycling/recovery and as a result minimise the amount of waste generated.</p>
	<p pid=".948W.9/7">Future funding for local authority waste management will be determined by the outcomes of the 2002 spending review.</p>

	<p pid=".951W.2/1">FMD Signposts to Recovery conference, held in Berkshire end of June 2001, which covered the Wycombe District. This was one of two seminars held in the region. This was to assist businesses in the recovery process from foot and mouth disease and any precautionary measures. The conference was targeted at advisers and advisory organisations in public and private sectors that regularly provide support, advice or information to rural businesses, e.g. SEEDA, CA, SE Tourist Board, NFU and Farm Crisis Network. Information was provided from a variety of Government sponsored agencies and partner organisations, Rural Business Recovery Fund, Farm Business Advisory Service, Countryside Agency Grants.</p>
	<p pid=".951W.2/2">A planning seminar was held in January 2002 to cover the three counties of Berkshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Wycombe District Council as the planning authority was invited to attend. There were four seminars held in total across the region, in a series resulting from the Government's Action Plan for Farming. The seminar focused on farm diversification and rural business development issues and brought together relevant partners at the regional and local level, to take account of regional needs and variations.</p>
	<p pid=".951W.2/3">Wycombe district is currently making changes to its deposit draft of its local plan to be adopted and run until 2011. The policies within this deposit draft have been assessed with regard to PPG7, by DEFRA representatives in the Government Office for the South East, which sets out how the Government's objectives for rural areas should be reflected in land use planning. Specific policies have been commented on and suggestions for appropriate wording given.</p>
	<p pid=".951W.2/4">Wycombe District Council has held a Rural Affairs Seminar, which was attended by DEFRA regional representation, on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-23">23 November 2001</phrase> at which James Ellis MEP gave a presentation on the Reform of the CAP. Representatives from the parishes within the Wycombe constituency were present as well as interest groups and local farmers, which provided an opportunity for networking between rural partners.</p>
	<p pid=".951W.2/5">The South East Rural Affairs Forum has been successfully set up, by DEFRA in the GOSE following recommendations in the Rural White Paper. The first meeting of the group was on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-15">15 April</phrase> in Guildford. This forum gives the opportunity for rural stakeholders across the south east to give their views on how rural policy is being delivered in the region. Councillor Bill Lidgate is representative on the forum covering Buckinghamshire's area. He is a member of the county council, and South Buckinghamshire district council with extensive knowledge of issues facing rural communities. He is a farmer who runs diversified rural enterprises including pedigree herd and retail farm shop. Chair of the Royal South Bucks Agricultural Association.</p>
	<p pid=".951W.2/6">The Countryside Agency, English Nature and Forestry Commission have been actively working with the Chilterns AONB which covers a major area of the constituency, and other partners to develop sustainable approaches to ensuring the long-term prospects for the chalk grasslands and beech woodlands that contribute to the unique characteristic of the Chiltern landscape. This involves developing support mechanisms and incentives for the farming and forestry practices that will perpetuate these features, working with producers through to the marketing of end products.</p>
	<p pid=".951W.2/7">Applications for the England rural development programme have been received from within Wycombe constituency. There has been one successful rural enterprise scheme project to date and there are currently two Countryside Stewardship Scheme agreements covering collectively approximately 8ha. In addition 97ha are currently being managed under the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".951W.2/8">In addition to the ERDP there are continuing CAP payments for most farms in the constituency.</p>

Further funding will be available from a community and household capital grant scheme which will be launched later this year. In England, the energy crops scheme, part of the rural development programme, has allocated &pound;29 million to solid biomass and this can support feedstocks for heat generation. Officials are also working closely with the local support teams set up by the Countryside Agency, through the community renewables initiative, to develop markets for renewables.</p>

	<p pid=".952W.5/1">The Government-Industry Forum on the Non-Food Uses of Crops is studying the potential for bioethanol production. This includes an assessment of the new production technologies which utilise lignocellulosic feedstocks, including purpose grown crops and forest material, and which are likely to give a better environmental return. The Government have also launched a second round of the green fuel challenge inviting bids for pilot projects for biofuels, including bioethanol, which would qualify for duty reductions. In England, the energy crops scheme, part of the rural development programme, has allocated &pound;29 million to solid biomass and this can support feedstocks for bioethanol production. Finally, the Government are considering carefully the recommendation of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food that duty on biofuels should be reduced to the rates applied to other clean fuels.</p>

	<p pid=".953W.5/1">The Government do not assess the number of people, across the whole country, exposed to noise every year and so there are no data relating specifically to the last 12 months. Such an exercise is, however, carried out periodically and levels outside dwellings were last measured, in 2000 for England and Wales and 2001 for Scotland and Northern Ireland, at over 1,000 sites in total, for a 24 hour period. The results of this National Noise Incidence Survey, which I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-20">20 May 2002</phrase>, established that 24 per cent. of the population was exposed to noise levels between 55&ndash;65 dBLAeq over 24 hours and 2 per cent. of the population was exposed to noise levels greater than 65 dBLAeq over 24 hours. It should be noted that these dBLAeq levels represent the &quot;free field&quot; values outside dwellings. Such levels outside dwellings (i.e. ignoring sound reflected back from the fa&ccedil;ade of the dwelling) are, of course, greater than the actual levels experienced from external sources inside the home. I have arranged for copies of the report to be placed in the Libraries of both houses.</p>

	<p pid=".954W.2/1">The Department takes very seriously the threat to honeybees from pests and diseases and is funding a range of measures to protect bee health, at a cost of around &pound;1.4 million in 2002&ndash;03. Under these measures, the National Bee Unit (NBU), part of the Central Science Laboratory, provides a free diagnostic and inspection service to the beekeeping sector in England as well as training and education to help beekeepers become more self-reliant through improved bee husbandry.</p>

	<p pid=".954W.8/1">The Directive is still the subject of negotiation and, therefore the precise requirements in terms of collection, recovery and recycling are not yet known. The UK will have 18 months from the date the Directive is adopted to transpose the Directive into national law.</p>
	<p pid=".954W.8/2">A substantial quantity of WEEE is currently recovered in the UK, particularly the larger items&mdash;white goods&mdash;such as fridges, cookers and dishwashers. There are adequate facilities for processing the existing disposals of WEEE through a wide range of re-use facilities, treatment sites and shredder operations licensed or registered exempt through the Environment Agency. These include community based refurbishment initiatives for household electrical items, scrap metal processors who take in white goods and shredders which take a range of WEEE in addition to white goods. Smaller items of WEEE, which generally have a high ratio of plastics to metal, are likely to prove the most challenging fraction of WEEE to collect and recycle.</p>
	<p pid=".954W.8/3">We believe the existing recovery and recycling infrastructure will be adequate to meet the targets which are set in the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive. The UK has a long-established and extensive infrastructure for the dismantling, recovery and recycling of ELVs. The Environment Agency currently regulates around 3,500 sites that deal with ELVs. There may, however, need to be an expansion in the market for recycled material from ELVs; we therefore welcome the fact that the Directive encourages the use of such material in vehicle manufacture.</p>
	<p pid=".954W.8/4">The European Commission has proposed a new Directive setting revised recovery and recycling targets for packaging waste for 2006. This is currently being considered by member states.</p>

	<p pid=".957W.0/5" class="indent">(d) Licensing of Crown Copyright (HMSO) (October 2001).</p>
	<p pid=".957W.0/6">The number of respondents for each was as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".957W.0/7" class="indent">(a) Raising the Educational Attainment of Children in Care: 200 responses to the consultation document and 2,000 responses to questionnaires distributed through the &quot;Who Cares?&quot; magazine;</p>

	<p pid=".957W.0/11">The Government's Code of Practice on Written Consultation places an emphasis on making formal national public consultation documents widely available and not restricting them to specific groups or individuals. Consequently there is no requirement in the code to measure the percentage of those specifically consulted who responded. In the case of the HMSO consultation on Licensing of Crown Copyright, for which records were kept on the number specifically consulted, the figure was 17.9 per cent.</p>

The report included three recommendations that were raised for consultation. The consultation exercise is being managed by the Lord Chancellor's Department.

	<p pid=".963W.6/1">A copy of &quot;Married Life&quot; will be placed in the House of Commons Library. &quot;Married Life&quot; is published by Lifecycle Marketing with an editorial board that includes One Plus One and other relationship support organisations. The magazine contains information about the marriage ceremony, relationship and legal issues. In 1999&ndash;2000 the Lord Chancellor's Department gave a one-year grant of &pound;8,500, with the Home Office giving &pound;10,000, to pay jointly for the publication of the magazine. Although the grant was partly funded between this Department and the Home Office, the magazine is not a Government document.</p>

The categories are as set out in s167 (2) of the Housing Act 1996 and include people occupying overcrowded housing. Statutory overcrowding is defined in terms of the room standard and the space standard, which are set out in Part X of the Housing Act 1985. The room standard is contravened when two persons of opposite sexes (over the age of 10), who are not living together as husband and wife, are required to sleep in the same room.</p>

	<p pid=".975W.9/2">It is not possible to quantify the transfer of responsibilities between London and Aberdeen since 1994, but broadly the Aberdeen team has continued to handle fields where operators have their production offices based in Aberdeen. Since 1994, with more companies relocating to Aberdeen from the south-east, there has been an incremental increase in the number of fields transferred to Aberdeen team.</p>

	<p pid=".977W.0/1">The current value to Consignia of business from the Department of Work and Pensions is some &pound;400 million a year.

How that migration affects the revenue of subpostmasters will depend on a number of factors, not least how benefit recipients and other post office customers respond to change.</p>
	<p pid=".977W.0/2">Banking will be a central part of post offices' strategy to move forward. Universal banking services, together with Post Office Limited's plans for an expansion of network banking&mdash;the provision of counter services for ordinary current accounts&mdash;should lead to a substantial increase in the range and volume of banking at post offices, tapping into a very much larger customer base than benefit recipients alone. This should benefit subpostmasters both directly and through increased footfall, providing a major income stream offsetting the loss over time of the benefit book related revenue.</p>
	<p pid=".977W.0/3">Universal banking services are due to be introduced in 2003 when migration of benefit payments by ACT is scheduled to begin. When that happens and whatever account people chose to have their benefits paid into, the Government is committed to ensuring that those who wish to do so will be able to continue to get their benefits in cash at post offices, in full and without charge.</p>

	<p pid=".982W.5/1">The Transparency Review was initiated in 1999 following the Comprehensive Spending Review. Its goal was to improve the accountability within the higher education sector for its use of public funds. The approach taken was to ensure that UK universities adopted a robust costing system to enable them to calculate the full economic costs of their main activities of teaching and research. An activity based costing methodology for this purpose was subsequently developed, and had been adopted by all UK HEIs by the end of 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".982W.8/1">Throughout its life, the Foresight programme has aimed to create new networks linking industry and academia to help the UK make best use of science and technology. Industrial participation remains central to the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.8/2">Of the 13 Foresight panels that were managed from within the Office of Science and Technology over the period 1999&ndash;2002, eight were chaired by industrialists, and about 50 per cent. of panel members were from business. During this period, Foresight established a regional network of coordinators. On-going regional initiatives, led by RDAs and others, working with trade associations and businesses to look ahead and identify opportunities and threats, have now gained a great deal of momentum. We expect this level of industrial engagement in Foresight to continue, and be enhanced by the next phase of projects.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.8/3">Two pilot projects have just been announced, and a full programme will be agreed following wide consultation later this year. Each project will involve first hand input from industry, and will generate information and ideas, many of which will be important for businesses&mdash;to guide their current and future strategic thinking about commercial opportunities and threats.</p>

	<p pid=".983W.2/1">The next phase of the Foresight programme will be composed of a series of discrete projects, forming a rolling programme. A formal process is being instituted to identify suitable projects. The Government's chief scientific adviser (CSA) will be hosting a meeting of leading innovators from industry and academia in July 2002 to generate about a dozen ideas. This will be followed by a wide consultation with stakeholders from business, academia and Government before a formal programme of projects is agreed upon.</p>
	<p pid=".983W.2/2">In order to maintain the momentum of the programme, and to refine the process for taking forward work, two pilot topics have been initiated. These are flood and coastal defence and cognitive systems. These were chosen by the chief scientific adviser, and endorsed by Ministers, after a consultation involving the Foresight Steering Group, the Foresight panels that were in place from 1999&ndash;2002, and Government Departments.</p>

In the associated open event for industry and non-government organisations, Brian Wilson emphasised the role of clean, reliable energy sources in addressing world poverty, and supported the recommendations of the G8 Renewable Energy Task Force. G8 Ministers reaffirmed the importance of renewable sources, as recognised by the Genoa G8 Economic Summit. They committed to encourage the development and introduction of clean energy technologies, including renewables, as well as energy efficiency, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development and elsewhere. They agreed also to strengthen co-operation on energy science and technology, particularly in the areas of emerging renewable sources, energy efficiency, and cleaner energy technologies.</p>

	<p pid=".989W.8/1">Determining the available capacity in gas pipelines is technically very complex and dependent on a number of factors including gas specification, entry location, existing gas flows and relative demand. Pipeline owners therefore undertake calculations on a case by case basis for each new prospective entrant and the results are commercially sensitive. On a broad level, certain pipelines currently have a reasonably constant level of spare capacity while others may have some spare capacity on a seasonal basis only. Additional annual spare capacity in the pipelines to St. Fergus is expected to begin to develop from about 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.8/2">Through PILOT, the Government and industry are pursuing a programme of activities aimed at maximising production of offshore oil and gas and encouraging commercial discussions between UK pipeline owners and Norwegian licensees. These activities, measures in hand to revise the industry's Code of Practice on access to offshore infrastructure, and the development of new guidance on the regulation of third party access to upstream pipelines will help to bring forward new developments which may be expected to utilise existing offshore infrastructure, including the pipelines to St. Fergus.</p>

Friend the Chancellor of Exchequer in Budget 2002 will depend, among other things such as the level of oil and gas prices, on the level of industry investment.

	<p pid=".996W.2/1">We are working closely with the industry and regulatory authorities such as the Environment Agency on tyre disposal and recovery issues. The proper disposal of tyres forms an important element of this work. The agency is committed to a long term programme, leading up to the landfill tyre ban, aimed at improving industry's awareness of its disposal responsibilities, backed up by effective enforcement action. We wholeheartedly endorse this programme and have provided additional funding to strengthen the agency's enforcement capabilities in this area.</p>
	<p pid=".996W.2/2">It will be necessary to ensure that the framework underpinning the tyre landfill ban promotes responsible tyre disposal and recovery. In April, DTI issued a discussion document on used tyre issues which included a possible statutory producer responsibility model. Comments on that discussion paper have been requested by <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-12">12 July 2002</phrase>. We will consider next steps in light of the responses received.</p>

There is one UK representative on the committee and the annual cost is low as this meeting is generally held at the same time and venue place as other fusion meetings, there are therefore no extra travel costs.</p>

It should also be noted that where planning permission is granted this does not necessarily mean that the proposed development or change of use went ahead. Data are not collected centrally on whether planning applications are actually implemented.</p>

	<p pid=".1006W.8/1">The provision of broadcasting services potentially falls within the ambit of the Competition Act 1998 and Fair Trading Acts. Responsibility for considering complaints, and for enforcing the law if necessary, rests with the Office of Fair Trading. In addition, the BBC's commercial activities are subject to its own fair trading commitment, which reflects and in some respects goes beyond the statutory requirements. This is set out in the BBC's published commercial policy guidelines and is monitored by the Board of Governors. An independent review by Professor Richard Whish, published in May 2001, concluded that the fair trading commitment and the guidelines are appropriate to ensure that the BBC does not distort competition in commercial markets and recommended no changes.</p>

	<p pid=".1009W.6/1">The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) helps promote better design for the cultural, social and economic benefits this brings to society. CABE is working closely with the Department for Education and Skills on the design of new education buildings; achieving a high-quality learning environment is key to reducing truancy rates. CABE is working with central and local government and with developers to promote the provision of public transport in all new developments, and thereby reduce traffic congestion. CABE is also working with NHS Estates and individual NHS trusts to ensure that health care services are delivered in well-designed environments.</p>

The proposed Gambling Commission will have greater powers than are currently available to the Gaming Board to vet the suitability of applicants for personal and operating licences; and it will also regulate bookmaking and other sectors of gambling which are currently outside the board's remit. We have emphasised to the gambling industry the importance of supporting the new charitable trust which will fund work to prevent and treat problem gambling; and the trust is this week inviting tenders for work to develop effective strategies for the delivery of research, education and support services.</p>

	<p pid=".1026W.6/2">The following information is taken from the Audit Commission's National Fraud Initiative (NFI) 2000. All data collection and matching is undertaken in accordance with the Code of Data Matching, agreed between the Audit Commission and the Information Commissioner. Because data for matching is drawn from a wide range of data sources, with individuals' details potentially appearing on a number of data submissions, it is not possible to identify the number of individuals for whom data has been collected. However, in its report on the 2000 NFI, the Commission reported that over 14 million records were matched. The Commission's role is to identify matches and report these back to the relevant authorities for further investigation. It is for individual authorities to identify potentially fraudulent matches and to investigate these further, and, if appropriate, prosecute. The Commission does not have details of how many cases fall into these categories. The cost of the Audit Commission's role in NFI 2000 was some &pound;600,000, including staff costs and computer costs. The Commission does not have information on the costs incurred by individual authorities in investigating potentially fraudulent matches. The Commission does not seek to estimate the potential savings arising from NFI. However, in its report on the 2000 NFI, the Commission reported that the value of detected fraud and overpayment, up to the date of publication, was &pound;50 million, an increase of 19 per cent. over the previous NFI undertaken in 1998.</p>

	<p pid=".1029W.6/3">When rolling out their future network needs, and in addition to the statutory consultation requirements, the five mobile phone operators have made a series of commitments to deliver improved communication and consultation with local authorities and local communities. This includes providing local planning authorities with annual rollout plans for each authority's area. We strongly encourage operators and local planning authorities to carry out annual discussions based upon these plans. These will provide an early opportunity to discuss technical and environmental constraints and to explore possible alternative approaches, particularly the opportunities for mast and site sharing and also in terms of the location and design of the apparatus.</p>
	<p pid=".1029W.6/4">The Department is currently drawing up, in partnership with representatives of the mobile phone operators and local government, a revised Code of Best Practice, which will include advice and best practice on the delivery of mobile phone mast development.</p>

	<p pid=".1030W.5/2">The regional development agencies are responsible for administering the single regeneration budget at regional level. The RDAs collect information on grant expenditure and performance data from the regeneration partnerships that manage the individual SRB schemes. The partnerships are required to appraise all projects before grant can be approved. Also, at the end of a scheme, the partnership is required to submit to the RDA a report on the overall achievement of the scheme against the strategic objectives and the end scheme position against the baseline position at the start of the scheme. The RDAs account to the Government for their expenditure, including grant paid to regeneration partnerships under SRB rules, in accordance with detailed reporting requirements and procedures set out in corporate planning and other guidance issued to the RDAs. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister also collects data from the RDAs on selected outputs generated by SRB schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".1030W.5/3">In addition, the Department has commissioned the Department of Land Economy at the University of Cambridge to undertake an eight-year evaluation of the SRB programme. A mid-term report of the evaluation, based on 10 case study SRB partnerships whose activities have completed, was published in January. The findings of this report and earlier reports are published on the Department's website.</p>

The budget for this grant for English authorities in 2002&ndash;03 is &pound;88 million compared with &pound;56 million in 1997&ndash;98, an increase of nearly 60 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".1033W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-29">29 May 2002</phrase>, English Partnerships entered into legally binding contracts with Meridian Delta Ltd. (MDL), a consortium consisting of Lendlease plc and Quintain Estates and Development, and with the Anschutz Entertainment Group, for the redevelopment of the dome and approximately 170 acres of land on the Greenwich peninsula. Under the deal, Anschutz will construct a world-class standard 20,000 seat arena inside the dome, capable of hosting a wide range of entertainment and sporting events. No specific price is being paid for the land under the arena, but its value is reflected in the deal as a whole with MDL. Anschutz is committed to investing &pound;135 million, and English Partnerships will be entitled to a share of profits made by the arena, after a priority return to Anschutz.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/2">In the outer rim of the dome, and spilling out into the northern tip of the peninsula, MDL and Anschutz plan to construct a mix of eating, entertainment and leisure facilities&mdash;this part of the development is known as the dome waterfront. Again, the land value is reflected in the deal as a whole with MDL. MDL and Anschutz are committed to investing at least &pound;65 million. Again English Partnerships will share in profits.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/3">All risk in respect of the dome will transfer to Anschutz and MDL, who are required to maintain the dome until 2018. Should they decide at that time to remove the dome structure and redevelop the land, English Partnerships will be entitled to a 50 per cent. share of redevelopment proceeds. This protects English Partnerships' position on the redevelopment value of the land.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/4">In respect of the rest of the peninsula land in the deal (around 146 acres), English Partnerships and MDL have agreed that they will develop the site jointly. Development is to take place over the next 20 to 25 years, with an end date of 2025. The detailed terms provide for English Partnerships to retain ownership of its land until individual plots are required for development. The payout will work as follows: first, an agreed minimum land value, on the sale of any parcel of land&mdash;this protects against any downturn&mdash;secondly, the uplift in the value of land, after planning permission and at the point of sale to a developer, to reflect development value. Calculation of the split varies across the phases of development, but broadly evens out to 50:50&mdash;after costs&mdash;assuming development of about 14 million square feet. Where MDL develops land itself, English Partnerships will receive the agreed minimum land value plus a share of sale proceeds, or the value of the development&mdash;both after costs&mdash;once the development is complete.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/5">Under the terms of the original acquisition of the land, British Gas is entitled to 7.5 per cent. of sale proceeds or open market value across the site. This would apply in relation to any onward sale of land on the Greenwich peninsula by English Partnerships.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/6">No negotiations between English Partnerships and British Gas have yet taken place on how exactly British Gas's entitlement is to be interpreted in the context of the deal with MDL and Anschutz. English Partnerships will ensure that the outcome of those negotiations represents good value for money for the public purse.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/7">The deal's three parts&mdash;dome, dome waterfront, and the rest of the land&mdash;are subject to the grant of planning permission. Participants envisage making an application in the autumn. Until planning permission is granted the site will remain the responsibility of English Partnerships.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/8">In agreeing to accept the terms of this deal, the Government have focused on four main aspects: value for money; regeneration benefits for the area; deliverability and a proper use for the dome.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/9">As regards value for money, we have made it clear that we would only proceed with any deal if it provided proper value for money for the Government. That included comparison with the value for money which could be delivered by demolishing the dome, or by alternative development scenarios retaining the dome. The net present value of the agreements that I have just outlined to English Partnerships, assuming the full scheme is developed, is around &pound;240 million as estimated by independent advisers. The expected cash to be received over a period of around 20 years will be up to &pound;550 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/10">The division of these proceeds between the Millennium Commission and English Partnerships has not been finally agreed. At the time of the Legacy deal a formula was agreed. Because that deal was of an entirely different sort to this one, the precise application of the formula to this deal needs to be considered further. But a fair split will be worked out. The process of working out that split does not affect the deal English Partnerships has done with MDL and Anschutz. On the basis of independent advice, we are satisfied that the deal is good value for money.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/11">If the site had been sold outright now with no joint development agreement, the estimated value of the site&mdash;the amount we would have obtained in the market&mdash;was considerably less than the net present value of the deal of around &pound;240 million. This is so whether the dome was there or not.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/12">The other main comparator that we have considered is whether this current deal would have produced a higher return had the dome been demolished and the land under it dealt with in the same way as the wider peninsula lands. Independent advice from Jones Lang Lasalle satisfies us that the value to the Government of demolishing the dome would produce a lower return for the Government than preserving the dome, and developing the site in the agreed way. To make available more land by the demolition would not increase the amount of land which could be developed because the constraints on development over the period of the development are not the amount of land but planning and transport.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/13">Moreover, we have received professional advice that the establishment of a successful and iconic venue enhances the value of the rest of the development.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/14">These agreements allow the Government to participate in the increasing value of the land across the peninsula. This is sensible, and in the public interest. As the development proceeds, land values will increase. This will be reflected in the land value element in the payment to English Partnerships when the land is sold for development.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/15">The deal also ensures a return to English Partnerships if the dome site is redeveloped at some point in the future. In addition, English Partnerships will share in profits from the arena and from the dome waterfront development.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/16">The deal contains no promise by the Government to a particular crossing across the Thames. There is no commitment of any sort in the deal or associated with it. MDL has confirmed this.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/17">The issue of enhancing the transport infrastructure is of huge importance to many communities in and around London. The increased activity on the Greenwich peninsula which comes from this development will inevitably be a factor which will bear on those decisions. But there is no promise on this issue in connection with the deal. The question of river crossings is a very complex regional issue, extending well beyond the Greenwich peninsula and relating to traffic flows across the region, not just in respect of individual developments.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/18">As regards regeneration benefits, the Greenwich peninsula has for decades been contaminated and badly connected to the rest of London. It has been de-contaminated and the Jubilee line extension brings with it good transport links. This development will bring tens of thousands of jobs and up to 7,000 new homes, many of them affordable. We believe that it will have a significant regeneration effect. It will create a new mini city. The MDL scheme outperforms any other scheme in regeneration benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/19">As regards deliverability, the participants in the development include players with established records in delivering developments of the size and quality this project requires. This is their core business.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/20">Anschutz Entertainment Group is part of the Anschutz Corporation, one of the largest private corporations in the United States of America. It has world-wide sporting and entertainment interests including the Staples Centre arena in Los Angeles. It has the resources to develop and the track record which shows that it can do it. It has the energy and commitment to deliver.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/21">Lendlease is a major development company. It is quoted on the Australian stock exchange, operates in 40 countries and has a market capitalisation of around &pound;2 billion. Quintain is quoted on the London stock exchange and has gross assets of &pound;637 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/22">Lendlease owns Bovis in the UK and has successfully developed the Sydney Olympic village and Bluewater shopping centre. It is currently project manager for the ground zero project in New York.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/23">These players have the resources, the experience and the ability to deliver.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/24">As regards a suitable use for the dome, by creating an arena and associated entertainment and leisure facilities we have found an appropriate use for what is widely acknowledged to be a high quality landmark building. Public access is assured. Keeping the dome as the lynchpin of the development has been welcomed by the London borough of Greenwich and the Mayor's office.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/25">The agreements represent excellent value for money. The deal brings substantial regeneration benefits for the immediate area and beyond. It brings into the development players of proven ability and resource. It ensures that the public sector can participate in the increase in value of the whole estate as the development proceeds. It represents a fitting use for the dome which will enhance the value of the whole project and attract people and economic activity.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/26">A huge amount of work has gone into this deal. It represents a very secure foundation on which the Government and their private-sector partners can proceed to deliver the benefits that are available to be harvested from the dome, and for the peninsula. We considered all other options but none offered comparable benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/27">The deal will deliver excellent value for money, thousands of jobs and homes, an exciting use of one of London's landmark buildings and the continued regeneration of a key site in the evolution of Greenwich, London and the Thames Gateway.</p>

	<p pid=".1042W.5/1">Local education authorities have a duty to secure sufficient schools in their areas and, in doing so, have regard to the need for securing that special educational provision is made for pupils who have special educational needs, including children with autism. Each year authorities must submit for approval, to the local School Organisation Committee, a School Organisation Plan setting out how they will secure sufficient provision, including the provision proposed for children with special educational needs. Local Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships are responsible locally, in association with local education authorities, for early years education and child care provision and are making special educational needs support a priority between 2002&ndash;03 and 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".1042W.5/2">Children with autism are benefiting along with all other children from the considerable extra resources this Government have devoted to education, including the three-fold increase in the capital spending on schools from &pound;775 million in 1997&ndash;98 to &pound;2.2 billion in 2001&ndash;02. The forthcoming guidance from the Department's Autism Working Group will help schools and local education authorities use the available resources to plan and make good quality provision for children with autistic spectrum disorders.</p>

	<p pid=".1053W.2/1">Teachers in maintained schools are subject to national schoolteachers' pay and conditions. Further education sector colleges are run by independent corporations established under the Further Education and Higher Education Act 1992 and there is no national pay structure in place. Colleges are free to establish pay scales that meet their needs and can be agreed with their staff. This Government have acknowledged the historic funding gap between schools and FE and we have pledged to bring up levels of funding and ensure upward convergence over time. Annual funding for FE has increased by over &pound;1.1 billion between 1997 and 2002&ndash;03, up to around &pound;4.3 billion. With a further increase of &pound;300 million planned next year, the real terms increase in total funding between 1997 and 2003&ndash;04 will be 26 per cent. The Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI) budget is &pound;311 million over the period 2001&ndash;04. This is to reward excellent teaching and is over and above any general pay rise. The additional investment we are making in the FE sector should help meet the pay aspirations of their staff.</p>

From September this year, new teachers in shortage subject areas may qualify for payments of &pound;4,000 under the &quot;Golden Hellos&quot; initiative and later this year, subject to the passing of legislation by Parliament, we will introduce a pilot scheme to help to pay off, over time, the student loans of newly appointed teachers in shortage subjects in England and Wales.</p>

We have also introduced training bursaries for FE teachers in pilot institutions.</p>
	<p pid=".1053W.5/3">Recruiting and training new staff is just one element of the Government's plans to improve the quality and responsiveness of further education. We have therefore started a debate with the sector and will announce later this year our proposals for implementing a strategy, supported by the outcomes of the Spending Review, to raise standards and performance and meet employer and skill needs.</p>

	<p pid=".1053W.8/1">Teachers in maintained schools are subject to national schoolteachers' pay and conditions. Further education sector colleges are run by independent corporations established under the Further Education and Higher Education Act 1992 and there is no national pay structure in place. Colleges are free to establish pay scales that meet their needs and can be agreed with their staff. This Government has acknowledged the historic funding gap between schools and FE and we have pledged to bring up levels of funding and ensure upward convergence over time. Annual funding for FE has increased by over &pound;1.1 billion between 1997 and 02&ndash;03, up to around &pound;4.3 billion. With a further increase of &pound;300 million planned next year, the real terms increase in total funding between 1997 and 03&ndash;04 will be 26 per cent. The Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI) budget is &pound;311 million over the period 2001&ndash;04. This is to reward excellent teaching and is over and above any general pay rise. The additional investment we are making in the FE sector should help meet the pay aspirations of their staff.</p>

	<p pid=".1057W.2/2">The Government aims, over time, to ensure affordable, accessible, good quality child care in every neighbourhood, and to ensure a good quality free early education place for every three and four year old. Londoners are benefiting from the range of measures within the national child care strategy. For example: between 1997 and 2001, 122,000 new child care places have been created in London; in financial year 2002&ndash;03 we will pay some &pound;16.7 million in child care grant to London local education authorities to support further development of new child care places; and we are targeting disadvantaged areas in London for 9,060 new neighbourhood nurseries places over the three years to March 2004, with total revenue support of some &pound;39.9 million and capital support of some &pound;16.9 million.</p>

	<p pid=".1066W.2/1">The guidance contained in the new SEN Code of Practice, which came into force in January 2002, does not assume that there are hard and fast categories of special educational need. It recognises that each child is unique and the questions asked by LEAs should recognise that there is a wide spectrum of special educational needs that are frequently inter-related, although there are also specific needs that usually relate directly to particular types of impairment. Children will have needs and requirements which may fall into at least one of four areas, and many children will have inter- related needs. The impact of these combinations on the child's ability to function, learn and succeed should be taken into account. The areas of need are: communication and interaction; cognition and learning; behaviour, emotional and social development and sensory and/or physical.</p>
	<p pid=".1066W.2/2">Information on numbers of children with specific types of handicap is not available centrally. The Department is considering introducing a requirement for schools and local education authorities to provide this information from 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".1068W.12/1">The 1998 European Union expert report concluded that currently available data indicate that mercury from dental amalgam restorations will not cause an unacceptable health risk to the general population. There is little evidence that an unacceptable health risk is associated with occupational exposure of dental personnel providing due care is used in the preparation and handling of dental amalgam. The same report also concluded that there is no scientific evidence that the use of dental amalgam is related to adverse effects on pre and post-natal health or fertility. There are therefore no plans to commission further research into amalgam safety. However, it remains the Department's advice that dentists should continue to avoid or delay any dental intervention or medication during pregnancy.</p>

From September 1996, the registration period was changed from 24 months to 15 months for adults, and from 12 months to 15 months for children. As a result of this, data held on registration numbers after 1997 are not comparable to earlier years. The data may also be affected by gradual improvements in the methods used for the removal of duplicate registration records, which were first employed by the dental practice board in 1993.</p>

The Department recognises the significant breadth of contributions made to the NHS at all levels by voluntary, community and charitable organisations. At national level these range from membership of the Department's policy development groups to contributing to specific consultation exercises. Locally voluntary organisations often provide specific services, for example volunteer hospital transport schemes to enable better patient access; and providing information and support networks for patients, their carers and families, about living with specific medical conditions.</p>

	<p pid=".1074W.5/3">The Department recognises that some people find complementary medicine treatments helpful in relieving the symptoms of certain conditions, particularly chronic conditions for which conventional medicine cannot provide a complete solution. Complementary medicine treatments, may be provided on the national health service if those responsible for commissioning health services on behalf of patients locally (primary care trusts) consider that they are a clinically and cost effective means of meeting an identified health need.</p>

	<p pid=".1077W.5/1">The main Government agency for research into the cause and treatments of disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC) which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry. The MRC spend is available from 1999 and is an estimated &pound;12.9 million on research relevant to arthritis.</p>
	<p pid=".1077W.5/2">The Department funds research to support policy and the delivery of effective practice in the national health service. The departmental spend on directly commissioned research projects on arthritis since 1997 is an estimated &pound;2.5 million. The Department has also funded projects relevant to arthritis but with wider relevance, and the expenditure on these has not been counted.</p>
	<p pid=".1077W.5/3">In addition to specific projects, the Department provides support for research commissioned by charities and the research councils that takes place in the NHS. Management of much of the research supported by NHS research and development funding is devolved and expenditure at project level is not held centrally by the Department. The total investment is considerably greater than the spend on directly commissioned projects.</p>
	<p pid=".1077W.5/4">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) was asked to appraise the use of infliximab (Remicade) and etanecerpt (Enbrel) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. NICE issued its guidance on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-22">22 March 2002</phrase>. NICE has recommended the use of etanercept for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and etanercept and infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</p>
	<p pid=".1077W.5/5">There are no payments made to sufferers of arthritis to assist with medication costs. People with arthritis are entitled to free NHS prescriptions if the patient is under 16 (or under 19 if in full-time education); aged 60 or over; or holds an exemption certificate; or is entitled on the grounds of low income. Prescription prepayment certificates save money for anyone who needs more than a certain number of items over a particular period.</p>

	<p pid=".1080W.3/1">The results of the unannounced inspections of the quality of hospital food will be published at the same time as those of the patient environment assessments undertaken between February and May 2002. The quality of hospital food will be assessed against a 'traffic light' criteria where 'Red' is further improvement needed, 'Amber' acceptable and 'Green' good. The inspections are currently under way and we expect to publish the results shortly.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-06-10.56944.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2002-06-10.1083W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/737" speakername="Hazel Blears" colnum="1083W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo020610/text/20610w86.htm#20610w86.html_spnew3">
	<p pid=".1083W.2/1">The principal source of information in respect of establishing historic compliance with fire safety requirements is the estates return information collection (ERIC) system where data is returned annually by national health service trusts up to the end of the financial year being reported. Data in respect of non-NHS trust property that form part of the NHS estate (eg health authority offices, primary care groups etc.) are not available.</p>
	<p pid=".1083W.2/2">The most relevant indicator is 'Costs to Achieve Statutory Fire Safety Compliance Standard B (excluding fire safety)'. In this context, condition B is the minimum standard required and is defined in the NHS guidance, estatecode, as meaning buildings which do not have backlog maintenance costs in respect of fire safety deficiencies and which comply with NHS firecode guidance and statutory requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".1083W.2/3">NHS trust accommodation which is currently below condition B standard will include that for which there is work outstanding that is of a relatively low risk but required under statutory legislation. The NHS is always striving to keep up to-date with new legislation and to provide a safe environment for patients, staff and visitors.</p>
	<p pid=".1083W.2/4">Fire safety is a serious issue, which is why we have set targets for the NHS in this area and every effort is made to remedy any concerns expressed by local enforcement bodies as quickly as possible. This is reflected in the extremely small numbers of injuries and deaths arising as a result of fires in NHS hospitals in England despite the high volumes of people who access healthcare premises annually. I have also imposed targets set by HSC 1999/191 to reduce backlog maintenance costs associated with fire safety and to achieve compliance with firecode.</p>
	<p pid=".1083W.2/5">The following table identifies the percentage of NHS trusts in England, over the five year period 1996&ndash;97 to 2000&ndash;01, who report having achieved the desired condition B standard having zero backlog maintenance costs associated with fire safety compliance:</p>
	<table>
		<caption>Percentage of total to achieve estatecode condition B&mdash;fire safety</caption>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".1083W.2/9"> <th><i>Year</i></th> <th><i></i></th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".1083W.2/12"> <td>1996&ndash;97</td> <td>8.4</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1083W.2/13"> <td>1997&ndash;98</td> <td>9.4</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1083W.2/14"> <td>1998&ndash;99</td> <td>9.8</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1083W.2/15"> <td>1999&ndash;2000</td> <td>11.1</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1083W.2/16"> <td>2000&ndash;01</td> <td>21.0</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".1083W.2/19">These figures demonstrate that the numbers of NHS trusts which comply with the fire code requirement are increasing. Clearly, we can do more, and we are doing so through setting and monitoring the aforementioned targets. In addition, progress is expected to further accelerate as the outcome of the increased major capital investment programme in the NHS reaches fruition.</p>
	<p pid=".1083W.2/20">With regard to the current outstanding cost of repairs, the most recent data available are for the year 2000&ndash;01. This shows that the total cost of backlog maintenance for NHS trusts in England to achieve estatecode condition B in respect of fire safety compliance at the end of the fiscal year 2000&ndash;01 is &pound;239 million. Planned major capital investment throughout the NHS should see the eradication of a large proportion of this backlog.</p>

	<p pid=".1084W.2/1">The principal source of information in respect of establishing historic compliance with health and safety requirements is the estates return information collection (ERIC) system where data are returned annually by national health service trusts up to the end of the financial year being reported. Data in respect of non-NHS trust property that form part of the NHS estate (eg health authority offices, primary care groups etc.) are not available.</p>
	<p pid=".1084W.2/2">The most relevant indicator is 'Costs to Achieve Statutory Health &amp; Safety Compliance Standard B (excluding fire safety)'. In this context, condition B is the minimum standard that NHS trusts are required to meet and is defined in the NHS guidance, estatecode, as meaning buildings which do not have backlog maintenance costs in respect of health and safety deficiencies and which comply with statutory requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".1084W.2/3">NHS trust accommodation which is currently below condition B standards will include that for which there is work outstanding that is of a relatively low risk but required under statutory legislation. The NHS is always striving to keep up to-date with new legislation and to provide a safe environment for patients, staff and visitors.</p>
	<p pid=".1084W.2/4">Health and safety is a serious issue, which is why we have set targets for the NHS in this area and every effort is made to remedy any concerns expressed by local enforcement bodies as quickly as possible. This is reflected in the relatively few numbers of health and safety incidents reported under the mandatory Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR). I have also imposed targets set by HSC 1999&ndash;191 to reduce backlog maintenance costs associated with health and safety requirements and to achieve statutory compliance.</p>
	<p pid=".1084W.2/5">The following table shows the percentage of NHS trusts in England, over the five year period 1996&ndash;97 to 2000&ndash;01, who report having achieved the desired condition B standard:</p>
	<table>
		<caption>Percentage of total to achieve estatecode condition B&mdash;health and safety</caption>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".1084W.2/9"> <th><i>Year</i></th> <th><i></i></th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".1084W.2/12"> <td>1996&ndash;97</td> <td>10.3</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1084W.2/13"> <td>1997&ndash;98</td> <td>9.0</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1084W.2/14"> <td>1998&ndash;99</td> <td>9.6</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1084W.2/15"> <td>1999&ndash;2000</td> <td>7.8</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".1084W.2/16"> <td>2000&ndash;01</td> <td>18.9</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".1084W.2/19">These figures demonstrate that the numbers of NHS trusts which comply with the health and safety requirement are increasing despite the continual introduction of new legislation. Clearly, we can do more, and we are doing so through setting and monitoring the aforementioned targets. In addition, progress is expected to further accelerate as the outcome of the increased major capital investment programme in the NHS reaches fruition.</p>
	<p pid=".1084W.2/20">With regard to the current outstanding cost of repairs, the most recent data available are for the year 2000&ndash;01. This shows that the total cost of backlog maintenance for NHS trusts in England to achieve estatecode condition B in respect of statutory health and safety compliance at the end of the fiscal year 2000&ndash;01 is &pound;355 million. Planned major capital investment throughout the NHS should see the eradication of a large proportion of this backlog.</p>

The Medicines Control Agency undertakes a wide range of evaluative activity in relation to herbal and homeopathic medicines, many of which have a basis in tradition. These activities include determining whether a product should be classified as a medicine, assessing applications for marketing authorisations for herbal medicines, assessing applications under the homeopathic registration scheme, and assessing safety and compliance issues affecting licensed and unlicensed herbal and homeopathic medicines.</p>
	<p pid=".1086W.14/2">The Department has directly funded a number of research projects which fall within the broad definition of traditional and alternative medicine, most of which are on-going, at a total cost of about &pound;600,000.</p>
	<p pid=".1086W.14/3">In addition, the Cochrane collaboration in the United Kingdom receives substantial support from the NHS research and development levy, and has contributed a large number of systematic reviews of alternative therapies to the Cochrane database of systematic reviews. The website of the Cochrane complementary field (http://www.compmed.umm.edu/Compmed/Cochrane/ Cochrane.htm) lists the titles of those Cochrane reviews.</p>

	<p pid=".1089W.8/2">Prior to <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-05">5 April 1999</phrase> national health service trusts had responsibility for collecting from insurers charges for hospital treatment following road traffic accidents under the provisions of sections 157 and 158 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. Trust accounts show the following amounts of road traffic income since 1994, the earliest year for which information is available:</p>

	<p pid=".1091W.5/1">The protocol for the United Kingdom's Biobank project was developed following extensive consultation with the scientific community. Independent international scientific peer review was used to inform the funding decisions made by the Department, the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Councils. In all, 12 experts were involved, 10 of whom were from overseas, including the United States of America, Australia and various European countries. None of these had prior involvement in the development of the protocol nor were they involved with organisations likely to participate in the study or benefit financially. A scientific management committee composed of senior scientific advisers will be responsible for overseeing data collection, setting targets, agreeing changes to the protocol, and monitoring scientific output. Scrutiny of the scientific protocol will be an on-going process and it is therefore considered unlikely that an additional body undertaking further independent scientific peer review will add significant value to the UK Biobank project.</p>

	<p pid=".1091W.8/2">From 1998 when 17-year-olds were permitted to donate blood the numbers doing so increased for two consecutive years.

	<p pid=".1093W.8/1">Reports of links between chemicals in vegetables and cancer of the oesophagus relate to speculation concerning possible effects of nitrate. I am informed that the Food Standards Agency (FSA) is aware of the scientific developments in this area and is investigating the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.8/2">Vegetables, particularly green leafy vegetables, contain the highest concentrations of nitrate in the diet. Although some of this nitrate comes from the use of conventional and organic nitrogen fertilisers on crops most is naturally occurring. Low light intensity during the growing period is the main influence on nitrate concentrations in plant tissue.</p>
	<p pid=".1093W.8/3">Many studies have investigated the possibility of a link between nitrate and cancer, but these have failed to provide convincing evidence that nitrate intake in the UK causes cancer. A new study by Professor McColl at the University of Glasgow has speculated on a possible association with oesophageal cancer in Scotland. The FSA agree with Professor McColl that the results are preliminary and require further investigation. Other areas of the United Kingdom with high nitrate intakes do not show similar high levels of the oesophageal cancer reported in Scotland. There is also new evidence available which suggests that dietary nitrate has beneficial effects. The FSA has commissioned a three-year project to characterise the potential benefits versus possible toxicity to humans from nitrate in the diet. The results of this work will be available later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".1095W.3/2">In guidance on the use of the drug methylphenidate in the treatment of ADHD in children, published in October 2000 by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), it was made clear that a diagnosis of ADHD should be based on a timely, comprehensive assessment conducted by a child/adolescent psychiatrist or a paediatrician with expertise in this disorder. Referrals for specialist assessment can come from a number of sources including family members, general practitioners, social workers and teachers. NICE also recommended that drug treatment with methylphenidate, where appropriate, should be seen as part of a comprehensive treatment programme, which includes psychological, educational and social interventions, for children with a diagnosis of severe ADHD.</p>

	<p pid=".1100W.5/1">All national health service bodies are already required by data protection legislation to provide patients with information about all likely processing and disclosures of personal data. The Information Commissioner has recently published guidance on the &quot;Use and Disclosure of Health Data&quot; which clarifies these requirements. The right to object to processing of personal data where the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002 are in effect is provided by the Data Protection Act 1998 and awareness of these rights is promoted by the Information Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid=".1100W.5/2">However, the Department will be issuing guidance to health service bodies that will both complement the Information Commissioner's and make it clear that where patients object to a disclosure under the permissive provisions of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002, their objections should normally be respected. A sample leaflet for informing patients about the regulations and what they should do if they are unhappy about possible disclosures will be included within this guidance.</p>

This will enable the parents to have their baby buried or cremated. The Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society's Guidelines &quot;Pregnancy loss and the death of a baby. Guidelines for professionals (1995)&quot; recognise that forms and certificates are often greatly valued by parents who otherwise may have little or no evidence or mementoes of their baby's existence. It states that it is good practice to offer all parents a copy to keep, whether or not they need it for practical reasons and that the documents should, where possible, be sensitively and sympathetically worded.</p>

	<p pid=".1104W.5/2">The national quality assurance framework on exercise referral systems, published last year, aims to improve the quality of existing referral schemes and help the development of new ones. The guidelines were also promoted at two regional seminars for primary care and leisure services. The Department does not keep a national register of practices which offer these schemes, or the number of participants. These details are held locally by primary care trusts (PCTs) or local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".1104W.5/3">The Department does not organise and centrally fund such schemes. It is up to PCTs, in conjunction with local authorities, to determine whether an exercise referral scheme fits with their broader plans for promoting physical activity.</p>
	<p pid=".1104W.5/4">The Department has funded two reviews by the former health education authority that documented progress and effectiveness of exercise referral schemes. The research showed that better designed referral schemes can lead to small levels of increased participation in activity, but that practice across the country was highly variable. There is on-going research of &pound;1.1 million via the health technology assessment programme, including two projects looking at exercise referral schemes.</p>

It has not yet been possible to publish proposals for reform, because of the complexity of the issues raised by potential reforms, the need to consult widely (including through the Lord Chancellor's Department on how compensation is paid) and also to consider how potential proposals sit alongside a concurrent review of the NHS complaints procedure. Nevertheless, the CMO has now held the last of his advisory group meetings and will shortly publish the findings along with recommendations for reform.</p>

It has not yet been possible to publish proposals for reform, because of the complexity of the issues raised by potential reforms, the need to consult widely (including through the Lord Chancellor's Department on how compensation is paid) and also to consider how potential proposals sit alongside a concurrent review of the NHS complaints procedure. Nevertheless, the CMO has now held the last of his advisory group meetings and will shortly publish the findings along with recommendations for reform.</p>

	<p pid=".1114W.5/2">Information is not collected centrally on the number of pupil drop-in surgeries run by school nurses, nor are numbers of nurses employed in the school health service collected separately from returns on the overall community nurse work force. Expansion of the school nursing service is a matter for primary care trusts, which are tasked with providing for the health care needs of their local population.</p>
	<p pid=".1114W.5/3">Services to pupils normally provided by the school nursing service include supporting children and young people with medical needs in schools. Services are also designed to reduce health inequalities through programmes to improve and protect health such as sexual health and relationships, accident prevention, nutrition and physical activity, parenting, smoking cessation, and immunisation.</p>
	<p pid=".1114W.5/4">Improving the health of children and young people and reducing inequalities are priorities for this Government. Additional work is being developed within the children's national service framework, national healthy schools standard and the teenage pregnancy unit.</p>

	<p pid=".1116W.5/2">Since the formation of the National Health Service Counter Fraud Service (NHS CFS) in 1998, every health body is required in Secretary of State Directions to have a dedicated and accredited local counter fraud specialist (LCFS) who can be contacted by NHS staff to report any suspicion of fraud in the NHS. One of the many functions of the LCFS is to contribute to a wider change in public and staff attitudes towards fraud in the national health service, using a variety of measures to develop an anti-fraud culture.</p>
	<p pid=".1116W.5/3">In addition, the NHS CFS has the Fraud and Corruption Reporting Line (FCRL), which is a secure channel for members of the public and NHS staff to report any suspicion of fraud in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".1116W.5/4">A series of fraud awareness presentations (FAPs) has also been given to every health authority, NHS trust, primary care trust and local professional committee, to not only provide details of the work of the NHS CFS but how to report a suspicion of fraud through their LCFS, regional NHS CFS office or the FCRL.</p>
	<p pid=".1116W.5/5">Over 600 of these presentations have been delivered to date and questionnaires completed by attendees reflect the development of an anti-fraud culture. The questionnaires have shown 99 per cent. of NHS staff are now clear about their role in countering fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".1116W.5/6">The NHS CFS also has a series of counter-fraud charters signed with all of the professional associations, 113 patient groups and the Royal College of Nursing. The number of NHS staff and contractors covered by counter-fraud charter agreements to work together to counter fraud is more than 400,000. Work continues to increase this number.</p>
	<p pid=".1116W.5/7">These charters demonstrate the development of a real anti-fraud culture among those working within the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".1117W.8/1">Most patients want the best treatment at a convenient place and service agreements will be designed to secure this. It is why we have embarked on a radical programme of modernisation to improve access, reduce unfair variation, raise standards, and provide quicker and more convenient services. Our programme of work includes a national service framework for the delivery of modern mental health and social services, and significant extra investment.</p>
	<p pid=".1117W.8/2">Following 'Shifting the Balance of Power' primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for commissioning services for their populations. They are accountable to their strategic health authority (StHA) for discharging this function effectively. PCTs will provide some services themselves and will also commission service from other providers, both local and non local. With regard to more specialised services that, by their very nature, are provided from relatively few providers, PCTs will increasingly have collaborative commissioning arrangements with other PCTs. This will enable them to pool expertise and ensure sufficient dedicated capacity to develop effective health needs assessments, and plan and secure delivery of services. In addition, there is the flexibility within the national health service of making referrals into the private sector if, in the judgment of clinicians and commissioners, an individual's needs warrant this, and the service is an appropriate one.</p>

	<p pid=".1118W.2/1">Central records are not kept of commissioning by primary care trusts of the services listed. However, we are well aware that these approaches are of benefit in mental health promotion, and in the treatment of mental illness. Clinical decisions about their use for individual patients are taken locally in the context of national guidance, the evidence base, and the available resources. We have set out seven standards for the delivery of effective mental health services in the mental health national service framework. Standards one, two and three set out the action needed to ensure effective access to assessment and treatment in and through primary care. The Department published an evidence based clinical guideline 'Treatment Choice in Psychological Therapies and Counselling' to help guide referrers. 'Making it happen&mdash;A guide to delivering mental health promotion' was published by the Department later in 2001; it contains a section entitled 'Physical activity as treatment', and in March 2001 we published a response to the Lords inquiry on complementary medicine, welcoming the report's recommendations.</p>

	<p pid=".1119W.2/1">The advisory committee on pharmaceutical training (ACPT) is one of a group of committees set up to advise the European Commission and member states on matters relating to the training of workers whose professions come under sectoral directives guaranteeing free movement and automatic recognition of qualifications.</p>
	<p pid=".1119W.2/2">The ACPT was set up by Council Decision 85/434/EEC. Its mandate is set down in Article 2, which states that:</p>
	<p pid=".1119W.2/3" class="indent">1. The task of the Committee shall be to help to ensure a comparably high standard of pharmaceutical training in the Community.</p>
	<p pid=".1119W.2/4" class="indent">2. It shall carry out this task, in particular, by the following means:</p>
	<p pid=".1119W.2/5" class="indent">exchange of comprehensive information as to the training methods and the content, level and structure of theoretical and practical courses provided in the member states,</p>
	<p pid=".1119W.2/6" class="indent">discussion and consultation with the object of developing a common approach to the standard to be attained in the training of pharmacists and, as appropriate, to the structure and content of such training,</p>
	<p pid=".1119W.2/7" class="indent">keeping under review the adaptation of the pharmaceutical training to developments in pharmaceutical science and teaching methods.</p>
	<p pid=".1119W.2/8" class="indent">3. The Committee shall communicate to the Commission and the member states its opinions and recommendations including, when it considers it appropriate, suggestions for amendments to be made to the articles relating to pharmaceutical training in Council Directives 85/432/EEC and 85/433/EEC.</p>
	<p pid=".1119W.2/9" class="indent">4. The Committee shall also advise the Commission on any other matter which the Commission may refer to it in relation to pharmaceutical training.</p>
	<p pid=".1119W.2/10">Each advisory committee has three experts from each member state&mdash;one each from the practising profession, the education establishments and the competent authorities concerned. Three alternates are also appointed. Members and alternates are nominated by Ministers, following consultation with the relevant professional bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".1119W.2/11">The advisory committee members' expenses fall to be paid by the Commission (or on occasion by the professions concerned). There is thus no direct charge to public funds.</p>
	<p pid=".1119W.2/12">Member states are currently considering Commission proposals for streamlining the directives and processes relating to free movement of professionals. None of the advisory committees has met during the last 12 months; and none of them has any items under consideration.</p>
	<p pid=".1119W.2/13">In April this year, the issues arising from the Commission's proposals for the future of professional recognition were submitted to the Parliamentary Scrutiny Committees (Explanatory Memorandum No. 7239/02&mdash;COM(2002)119final).</p>

	<p pid=".1120W.2/1">Under EU Directive 2001/37/EC on the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products, provision is made for a Committee to be set up to assist the European Commission in developing and updating the provisions of the Directive. The Committee is currently in the process of being set up and its first meeting is anticipated to take place before the end of this year. The United Kingdom will be represented by one expert, and the costs associated with it are not yet known. The work programme of the Committee has not been confirmed but is likely to build on Article 11 of the Directive, which highlights a number of areas which should be reviewed or developed in the light of developments in scientific and technical knowledge.</p>
