In respect of overseas travel by Ministers, since 1999 the Government have published an annual list of all visits overseas undertaken by Cabinet Ministers costing &pound;500 or more during each financial year. The list published in 1999 covers the period <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="1999-03-31">31 March 1999</phrase>. Where RAF/Private Charter aircraft are used this is shown in the list. The Government have also published on an annual basis the cost of all Ministers' visits overseas. Copies of the lists are available in the Libraries of the House. Information for 2004&ndash;05 will be published in due course.</p>

However, the Regulation also allows the Agency to use the national authorities to carry out on its behalf tasks that need to be performed to meet its own responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1020W.2/2">The Agency does not have a physical presence in the United Kingdom. While it has been recruiting staff to its offices in Cologne and establishing necessary procedures, all the necessary technical work to meet its responsibilities in the UK have been carried out on its behalf by the UK Civil Aviation Authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1020W.2/3">In 2004, the European Aviation Safety Agency approved the following airworthiness-related items for United Kingdom companies and UK-registered aircraft on the basis of investigations and recommendations made by the UK Civil Aviation Authority:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid="a.1020W.2/6"> <th></th> <th>Number</th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.1020W.2/9"> <td>Modifications to aircraft</td> <td>2,201</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1020W.2/10"> <td>Repairs to aircraft</td> <td>1,910</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1020W.2/11"> <td>Airworthiness Directives and related items</td> <td>60</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1020W.2/12"> <td>Approval of organisations that design aircraft</td> <td>27</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.1020W.2/13"> <td>Total</td> <td>4,198</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.1020W.2/16">For some aircraft types operating on the UK register the Agency has assigned the airworthiness-related tasks in the categories above to other national aviation authorities, or to multi-national teams that include personnel from the EU national aviation authorities and, in some cases, employees of the Agency. As these tasks were undertaken in other countries, accurate information on the number and nature of approvals granted is not held in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1020W.2/17">The Agency does not have a publications service. During the last 12 months, the Agency has issued a considerable number of documents, including detailed consultations, information leaflets and the minutes of its Management Board's meetings, all of which can be accessed on the Agency's website at <a href="http://www.easa.eu.int">www.easa.eu.int</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1034W.0/1">Despite large increases in Government funding&mdash;up from &pound;312 million in 1997&ndash;98 to &pound;570 million in 2005&ndash;06&mdash;there is still not enough to fund all worthwhile proposals from the flood and coastal defence operating authorities (the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards). Defra therefore operates an objective and published priority scoring system which is intended to direct our finite funds to best effect nationally, to maximise the benefit obtained from the programme as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.0/2">The current scoring system was introduced in 2003 after extensive consultation following a pilot introduced in 1997. In summary, proposed projects are scored on three elements&mdash;their estimated economic benefits, the number of people they are likely to protect and protection and enhancement of environmental and/or heritage assets. All three are compared to cost so that projects are treated fairly regardless of size. The higher the score, the higher the priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.0/3">In order to be eligible for funding from Defra, projects must achieve Defra's published threshold score for the year in which they start. The threshold scores were last revised in November 2004 to take account of changes in operating authorities' investment plans. Because of an increased demand for grant nationally, the thresholds had to rise and are now 19 for projects to start in 2005&ndash;06 or 2006&ndash;07 and 15 in 2007 08.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.0/4">The scoring system has no effect on the overall sum available for grant aid. It does not attempt to allocate funding to projects in an absolute sense but simply to rank proposals in a relative priority order. Defra is then able to allocate its funding to projects in priority order. The actual threshold score which a project must achieve will depend on available funding compared to need nationally. The thresholds are set by analysis of forward plans provided to Defra by operating authorities each year&mdash;proposals for funding are compared with available funds and I set the lowest threshold that can be afforded for the following financial year, together with indicative estimates of the likely thresholds for the following two years. The latter are reviewed a year later in the light of updated authorities' plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.0/5">The threshold is the same for all projects and is applied broadly equally to all operating authorities. There can be exceptions such as for the very few projects required to protect environmental sites of international importance under the Habitats Directive but the amount of funding spent on these projects is low.</p>

	<p pid="a.1034W.3/2">Recognising that some ordinary watercourses create significant flood risk, in March 2003 the Government announced that all the so called critical&quot; ordinary watercourses (COWs) would become the responsibility of the Environment Agency (EA). This transfer of responsibility is in progress and will be completed by April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034W.3/3">Once a COW has been transferred, it becomes a main river and the EA assumes full responsibility for all associated flood risk management and for dealing with any flooding from it.

	<p pid="a.1034W.3/4">While the EA will retain the overall responsibility for the transferred COWs, they may decide to contract back maintenance and other work to the appropriate local authority or IDB where these bodies are willing to take this on and have a good track record.</p>

	<p pid="a.1035W.2/1">Defra has overall policy responsibility for flood and coastal erosion risk in England. We fund most of the Environment Agency (EA)'s flood risk activities and provide grant aid on a project by project basis to the other flood and coastal defence operating authorities (local authorities and internal drainage boards) to support their investment in improvement works.

	<p pid="a.1035W.2/4">Croston Flood Wall&mdash;works to improve unstable sections of the existing flood defence walls along the River Yarrow, through the village of Croston, were completed in May 2004 (out-turn cost &pound;680,000).</p>

	<p pid="a.1035W.2/9">A strategic study into flood risk management covering the River Douglas catchment area is nearing completion. This takes in the major tributaries of the Rivers Yarrow and Lostock and their Critical Ordinary Watercourse tributaries, which cover part of the Chorley constituency. The strategy study is an important stage in determining flood risk and how to manage it. It also helps the EA to decide on future, sustainable flood protection measures. The expected completion date for the study is July 2005 (estimated cost &pound;135,000).</p>
	<p pid="a.1035W.2/10">This study has already highlighted that flood risk to Croston Village should be examined further. An investigation is now under way, the outcome of which will be a viability report for a Croston Village Flood Alleviation Scheme. The report should be completed by April 2005. Subject to the findings, a detailed feasibility study will be planned in the EA's medium/long-term programme, and improved flood risk management scheme options for the village will be considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.1037W.2/1">Both I and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Food and Farming have met representatives of the Association of Labour Providers and individual labour providers on several occasions to discuss the implications of the Gangmaster (Licensing) Act 2004. We have also attended meetings of the Gangmaster Licensing Authority Consultative Committee, which includes representatives of the Association of Labour Providers and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation. A wide range of matters connected with the implementation of the Gangmaster (Licensing) Act and the establishment of the Licensing Authority was discussed at these meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.2/2">The Government welcomes the constructive role that labour providers and other stakeholder organisations have played in relation to the introduction of the new licensing arrangements. We look forward to maintaining this close relationship as the detail of the licensing scheme is developed and will ensure labour providers will continue to be consulted fully before the arrangements are finalised. We remain on course to establish the Gangmaster (Licensing) Authority in April and hope to be able to start processing licence applications before the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1037W.5/1">A wide range of measures address land condition. Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 was brought into force in April 2000 to address in particular the legacy of historic contamination, where this poses unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. Local authorities are now identifying contaminated land in their area, and ensuring that appropriate remedial action is taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.5/2">Such remediation also takes place as part and parcel of the development of land, and is secured through the planning system, which aims to encourage the redevelopment and beneficial re-use of previously developed land. Last autumn, new planning guidance (PPS23&mdash;Planning and Pollution Control&quot;) was issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, which aims to assist in the remediation of contaminated land through the process of development. A new Land Restoration Trust has been set up.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.5/3">We have published a Soil Action Plan to help tackle the various risks and threats to soil. The plan is informed by key European initiatives such as the Water Framework Directive and work towards a European Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection. The EU Thematic Strategy identifies contamination, erosion and organic matter as three priority issues for soils and is also developing overarching plans for soil monitoring and R and D.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.5/4">Under the Single Payment Scheme land managers are required to demonstrate that they are keeping the land in Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC). GAEC standards, set specifically for England, apply to soil management and protection and to the maintenance of habitats and landscape features.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.5/5">In the built environment soil degradation and erosion caused by construction activities can be a serious issue, particularly in terms of pollution of water resources. Defra is working with the construction industry to identify and address gaps in knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.5/6">Within the suite of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), notified for their conservation importance in England, degraded habitats will be addressed by our PSA target to have 95 per cent. of the SSSI area in favourable condition by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1037W.5/7">Defra will shortly be launching the new Environmental Stewardship Scheme which will replace the existing Countryside Stewardship and Environmentally Sensitive Areas Schemes. The new scheme will focus on natural resource protection, in addition to the primary objectives of the existing schemes, namely wildlife conservation; maintenance and enhancement of landscape quality and character; protection of the historic environment; and the promotion of access of the countryside. This will include measures to help protect watercourses and sensitive habitats by reducing diffuse pollution and soil erosion.</p>

	<p pid="a.1038W.5/1">The Countryside Agency has undertaken a variety of time-linked pilot programmes on behalf of Government and has contributed to rural bus services on our behalf through the Rural Transport Partnership and Parish Transport schemes. The Agency's database does not record information to distinguish funding for rural bus services from other grants to support other local transport needs within those schemes.

	<p pid="a.1038W.5/2">In 2004&ndash;05, the Department for Transport is making &pound;51 million available for rural bus services through Rural Bus Subsidy Grant to bus companies and local authorities to maintain services which would otherwise be uneconomic.

	<p pid="a.1040W.2/1">Defra has overall policy responsibility for flood and coastal erosion risk management in England. Defra funds most of the Environment Agency's flood management activities in England and provides grant aid on a project by project basis to the other flood and coastal defence operating authorities (local authorities and internal drainage boards) to support their investment in improvement projects to manage flood and coastal erosion risk. To qualify for Defra funding proposals must satisfy essential technical, economic and environmental criteria and achieve the relevant priority score&quot; for the year in which work is programmed to start.</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.2/2">The Government encourages operating authorities to take a strategic approach to the provision of flood and coastal defences and they are required to consider a range of defence options. New Forest district council (NFDC), the local coast protection authority, is currently undertaking the West Solent Strategy Study and the area covered extends from Hurst Spit to Calshot Spit including the Lymington salt marsh. NFDC is, I understand, carrying out a public consultation exercise that will inform the options to be evaluated in the study.</p>
	<p pid="a.1040W.2/3">NFDC's medium term plan includes work planned in Lymington where the council propose to reduce the rate of salt marsh erosion but I hope you understand that, until the West Solent Strategy Study is complete and until the council has submitted proposals for coast protection work in Lymington, I cannot comment on options for work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1040W.5/2">The Government has concluded that SFI's forest management standards and chain of custody system do meet the Government's contract criteria for assurance of legal harvesting but do not provide the required assurance of Sustainable forest management.

	<p pid="a.1041W.8/1">Defra's priority is to maximise the protection of people and assets in relation to the funding available. While there is no bias in the priority score system against rural projects, it is however true that projects are less likely to go ahead in sparsely populated areas as these will tend to score less highly than projects which protect larger numbers of people or higher asset values for a given cost. Most of the components making up the priority score of a given project are compared to cost so the crucial measurement is on benefits per unit cost and not on the absolute benefits of proposals. This ensures smaller projects are considered on an equal footing to larger ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.1041W.8/2">We do not classify projects by urban or rural location and often the distinction will not be clear. We could not seek to gather this information without incurring disproportionate cost. As explained in my letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-11">11 February</phrase> to the hon. Member, I have placed in the House Library a list of improvement projects in England approved since May 1997, or which were approved earlier but received funding after that date.</p>

	<p pid="a.1049W.8/1">Upon accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1991, South Africa submitted an initial report providing a full inventory of its nuclear materials. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) conducted a number of inspections to verify the completeness of South Africa's report. They concluded that there was no evidence that the inventory was incomplete.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049W.8/2">In 1993, however, the then South African Prime Minister F. W. de Klerk revealed that South Africa had been pursuing a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s and 1980s, but that this programme had been abandoned in 1989. A team of IAEA technical experts travelled to South Africa in April 1993 to assess whether South Africa had indeed abandoned its programme. They found nothing that was inconsistent with South Africa's declaration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049W.8/3">Subsequently, under South Africa's nuclear safeguards agreement with the IAEA, inspectors have carried out regular checks to ensure that there has been no diversion of nuclear materials. They have not reported any discrepancy to the IAEA Board of Governors. A further reassurance is provided by the adoption by South Africa of an Additional Protocol to its safeguards agreement.</p>

Of those, 35 have been repatriated to the UK.

	<p pid="a.1050W.8/1">We are aware that delays in identifying victims adds to the distress of the families concerned. But there can be no short cuts in the Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) process and, even when bodies are found, the process of formally identifying them can be difficult and lengthy. More details of the process can be found on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website, <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/tsunami">www.fco.gov.uk/tsunami</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1050W.8/2">The police have considered the merits of the three main ways in which bodies may be identified. Dental records, fingerprints and DNA may each be of value, either separately or in conjunction. The approach is decided on a case-by-case basis, because the precise value of each method depends on factors such as the condition of the body and the availability of ante mortem data. Most matches so far have been based on dental records.</p>

	<p pid="a.1053W.2/4" class="indent">The Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 is quite specific as to the means of access to records of deaths held by the Registrar General and by registration officers. The Act gives persons the right to search the indexes in order to identify the entries they are looking for and to obtain certified copies (certificates) on payment of the statutory fee. Neither the Registrar General nor registration officers have any powers to disclose or share information in any other way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1053W.2/5" class="indent">Proposals in the form of the draft Regulatory Reform (Registration of Births and Deaths) (England and Wales) Order 2004, presented to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-22">22 July 2004</phrase>, contained a draft provision that would have enabled the Registrar General to provide list cleaning services to financial sector companies in relation to death registrations. The House of Commons' Regulatory Reform Committee and House of Lords' Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, whose first scrutiny reports were published in December 2004, decided that the draft Order should not proceed to its second stage of scrutiny as it was an inappropriate use of the order-making powers in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. The Government is now considering its next steps for modernisation of the civil registration service.</p>

However, the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, recently announced that the Government are ready to work with other governments to enter into agreements to purchase malaria vaccine in advance in order to ensure a secure market. This funding mechanism, known as the Advanced Purchase Commitment (APC), will aim to attract private investment into vaccine development and production.

In 2004, following hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne, DFID refunded &pound;13,000 to the MOD for the replacement of relief items held on the naval task force that were provided, at DFID's request, to the affected countries.

The Super Puma helicopters chartered by DFID for use by the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) do not have an exact UK military equivalent; however the MOD quote a figure of approximately &pound;732 per flying hour for a Puma while the civilian charter quote a figure of approximately &pound;1,981 per flying hour for a Super Puma.

	<p pid="a.1064W.2/1">To date, no single route has been served by both a military and a civilian plane on DFID's behalf. Calculations of costs per task are based upon the flying time between the two locations. There are other variables such as airport handling charges but these would be common to both military and civilian charter or repositioning costs. In comparing costs of military and civilian aircraft carrying out similar tasks with the same payload, the best comparator is the rate charged per flying hour. For the C-17, tasked by DFID to transport relief items to countries affected by the Indian Ocean disaster, the MOD quoted an hourly flying rate of approximately &pound;1,975.</p>
	<p pid="a.1064W.2/2">There are no direct civilian equivalents of military aircraft and payloads are different, but the approximate rate for the civilian aircraft Antonov 124 is &pound;4,225, &pound;795 for the Ilyushin-76 and &pound;483 for the Antonov 12. The C-17 has a payload of 75 tonnes; the Antonov 124 has a payload of 120 tonnes, the Ilyushin-76, 40 tonnes and the Antonov 12,15 tonnes.</p>

The 2004 Annual report includes earlier years and plans to 2005&ndash;06. Detailed plans beyond that date have not yet been finalised. Annex B and Chapter 2 present figures on slightly different bases as Annex B includes expenditure with the Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) and Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) whereas Chapter 2 refers only to DEL. Within the figures in Annex B the Teachers' Pension Scheme is totally in AME as is the Educational Maintenance Allowance scheme from 2003&ndash;04 onwards. The small balancing activity to reconcile to the AME total shown in Annex B is in Further Education, Adult Learning and Skills and Lifelong Learning 'Other'.</p>

On National No Smoking Day, we will announce a package of support for smokers who want to quit as part of our commitment to become a smoke free workplace by 2006. Systems and practices are being developed, in line with HSE guidance, to help prevent work-related stress occurring.</p>

	<p pid="a.1068W.5/1">Gloucestershire has two Sure Start local programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1068W.5/2">Sure Start Barton, Tredworth and White City was approved in October 2000 and supports around 900 young children and their families living in these areas. Sure Start Cheltenham was approved in February 2003 and supports around 740 young children and their families living in the Hester's Way and Oakley, Whaddon, Lynmouth and Priors area of the district. Barton, Tredworth and White City Sure Start Local Programme have spent &pound;1,214,000 on their capital projects and Cheltenham Sure Start Local Programme have had approximately half of their &pound;1,075,000 capital allocation approved for specific projects in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1068W.5/3">Both programmes deliver a wide range of child, family health and parental support services. Recent Sure Start Unit monitoring reports for the month September 2004 show that Sure Start Barton, Tredworth and White City saw around 35 per cent. of children that month and has visited all of families with newborn babies within the first two months of their child's life. Sure Start Cheltenham has visited around 70 per cent. of families with newborn babies within the first two months of their child's life. Evidence of impact from local evaluation of the Sure Start Barton, Tredworth and White City programme also shows that from a baseline of 51 per cent. of mothers breastfeeding at birth, the rate is now 57 per cent. The programme has also reported that activities associated with the 'Improving and Learning' objective has resulted in a 30 per cent. increase in the use of library services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1068W.5/4">There is one mini Sure Start local programme (Dursley and Cam) in Stroud which was approved in December 2002. The programme received a revenue grant in 2004&ndash;05 of &pound;100,000 to support the delivery of outreach and health services, family support and adult education. This programme is linked to a 50 place neighbourhood nursery (Treetops Nursery) in Dursley with additional outreach and family support being delivered from Rednock Community Centre in Dursley and from GL11 Community Project in Cam. Sure Start has contributed &pound;256,000 in capital funding towards the nursery's integrated education and care facilities. We are also providing start up revenue grant funds of &pound;270,000, available over three years to help ensure the Nursery is firmly established. This is being developed into a children's centre and is expected to be designated by March 2006. The children's centre will reach children and families in Dursley, Cam East and Cam West wards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1068W.5/5">Gloucestershire has five neighbourhood nurseries delivering 190 new early education and childcare places. Gardners Lane Early Excellence Centre in Cheltenham was approved in 2002. It has received a revenue grant of &pound;242,150 in 2004&ndash;05 and will continue to receive this level in 2005&ndash;06. It has had a one-off capital grant of &pound;376,100. This centre is also being developed into a children's centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.1068W.5/6">Gloucestershire county council is planning to create eight children's centres by April 2006. The locations of these children's centres are as follows: Treetops children's centre in Dursley ward; Hesters Way children's centre building on existing provision from the Cheltenham Sure Start local programme and the neighbourhood nursery in Hesters Way ward; Bartongate children's centre building on existing provision from Barton, Tredworth and White City Sure Start Local programme and the Neighbourhood Nursery in the Eastgate ward in Gloucester; Finlay children's centre building from the Gloucester Sure Start Local Programme on a school site and covering the Barton and Tredworth ward; Gardners Lane children's centre building on the Early Excellence centre and reaching those in the wards of St. Peter's, St.Paul's, Lower High Street and Swindon Village; Robinswood children's centre building from the Early Years centre in the Matson ward; Rowanfield children's centre building on Rowanfield Infants School in St.Mark's ward and Linden children's centre building on Linden Primary School covering Moreland and Westgate wards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1068W.5/7">These centres will reach 4,731 children under five resident in the areas. 176 new child care places will mean that 469 full-time child care places are available within the eight areas. Gloucestershire have been given indicative allocations of &pound;1 million for capital development and &pound;355,000 of revenue funding for the development of these children's centres.</p>

Those involved were the Attorney-General and myself, two officials in our office, three officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Christopher Greenwood QC.

The Attorney-General was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised and approved the answer.</p>

	<p pid="a.1077W.0/2">The provision of single-sex accommodation is measured as compliance with three objectives we have set, requiring national health service trusts to provide single-sex sleeping areas, separate bathroom and toilet facilities for men and women, and where appropriate, safe facilities for the mentally ill. Compliance is measured annually at trust level and information at ward level is therefore not available.</p>

	<p pid="a.1085W.0/1">Skin cancer is the second most common cancer in the United Kingdom, with about 40,500 cases annually. 6,000 of these cases are malignant melanomas. While rare, mortality rates are high and 50 per cent. of patients die within two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/2">The Government has been active in providing information to the public to advise people on the best ways to avoid skin cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/3">We have with key stakeholders developed the SunSmart&quot; campaign. It is run by Cancer Research UK and funded by the UK health departments. Cancer Research UK has received funding of around 400,000 for three years from 2003&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/4">The SunSmart advice is:</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/5" class="indent">stay in the shade between 11 am to 3 pm,</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/6" class="indent">make sure you never burn,</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/7" class="indent">always cover up with a T-shirt, wide brimmed hat and sunglasses,</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/8" class="indent">remember to take extra care with children,</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/9" class="indent">then use factor 15 plus sunscreen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/10">Further work by Cancer Research UK is being undertaken on risks associated with sunbeds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/11">No new guidelines have been issued in the last three years while the SunSmart campaign has been in place, although there has been variation on the ways in which the messages are put across to the public so as to achieve maximum and continuing impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/12">The messages in the SunSmart campaign have been approved by the members of the United Kingdom Skin Cancer Working Group, which is hosted by the British Association of Dermatologists and includes representatives of the National Radiological Protection Board, the Skin Care Campaign, UK health departments, the Health and Safety Executive and other experts in the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/13">The following international studies discuss the scientific evidence for sun protection behaviours and messages These studies include: Interventions to prevent skin cancer by reducing exposure to ultraviolet radiation, A systematic review, Saraiya, Glantz, Briss et al., Am J Prev Med 2004; 27 (5).</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/14" class="indent">European Code Against Cancer and scientific justification: third version (2003), Boyle, Autier, Bartelink et al, Annals of Oncology 14:973&ndash;1005, 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/15" class="indent">IARC Handbooks of Cancer Prevention, Volume 5, Sunscreens, International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization, 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/16">Copies of these studies have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/17">The Chief Medical Officer's advice in his top 10 tips for better health on protection from the sun reiterates the advice in the SunSmart campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/18">Government also funds the ultra-violet (UV) index on the Meteorological Office website (linked to the Cancer Research UK SunSmart website). Met Office weather reports on television and radio draw attention to the UV index when danger from the sun is high.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085W.0/19">The United Kingdom Skin Cancer Working Group recently established a sub-group to consider questions relating to exposure to sunlight and Vitamin D. This sub-group at its meeting in January 2005 concluded that on present evidence it would be inappropriate to alter the SunSmart messages. However, it noted that an international workshop on the subject of exposure to the sun and Vitamin D levels will take place in Munich in October 2005 involving the organisations Euroskin and the WHOINTERSUN groups. One of the objectives of this international workshop is to produce a peer-reviewed publication as soon as possible. The Government will consider any implications for policy from the evidence in this report when it is available.</p>

	<p pid="a.1089W.5/24">The GAC plays a unique role in the UK in displaying works of art from its holdings in major Government buildings at home and abroad, in order to promote British art, culture and history. Due to the nature of Government buildings and current security issues, it is not possible for the general public to gain open access to most of the works on a daily basis. However, the buildings in which works of art are displayed&mdash;in reception rooms, entrance halls, Ministers' and Ambassadors' offices&mdash;all receive many thousands of visitors per year, all over the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1089W.5/25">Members of the public may consult the GAC to see individual works of art. Additionally, many Government buildings in the UK (including the GAC's own premises) are accessible during the annual Open House Weekend. The GAC also gives regular tours throughout the year round its premises, lends works of art to public exhibitions, and operates a website <a href="http://www.gac.culture.gov.uk">www.gac.culture.gov.uk</a> listing and illustrating all its original works of art. A growing number of historical and modern prints are being added to this.</p>

This has been carried out since 1986 but has not always cover drug use. Another Home Office survey, the Crime and Justice Survey, obtained information on illicit drug use among the general population aged 10 to 65 in England in 2003 and will provide follow-up data on drug use for the 10 to 25-year-olds in 2004 and 2005.</p>

Although these include statistics on drugs offences&mdash;such as possession&mdash;and on property crimes&mdash;such as burglary&mdash;they do not contain information on the offender's drug habits. It is therefore not possible to estimate from these statistics the percentage of all crime which is linked to the need to support a drug habit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1096W.2/2">However, since April 2003 offenders charged in certain areas with certain offences known to be commonly committed by drug users have been tested for opiates (heroin) and cocaine/crack as part of the Drug Interventions Programme. The following table summarises the total number of offenders tested, and the numbers and percentages of those testing positive for opiates or crack/cocaine between January and December 2004 in the 47 DATs that operate drug testing on charge as part of the Drug Interventions Programme. This gives some indication of the proportion of property crime that may be linked to drug use, although it should be noted that not all crime by drug users is necessarily committed to support their habit.</p>

	<p pid="a.1097W.5/1">Waiting times for drug treatment are at their lowest ever and 54 per cent. more people are in treatment than in 1998. Drug treatment is available to individuals based on their needs. Drug Action Teams (DATs) are responsible for assessing local needs and then commissioning services accordingly to meet the assessed needs of individuals, using the Drug Pooled Treatment Budget and other mainstream funds. In 2004, the Government announced significant year-on-year increases in the Pooled Treatment Budget from &pound;253 million nationally in 2004&ndash;05 to &pound;478 million nationally by 2007&ndash;08.</p>

This information is available in the Area Tables of the 'Drug Seizure and Offender Statistics, UK, 2001 and 2002' filed in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.1102W.3/1">The initiative to designate Europol as the central office for combating euro counterfeiting is still being discussed in the Council of Ministers. Its aim is to make Europol a central point at which EU member states and third countries can share information in relation to euro counterfeiting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102W.3/2">Euro counterfeiting is a growing area of crime. The UK Government considers that this initiative would improve the effectiveness of the fight against euro counterfeiting and consequently agreed to co-sponsor it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102W.3/3">The designation will not affect the responsibilities, rights or powers of Europol officers or Europol staff in the UK or elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102W.3/4">The Bank of England is the designated National Central Office&quot; in the UK and as such acts on behalf of the European Central Bank in the UK for matters relating to the counterfeiting of euro banknotes. UK officers send any counterfeit currencies found in the UK to the National Criminal Intelligence Service in the first instance. Counterfeit euros or English sterling are then sent on to the Bank of England which will represent the European Central Bank in court proceedings in the UK. UK officers supplying or requesting information about euro counterfeiting would liaise with Europol staff in the usual way. The initiative creates no new obligations for the UK courts, or in respect of charges or the location of hearings. Charges may be brought in the UK courts for euro counterfeiting crimes.</p>

The specified date will be set by Parliament in regulations. For those EU nationals who are already resident, the scheme would become compulsory if it became compulsory for British citizens to register, though EU nationals could choose to register voluntarily. Any EU nationals who are not required to register may, as now, use their national passport or identity card as proof of identity. EU legislation will require the incorporation of digital facial image and fingerprint biometrics from 2008. It is for each public service to decide how it will require its users to demonstrate their identity, irrespective of nationality. The Identity Cards Bill provides powers for Parliament to approve regulations specifying how individual non-devolved public services may use the Identity Cards Scheme to verify identity.</p>

	<p pid="a.1106W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, Cathy Jamieson (Scottish Minister for Justice) and I represented the United Kingdom at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Luxembourg on the 25&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2004-10-26">26 October 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1106W.5/2">A list of A&quot; points approved (with the exception of items 11 and 32, which were withdrawn) at the Council has been placed in the Library (Document PTS A 50 13815/04). The UK tabled a Declaration on item 1 (European Border Agency), in relation to its participation and its position regarding Gibraltar.</p>
	<p pid="a.1106W.5/3">The main discussion at the Council centred around the new multi-annual work programme, the Hague Programme, which follows on from the programme agreed at the Tampere European Council in 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.1106W.5/4">The Home Secretary and I welcomed the Presidency's emphasis on evaluation and implementation within the Programme and the importance of delivering work at an EU level which was of demonstrable benefit to the EU's citizens. There was also a useful focus on key areas of work which the UK had been pushing for: on closer police co-operation and more intelligence led policing; on mutual recognition of judicial decisions, respecting the diversity of member states' legal traditions; on biometrics and strengthening our external borders; and on working more closely together to combat terrorism and organised crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.1106W.5/5">In areas where the draft text was less welcome, such as on asylum and parts of criminal justice, we intervened robustly to protect the United Kingdom's interests. The final draft of the Programme went to the European Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-05">5 November</phrase> for final agreement. The final draft accommodated our key priorities and provided a strong foundation for work at an EU level over the next five years which will be beneficial for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1106W.5/6">With regard to other issues on the agenda, the Presidency put forward a compromise solution on the time scale for including biometrics in passports. This would be 18 months from adoption of the Regulation for a first identifier (digital facial image) and 36 months from adoption for the second (fingerprint). I was able to support this as a means to ensure greater security for our borders. The text of the draft Regulation was agreed in principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.1106W.5/7">The Counter-Terrorism Co-ordinator (De Vries) outlined to the Council the progress which had been made on peer evaluations&quot;. An interim report, covering the 15 old&quot; member states, was discussed at the Council on 2&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-12-03">3 December</phrase>. A similar report on the new&quot; member states will be prepared during 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1106W.5/8">The Council did not reach an agreement on the issue of proposed amendments to the Framework Decision on Ship Source Pollution. The Presidency concluded that the issue would be sent to the European Council for further discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1106W.5/9">The Commission presented its initiative for a Council Decision on the exchange of information from criminal records. This was a first step in meeting the mandate from the March European Council for a register of convictions and disqualifications. The Presidency confirmed that the Commission proposal would be further discussed in the Working Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1106W.5/10">In considering other business, the Presidency confirmed its intention to adopt Council Conclusions on improving access to durable solutions and on the development of a common readmission policy, which were subsequently adopted at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-02">2 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1106W.5/11">The Commission reported on the evaluation of the Drugs Action Plan for 2000&ndash;04. The evaluation assessed the impact of achievements to date and assessed the areas where more could be done. The Commission called for a future strategy to include clear aims, operational indicators and responsibilities, in order to meet these challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.1106W.5/12">Also during the Council, on behalf of the UK, I signed the agreement between Switzerland and the EU and EC, regarding their participation in the Schengen acquis. This means that they now join Norway and Iceland in attending Mixed Committees.</p>

	<p pid="a.1109W.0/1">Official conviction figures include statistics on convictions for drugs offences, such as possession, supply, and on property crimes such as burglary, but do not contain information on the offender's drug habits. It is therefore not possible to estimate the volume of convictions which are linked to the use of drugs or to the operation of drug markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1109W.0/2">Information on the number of known drug offenders found guilty or cautioned for drugs offences is available for police force areas only and it is not possible therefore to give an estimate for North Durham alone. For the Durham police force area, there were 1,180 convictions for drugs offences in 2001. The equivalent estimate for 2002 is 1,200. This information is available in the area tables of the Drug Seizure and Offender Statistics, UK, 2001 and 2002&quot; filed in the House Library.</p>

The Proceeds of Crime Act already allows for the seizure of cash and the freezing of all property and assets that are derived from crime. The value of property and assets are then recovered following their sale. The Act contains significant new powers to investigate and recover criminal assets. It established a dedicated Assets Recovery Agency with new powers of civil recovery and taxation of criminal assets. We are determined that the powers in the Act will be used to the full to recover the proceeds of crime.

	<p pid="a.1109W.9/2">Under the Firearms Act 1982, imitation firearms that are readily convertible to fire live ammunition are treated in law as real, working guns and are therefore prohibited or require a firearms certificate. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced a new mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment for the unlawful sale or possession of prohibited firearms. There are otherwise no restrictions on the sale of imitation firearms, some of which are capable of discharging low powered projectiles and some not. Any imitation sold as a toy must not have an energy level in excess of 0.08 joule.</p>
	<p pid="a.1109W.9/3">The Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 introduced a new offence of carrying an imitation firearm in public without reasonable excuse. The police believe that this is a significant contribution to dealing with problems of misuse as they can now challenge anyone seen in public with an imitation and can arrest them if they do not have a reasonable explanation. It is also an offence to possess an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of unlawful violence.</p>

	<p pid="a.1112W.8/1">The courts set fines to reflect the seriousness of the offence while taking into account the means of the offender. Therefore the fines imposed for driving while uninsured are often lower than &pound;200, the level of the fixed penalty notice. This may be addressed in part by the Management of Offenders and Sentencing Bill. It proposes a simple statutory methodology for calculating the amount of the fine. In addition courts will have the discretion to adjust the amount of the fine up to the level of the fixed penalty that otherwise would have been imposed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1113W.9/2">Tenure-neutral&quot; measures include Acceptable Behaviour Contracts, Anti-social Behaviour Orders, injunctions under Section 222 of the Local Government Act 1972 and measures to tackle noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>

	<p pid="a.1114W.2/1">The principal Building Regulations were revised in 1991 and 2000, with amendments in each year except 1993 and 1996.

	<p pid="a.1114W.2/3">Compiling estimates of the costs of all the actual changes since 1993 would incur disproportionate costs, as these are not kept as a running record. However, all proposals for change have been subject to a cost benefit or regulatory impact assessment to ensure they are justified.</p>

	<p pid="a.1121W.2/1">The letter in question was sent to all the chairs of Fire and Rescue Authorities (FRAs) in England. It did not accuse any specific authority of leaking information to the Fire Brigade Union (FBU) but reflected findings that the leak did not originate from an official, consultant or from the Regional Management Boards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1121W.2/2">An internal investigation showed that the version of the Outline Business Case (OBC) that was acquired by the FBU was the same as that circulated in confidence to Fire and Rescue Authority chairs. Forensic analysis showed that at some point between it being sent out to FRAs and the FBU placing it on their website it was electronically manipulated by a technically competent person. That analysis also showed that it was not leaked by anyone at headquarters.</p>

The referendum addresses must be sent by the universal postal provider. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister therefore put in place a contract with the Royal Mail in summer 2004 to deliver these referendum addresses. The total cost was just under &pound;500,000.</p>

NOP contacted a sample of the electorate by telephone to ask whether they had received leaflets from the yes or no campaigns. To do this effectively, NOP had to describe the leaflets. Therefore officials in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister requested a copy of each campaign organisation's leaflet from the Electoral Commission and explained in full the reasons for doing so. Copies of these leaflets were not sent to Ministers or special advisers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1132W.2/2">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) provides a variety of training for its staff which raises awareness of disability. It is principally aimed at advisers and other people who deal with the public but some is available to all employees. It includes an event called 'Dealing with Vulnerable Groups' which helps staff in dealing with people who are deaf or are visually impaired or who have mental health issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1132W.2/3">In addition to formal training courses, people are increasingly developed by a variety of other means, including mentoring and e-learning in the work place. These include The Diversity Toolkit, which offers a range of training options and which won a British Diversity silver award in the innovation and awareness category in 2004. The disability awareness strand of this has been made compulsory for staff in several DWP businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1132W.2/4">Although the Department works in partnership with external organisations to develop disability awareness products, training is only delivered to the Department's own staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.1132W.2/5">The Department does not collect information about the numbers of its staff who access particular types of training or the cost of delivering different types of training. This information could be collected only at disproportionate cost.</p>

This was outlined in the July 2004 Defence White Paper supplement Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities&quot;.

	<p pid="a.1137W.2/1">The 14 Civil Contingency Reaction Forces (CCRFs) are based on the 14 TA infantry battalions spread across the country and, should the need arise, would be manned by members of the Volunteer Reserve Forces, albeit mainly the Territorial Army. A list of qualified volunteers up to a maximum of 500 per CCRF is maintained by each CCRF Headquarters in order that they can respond at short notice to a crisis. But CCRF volunteers are not permanently employed by the armed forces, nor are they held at permanent readiness.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.2/2">It is, however, a fundamental principle that volunteers for the CCRFs agree to be mobilised at relatively short notice. We expect to be able to deploy a CCRF within 24 hours should the need arise, although this may be tempered by the need for additional training depending upon the nature of the crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.2/3">The list of CCRF volunteers is dynamic and reflects the availability of individuals as their personal circumstances change. When an individual becomes unavailable, whether through operational deployment or any other change in circumstances, they cease to be a member of the CCRF and another volunteer is brought forward to replace them. In this way the CCRF capability is maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.2/4">Volunteers receive five days training per year, in addition to their normal reservist training. Details of individual training activities are not held centrally, but in general the additional days are used to ensure familiarisation and integration with the local authorities and the emergency services and to ensure that the procedures for mobilisation are well practised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137W.2/5">It should be borne in mind that the CCRFs are neither an automatic nor the only option to respond to a request from the civil authorities for military assistance. Regional commanders will identify the best choice from all available units, regular or reserve, depending on the nature and urgency of the request.</p>

	<p pid="a.1140W.5/1">At HM Naval Base Clyde (Faslane) staff working in the Active Processing Facility and the Nuclear Repair Workshop are required to use routine secondary monitoring. Staff exiting submarine reactor compartments are monitored by suitably qualified and experienced workers, using appropriate hand held instrumentation, capable of detecting very low levels of radioactive contamination. This monitoring is precautionary as work procedures and protective clothing are designed to minimise the chance of becoming contaminated. Secondary monitoring (using a walk-through monitor), which takes place after the worker has completed primary monitoring and removed his protective clothing, is mandatory when contamination is suspected or found. All nuclear safety matters relating to the Royal Dockyards at Rosyth and Devonport are a responsibility of the owners of the Dockyards: Babcock Rosyth Defence Limited and Devonport Management Limited respectively. However, they must comply with nuclear safety regulations including the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.1140W.5/2">There are no plans to make secondary monitoring mandatory at the Clyde Naval Base as current arrangements within existing facilities comply with legal requirements and have been assessed by the Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (HSE/NII). A recent review of the options for enhancing monitoring arrangements for new facilities has been completed and will inform future worker monitoring protocols. There are no further plans, at this stage, to commission research into whether levels of safety would be increased by introducing mandatory secondary monitoring.</p>

	<p pid="a.1141W.2/1">I have looked into the reasons behind this error and Ministry of Defence officials have found that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1141W.2/2">Shortly after the parliamentary question was received by the Department on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-24">24 November 2004</phrase>, officials drafted a reply. That draft reply accurately reflected the situation at that time. This was forwarded to the Department's parliamentary branch on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-25">25 November 2004</phrase>. As the question concerned a defence procurement issue, the reply was passed to my hon. Friend the Minister for Defence Procurement (Lord Bach)'s Private Office for clearance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1141W.2/3">My hon. Friend the noble Lord was on official duties overseas between the periods <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-29">29 November</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-05">5 December</phrase>, 6 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-09">9 December</phrase>, and 9 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-10">10 December</phrase>. Some time between the period 5 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-21">21 December</phrase>, my hon. Friend the noble Lord cleared the draft reply. Our records do not show the exact date this happened, but this was more likely to have been towards the end of this period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1141W.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-09">9 December</phrase>, the Department concluded its negotiations with Swan Hunter regarding the Landing Ship Dock (Auxiliary) project and a contract amendment was signed. At this point, the reply which had been drafted no longer accurately reflected the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1141W.2/5">By the time the reply was signed out of Minister (DP)'s Private Office on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-21">21 December</phrase>, the answer was incorrect. This was not identified by the Private Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.1141W.2/6">I approved the reply at some point between <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-21">21 December 2004</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-07">7 January 2005</phrase>, on the assumption that the reply and supporting advice provided was accurate. The reply was returned to the Table Office on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-07">7 January 2005</phrase>. The reply appeared in the Official Report&quot; on the next sitting day, <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-10">10 January 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1141W.2/7">This was a regrettable incident resulting from a genuine error. There was no intention by Ministers deliberately to mislead the House. My hon. Friend the noble Lord has put in place measures to improve the handling procedures in his Private Office which should help prevent such an incident happening again.</p>
