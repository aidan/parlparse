	<p pid=".8W.8/1">The Small Business Service (SBS) has undertaken research and taken action to identify and tackle the barriers faced by women and ethnic minority entrepreneurs.</p>
	<p pid=".8W.8/2">Firstly, SBS has commissioned research to explore the evidence of barriers (as part of research strategy on socially excluded groups). Reports on women and ethnic minority entrepreneurs have been completed and the reports are now publicly available. Other research projects are ongoing.</p>
	<p pid=".8W.8/3">Secondly, SBS has sponsored two events to help identify barriers:</p>
	<p pid=".8W.8/4" class="indent">a Kingston University Seminar on <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-01">1 May 2001</phrase> to examine ethnic minority businesses; and</p>

	<p pid=".8W.8/6">Thirdly, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry created an Ethnic Minority Business Forum in July 2000. The forum's remit to strengthen Government's dialogue with ethnic minority business communities. It advises the Secretary of State and the SBS Chief Executive, David Irwin, on policies to help ethnic minority communities at work and in running their own businesses. Its first annual report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-18">18 September 2001</phrase>. The DTI and SBS plan to respond formally to the report's recommendations at the forum's next meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">4 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".8W.8/7">Fourthly, SBS is supporting projects through the Phoenix Development Fund to encourage innovative ways of promoting enterprise in deprived areas, and among groups of people currently under-represented in terms of business ownership. Of the 96 projects currently supported, 37 directly target women or ethnic minorities.</p>
	<p pid=".8W.8/8">All SBS and Business Link services aim to meet the needs of all existing and &quot;would-be&quot; entrepreneurs, regardless of their gender or ethnicity. We will continue to research barriers which exclusively or disproportionately affect women or ethnic minority entrepreneurs, and where appropriate will take prompt and efficient action to remove these or reduce their impact.</p>

	<p pid=".11W.0/2">The proportion of wind turbines operating in the UK that were manufactured domestically is estimated to be just under 6 per cent. The proportion containing UK components is estimated to be at least 43 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".11W.0/3">Much more British manufacturing of wind turbines and components is expected in the future. Aerolaminates have moved into a new larger factory with much greater capacity on the Isle of Wight. As well as blades, they are now supplying some complete turbine rotors to their parent company, NEG-Micon. Cambrian Engineering have manufactured, or have orders, for 95 per cent. of the wind turbine towers to be installed in the UK this year. Vestas, who are among the world-leaders in wind turbine manufacture, announced in June that they are to start UK operations at Machrihanish near Campbeltown in the west of Scotland where their new factory will create 124 direct jobs and 44 associated jobs.</p>

	<p pid=".12W.0/1">In the case of wave energy, my Department has already supported the development of the world's first commercial wave power device at Islay, and we recently announced that we will provide further support to the company involved, Wavegen, by increasing the level of R&amp;D funding for their most recent project to almost &pound;1.67 million. This funding will assist with the further development of their new offshore wave energy concept and the construction and testing at sea of a prototype. This substantial funding confirms the Government's commitment to its new wave energy programme.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.0/2">The Department commissioned a study into the prospects for tidal stream technology in the UK and this has now been completed. It was positive about the prospects for tidal stream, and is being taken forward in association with the industry. There are a useful amount of tidal currents around the shores of the UK and these are already well charted. There a number of sites where tidal stream generators could be deployed, but as yet no prototype device. Tidal stream is now covered as a technology in my Department's Sustainable Energy Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.0/3">The Department recently initiated a call for proposals under the Sustainable Energy Programme, which invites bids for funds to support the development of both wave and tidal power. The level of funding will be dependent on the number of good quality R&amp;D proposals which are received from the industry.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.0/4">Both technologies will also continue to be eligible for funding for R&amp;D into Electricity Generation from renewable and clean sources from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). This programme provides &pound;3.5 million of support per year for research into the full range of renewables technologies. To date, wave and tidal projects have received over &pound;769,000 of support from this source.</p>
	<p pid=".12W.0/5">We anticipate that the introduction of the Renewables Obligation will also provide a further stimulus to these and the wider range of eligible renewables, including wave and tidal power. Both technologies may also benefit from a proportion of the &pound;100 million announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister earlier this year.</p>

	<p pid=".13W.2/2">The Government have allocated at least &pound;49 million to capital grants for offshore wind. &pound;39 million will come from DTI, the remainder from the New Opportunities Fund. The capital grants programme was officially launched this week, and application forms/guidance notes are now available from DTI at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/renew/eoi.htm">www.dti.gov.uk/renew/ eoi.htm</a>. These grants will support early deployment of a number of demonstration projects and enable the industry to develop a bank of knowledge and expertise to maximise the contribution of this technology to the UK's 10 per cent. target. We have also consulted recently on the offshore consents process and plan to bring forward a new 'one-stop-shop' approach which should make it easier for project developers to get their projects up and running.</p>

The Obligation marks a significant commitment by Government to the renewables industry as a whole, with the potential to create a market worth over &pound;1 billion per annum by the year 2010. We have backed up our commitment to the Obligation with funding worth over &pound;260 million for this and the next two financial years, including the capital grants funding and R&amp;D programmes already mentioned. A proportion of the &pound;100 million for renewables announced by the Prime Minister earlier this year may also be allocated to the early deployment of offshore technologies.</p>

	<p pid=".14W.7/1">I attended the informal meeting of EU Heads of Government in Belgium on <phrase class="date" code="">19 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.7/2">The meeting was originally called to have an informal discussion about the future institutional development of the European Union. In the light of <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase> we, the Presidency and all our partners, wanted to use the meeting to focus on developments in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.7/3">The continuing and wholehearted solidarity of the European Union in the face of the <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase> attacks was confirmed in the discussion in Ghent on Friday and in the statement which was issued, a copy of which I have placed in the Library of the House. The statement emphasises the crucial need to relaunch the middle east peace process without preconditions.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.7/4">The European Union's solidarity with the United States has been shown in action as well as in words, not just by our own contribution but by those of other EU partners.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.7/5">Since the beginning of this crisis, we and our EU partners have placed as much importance on the humanitarian as on the military aspects of our campaign. So far this year, aid amounting to over 310 million euros has been mobilised by the European Union to relieve the suffering of the Afghan people. That includes emergency aid and food aid released through the world food programme.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.7/6">The EU has also been looking to the protection of our own citizens. The Commission has proposed uniform EU-wide security and safety standards in aviation, standards which have already been significantly tightened across the EU since <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase>. The co-operation between civil protection authorities across the EU has been stepped up and we are developing an EU system for surveillance and control of communicable diseases, including an early warning and response system to help us deal with threats from biological or chemical agents. EU-wide legislation is being negotiated on common penalties for terrorist offences and a European arrest warrant.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.7/7">I have also placed in the Library statements on the economic situation in the European Union and on preparations for the euro. At the meeting, I stressed the importance of sticking to the economic reform agenda we outlined at the Lisbon Summit 18 months ago. The essential requirement in the present economic climate is to create jobs and that will happen if, at EU level and beyond, we can open up markets in energy, financial services, transport and other sectors. We also have to be steadfast for free trade. I welcome the commitment of Prime Minister Aznar to pursue that economic reform agenda vigorously under the Spanish Presidency.</p>

NOF has selected Sport England as an Award Partner to deliver an additional &pound;31 million of Lottery money to projects in England for the creation of playing fields and community spaces, as part of NOF's Green Spaces Initiative.

	<p pid=".25W.5/2">The Countryside Stewardship Scheme is already open to organic farmers. Because it is a discretionary scheme, applications are assessed and approved on the basis of the environmental benefits they can offer. This assessment process takes account of the potential additional benefits of combining Countryside Stewardship with organic farming and as a result many organic farmers have been accepted into the Scheme. Officials are also conducting a review of agri-environment schemes which will consider a range of issues including the structure of existing schemes and the interrelationship between them. The review will report in 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".26W.5/1">The farmland bird index, based on populations of 20 species, increased last year, though this may have been partly due to the relatively mild preceding winter. Expert advice is that it will take several years before we could expect to see the effects of current policy measures. Nevertheless, analysis of the underlying trend by the British Trust for Ornithology has shown that the rate of population decline is now slowing.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.5/2">A number of existing policy measures will help this Department to achieve its Public Service Agreement (PSA) target to reverse the long-term decline in the number of farmland birds by 2020&mdash;not least the significant expansion of our agri-environment schemes under the England Rural Development Programme. In particular, we are very hopeful that next year's national rollout of arable Countryside Stewardship options, based on the successful pilot scheme, will prove beneficial for birds.</p>
	<p pid=".26W.5/3">The reasons for the decline in farmland bird numbers are complex. That is why we have commissioned research from the British Trust for Ornithology, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Oxford University to help us identify more precisely what needs to be done to deliver the PSA target.</p>

	<p pid=".32W.14/2">The Food Standards Agency collects data on the nutrient content of a wide range of foods, including fruit and vegetables, on a regular basis. A report published last year suggests there has been some decline in the nutrient content of fruit and vegetables. Due to a variety of factors, the range of nutrient levels in foods can be very wide and is approximately the same for conventional and organic produce.</p>
	<p pid=".32W.14/3">The composition of individual foods is less important than the nutrient content and overall balance of the diet. Data show that nutrient intakes for the population as a whole are generally adequate.</p>

	<p pid=".34W.12/1">The pay, terms and conditions of staff in general further education and sixth-form colleges are matters for college corporations and management to determine in consultation with the relevant unions. I understand that over the years since incorporation, sixth-form colleges have sought to mirror pay and conditions arrangements in schools, because staff responsibilities are similar in both. In general FE colleges, a wider range of pay and conditions arrangements now exist, reflecting the diverse learning needs of colleges local communities and colleges individual decisions on implementing the nationally recommended pay settlement each year.</p>
	<p pid=".34W.12/2">In addition, sixth-form colleges have, this year, been given proportionately a larger share of teaching pay initiative (TPI) funding than general FE colleges. This honours a commitment given by the former Secretary of State, identifying the scale of implementation of TPI in sixth-form colleges in 2001. Under TPI, sixth-form colleges should, this year, be able to replicate the &pound;2,000 threshold payments that apply in schools; and in general FE, colleges should be able to pay at least &pound;1,000 and up to &pound;2,000 to eligible staff, with up to &pound;4,000 to a minority of their most able staff.</p>

The Prime Minister launched &quot;Skills for Life&quot;, the national strategy for improving adult literacy and numeracy in England on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-01">1 March</phrase>. New national standards, a core curriculum for literacy and numeracy, teacher training and national tests in literacy and numeracy are all now available nationally after a successful pilot. A national promotional campaign is currently boosting demand. We are working across Government and with key partner organisations to ensure that all those who can help adults with literacy and numeracy skills needs are able to do so. Our target is that 750,000 adults improve their literacy and numeracy by 2004. More than 70,000 adults have already gained literacy and numeracy qualifications since April 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".40W.2/1">We welcomed Lord Dearing's June report to the Archbishop's Council, which recommended an increase in the number of Church of England secondary school places to build on the Church's record of meeting parental demand and local community need. However, decisions to set up new faith schools, or close other schools and reopen them as faith schools, are taken at local level&mdash;by the school organisation committee for the area, or the schools adjudicator where the committee cannot agree&mdash;and depend on proposals coming forward.</p>
	<p pid=".40W.2/2">In the White Paper &quot;Schools: achieving success&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-05">5 September</phrase>, we proposed to legislate for different procedures, where a need for a wholly new school is identified by a LEA. The LEA will have to invite any interested parties&mdash;which may include the Church of England or other faith group&mdash;to bring forward proposals to establish the new school. After the local school organisation committee has commented on alternative proposals, the Secretary of State will decide between them, taking account of the proposals educational merits, value for money and the outcome of local consultation.</p>

It works mainly on specific projects, chosen following consultation with other Ministers and suggestions from interested groups. The unit's remit covers only matters which are the responsibility of the Government, but it keeps in close touch with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland devolved Administrations, which have their own strategies for tackling social exclusion.</p>

	<p pid=".47W.0/1">The Freedom of Information Act received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-30">30 November 2000</phrase> and, by section 87(3), has to be fully implemented by the <phrase class="date" code="">30 November 2005</phrase>. However, the Government are committed to the implementation of the Act before this deadline. The Lord Chancellor also has a statutory duty to report to Parliament by <phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase> this year on his proposals for bringing fully into force those provisions that are not yet fully in force.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.0/2">In his appearance before the Home Affairs Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="">16 October</phrase>, the Lord Chancellor outlined the two possible approaches to implementation. A 'Sector by Sector' approach would mean implementing the Act in stages, by type of public authority, with publications schemes provisions implemented first and the right of access following, say, six months later. The alternative is a 'Big Bang' approach, under which the publication scheme provisions are rolled out, by type of public authority, and the individual's right of access to all public authorities commences at the end of that complete process. The Government are considering which of these two to adopt.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.0/3">Some parts of the Act are already in force. The provisions of the Act set out in section 87(1) came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-30">30 November 2000</phrase>, when the Act was passed. These provisions relate mainly to the work of the Information Commissioner, the coverage of the Act and Order making powers. The provisions set out in section 87(2) of the Act came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-30">30 January 2001</phrase>. These relate primarily to the creation of the post of the Information Commissioner. Provisions relating to the amendment of the Data Protection Act, as provided for by the Freedom of Information Act, were also brought into force by Commencement Order in Statutory Instrument 2001 Number 1637, on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-30">30 April 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.0/4">The Government are determined that the time taken to implement the Act will be used well to ensure that the Act is a success. There is a parallel to be drawn here between the Freedom of Information Act and the Human Rights Act. Time was taken to ensure that the Human Rights Act was implemented properly. This meant that, despite criticism at the time, the implementation of the Act has been considered a success.</p>

	<p pid=".47W.3/1">Within the Lord Chancellor's Department there is a Division devoted to central policy on Freedom of Information and Data Protection. It has a delegated budget of approximately &pound;310,000 for work on Freedom of Information. In addition, the Division has allocated a grant in aid, for this financial year, to the Information Commissioner of &pound;2 million, for her responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (the Act).</p>
	<p pid=".47W.3/2">Each Public Authority is responsible for the implementation of the Act within its own jurisdiction and therefore, there are a number of staff involved in the implementation of the Act in the Lord Chancellor's Department itself, as well as in its Agencies and Associated Offices, as there are in other Departments.</p>
	<p pid=".47W.3/3">Key staff in each Department include the Management Board level 'Champion' for Freedom of Information and the Implementation Team Leader. Records and knowledge management staff, including website staff, are also involved, as are many others throughout the Department. The work is clearly an aspect of many people's jobs; for example, the Home Office has in the region of 50 staff involved in the implementation as some part of their job.</p>

	<p pid=".50W.8/1">The national Trial Issues Group carried out a review of the reducing delay measures in November of last year, in so far as they affected the magistrates' courts. One of the recommendations was that a national agreement should be established on file quality standards so that it was clear when they were &quot;fit for purpose&quot; and ready to proceed to court.</p>
	<p pid=".50W.8/2">The Government's strategy to reduce unnecessary delay in the criminal justice system is being taken forward at a national level by the Trial Issues Group through its Reducing Delays Sub Group (RDSG). To achieve this, RDSG established a National Implementation Team consisting of officials from the Home Office, Lord Chancellor's Department, Crown Prosecution Service, police, Law Society and the Court Service. A &quot;post- Narey&quot; evaluation of most of the new procedures has now been carried out and an action plan based on its recommendations has been drawn up. TIG will oversee action generally on this during the course of this year.</p>

	<p pid=".51W.0/34">In addition, there are abductions to countries which are not party to the convention or which, for other reasons, are not reported to the Child Abduction Unit.</p>
	<p pid=".51W.0/35">The United Kingdom has signed the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children. A list of countries in which both conventions are in force with the UK is given in the table. In March 2001 the Brussels II regulation came into force. This regulation deals with the recognition and enforcement of judgments made in matrimonial proceedings and orders for parental responsibility in respect of children of both spouses. If a child is abducted or retained following a contact visit the left behind parent can use this legislation to recover the child. This regulation can only be used to enforce judgments made after <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-01">1 March 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".51W.0/36">If a child has been abducted to a country which is a signatory to the Hague Convention the court in the foreign country is normally under a duty to return the child to his state of habitual residence as quickly as possible. The underlying basis of the convention is that the receiving state should not enter into an investigation in relation to the custodial issues, but leave these to be resolved by the courts in the country of habitual residence. However, the foreign court is not under a duty to return the child if he objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of his views.</p>
	<p pid=".51W.0/37">While the foreign court is under a duty to return a child to his country of habitual residence as quickly as possible it may decline to do so if it would expose him to a risk of psychological or physical harm.</p>
	<p pid=".51W.0/38">The agreements the Government have made in relation to the return of abducted children to the United Kingdom are the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and the Council of Europe Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions Relating to the Custody of Children.</p>

	<p pid=".54W.2/1">We have put in place a comprehensive strategy to reduce fraud across all benefits. We are tightening up the system to make sure that from the very first claim, the right benefits are going to the right people.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/2">We have firm targets for reducing the amount of fraud and error in Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance. The Department is aiming for a reduction of 25 per cent. by 2004 and 50 per cent. by 2006. We have met our first milestone, which was to achieve a 10 per cent. reduction by March 2002, 18 months ahead of schedule.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/3">This year we have also introduced for the first time a continuous measure of the level of Housing Benefit fraud.

	<p pid=".54W.2/4">We have also introduced an ongoing programme of National Benefit Reviews looking at other benefits. These reviews are providing us with the intelligence we need to focus our efforts where it is needed most.</p>

	<p pid=".54W.8/4" class="indent">Mr Smith is unavailable and therefore I am writing to you on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.8/5" class="indent">You asked how much money in excess of the proper calculation was paid by parents without care through the Child Support Agency to parents with care in the last year for which information is available; and how much was recovered from parents with care and repaid to parents without care.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.8/6" class="indent">You also asked how much money below the proper calculation was paid by parents without care through the Child Support Agency to parents with care in the last year for which information is available; and how much was subsequently recovered and paid over.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.8/7" class="indent">The information you have requested in the first part of each question is not available, as it is not collected in the format you have asked for.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.8/8" class="indent">However in the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts for 2000&ndash;2001, the National Audit Office estimated that overpayments amounted to &pound;5 million and underpayments amount to &pound;12 million. These figures were based on a sample of cases examined, which showed underlying errors in maintenance assessments and incorrect adjustments to customer's accounts. Any variance of 1p of more in an assessment is regarded as an error.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.8/9" class="indent">Where we identify that maintenance has been overpaid it will be refunded to the parent without care either in a lump sum or by means of reducing the ongoing liability that has to be paid.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.8/10" class="indent">Maintenance that was due but not paid is collected as arrears. Arrears are either received in lump sum payments or agreements are reached where by a parent without care will pay an amount towards arrears in addition to regular maintenance. If no agreement can be reached between the Agency and the parent without care then that case would undergo enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.8/11" class="indent">The value of the excess of the proper calculation and also that, which is below the proper calculation, is not collected in the format you have requested to enable me to give a definitive reply.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.8/12" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid=".57W.5/1">Work-focused Interviews will enable people receiving incapacity benefit to consider their work options and to hear about the practical and financial help that is available to them. An application for employment following a work-focused interview will have no effect on an individual's incapacity benefit entitlement and would not in itself have any bearing on the outcome of any future personal capability assessment. If a person subsequently took up employment, entitlement might be affected as there are limited circumstances in which people can work and receive incapacity benefit.</p>

They will also be able to take part in a review when they will have the opportunity to discuss the help and benefits available to them.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.5/3">There will be no direct contact between the work- focused interview Personal Adviser and the personal capability assessment medical examiner. Records from the work-focused interview will not be available to personal capability assessment medical advisers.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.5/4">The participation of a person in a work-focused interview will not generally influence the timing of their next personal capability assessment. However, if at the time their Personal Adviser considers it appropriate they may refer the case to a benefit decision-maker to consider if, in the light of all the available evidence, a personal capability assessment is required.</p>

	<p pid=".58W.2/1">The Government have no plans to introduce legislation on integration in the manner described because there is no evidence that UK occupational pension schemes take increases in the state pension into account once state pension age has passed and the scheme member's pension is in payment.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.2/2">It is estimated that in 1995 there were approximately 7,200 private sector defined benefit occupational pension schemes which operated integration of some form to allow for the receipt of state pensions.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.2/3">In general, the integration adjustment is applied at the time the pension is calculated at the date of retirement or at the date state pension age is reached. The resultant pension is then subject to increases according to the scheme rules. These rules also protect against the level of pension from being reduced once it has gone into payment.</p>

	<p pid=".59W.0/2">Local exchange and trading schemes and time banks are dealt with in accordance with normal tax rules. If a trader offers their goods and services through a LETS scheme then they will be liable to tax in the normal way. If a non-trader offers their goods and services through a scheme there should be no liability. Since both the form of these organisations and of members' activities within them can differ, anyone in doubt about the tax position, whether organiser or scheme member, should check the position with the local tax office.</p>

	<p pid=".63W.8/3" class="indent">As National Statistician and Registrar for England and Wales, I have been asked to reply to your recent questions on:</p>
	<p pid=".63W.8/4" class="indent">1. what measures will be taken to provide accurate and reliable census data for Eastbourne (9099);</p>
	<p pid=".63W.8/5" class="indent">2. when (a) summary and (b) full census results for Eastbourne will be published (9097);</p>
	<p pid=".63W.8/6" class="indent">3. what percentage of households in (a) Eastbourne and (b) Wealden completed a census return (9098).</p>
	<p pid=".63W.8/7" class="indent">In answer to the first question, a number of measures have either already been implemented or will be taken to provide accurate and reliable census data. Prior to the Census, an important new initiative was the Community Liaison programme. Its main objectives were:</p>
	<p pid=".63W.8/8" class="indent">to facilitate enumeration and to ensure full coverage;</p>
	<p pid=".63W.8/9" class="indent">to help provide a source of potential field staff;</p>
	<p pid=".63W.8/10" class="indent">to advertise the Census and to underline its uses;</p>
	<p pid=".63W.8/11" class="indent">to provide help to individual members of local communities;</p>
	<p pid=".63W.8/12" class="indent">to help with translations and advertising.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.8/13" class="indent">This, coupled with the new strategy of asking the public to post their completed forms back, enabled resources to be targeted to where they were most needed.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.8/14" class="indent">Despite these efforts, it was always anticipated that some people would not be counted and that the degree of under-enumeration would vary across the country. The extent and nature of such under-enumeration will be more accurately assessed than ever before by the extensive, separate, follow-up Census Coverage Survey carried out by interviewing around 300,000 households shortly after the Census enumeration was completed. Once the interview responses and all the Census returns have been analysed, we will have a definitive picture of how well we have done at Local Authority level. The sample size was large enough for estimates of levels of under-enumeration for each Local Authority to be made and will enable the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to create a complete dataset for analysis of individual communities that takes account of this estimated under-enumeration.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.8/15" class="indent">Information about the quality of Census data will be published on the National Statistics website and brought together in a Census Quality Report to be published in 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.8/16" class="indent">With regard to your second question, the target date for mid-year 2001 population estimates by sex and age for all local authority areas based on the 2001 Census is August 2002. These will include an adjustment for births, deaths and migration between Census Day (<phrase class="date" code="2001-04-29">29 April 2001</phrase>) and <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-30">30 June 2001</phrase>. The target date for summary Census results&mdash;Key Statistics for areas throughout England and Wales (including Eastbourne) is December 2002. They will be laid before Parliament and accessible through the National Statistics website.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.8/17" class="indent">The full census data for Eastbourne will be published along with the detailed results for all the other local authority areas in the first half of 2003; these will be accessible via the National Statistics website.</p>
	<p pid=".63W.8/18" class="indent">In response to your final question, I am unable, at this stage, to provide detailed information on the response rate to the Census in Eastbourne and Wealden. This will be available in Autumn 2002. Currently the ONS estimates that the 2001 Census response rate nationally will reach 98 per cent. of households.</p>

The most recent British Crime Survey, which is widely recognised as providing the best picture of long-term trends in crime, shows a drop in violent crime of 4 per cent. between 1997 and 1999. But we know from the increase shown in police recorded crime figures that level of violent crime remains too high and we must continue to do all we can to reduce it.</p>

	<p pid=".71W.9/3">Last year we gave &pound;20 million to the five metropolitan forces which account for nearly three quarters of all recorded robberies, specifically to assist them in meeting their five-year robbery reduction targets. They have used the money to introduce a number of new initiatives and to reinforce good practice. These include the targeting of hotspots (including transport routes) and offenders based on better intelligence, higher visibility of uniformed officers on the street, mobile CCTV vans, a range of publicity measures, improved recording, scene of crime management, investigation and identification techniques; youth diversion measures, the creation of safe routes into city centres, and targeted anti-mobile phone theft campaigns.</p>

In the financial year 2000&ndash;01, 410 claims were approved; &pound;44,550 was paid in compensation. In the first six months of the current financial year, 214 claims have been approved and &pound;68,165 has been paid. As there is a timelag of around two months between authorisation and payment, a number of claims agreed in 2000&ndash;01 will have been paid in the current financial year. Records of payments do not differentiate between claims in connection with lost passports and other claims arising from maladministration by the directorate but we estimate that around 85 per cent. relate to lost passports and associated costs such as travel expenses.</p>

	<p pid=".75W.14/2">Where this is a particular problem, we would expect it to be covered within the local crime and disorder strategy. There are a number of existing powers which can be brought to bear. The antisocial behaviour order provides an important tool in respect of antisocial activity by particular individuals. Other measures include provisions in the Road Traffic Acts 1988 and 1991 and, as regards excessive and avoidable noise, in the Environment Protection Act 1990. Where appropriate, local authorities can consider enacting byelaws specifically to restrict the use of motorcycles on council estates and in open public spaces. Current research is looking at aspects of unlicensed driving and motorcycle riding, and we shall consider carefully any further measures it recommends to address the issues.</p>

	<p pid=".83W.0/1">The information requested for the period up to <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-30">30 June 2001</phrase> is set out in tables which can be found in the Library. As of that date, a total of 37,105 prisoners had been placed on home detention curfew since the scheme commenced on <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-28">28 January 1999</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.0/2">Table 1 shows the original offences committed by prisoners released under the scheme during the period, the number of prisoners convicted of each specific offence, the average sentence received and served for those offences, and the average period spent on the scheme in respect of prisoners convicted of each specific offence. The data are taken from the Prison Service's Inmate Information System, based on the data recorded by each prison. The table provides as detailed a breakdown as is possible from central records.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.0/3">As at <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June</phrase>, a total of 1,249 prisoners placed on the scheme had breached the conditions of their curfew. A breakdown of this number showing the original offences committed by those curfewees is shown in Table 2.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.0/4">Information on curfewees whose licences are revoked and who disappear before being recaptured is not held centrally. However, information is held on the number of curfewees unlawfully at large at any one time. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June</phrase> there were 77 curfewees who remained unlawfully at large. This represents less than 4.3 per cent. of the total number of revocations.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.0/5">Details of the offences committed by those 77 curfewees who remained unlawfully at large on <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-30">30 June 2001</phrase> can be found in Table 3.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.0/6">As at <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-30">30 June 2001</phrase>, 1,801 curfewees had their licences revoked, using the powers available to the Secretary of State under sections 38A(1) and 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The reasons for revocation were as follows: breach of the curfew (section 38A(1)(a) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991); the curfewee's whereabouts could no longer be electronically monitored (section 38A(1)(b) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991); it was necessary to protect the public from serious harm (section 38A(1)(c) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991); the curfewee had committed an offence or breached any other requirement of probation supervision (section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991). Curfewees who are charged with a new offence may also be recalled on any of the preceding grounds depending upon the circumstances of the case.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.0/7">Prisoners whose current sentence is in respect of an offence committed before <phrase class="date" code="1999-01-01">1 January 1999</phrase> are not liable to be recalled under section 39 of the Act. In such cases, where the curfewee has breached the requirements of probation supervision or where they have committed a further offence and it has not been possible to revoke their licence under section 38A of the Act, the breach may be referred to the courts under section 38(1) of the Act. The total number of such cases referred to the courts is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.0/8">A breakdown of the original offences committed by the 1,801 recalled curfewees, together with a breakdown of the reasons for their recall is at Table 4.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.0/9">Table 5 gives a breakdown of the cases where a prisoner placed on home detention curfew is known to have been convicted, cautioned in respect of an offence committed while on home detention curfew, or where a prisoner is known to be pending prosecution for such an offence. Where a curfewee has been charged with more than one offence, these have been shown separately.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.0/10">Table 6 gives a breakdown of cases involving prisoners placed on the scheme who are known to have been convicted, cautioned or have a prosecution pending in respect of an offence committed while on home detention curfew which is similar in character to the index offence or offences for which they were originally convicted.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.0/11">The scheme is designed to ensure a better transition for short term offenders between custody and the community. Prisoners are only placed on home detention curfew after a careful risk assessment and the safety of the public is paramount at all times.</p>

	<p pid=".84W.2/1">We remain determined to reduce the number of robberies, and have set a challenging target of a 14 per cent. reduction in robbery in our principal cities by March 2005. The rate of increase in recorded robbery fell from 26 per cent. to 13 per cent. in the 12 months to March 2001. The five metropolitan forces have been set individual robbery reduction targets under the best value framework, and have been given an additional &pound;20 million specifically to assist their efforts in tackling robbery and to enhance those targets. Almost three-quarters of all robberies are committed in these five metropolitan areas.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.2/2">The additional funds have enabled those forces to introduce a number of new initiatives and to reinforce good practice. These include the targeting of hotspots (including transport routes) and offenders based on better intelligence, higher visibility of uniformed officers on the street, mobile closed circuit television vans, a range of publicity measures, improved recording, scene of crime management, investigation and identification techniques; youth diversion measures, the creation of safe routes into city centres, and targeted anti-mobile phone theft campaigns.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.2/3">We are also working at a national level with the mobile phone industry to tackle mobile phone theft, which accounts for a significant proportion of robberies. In July we published a crime prevention leaflet distributed via police forces and retail outlets, and we are continuing to press the industry to enhance the security of their products and services.</p>

	<p pid=".94W.8/1">The Transport Council met in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="">16 October</phrase>. I represented the United Kingdom, together with my right hon. Friend the Minister for Transport.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/2">This meeting of the Council was mainly focused on aviation issues, following the special session of the Transport Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-14">14 September</phrase>, which I attended. In addition, the special European Council of <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-21">21 September</phrase> had called on this Council to adopt measures in the field of aviation security. I am very pleased that the Council succeeded in doing this. The Council put in hand preparations for Community-wide measures to enhance aviation security.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/3">The Commission presented a draft regulation establishing a framework of aviation security measures and inspection arrangements. The Presidency reported on the work of the ad hoc group set up by the special Transport Council, which will examine further the scope for additional measures in areas such as crew training; checking and monitoring of hold luggage; securing cockpits; sky marshals; use of video cameras, and quality control of security measures. The Council also discussed alignment of security measures with those adopted by the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC), and the need for the issues to be further pursued at the global level by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/4">The Council agreed conclusions, following a debate on the economic consequences for the aviation industry of the <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase> attacks, on the basis of a Communication from the Commission. The conclusions recognise that application of the Community's state aid rules is the Commission's exclusive competence, and noted the limited range of financial assistance the Commission would approve. This would include compensation for losses directly attributable to the closure of airspace in the four days following <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase>, insurance guarantees for war-related third party risk where the market has failed, and possible assistance with the costs of enhanced security measures. The conclusions called on the Commission to take a position on slot flexibility before the next winter season, and welcomed the Commission's intention to open a dialogue with the US on a code of conduct on unfair competition. On insurance guarantees the conclusions called for monthly reviews with a final cut-off date of <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase> this year.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/5">I joined several Ministers in supporting the Commission's proposals. I also emphasised the importance of the EU airline industry restructuring itself, and circulated a paper calling for member states and the Commission to try to prevent ownership and control clauses in bilateral air service agreements being an obstacle to airline consolidation.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/6">The Commission presented its proposals for the Single European Sky, aimed at improving co-ordination of air traffic management across the EU and reducing delays through better use of airspace. This is an initiative which the UK supports and we look forward to seeing progress on it in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/7">The Presidency reported on recent developments at the ICAO General Assembly in Montreal. The results on aircraft noise were generally welcomed. Council conclusions noted that Council would give priority to adopting a replacement to the current 'hushkits' Regulation in the near future.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/8">A common position was reached on proposals to establish a European Aviation Safety Agency. There were progress reports on proposals for occurrence reporting in civil aviation and on cabin crew training, which were remitted back to COREPER for further work.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/9">The Council noted the progress report on the ERIKA 1 and two packages of proposals on maritime safety and related measures. The outcome of the packages is now satisfactory from our point of view, and I am pleased that a number of the issues have been taken forward by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). We look forward, subject to clarification on some points, to a decision in December on establishment of a European Maritime Safety Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/10">At a debate over lunch on the Galileo global navigation satellite system, the Minister for Transport set out the UK's concerns over the proposed Joint Undertaking management structure. When the Council resumed, the Presidency reported that COREPER would be continuing work on three main areas, with a view to a decision on proceeding with the project at the December Council. The areas of work are: arrangements for private sector involvement, in particular the need to avoid conflicts of interest; the best way of involving member states, with emphasis on the roles of a supervisory board and management committee; and involvement of the European Space Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/11">The Commission confirmed that a full revision of the transport Trans European Networks (TENs) guidelines would be undertaken in 2004. An interim revision will boost Community support to 20 per cent. for major rail infrastructure projects and cross-border bottlenecks on frontiers of candidate countries.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/12">The Commission gave a brief presentation on its recent White Paper on the common transport policy. The Presidency said that it would aim for a Council Resolution on the White Paper in December.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/13">My right hon. Friend the Minister for Transport was one of several Ministers who raised continuing concerns about the technical specification for digital tachographs. The Commission stated that adoption in December remained its goal.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/14">There was a progress report on the proposal to extend the requirement to fit vehicle speed limiters to a wider range of vehicles. With a view to political agreement in December, COREPER will be continuing work on the proposal, seeking solutions on the scope of the proposal and the issue of retrofitting, on both of which the UK and some other member states have expressed concerns.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/15">There was also a progress report on the proposal on training of professional drivers. Work on this will continue, with a view to the Council reaching agreement on it in December.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/16">No votes were taken at this Council.</p>

This was to provide a broad range of different situations to inform the survey's conclusions. The Department chose some authorities that have held or will be holding a referendum on directly elected mayors, others that intend to adopt a leader and cabinet form of executive and others who had yet to decide their preference. In addition, the Department wanted a wide geographical spread of locations to be surveyed. Based on those criteria, Westminster was a suitable candidate to be surveyed. Members of the public have also been surveyed in Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool, Harrow, Middlesbrough, Preston, Plymouth, Oxford and Derby.

This involves both new and existing programmes and initiatives as well as fiscal measures. Many recommendations are implemented through guidance to other bodies or through reorientation of existing policy. Therefore it is not possible to identify the proportion of DTLR spending specifically relevant to implementation of these recommendations.</p>

	<p pid=".105W.6/1">I do not currently plan to adopt a policy, in either the Building Regulations or the Approved Documents that support them, to limit the compartment size in single storey warehouse, distribution and storage premises.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.6/2">Nor do I currently plan to adopt a policy, in either the Building Regulations or the Approved Documents that support them, to require the installation of sprinklers in all warehouse, distribution and storage premises where there are compartment sizes in excess of 2000 square metres.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.6/3">Guidance on fire safety measures that will meet the requirements of the Building Regulations is given in Approved Document B (Fire safety). The 2000 edition of Approved Document B suggests that the compartment size of an unsprinklered single storey retail premises should not exceed 2000 square metres.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.6/4">The decision to limit the guidance on the use of sprinklers in the 2000 edition of Approved Document B to single storey retail buildings, as opposed to warehouse, distribution and storage premises, was based on the fact that retail buildings have the greater potential for loss of life. This is because of the large numbers of people that may be present within a retail building, the fact that they will generally be unfamiliar with their surroundings and the levels of managerial control that can be placed on members of the public is somewhat different to that which can be placed on staff in a warehouse type building. The decision to provide such guidance on single storey retail buildings was arrived at following the undertaking of a full Regulatory Impact Assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.6/5">Owing to the recognised fact that the level of risk to occupants and fire fighters can increase with height, the Approved Document does already suggest maximum compartment volumes, both with and without sprinklers, for multi-storey storage type buildings.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.6/6">No estimate has been made of the cost of requiring the installation of sprinklers in all new warehouses, storage and distribution buildings. This would form part of a Regulatory Impact Assessment should such a proposal be considered in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.6/7">I do not propose to adopt the policy of requiring all warehouse, distribution and storage premises to use only non-combustible core sandwich panels as this is a matter for consideration on a case-by case-basis. The 2000 edition of Approved Document B offers guidance on the use of sandwich panels within buildings. It offers design recommendations with regard to the selection of the type of panel core and its associated jointing and fixing system. It goes on to suggest that a risk assessment approach should be adopted to identify the appropriate solution.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.6/8">The Building Regulations are applicable to most building work that is undertaken in England and Wales, typically the erection or extension of a building. Fire precautions in warehouses in use are normally governed by the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997, as amended, and, where the warehouse has been designated as a factory, the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Fire safety legislation is concerned with life safety, and sprinklers will be required if they are necessary for the protection of employees or other occupants of the building.</p>
