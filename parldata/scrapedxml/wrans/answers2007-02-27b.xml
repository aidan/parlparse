Allocations in future years will depend on the outcome of this year's comprehensive spending review and DFID internal resource allocation decisions. We expect to maintain our support to Afghanistan in line with the UK's 10 year Development Partnership Agreement signed in January 2006. We committed to spending more than 50 per cent. of DFID's assistance to Afghanistan through the Government of Afghanistan's systems, which we believe to be the most effective way of delivering aid. We will in fact spend more than 70 per cent. through the budget this year, and hope to maintain this in future years in support of priorities set out in the Afghanistan National Development Strategy.</p>

The ARTF is a multi-donor funding mechanism managed by the World Bank, which applies rigorous procedures to protect against fiduciary risks and strengthen public financial management. DFID has provided a significant proportion of our aid through the ARTF since it was set up: &pound;15 million (20 per cent.) in 2002-03, &pound;34 million (43 per cent.) in 2003-04, &pound;47 million (5 per cent.) in 2004-05, &pound;79 million (78 per cent.) in 2005-06, and &pound;60 million (59 per cent.) in 2006-07.

	<p pid="b.1137W.2/1">The Temporary International Mechanism&mdash;TIM&mdash;pays allowances to Palestinian Authority (PA) civil employees, and those identified as hardship cases. The economic crisis has hit PA employees hardest, as the Government have not paid salaries since March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1137W.2/2">Initially the TIM paid allowances only to health workers. In August 2006, the G8 summit at St. Petersburg requested that the TIM be expanded, so all civil PA workers who had earned less than $600 per month (2,500 New Israeli Shekels) were included. In December 2006 the Quartet (US, Russia, UN and EU) requested a further expansion to remove the income ceiling entirely, so the TIM has been extended to all civil employees of the PA (excluding security forces and the civil police). The last payment in February 2007 paid all 77,000 civil PA employees. Only PA employees which are both on the PA payroll before the Hamas Government came to power, and which remain on the payroll as of December 2006, are entitled to allowances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1137W.2/3">Under the previous Palestinian Authority Government, the Ministry of Social Affairs made payments to 36,079 families. These beneficiaries now receive payments through the TIM. A further 36,600 beneficiaries have been added from lists compiled by the World Food Programme. The TIM Management Unit is evaluating a further 4,000 individuals to assess their eligibility for TIM benefits.</p>

	<p pid="b.1138W.3/1">DFID uses a range of approaches and aid instruments to fight specific diseases in developing countries according to the country situation. The preference is to provide budget support or pooled funds to support the implementation of countries' own health plans. Such approaches provide flexible and long term support to fund trained staff, essential medicines and the costs of delivering broad based health services. In more difficult settings where DFID supports large disease specific programmes it encourages the delivery of integrated packages of care, for example adding distribution of bednets, micronutrients, and other vital treatments to immunisation programmes. DFID also encourages others to buy into national plans and use national delivery systems to minimise the negative effect of projects that may divert funds, staff and effort to specific health issues at the expense of broad based services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1139W.5/1">All payments of allowances to Palestinian beneficiaries, made through the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM), are subject to five different counter-terrorism checks. These checks were a key requirement for the TIM to be approved by the Quartet (EU, US, Russia and the UN) and provide a safeguard that tax payers' money is not going to members of terrorist organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1139W.5/2">The total cost of bank charges is less than 3.5 per cent. of the overall total the TIM has paid out to Palestinians. Up to the end of February 2007, the total bank charge was &euro;4.57 million, out of a total allowance payment of &euro;131.6 million. While these bank charges are significant, they are an essential cost for providing aid in this way.</p>
	<p pid="b.1139W.5/3">We understand that the TIM is less optimal than budget support; however it is the best alternative in the current political context. We are unable to provide aid directly to the Palestinian Authority Government until they comply with the Quartet Principles to give up violence, recognise Israel and commit to previous agreements, including the road map for peace.</p>

	<p pid="b.1140W.2/1">DFID's assistance to Somalia has increased from less than &pound;2 million in 2002-03 to almost &pound;18.75 million in 2005-06. Our assistance is aimed at achieving a peaceful and economically viable Somalia, and is based on three objectives:</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/2" class="indent">(i) to help achieve a just and viable political settlement in Somalia;</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/3" class="indent">(ii) to work with others to establish the basis for effective development assistance,</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/4" class="indent">with an initial focus on improving governance and service delivery; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/5" class="indent">(iii) to ensure timely provision of humanitarian relief.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/6">A key part of DFID's support is channelled through the UNDP to provide direct support to the transitional federal institutions (TFIs). The UK, along with other donors (mainly the European Commission, Norway and Sweden), are providing both technical and financial assistance to help the TFIs to become established and build their capacity. Support to date has involved direct financial support to the costs of the TFIs through a UNDP project (e.g. refurbishment and equipping of TFI buildings, stipends for MPs, police and judiciary, and costs of TFI members' travel within Somalia). These donors are also providing capacity building support to the TFIs through an emergency technical assistance project, plus support for a constitution development project.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/7">DFID, alongside a broad group of other donors, is also providing support to the security and judiciary sector across Somalia through UNDP's rule of law and security programme. This support has helped establish three police training centres (one in Somaliland, one in Puntland and one in Baidoa), as well as helping to produce a Somali police Development Plan as a basis for re-establishing policing in south/central Somalia. Security sector review work is also being taken forward as a priority with Somaliland and Puntland. This programme has also financed the reconstruction of the prison in Hargeisa, so that it now meets international standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/8">The largest part of DFID's funding for Somalia to date has been in the form of humanitarian assistance, which has been provided in response to natural disasters which have afflicted Somalia in recent years. These funds have been channelled through UN agencies and NGOs. We continue to carefully monitor the humanitarian situation in Somalia and have been one of the leaders in the international response to these crises.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/9">In addition to our humanitarian response, we continue to support the education and health sectors via UN agencies and NGOs, and agreed last year a &pound;6 million education partnership with UNICEF and UNESCO.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/10">Much of DFID's funds are directed to Somaliland and Puntland in the north, as they are currently more stable. Somaliland receives 30 to 40 per cent. of UK assistance to Somalia. This includes support to the 2005 Somaliland parliamentary elections and the upcoming presidential election.</p>

	<p pid="b.1141W.6/1">The Casino Advisory Panel established by the Secretary of State, to recommend the local authority areas for the 17 new casinos permitted under the Gambling Act 2005, is independent from Government. The panel made its recommendations to the Secretary of State in their final report on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January 2007</phrase>. In paragraph 88, &quot;Ambient and Impulse Gambling&quot;, of their final report the Casino Advisory Panel stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.1141W.6/2" class="indent">&quot;Throughout our consideration of the submitted evidence we noted concern that the location of a casino in or near an area of social deprivation could locally worsen problem gambling and debt. For example, people in financial trouble might see the prospect of an unlimited jackpot as a &quot;quick fix&quot; to their problems. Such concern is supported, for example, in Sir Alan Budd's report by a reference in the British Prevalence Survey associating the highest percentages of problem gambling with table games in a casino, betting and fruit machines, and we note also evidence as to correlation between proximity and problem gambling related to casinos. Our remit, however, is to look at areas rather than sites and we have very much focussed on that. Moreover, town planning policy throughout Britain regards casinos as a town centre use. So our view is that problem gambling is more a town planning consideration rather than one for us, though we have noted in our appraisals where it is proposed to locate a casino near to an area of deprivation. In the event, this consideration has in no case been determinative.&quot;</p>

Despite Zimbabwe voluntarily withdrawing from the Commonwealth in July 2003, following their suspension from the Council of the Commonwealth earlier that year, the status of their citizens is not affected in UK law, and they remain eligible to join the British armed forces. To change this situation would require an Order in Council amending the British Nationality Act 1981 and currently there are no plans to make such an Order in respect of Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid="b.1147W.9/1">British Army Gurkhas serve under their own unique terms and conditions of service, which include a pension scheme. The Gurkha Pension Scheme is based on the Indian Army model. It provides an immediate pension at Indian Army rates, according to rank, to every Gurkha who completes at least 15 years service, together with associated lump-sum payments. 15 years is the maximum length of service permitted to soldiers on the Gurkha engagement up to and including the rank of corporal. The pension increases for higher ranks, including Queen's Gurkha officers and longer service, but only WO1 and above can normally serve up to 22 years. Pensions are calculated in Indian Rupees and paid in Nepali Rupees, with MOD bearing all exchange costs and losses. They are uplifted annually for local inflation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1147W.9/2">In a 1981 review, Gurkha pensions were set at the top band of the relevant Indian Army scales. In 1999, Gurkha pensions were uplifted by at least 100 per cent. to reflect the benefits &quot;in kind&quot; understood to be provided to Indian Army &quot;Gorkha&quot; pensioners in India, such as medical facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1147W.9/3">The current review of Gurkha terms and conditions of service has been looking at the case for changing these arrangements for those Gurkhas who left the Army on or after <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>. Account has been taken of the trend, resulting from the change to the immigration rules in 2004, for ex-Gurkhas to settle in UK rather than Nepal. <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase> was the date when the Gurkhas became a UK-based force on completion of the withdrawal from Hong Kong.

	<p pid="b.1151W.11/1">The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations apply to all employers in the private and public sector. Employers who fail to comply with them are liable to be taken to an employment tribunal by individuals who believe they have been subject to unlawful age discrimination. To date, there have been 558 claims lodged with the employment tribunal service. This suggests that the vast majority of employers have recognised the value of taking a non-ageist approach.</p>

	<p pid="b.1152W.2/1">As with other strands of discrimination legislation individuals of any age can enforce their employment rights through employment tribunals. Once the Commission for Equality and Human Rights (CEHR) is established in October it will provide institutional support on age discrimination for the first time. The new Commission will be an independent influential champion whose purpose is to reduce inequality, eliminate discrimination, strengthen good relations between people and protect human rights. The CEHR will take an active role in helping to achieve change to benefit some of the most vulnerable and least well represented people in our society.</p>

	<p pid="b.1152W.8/1">The Government's Market Transformation Programme (MTP) has analysed the performances of over 630 televisions sold in 2004, 2005 and 2006 and has concluded that the difference in energy consumption between analogue and integrated digital televisions (IDTVs) is negligible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.8/2">The annual consumption of a television varies significantly with screen size and television type, and defining what constitutes a 'typical' television is difficult. However, for a 32 inch widescreen cathode-ray television, MTP estimates that the annual consumption will be 292 kWh, and 310 kWh for a LCD screen of the same size. A 42 inch (a typical size for this technology) plasma TV will consume 746 kWh per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.8/3">However, digital transmission is more efficient than analogue in terms of power usage. Replacing the analogue terrestrial transmission network with a nationwide digital terrestrial television network will lead to a significant net reduction in energy usage by transmission networks, estimated to be 186 GWh per year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1156W.12/1">The Department has not made any specific economic assessment of the impact of phasing out the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (SAWS) on British agriculture and the soft fruit sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1156W.12/2">However, the Government are fully aware of the concerns expressed by farmers and growers that the abolition of SAWS will adversely impact upon their businesses by depriving the industry of a source of much needed seasonal workers. To address these concerns the Government decided that SAWS should not be phased out until 2010. This is to allow time for the industry to adapt to new sources of supply of workers from the new member states. It is evident from data collected by the Worker Registration Scheme that many farmers and growers are making this transition. According to the Accession Monitoring Report (produced by the Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue and Customs and Department for Communities and Local Government) between May 2004 to September 2006 some 56,000 workers from the A8 member states (excluding Cyprus and Malta) registered to work in the agricultural and horticultural sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1156W.12/3">The Government appreciate that there may be occasions when, despite the availability of workers from the new member states, employers are still unable to recruit sufficient workers to meet their labour needs. The Government have therefore made provision under Tier 3 of the Points-Based System (PBS) for managed migration to set up short-term, quota-based schemes for workers from outside the EU to address temporary shortages. This will ensure that we can respond flexibly and quickly to meet shortages in the supply of workers when these cannot be met from the resident and EU labour force.</p>
	<p pid="b.1156W.12/4">Together, these measures should ensure that the phasing out of SAWS will have a minimal impact on British agriculture.</p>

	<p pid="b.1157W.2/1">There are already regulations in place which control the commercial breeding and sale of dogs. These regulations are enforced by local authorities who have powers to license and inspect premises for purposes of animal welfare.</p>
	<p pid="b.1157W.2/2">In addition to the existing regulations, from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-06">6 April</phrase>, under the new Animal Welfare Act, all owners and keepers of animals will have a statutory duty to provide for the welfare needs of their animals. Failure to do so could result in a fine of &pound;5,000 or six months' imprisonment, or both.</p>
	<p pid="b.1157W.2/3">It is our intention to replace the current dog-breeding legislation with new regulations, introduced as secondary legislation, under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. We will consider whether the regulations controlling the commercial breeding and sale of dogs need to be tightened.</p>
	<p pid="b.1157W.2/4">The Kennel Club have recently launched an Accredited Breeders Scheme which seeks to raise the welfare level of breeding bitches and their puppies. This scheme will provide valuable lessons when it comes to framing any new legislation in this area. However, it will take time for these lessons to be evaluated and therefore it would be premature to speculate on the timing of any new legislation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1161W.0/1">Targeted surveillance for all types of avian influenza viruses in wild birds is in place throughout the UK and is ongoing. The targeted surveillance focuses on species of wild birds that experts believe to have a greater potential role in the spread of avian influenza viruses. There is a comprehensive list which generally includes ducks, geese, swans, gulls and waders. Sampling is targeted to high priority surveillance areas, which have been chosen on the basis of abundance of migratory waterbird species and domestic poultry. Members of the public can report dead swans, ducks, geese, waders and gulls by calling the Defra Helpline on 08459 33 55 77.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.0/2">There are also over 300 selected reserves across the UK that are actively patrolled by partner organisations on a voluntary basis for dead wild birds, which are then tested. Since the beginning of February over 300 wild bird reserve patrols had been carried out.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.0/3">Within the area around the infected premises in Suffolk and Norfolk, there have been enhanced levels of surveillance of wild birds. We are aware of 30 key waterbird locations in Suffolk (such as estuaries and marshes). 12 of these locations are within 20 kilometres of the infected premises, of which 10 are patrolled regularly as part of the programme. Six of those sites have been patrolled over 100 times since the patrol programme began in early November 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.0/4">After consultation with expert ornithological groups we decided that at the infected premises it would be more practical to take faecal samples from the environment than catch and test live wild birds. These samples were negative.</p>

Furthermore, this burden is borne disproportionately by the poorest in society and the poorest EU member states, who spend twice the proportion of their income on food.

	<p pid="b.1164W.6/3">The Veterinary Medicines Regulations are one of a number of simplification measures the Department is taking forward. The Department's 2006 simplification plan, 'Maximising Outcomes, Minimising Burdens', identifies a reduction in the administrative burden Defra imposes on business of &pound;159 million, more than 30 per cent. of the Department's total administrative burden. Copies of the simplification plan are available from the Library of the House.</p>

We are nevertheless planning an early review of progress, which will look at the effectiveness of measures already in place and seek information about how best to target new agreements.

	<p pid="b.1166W.5/1">Flood risk is defined as the probability that flooding may occur, together with its consequences. The Environment Agency (EA) is the principal operating authority with responsibility for managing flood risk and undertakes annual National Assessments of Flood Risk. The agency's 2005 assessment identified 2.1 million properties in England at risk of flooding. The results from the 2006 assessment will be published shortly and are expected to be similar to those for 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1166W.5/2">Assessments of location-specific risk are carried out by the flood risk operating authorities, primarily the EA. Relevant activities, include the current review of Shoreline Management Plans around the coast, and the development of catchment flood management plans inland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1166W.5/3">The EA uses the National Flood and Coastal Defence Database to monitor the condition of its assets, with a quarterly review of progress. The frequency of individual asset inspection depends on the level of flood risk involved. Targets and standards for maintaining flood risk management infrastructure are set out in the EA's corporate plan, and outturn is recorded in its annual report. Both of these are available from the EA's website.</p>

	<p pid="b.1168W.5/1">Grants for conservation and woodland protection will be offered under the Rural Development Programme for England 2007-13, through Environmental Stewardship and the English Woodland Grant Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.5/2">A significant proportion of the funding for the programme will come from voluntary modulation. The EU regulation governing voluntary modulation, which must be in place before we can finalise our budgets, is still under negotiation at EU level and is not expected to be adopted until the spring. We will not be able to announce the final amounts of funding available for the next programme until after this has been resolved. The details of our Rural Development Programme, including grant rates, will then be subject to approval by the EU Commission.</p>

	<p pid="b.1169W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169W.2/2">In the financial year 2006-07, the Department for Transport, via the Energy Saving Trust (EST), provided grants towards the installation of 11 refuelling pumps for high-blend (&quot;E85&quot;) bioethanol fuel and 29 recharging points for electric vehicles under the Refuelling and Recharging Infrastructure Grant Programme. In the first year of the programme (2005-06), one grant was provided towards the cost of a natural gas refuelling point. Further details on the availability of renewable transport fuels across the UK are available via the EST website at <a href="http://www.est.org.uk/fleet/vehicles/">http://www.est.org.uk/fleet/vehicles/</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1169W.2/3">The Government are due to introduce a Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) in April 2008. This will ensure a significant and stable market for renewable road transport fuels. The level of the RTFO will reach 5 per cent. in 2010-11, which should mean that by that date, some 2.5 billion litres of renewable transport fuels per annum will be sold in the UK. The Government are currently consulting on the detailed design of the RTFO and on how it might evolve over time. Copies of the consultation are available via <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/roads/rtfo">http://www.dft.gov.uk/roads/rtfo</a> and are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169W.2/4">In the short to medium term, biofuels are likely to make up the great majority of renewable transport fuel sales in the UK. Biofuel sales made up some 0.5 per cent. of total transport fuel sales in 2006. Monthly and annual UK fuel sales data are available via the HM Revenue and Customs website at <a href="http://www.uktradeinfo.com/index.cfm?task=bullhydro">http://www.uktrade info.com/index.cfm?task=bullhydro</a> Sales of biofuels in 2007-08 will depend on a variety of factors, including the relative prices of crude oil and biofuel feedstocks. As a result of the introduction of the RTFO, sales of biofuels in 2008-09 should reach some 2.5 per cent. of total transport fuel sales, rising to 3.75 per cent. in 2009-10 and 5 per cent. in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169W.2/5">Achieving these targets will not require any significant changes to the transport fuel supply and distribution infrastructure, since biofuels can already be blended at low levels into conventional fossil fuels with no adaptations to either the vehicle or the refuelling point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169W.2/6">In the longer term, other renewable transport fuels (including renewably produced hydrogen or electricity) are also likely to become more widespread. Hydrogenpowered vehicles would require a dedicated refuelling infrastructure, the costs of which were considered in the Government's response to the 2004 report &quot;A Strategic Framework for Hydrogen Energy in the UK&quot;, which is available in the Libraries of the House and at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sources/sustainable/hydrogen/strategic-framework/page26734.html">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sources/sustainable/hydrogen/strategic-framework/page26734. html</a></p>

	<p pid="b.1170W.2/1">The integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) directive (96/61/EC)<sup>(1)</sup> is about preventing pollution, rather than reacting to it. Each installation subject to the directive must have a permit containing conditions which are set to achieve a high level of protection for the environment. Those conditions comprise pollutant emission limit values and other operating conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.2/2">Member states are required by the directive to ensure that the conditions of the permit are complied with. To ensure that, and hence to ensure the environment is protected from pollution which might otherwise be caused, it is essential that each installation is inspected regularly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.2/3">Inspections incur costs which have to be recovered through the charging system from each operator. The Environment Agency has developed a risk-based approach to determining inspection frequencies, under which compliant installations are visited less frequently than those with a history of non-compliance, and this is reflected in the charging scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1174W.2/1">It is rare for a waste private finance initiative (PFI) project to have just one technological solution or one waste processing facility. Essentially, PFI credits are awarded to authorities to deliver increased diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill. Once they have analysed sufficiently the technical, environmental and economic options, an authority can choose to deliver this diversion by adopting a range of waste management technological solutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1174W.2/2">All waste PFI projects have a recycling element included. However, none of the projects have been funded solely on the basis of undertaking recycling. A project eligible for PFI credits needs to demonstrate how it will complement longer term national targets for recycling.</p>

	<p pid="b.1175W.2/1">The average contract length of a private finance initiative (PFI) project, which has an energy from waste facility as one of several waste management technology solutions, is approximately 25 years. PFI credits are awarded to authorities primarily to deliver increased diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill. Most PFI projects use a combination of waste processing technologies rather than a single technology. Typically, energy from waste, as a waste processing option, is used in combination with other waste processing technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.2/2">A minimum tonnage of waste throughput is usually guaranteed throughout the contract period as funders, typically banks, would otherwise expose themselves to unconstrained waste volume risk over the term of the contract. Very recently, we have become aware that certain waste management companies with access to waste arising have been prepared to underwrite a block of plant capacity, thereby opening up the possibility of shorter contracts for smaller volumes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1175W.5/1">The UK will continue to protest at the highest diplomatic level against Norway and Iceland's commercial whaling activities which, though legal, are not in keeping with the spirit of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). We will continue our efforts, along with other countries, to urge these countries to reconsider their position and end this unjustified and unnecessary practice. Indeed, in November 2006, the UK led a diplomatic demarche of 25 countries together with the European Commission in condemning the Icelandic Government's decision to resume commercial whaling.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.5/2">The UK Government have regularly criticised Japanese and Icelandic scientific whaling programmes as being of little scientific value and urged both countries to terminate them forthwith. In December last year, the British ambassador to Japan took part in a 27-country demarche to both the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Japanese Fisheries Agency to protest against Japan's programme of lethal special permit (&quot;scientific&quot;) whaling in the Southern Ocean.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.5/3">In order to help recruit more conservation-minded countries to the IWC, we have produced a new publication, &quot;Protecting Whales&mdash;A Global Responsibility&quot;, endorsed by the Prime Minister and by Sir David Attenborough, which has been sent to 57 countries, both anti and pro-whaling, encouraging them to join the effort to protect all cetacean species.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175W.5/4">DEFRA officials ensure that Foreign and Commonwealth Office posts in the relevant capitals are briefed, and engage in discussion with their counterparts on whaling at every appropriate opportunity. This ensures that countries are in no doubt of the importance that the UK attaches to whale conservation. This is particularly important as we approach the next IWC meeting to be held in Anchorage, Alaska in May.</p>

	<p pid="b.1176W.2/2">It is clear that the strength of opposition to Iceland's actions has surprised the Icelandic Government, and there is a healthy debate in the Icelandic press about the wisdom of the Government's decision.

Deepening economic co-operation between the EU and the US will not only bring the benefits of helping to remove remaining barriers to trade and investment but also serve as a positive step towards a more flexible and efficient global economy.</p>

The EU has allocated around &pound;4.4 million to projects in Iran under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. Three projects, to which the EU has allocated a total of &pound;2.9 million, are implemented by United Nations agencies. A further &pound;1 million project was launched in January 2005.

	<p pid="b.1187W.8/1">We regularly discuss the issue concerned with the Turkish and Armenian authorities, including when the UK's Special Representative for the South Caucasus visited Turkey in January. We welcomed the Turkish Government's offer in 2005 of an impartial investigation by historians into the events of 1915-16. The Armenian Government suggested a commission to consider this and all other bilateral issues. Regrettably, there is no agreement between the parties thus far on how to take this forward.</p>

All of the fraud and customer error estimates are calculated by applying the percentage overpaid in 2000-01 to the annual expenditure on incapacity benefit.<br/> 2. Official error in incapacity benefit has been measured in every year since 2000-01.<br/> 3. The official error estimates for 2004-05 and 2005-06 differ from those published in the relevant departmental resource accounts, as up to date estimates were not available at the time.<br/> 4. As the measurement system is based on the examination of a sample of the incapacity benefit case load, the estimates are subject to a degree of statistical uncertainty. For example, the central estimate of official error in 2005-06 is &pound;90 million, but the range in which we can be 95 per cent. sure that the true value lies runs from &pound;70 million to &pound;120 million.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1198W.2/2">Under our reforms, more people will be receiving state pensions based on their national insurance records, and there will be a more generous basic state pension due to the restoration of the earnings link. This provides a solid foundation for private saving. The guarantee credit will continue to provide a safety net and reforms to the savings credit will reduce the spread of means-testing and support the savings incentives that are an integral part of the reform package.</p>
	<p pid="b.1198W.2/3">Raising the level of the basic state pension as specified would lead to a series of cliff-edges in the weekly amounts being received by different retirement cohorts in the same year. An individual who retires in 2009 with full entitlement would receive around &pound;84 (in 2007-08 earnings terms) of weekly basic pension income. In 2012, when earnings-uprating commences, this amount of basic pension would be worth around &pound;82 per week. This individual would then receive this amount each year of their retirement. However, another individual retiring in 2015 would receive &pound;100 in weekly basic pension income&mdash;almost &pound;20 more per week than an individual retiring six years earlier. This disparity would continue to grow until 2030, when new retirees would receive &pound;115 per week.</p>
	<p pid="b.1198W.2/4">The following table contains the cost of raising the basic state pension as specified in the hon. Member's question. These costs are additional to the costs of pension reform set out in the regulatory impact assessment accompanying the Pensions Bill. No further policy changes have been assumed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1202W.11/1">The police service is making excellent progress towards the implementation of neighbourhood policing throughout England and Wales by 2008. In support of this, we will provide continuing funding towards the provision of 16,000 PCSOs in 2007-08. We will not expect forces to increase the number of PCSOs beyond this, although they may of course choose to do so according to local circumstances and need.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.11/2">The police service has advised that the sustainable rollout of neighbourhood policing by 2008 may not require 24,000 PCSOs, so we are giving local forces the flexibility they have asked for to determine the most appropriate staffing mix in their neighbourhood teams.</p>

A prisoner must be assigned to the correct security category even if it may not be possible to allocate the prisoner to a particular establishment for prisoners in that category. Therefore, as prison places can hold a variety of category of prisoner (but not a higher category than the prison is designated to hold), it is not possible to calculate the number of vacant prison places for each category.</p>

The findings suggested that 20 per cent. of the prison population have some form of unseen (hidden) disability which will affect and undermine their performance in both education and work settings. A further 32 per cent. of the sample who were given an in-depth assessment had literacy difficulties but did not show positive evidence of the characteristics of dyslexia, dyspraxia or other unseen disabilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1225W.2/1">It is for the Court of Appeal or the Sentencing Guidelines Council to issue guidance to courts about sentencing practice. Criminal Justice Ministers made a statement to the National Criminal Justice Board on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-23">23 January 2007</phrase>, which included a reference to the sentencing principles set out in legislation. The Senior Presiding Judge, who sits on the Board, agreed with the Lord Chief Justice that the statement should be drawn to the attention of all judges and magistrates as they took the view that it was helpful.</p>
	<p pid="b.1225W.2/2">The Sentencing Guidelines Council was set up in March 2004 and we are not aware of previous communication to the judiciary about sentencing guidelines. But the statement to the National Criminal Justice Board is not unprecedented. For instance, a similar statement was issued in November 2002 by the then Home Secretary, Lord Chancellor and Attorney-General.</p>

	<p pid="b.1225W.5/1">Monitoring of sentencing guidelines is primarily a matter for the Sentencing Guidelines Council. It is not possible to make an estimate of the proportion of cases where sentencing guidelines were not followed in individual sentencing decisions, particularly when there have so far been few offence specific sentencing guidelines published. The Sentencing Guidelines Council publishes information about sentencing trends and monitors decisions of the Court of Appeal for those cases where an appeal involves consideration of the application of a guideline.</p>

	<p pid="b.1231W.5/1">Noise from departing aircraft is continually monitored by BAA at 10 fixed sites under the departure tracks at Heathrow. The monitors are put in place to gauge whether aircraft comply with the departure noise limits specified in the noise abatement notice for Heathrow under Section 78(1) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982. The noise limits apply at a distance of 6.5 kilometres from aircraft 'start of roll', so the location of the fixed monitors is relatively close to the airport; it does not extend to Wandsworth. Compliance is reviewed regularly through the Noise and Track Keeping Working Group, and data is published annually in BAA's Flight Evaluation Reports. There are no equivalent limits for arriving aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231W.5/2">Data from the fixed monitors, together with additional mobile noise monitors, is used to validate a noise exposure model for the 16 hour daytime summer period. The Civil Aviation Authority, on behalf of the Department, uses the model to produce annual noise contours at Heathrow airport, representing noise from both arriving and departing aircraft. (ERCD Report 0406, available on the CAA website, shows the location of both fixed and mobile monitoring sites over recent years.) The 2005 noise contours were published last December and are available on the Department's website.</p>

These measures came into effect in July 2005. The Government have agreed that, at a suitable point during the lifetime of the new provisions, they will publish a report on the impact of the new measures in the Act, including an indication of whether the Government are minded to move towards a registration scheme. Sections 45 and 47 of the Children Act 2004 make provisions which allow the Government to introduce a registration scheme in England at any point within four years of the Act receiving Royal Assent. The report will therefore be prepared and published in time for Parliament to consider the matter by November 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1238W.6/4">Prior to the publication of the Further Education and Training Bill, departmental officials discussed how these proposals might be taken forward from the Quality Assurance Agency and the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The views of the Association of Colleges and other representative bodies from the further education sector were also taken. The Department then launched a written consultation on November 2006, and in response received over 30 written submissions on the proposals from a wide range of stakeholder bodies. There have been numerous discussions about the proposals too. The representations we have received have been instrumental in modifying the proposals of Clause 19 to ensure that the views of the further and higher education sectors, and other interested parties, are taken into account.</p>

The results are published in Roads Service's annual Traffic and Travel Information Report, which presents the traffic volumes in a variety of formats for each site. The figures quoted are based on the latest available report, which is the 2005 census.</p>

	<p pid="b.1249W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mrs. Katharine Bryan, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-27">27 February 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1249W.5/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question about how many and what proportion of rateable premises are without a mains water supply in each <i> (a)</i> parliamentary constituency and <i> (b)</i> district council area in Northern Ireland (123611). I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1249W.5/4" class="indent">It is estimated that less than 1 per cent. of domestic properties in Northern Ireland are not connected to the mains water supply. Water Service does not, at present, hold records of unconnected properties but is currently developing a comprehensive customer database in preparation for the introduction of domestic charging from April this year. The database will identify any domestic properties not connected to the mains water supply. It will be able to report by district council area but not by parliamentary constituency.</p>

	<p pid="b.1250W.3/1">We are introducing a range of new measures at the May 2007 local elections that are designed to strengthen the security of postal voting. These build on the measures successfully introduced in May 2006, which helped to detect the alleged fraud in Tower Hamlets. The new measures include: the use of personal identifiers by postal voters; the new offence of falsely applying for a postal vote; the requirement in all cases for a reason to be given if postal ballot papers are to be sent to a different address to that at which the postal voter is registered; a marked register of returned postal votes; and new secrecy warnings on postal voting documents.</p>

	<p pid="b.1254W.2/1">The Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 allows criminal courts the discretion to order that an acquitted defendant, who has paid for their own legal costs, be reimbursed for the costs properly incurred by him in those proceedings out of central funds. The data held centrally cannot identify the average hourly rate paid to either solicitors or counsel from central funds. However, claims are assessed by a determining officer, who will allow work which has been actually and reasonably done. In assessing the appropriate hourly rate the determining officer will have regard to the guideline figures for the summary assessment of costs used in the civil courts.</p>

	<p pid="b.1254W.5/1">We are unable to provide a figure for an average hourly rate. The legal aid schemes provide for a variety of ways in which lawyers can be remunerated, including through fixed, standard, and graduated fees, individual contract rates and prescribed hourly rates. In successful civil cases, where an order may be made for payment of costs by the opponent, providers may be remunerated at market rates. Barristers' fees are generally not set by reference to hourly rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1254W.5/2">Where hourly rates are used, different hourly rates are set out in regulations and contracts depending on whether the case is civil or criminal, the tribunal or court where representation is provided and other factors. Providers can also claim enhancements and uplifts, depending on, for example, matter type, complexity, or seniority of fee earner. As part of our legal aid reform programme we are extending the categories of work that are covered by fixed, standard and graduated fees.</p>

	<p pid="b.1256W.6/1">My Department's estimates are based on the results of the independent review conducted by economic consultancy firm Frontier Economics, published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-16">16 October 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.6/2">Table 3 of their report estimates that including reading, consideration and consultation time in calculating the appropriate limit would result in a 4 per cent. volume reduction of requests processed within the appropriate limit across central Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.6/3">If the aggregation of non-similar requests was introduced it would result in an 8 per cent. volume reduction of requests processed within the appropriate limit across central Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.6/4">These figures are the estimated volume reductions for introducing each option on its own and are not additive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.6/5">Under the Act authorities are not obliged to answer a request if it is estimated to exceed the appropriate limit, but may still choose to do so. The request volume reduction figures in the Frontier Economics report are upper-band figures and assume that Government bodies apply the provisions in all cases where possible and do not exercise discretion in application.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.6/6">Where authorities are refusing on the ground of cost, they are under a statutory obligation to provide advice and assistance to enable the requestor to refine their request so that it can be processed within the appropriate cost limit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256W.6/7">The independent review showed that a small minority of requests and requestors account for disproportionate amounts of the cost of answering FOI requests. Our proposals are designed to address this issue by targeting the 5 per cent. of requests that account for 45 per cent. of the time spent dealing with initial requests, as detailed at Figure 5 of the Frontier Economics report.</p>

	<p pid="b.1263W.12/1">The National Blood Service (NBS) has proposed that processing and testing facilities will be consolidated at three sites. The outline strategy does not propose that all services will relocate to just these three sites. Services that need to be close to either patients or blood donors will remain so. The specialist services provided to hospitals by the NBS will be rationalised to ensure services continue to be delivered to those hospitals that require them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1263W.12/2">While demand for red cells is falling, demand for specialist services continues to grow. Specialist services are currently subsidised by income from the provision of blood and component products. NBS therefore is aiming to make efficiencies and have regard to economy of scale considerations that allow expanding services to develop further, while reducing subsidies.</p>

	<p pid="b.1274W.9/1">The Department does not collect data centrally on the use and disposal of radioactive materials by hospitals. The Radioactive Substances Act 1993 requires that hospitals register their use and storage of radioactive materials and hold authorisation for disposal and accumulation of radioactive waste. Under these structures, the registered users maintain detailed local records of use, storage and disposal of radioactive materials. The Environment Agency maintains information on the individual registrations and authorisations, which include the maximum limits on radioactivity permitted. In addition, the Agency holds records related to waste radioactive materials through the pollution inventory.</p>
	<p pid="b.1274W.9/2">The uses of radioactive materials in diagnostic and therapeutic medicine are almost without exception confined to materials of very short half-life. The waste is mostly disposed of by decay, with extreme dilution to watercourses (where strict measures are used to estimate the rate of discharge and ensure that drinking water is never put at risk), as waste for incineration or by dilution in other waste for local authority disposal. As a consequence of these methods of disposal there is no significant burden to the low-level waste repository.</p>

	<p pid="b.1278W.5/1">The Department has made available, via its Prodigy and NHS Direct websites, detailed information on myasthenia gravis suitable for both health professionals and the general public. In addition, the recently published musculoskeletal services framework will help to raise awareness of all musculoskeletal conditions, including myasthenia gravis, among health professionals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1278W.5/2">Data on hospital waiting times for specific conditions are not collected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1278W.5/3">The national service framework (NSF) for long-term conditions is supporting local sustained improvements in service quality for people with long-term conditions, including myasthenia gravis. The NSF addresses a range of key issues including the need for equitable access to a range of services and the ability to see a specialist and get the right investigations and diagnosis as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1278W.5/4">It is for primary care trusts, in consultation with other stakeholders, to determine the appropriate level of services, and the number of health professionals required, to meet the needs of their local populations living with myasthenia gravis.</p>

	<p pid="b.1279W.2/1">Although health services are covered by the European Union (EU) Treaty, it is well accepted that EU activity must respect the responsibilities of the member states for organising and managing their health systems. Last year's EU ministerial statement on values and common principles underlined the importance of the social objectives that health systems have to deliver.</p>
	<p pid="b.1279W.2/2">National health service bodies generally fall outside the scope of EU competition rules. As set out in &quot;Health reform in England: update and next steps&quot;, published in July 2006, the introduction of competition will not be appropriate in all services. &quot;The Future regulation of health and adult social care in England&quot;, published in November 2006, described the Department's position on choice and competition, the need for proportionate and transparent system management and the benefits for patients and the public. As set out in this document, we will provide further guidance in spring 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1280W.2/1">The provision of in-year financial support or brokerage is no longer permitted. Deficits in national health service organisations must rest where they fall. In 2006-07, strategic health authorities (SHAs) have the power to agree a resource top-slice from their primary care trusts in order to create a reserve which the SHA may then use to balance the overall financial position across its economy. Organisations making a contribution to this reserve can expect those contributions to be returned over a period which will not normally exceed the three-year allocation cycle. Transactions to create these reserves must be fully reflected in the accounts of each organisation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1285W.0/1">Plans originally developed in autumn 2004 assumed that all deployments of picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) delivered through the national programme for information technology would be completed by the end of March 2007. These plans were subsequently revised to reflect delay due to the impact of a Judicial Review by an unsuccessful bidder which failed in its challenge to the procurement process in the courts, and to the need to re-negotiate the PACS contract in the programme's north west and west midlands cluster area. Despite this delay the majority of installations, including 100 per cent. of those planned in London and the south of England, will have been completed by this date, in line with plans for 100 per cent. completion across the national health service in England by the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1285W.0/2">As at the end of January 2007, 69 NHS trusts had implemented PACS over a period of 21 months as a result of the national programme, and they are currently estimated to be treating in the region of 160,000 patients each week using the technology. This compares to 43 implementations over 14 years in the period prior to the inception of the programme. Including trusts where PACS had been installed prior to the programme, more than 65 per cent. of acute trusts in England are now using PACS, making estimated savings of up to a third of a million pounds each per annum on the cost of x-ray films and processing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1285W.0/3">Local service providers are currently installing PACS at an average rate of four trusts a month. Information on progress in individual local service provider areas is in the table.</p>

	<p pid="b.1286W.0/1">The Department has commissioned no such research. However, the Department already recommends that women trying to get pregnant should take a daily 400 microgram (meg) folic acid supplement from the time they stop using contraception until the 12th week of pregnancy. Women should also eat foods containing folate, the natural form of folic acid, such as green vegetables and brown rice as well as fortified bread and breakfast cereals. Folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects such as spina bifida in the newborn.</p>

I am replying in her absence. (122783)</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.11/4" class="indent">The most recent year for which figures are available is 2005. The table below shows the number of deaths for the 10 leading causes of death in boys and girls aged 11-16 years of age in England and Wales in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.11/5" class="indent">There are many ways in which 'causes' of death are defined for different purposes. The cause of death groups used here are based on a list developed by the World Health Organization, modified for use in England and Wales. An article published in 2005<sup>(l)</sup> examined four variations of this cause list. It proposed mutually exclusive cause groups and recommended that for ranking causes of death the most useful groupings split cancers by site and accidents by mechanism (e.g. drowning/poisoning). That recommendation has been followed for the data reported here.</p>

	<p pid="b.1298W.0/2" class="indent">Alternatively secured pensions were introduced to meet the specific needs of certain religious groups that have a principled religious objection to the pooling of mortality risk through annuities. As explained in the partial regulatory impact assessment published at pre-Budget report (Tax Relief for Pensions&mdash;2006 pre-Budget report Reforms) the fiscal impact of introducing ASPs are part of the overall costs of pension simplification. Estimates of the overall Exchequer costs of pension simplification remain at &pound;25 million for 2006-07, rising to &pound;250 million in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.1298W.0/3">Widespread use of ASP would have a potential additional cost to the Exchequer due to deferral of tax charges where pensions are not used to provide an income in retirement.</p>
