	<p pid="b.1036W.2/1">Since 2004 penalty notices for disorder (PNDs) have been available to the police to deal quickly and effectively with low-level, antisocial and nuisance offending, including minor instances of shoplifting. The scheme allows the police to spend more time on frontline duties and provides an alternative to prosecution in appropriate cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.1036W.2/2">In July 2009 revised operational guidance was issued to police forces to restrict the issue of PNDs for retail theft to first-time offenders who are not substance mis-users and to cases where the value of goods stolen does not exceed &#163;100.</p>
	<p pid="b.1036W.2/3">The scheme is not designed to tackle more serious offending, which should be prosecuted at court.</p>
	<p pid="b.1036W.2/4">The Government are undertaking a full assessment of sentencing policy to ensure that it is effective in deterring crime, protecting the public, punishing offenders and cutting reoffending. We will be considering our approach to all out-of-court disposals as part of this work.</p>

	<p pid="b.1036W.8/1">HMCS systems do not currently identify how many or how much of the value of fines imposed just in magistrates courts within a certain period remain outstanding, this information could be provided only at disproportionate cost as it would require a manual search of all fine accounts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1036W.8/2">However HMCS systems can identify the total amount imposed within the last three years and the total value outstanding. The total value outstanding can relate to fines imposed in any previous period and includes financial penalties imposed a number of years ago during the period when fines could not be cancelled (2004-06) and financial penalties which are being paid by instalments. The total amount imposed and balance outstanding includes fines imposed in the magistrates and Crown courts, compensation, costs, victims surcharge and the value of unpaid fixed penalty notices that are transferred to HMCS for enforcement as a fine. The outstanding balance has risen through the application of a strict policy that only allows fines to be written off in certain circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.1047W.6/1">Our embassy in Rangoon regularly meets representatives of ethnic minority groups both inside Burma and on the Thai-Burma border. This includes recent meetings with the Karen, Shan, Rohingya, Mon and Chin where forthcoming elections were discussed. Such groups have faced difficulties with the process of registration, membership listing, candidate nominations, severe funding restrictions and in some cases harassment from the regime. Foreign and Commonwealth officials also recently met a delegation of ethnic representatives in London to discuss forthcoming elections and further meetings with ethnic leaders are scheduled. Our ambassador in Rangoon repeatedly raises his concern with the regime that forthcoming elections will not be free and fair while ethnic and other opposition parties continue to be excluded or face tough restrictions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1049W.0/1">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is responsible for the child maintenance system. I have asked the Child Maintenance Commissioner to write to the hon. Member with the information requested and I have seen the response.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.0/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.0/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions whether all pre-2003 Child Support Agency cases will be transferred to the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission by 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.0/5" class="indent">The problems encountered by the Child Support Agency following the launch of the Reforms in 2003 resulted in a decision to defer the bulk transfer of cases from the old (launched in 1993) scheme, to the current (launched in 2003) child support scheme. In the meantime, cases were only migrated from the old computer system to the new computer system where they had a link with a case on the new system that made this necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.0/6" class="indent">This decision was kept under review and in February 2006 the Government asked Sir David Henshaw to review the entire system of child maintenance. His subsequent report led to the Government's White paper and to the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008, which makes provision for a new system of child maintenance known as the &quot;future scheme&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1049W.0/7" class="indent">The Commission continues to develop plans for a future scheme that is intended to replace both the existing schemes. As with all government departments, the Commission is undertaking a review of its plans as part of the current spending review and in line the new government's priorities.</p>

The main way in which HSE monitors compliance with the law is through proactive visits to workplaces by inspectors and other front-line staff. If an inspector has concerns about the safety of electrically powered gates, then they will enquire into the maintenance arrangements and seek assurance or demonstration that the safety devices are in working order. If inquiries are made of installers of such gates, then their knowledge of the relevant British Standards would be examined. Enforcement action, including Prohibition and Improvement Notices, may be taken where significant deficiencies are found, even if an injury has not occurred.</p>

We have taken action to provide the flexibility needed to allow local authorities the freedom to make their own decisions about where savings are found without impacting on essential frontline services. The Government lifted restrictions on how local authorities spend their funding on grants totalling &#163;1.2 billion. We also made no changes to the amount of formula grant which each council received this year. This is the main funding paid to local authorities with no strings on how they use that money. The impact on their area of the reductions in grants this year will be for local authorities to decide. We have received no representations from individuals and. organisations in Wigan on the effect of these changes on services.</p>

We will put in place a robust delivery plan which will take into account market and investor views. We are committed to comprehensive support for renewable electricity, through the establishment of a full system of feed-in tariffs-as well as the maintenance of banded renewables obligation certificates, with the aim of ensuring the most straightforward regime for investors. The Offshore Wind Developers Forum, which I co-chair, includes both domestic and international developers and has been tasked to ensure the viability and deliverability of offshore wind in the UK through existing and future rounds of development, and to maximise the economic opportunities available for UK-based business. In addition, Offshore grids are a significant opportunity for foreign investment. Offshore transmission operators (OFTOs) will be appointed through competitive tenders to build and maintain transmission networks in UK waters, with an expected &#163;15 billion of investment required to 2020. We have already announced the appointment of three OFTOs to manage &#163;700 million of offshore grid assets, one of which is an overseas investor.</p>

	<p pid="b.1070W.11/2">The survey findings also reveal large variations between local areas with, for example, over one in four people in the most deprived areas perceiving a high level of ASB, nearly five times the level in the most affluent areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1074W.0/13">(ii) The e-Borders programme has been managed throughout by senior civil servants reporting ultimately to the senior responsible officer. Advice and guidance on specialist areas of expertise has been provided by consultants during this period to the senior management team and the e-Borders programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1074W.0/14">The current plan is to retain some consultants to advise on the next e-Borders procurement exercise, with consultancy expenditure in the year to March 2011 currently forecast to fall to &#163;7 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1074W.0/15">The use of external consultants provides the UK Border Agency with specialist knowledge, skill, capacity and technical expertise that would not otherwise be available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1074W.0/16">The periods covered saw the programme move from procurement of the strategic solution and provision of the Semaphore pilot system to the more complex activity to assure the design and delivery of the strategic solution. The fall in consultant and contractor headcount during this time did not deliver an equivalent reduction in cost since there was an associated change in the mix and type of consultancy support provided, along with a need to use more hours from individual consultants because of the pressures on the programme and the requirement for their specialist knowledge.</p>

It also presents measures pursuant to those elements of the Schengen acquis in which the UK participates (the police and criminal justice elements) since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, when our ability to opt out of such measures was created. The UK was automatically bound by any measure tabled pursuant to those elements of the Schengen acquis in which we participate prior to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. There is only one measure currently under negotiation which builds on those elements of the Schengen acquis to which we are bound: a Council Regulation to establish an Agency for the purposes of managing existing IT systems in the area of Justice and Home Affairs. The UK has notified its wish to participate in that measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1077W.2/2">The table shows the main Title IV TEC measures for which information is held centrally and to which the opt-in applied. Since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-01">1 December 2009</phrase>, more information has been held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1077W.2/3">There have been 25 measures to which the Title V TFEU opt-in has applied, to which the UK has opted-in to 15 and out of six and a further four published proposals where the Government will take a decision within the next three months. There have been four measures to which the Schengen opt-out applied (excluding the IT Agency). The UK is participating in all four.</p>
	<p pid="b.1077W.2/4">Additional information on the dates when all these measures were presented, when the UK signalled its acceptance, when they were adopted and entered into force were not held centrally prior to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, all decisions to opt into or out of JHA measures are notified to Parliament at the time they are made. The first annual report will be presented to Parliament in December providing retrospective information on the UK's application of the opt-in Protocol from <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-01">1 December 2009</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-01">1 December 2010</phrase>, a year since the Lisbon Treaty came into force.</p>

	<p pid="b.1079W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated September 2010:</p>
	<p pid="b.1079W.3/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning how many (a) collective and (b) individual trade-disputes of each type in the (i) public and (ii) private sector were recorded in each class of economic activity under the 2007 Standard Industrial Classification in each year since 1990; arid if he will make a-statement. (14106)</p>
	<p pid="b.1079W.3/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles monthly labour disputes statistics for the UK. They exclude disputes which do not result in a stoppage of work and stoppages involving fewer than ten workers or lasting less than one day, unless the total number of working days lost in the dispute is 100 or more.</p>
	<p pid="b.1079W.3/5" class="indent">Figures on a public and private sector basis are only available from 1996 onwards. No breakdown is available by industry and by a public/private split. Figures are also only available for collective disputes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1079W.3/6" class="indent">Table 1 provides estimates of the number of stoppages for the public and private sector; in the United Kingdom from 1996 to 2009. Table 2 provides figures on an industrial sector basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.1082W.5/2">Social enterprises are often eligible for tax breaks. For example, many are charities and benefit from the associated tax benefit. However, charity tax benefits come with associated regulatory burden which some businesses, CICs and many other social enterprises choose to avoid. More generally, for non-charitable social enterprises, it is also important that Government avoid giving unfair advantage to one type of business over another and maintain a level playing field between different types of organisations trading in the market.</p>

	<p pid="b.1087W.2/1">Injured UK service personnel who have suffered traumatic amputation as a result of battle or non-battle injury attend the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court in Surrey, where they are supplied with tailor-made prostheses with state of the art componentry which is matched to their clinical needs. Quality and fit of prosthetic limbs are of paramount importance in the rehabilitation process, and as part of the routine clinical care every amputee case at DMRC is regularly assessed for the comfort and fit of their socket, and the alignment and functional quality of all components are checked every time the patient comes to DMRC as either an in-patient or out-patient.</p>
	<p pid="b.1087W.2/2">The Department of Health (DH) and devolved Administrations have agreed that the level for limb fitting support for service personnel should be maintained by the NHS when the individual leaves the service, be it on medical discharge or after completion of their engagement. The DH has advised strategic health authority chief executives of the need to ensure continuity of provision of prostheses subject to the clinical needs of individuals. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has discussed transitional arrangements for seriously injured personnel with key NHS providers for those leaving the armed forces and put in place a protocol to help ensure ease of transfer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1087W.2/3">As part of the overall rehabilitation process, military patients at Headley Court also have access to trained mental health staff, psychologists and social workers who can provide treatment and advice to help them come to terms with their injuries. For amputees who are leaving the services and are assessed as requiring ongoing counselling, arrangements will be made for them to receive this through the NHS as part of the transfer of medical care. Transition protocols between MOD and DH have been developed and are aimed at ensuring an effective transfer of care from MOD to the NHS and other providers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1090W.8/1">No, not all the land occupied by the Ministry of Defence's (MOD) facilities in Cyprus is classed as sovereign British territory. Under the 1960 Treaty of Establishment (ToE) the United Kingdom retained British sovereignty over two areas, one in the south (Akrotiri) and the other in the east (Dhekelia), which are known collectively as the Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs). In addition, the MOD has facilities on several 'retained sites'. The ToE gives the UK rights on these sites, although the Republic of Cyprus has sovereignty over the territory on which the retained sites are located.</p>

The Government's decision to redeploy &#163;150 million of our savings for 2010-11, creating an additional 50,000 adult apprenticeship places, demonstrates our commitment to high-quality skills. The National Apprenticeships Service and the Skills Funding Agency are working with training providers which will be encouraging employers to make these additional places available.

The Annual Population Survey is the only available source of data with a sample large enough to provide local authority estimates of the number of young people up to the age of 24 who are NEET. However, the sample is not large enough to provide estimates for smaller geographies, such as parliamentary constituencies, or to provide local authority estimates for age ranges narrower than 16 to 24.</p>

Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br/> <sup>(2)</sup> Primary diagnosis<br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br/>  ICD-10 code used:<br/> E66-Obesity<br/> <sup>(3)</sup> Number of episodes with a (named) main or secondary procedure<br/> The number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and four prior to 2002-03) procedure fields in a HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record. Note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure. For example, patients under going a 'cataract operation' would tend to have at least two procedures - removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one-counted in a single episode.<br/> See clinical codes sheet for OPCS codes used for 'bariatric surgery'.<br/> Data quality<br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/>  Strategic Health Authority (SHA)/PCT of residence<br/> The SHA or PCT containing the patient's normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another SHA/PCT for treatment.<br/> Assessing growth through time<br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.<br/> Activity included<br/> Activity in English NHS Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector<br/> Bariatric Surgery OPCS codes</td> </tr>
