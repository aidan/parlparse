	<p pid=".435W.8/1">The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) publishes an annual report on the sales of antimicrobial products in the UK. The latest report, for 2002, shows that 98 tonnes (active ingredient) of antibiotics were sold for products authorised only for use in pigs. 998,000 tonnes of pigs (liveweight) were slaughtered in the UK in 2002. However, 283 tonnes (active ingredient) of antibiotic were sold for multi-species products. It is not known how much of these were for pig use. Using the pig only sales tonnage, 98.2 kg (active ingredient) of antibiotic were sold per 1000 tonnes of pigs slaughtered liveweight. As some of the multi-species products may have been used in pigs this figure is likely to be an underestimate. The VMD is working on a system to collect data that will enable the multi-species tonnage to be broken down by species but this is not yet available.</p>
	<p pid=".435W.8/2">The UK is one of a small number of EU member states that publish data on antibiotic sales. It is not, therefore, possible to give a whole EU equivalent.</p>

	<p pid=".436W.2/1">Antibiotics for use in animals are authorised either as veterinary medicinal products or as zootechnical feed additives (which include antimicrobial growth promoters). These work by increasing the efficiency of the absorption of feed in the animal's gut thereby allowing them to reach slaughter size more quickly.</p>
	<p pid=".436W.2/2">The use of zootechnical feed additives in the EU is subject to Directive 70/524/EC, as amended. No feed additive may be authorised unless it satisfies criteria set out in that Directive, including a requirement that at the level permitted in feedingstuffs it does not adversely affect human or animal health or the environment. Such additives may be used only within the terms of their entry in the annexes in the Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".436W.2/3">Antibiotics are also used as veterinary medicines but no antibiotic is authorised in the UK for the treatment of food producing animals unless it has first been considered by the independent, Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) which advises the Government on the safety, quality and efficacy of veterinary medicines. All such antibiotics authorised in the UK are classified as prescription only medicines. They may be administered only on the basis of a prescription issued by a veterinary surgeon who has the animals under his or her care.</p>
	<p pid=".436W.2/4">In addition anybody incorporating veterinary medicines or zootechnical feed additives into animal feedingstuffs, or distributing these products, must be inspected, approved and registered by the Animal Medicines Inspectorate (AMI) of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain or the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid=".438W.3/1">The Government are engaged in a number of activities to encourage water conservation across different sectors. In relation to domestic water use, the recent report by the Sustainable Buildings Task Group, &quot;Better Buildings&mdash;Better Lives&quot;, contained a number of recommendations to improve the water efficiency of new and existing buildings. These include tighter minimum standards for water fittings, development of best practice guidance and incentives to encourage the uptake of water efficient products. The Government are actively considering how it will take these forward. I am also looking into the feasibility of introducing a product labelling scheme to help domestic consumers identify water efficient fittings and appliances. These activities will complement the existing duty on water undertakers to promote the efficient use of water by their customers.</p>

	<p pid=".439W.2/1">The Government are indeed working hard to reduce administrative burdens on farmers not least through reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, reducing 10 main funding schemes to a Single Payment Scheme. This will remove much of the bureaucracy and paperwork associated with the old schemes and result in a streamlined and simplified application process for farmers. More than 100 pages of forms will be reduced to a fraction of this number. And through the Modernising Rural Delivery Rural Programme we aim to simplify access to rural funding streams.</p>
	<p pid=".439W.2/2">In addition, the Whole Farm Approach will be rolled out in late 2005. The whole farm appraisal is currently being widely piloted, and this will transform Defra's interactions with farmers on subsidies, regulation and advice by redesigning them around on-farm activities and saving farmers from repeated requests for regulatory data.</p>
	<p pid=".439W.2/3">The existing administrative burdens on farmers derive largely from regulations to achieve desirable outcomes for society such as protecting human and animal health, animal welfare and the environment. In addition, administrative checks are required to ensure proper disbursement of funds under CAP and other rural schemes. However, the Government are taking a broader approach to reducing administrative burdens on farmers; in response to the recent recommendations of the Regulation Taskforce set up by the Secretary of State. Along with a new unit developing a farm regulation strategy, this will help improve Defra's regulatory performance; achieving a coherent and holistic approach to the development of regulation and its impact on farmers.</p>

	<p pid=".440W.2/2">Farmers and hauliers who comply with the rules governing multiple pick-ups and drop-offs incur no costs arising from the enforcement of these provisions. Defra is responsible for the cost of granting approval of multiple pick-ups and drop-offs.</p>
	<p pid=".440W.2/3">Any vehicle taking livestock onto a farm and then off again as part of a multiple pick-up or drop-off movement risks spreading disease, either to the animals if disease is present on the farm, or to animals on the farm if disease is present in the animals on the vehicle. Given the need for continued biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of disease there are no proposals to amend the requirement that multiple pick-ups and drop-offs take place only from approved points.</p>

	<p pid=".446W.5/1">I am not aware that the Chief Scientific adviser made a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March</phrase> that climate change is a reason for increased use of the Thames Barrier. However, this issue was raised when he provided evidence to the EFRA Committee on Climate Change, Water Security and Flooding on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-12">12 May</phrase>, when he said that increased use of the Barrier is an indication of the influences of global warming.</p>
	<p pid=".446W.5/2">The Barrier is closed to protect London from extreme high tidal waters generated by storm surges in the North Sea and to provide storage for extreme freshwater flows, which would threaten west London, and combinations of these phenomena.</p>
	<p pid=".446W.5/3">It is true that recent years have seen an increase in frequency of Barrier closures but whether this is attributable to changes in operational procedures, increased fluvial flows or climate change is difficult to accurately measure. One factor is that mean sea level and extreme tidal waters are expected to increase as the South East of England continues to fall relative to sea level. This was factored into the design of the Barrier.</p>

These include discussion of service standards which will be an important part of the final contract. As I stated on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-17">17 June</phrase>, I understand it to be CWT's assessment that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations will apply. The jobs of existing staff will thus be protected and they have the opportunity to remain in the Travel Office. A range of measures will be put in place to check on the performance of CWT: these will be reflected in the service standards and monitored on a regular basis. Hon. Members and their staff are encouraged to provide feedback on the service through the Travel Office Consumers' Panel, to the Director of Finance and Administration or to CWT itself. The contract has been let on a competitive basis, and represents best overall value to Parliament, taking account both of the cost of the contract itself, and also potential savings in the cost of travel.</p>

However, the Government recognises that there have been delays in the pay and modernisation process and that, among other things, this could mean that we will be seeking to recoup the transitional funding less than a year after it has been distributed to fire and rescue authorities. It is important that we get a clearer picture of the pressures fire and rescue authorities may face, and the extent to which they are making efficiency improvements.

	<p pid=".452W.0/1">All Fire and Rescue Authorities are in the process of implementing their first year action plans according to Integrated Risk Management (IRM) principles and will start consulting on their year two plans shortly. IRM replaces the former centrally determined standards of fire cover that sometimes bore little or no relation to the current pattern of risk in a given area. Each authority has to consider the range of risks faced by the communities it serves and then allocate available resources to maximum benefit. As part of that process, authorities have been considering whether current working patterns adequately match the occurrence of incidents over the course of the day. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not expect that there will be a &quot;one size fits all&quot; solution and it will be for each authority to determine what use to make of downtime during the night hours and what rest facilities are appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".452W.3/1">It is the Government's policy, set out in the White Paper 'Our Fire and Rescue Service', that union participation in negotiating arrangements for the Fire and Rescue Service should be widened. We hope that voluntary reforms will achieve this. However, Government is seeking reserve powers under the Fire and Rescue Services Bill which would enable it to set up new statutory arrangements if voluntary reforms do not result in improvement.</p>

	<p pid=".454W.3/1">The Housing Corporation introduced Partnering Programme Agreements (PPAs) into the main Approved Development Programme (ADP) for the 2004&ndash;06 programme. PPAs do not use cost benchmarking (as in the TCI regime) and focus on levels of grant paid rather than overall costs to registered social landlords (RSLs). They are individually negotiated. Almost 80 per cent. of the ADP for 2004&ndash;06 has been allocated to some 70 RSLs or groups of RSLs under partnering. The introduction of partnering in the 2004&ndash;06 ADP encouraged RSLs to bring forward cost effective proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.3/2">Total Cost Indicators (TCIs) have been used for the 20 per cent. of the 2004&ndash;06 ADP not allocated through partnering.</p>
	<p pid=".454W.3/3">Within the TCI regime, there should be no disincentive to develop larger dwellings as the TCIs increase with the size of the dwellings. The TCIs only provide an indication of the &quot;norm&quot; costs of providing a dwelling of a certain size in a certain area. If more than eight people are to be housed in a dwelling, then RSLs can apply an additional multiplier to raise the TCI to take account of the increased costs.</p>

	<p pid=".457W.2/1">It is the Government's intention to hold the referendums by all-postal ballots. Orders to that effect were laid on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-24">Thursday, 24 June 2004</phrase>. To hold referendums this autumn, as widely expected, and to allow an adequate campaigning period and timely public information, Parliament needs to approve those Orders before Summer recess.</p>
	<p pid=".457W.2/2">The Orders do not allow for the referendums to be held by traditional ballot. However, the draft Orders contain a requirement for one assistance and delivery point per 50,000 electors, to be open on polling day between 7am and 10pm and the preceding five working days for normal working hours. So, electors will have the choice as to whether to return their vote by post, to deliver it by hand, or to vote at a place supervised by electoral officials.</p>

	<p pid=".463W.3/1">When dealing with dyslexia, as with other recognised special educational needs conditions, schools and local authorities are expected to have regard to the SEN Code of Practice, published in November 2001, which gives practical advice on carrying out their statutory duties to identify, assess and make suitable provision for children with SEN. However, the precise arrangements for any screening and assessment arrangements are for local determination.</p>
	<p pid=".463W.3/2">The National Literacy Strategy includes a range of specific guidance material for teachers and SEN Co-ordinators on dyslexia. Officials are currently working with both the Dyslexia Institute and the British Dyslexia Association to develop new resources in this area. The Department has also supported a number of initiatives aimed at raising awareness to help teachers to identify pupils with dyslexia and to take appropriate action at an early stage.</p>
	<p pid=".463W.3/3">The Government's recently published Strategy for SEN, 'Removing Barriers to &quot;Achievement&quot;, sets out a long term vision for SEN, together with a programme of sustained action and review, both nationally and locally. Among the initiatives outlined in the Strategy is a new Inclusion Development Programme to help schools become more effective in responding to the needs of individual pupils. The programme will support partnership projects involving education, health and social care, as well as a wide range of other partners, to develop and pilot effective practice. The aim is to improve the evidence base about what works and build consensus about how to implement good practice more effectively for particular types of SEN including dyslexia.</p>

The bulk of capital funding is now allocated to LEAs and schools by needs-related formula so that they can decide how to target the increasing resources which they are now receiving to address their highest priority needs. The funding available also includes Building Schools for the Future, where the government are committed to renewal of all secondary schools in England within 10&ndash;15 years from 2005&ndash;06, subject to future public spending decisions. All authorities will be given an indication of the likely timing of investment in their area in the autumn. Capital funding is now delivered as PFI credits, capital grant and supported borrowings.

	<p pid=".464W.2/1">1,145 neighbourhood nurseries are open, providing 39,584 places. No neighbourhood nurseries have so far closed.</p>
	<p pid=".464W.2/2">We are committed to delivering 45,000 high quality places through neighbourhood nurseries and are on target to do so by the end of summer 2004. There are no plans to develop further neighbourhood nurseries. Instead, our future focus is on the development of children's centres, which build on existing provision such as Sure Start local programmes, neighbourhood nurseries, Early Excellence centres and maintained nursery schools. In the current spending review period we plan to develop children's centres and 43,000 new full day care places in disadvantaged areas.</p>
	<p pid=".464W.2/3">To ensure sustainability all providers wishing to develop a neighbourhood nursery were required to submit a five-year business plan to their local authority at the planning stage. The business plan contains sustainability plans including the establishment of a viable fee structure and identification of other relevant sources of funding and support that will help sustain nursery after the initial three-year funding period. &pound;31 million sustainability funding through the Sustainability Grant is also available for local authorities to support provision in the most disadvantaged areas and they can choose to use this money to support neighbourhood nurseries if necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".464W.2/5">&pound;246 million has been allocated by the Department for Education and Skills to cover revenue funding for neighbourhood nursery projects. Each neighbourhood nursery is entitled to a maximum of &pound;5,400 per neighbourhood nursery place, which is paid over three years. The Sure Start unit has agreed to some projects converting some of this revenue to capital money, and as a result, based on the 1,088 open nurseries, around &pound;182.5 million is due over their first three years of operation working out at an average of &pound;4,906 per place.</p>
	<p pid=".464W.2/6">Once the remaining neighbourhood nurseries in development are open the full capital and revenue budgets will be spent.</p>

	<p pid=".469W.4/1">The Government's policy towards persons in the United Kingdom driving without insurance, driving without a licence, and driving without due care and attention, is to apply the requirements and sanctions contained in legislation. For Great Britain, that legislation is the Road Traffic Act 1988 and the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. The provisions apply to persons from the new EU member states as to other drivers. For Northern Ireland, similar provisions exist in Northern Ireland law.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.4/2">As regards offenders with no fixed address in the United Kingdom, the Government recognise that there are practical difficulties relating to their prosecution, as they are likely to leave the UK to return to their home states and cannot be compelled to return. There are also practical difficulties relating to the application of the fixed penalty system to them. The Government are examining ways of improving the effectiveness of the system.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.4/3">No special provisions are made in respect of drivers from the new EU member states. Under the second EC Directive on Driving Licences (91/439/EEC) full mutual recognition was granted to all driving licences issued in EEA countries and the minimum testing and medical standards that must be met before a licence is issued were harmonised. From <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>, this recognition extends to licences issued in the accession states&mdash;as does the requirement to meet the minimum testing and medical standards.</p>

Where sections of motorway are involved there is generally a much better response to information leaflets and questionnaires than to exhibitions. These are used where the route passes through communities.</p>

The IPCC Special Report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere (1999) noted that enhanced air traffic management had the potential to lead to a global fuel saving of between 6 per cent. and 12 per cent. of total fuel consumption. Estimates of fuel savings include inefficiencies linked to airspace structure and current management practices as well as the more local phenomenon of holding due to airport congestion. Implementation of the EC Single European Sky initiative, which came into force on the <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-20">20 April 2004</phrase>, should lead to more direct routing and consequential fuel savings, estimated to be of the order of 10 per cent.

The Government has welcomed the endorsement of the provisions that extend BTP's jurisdiction in limited circumstances by the Privy Counsellor Committee which reviewed the Act.

	<p pid=".473W.2/1">I regularly encourage local authorities and bus companies to work together in partnership and am pleased that the majority of local transport authorities in England are involved in one or more voluntary quality bus partnership agreements. Many such agreements comprise one or more bus corridor improvements. Because these agreements are voluntary there is no requirement to report them and the comprehensive information requested is not available. Local transport in Wales and Scotland is a matter for the devolved Administrations.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/2">The Department provides funding to English local authorities for bus priority measures such as quality bus corridors. Funding provided in 2003&ndash;04 was forecast to deliver over 1,300 kilometres of improved bus routes in that year.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/3">In September 2003 the Bus Partnership Forum published an information pack &quot;Bus Priority: The Way Ahead&quot; to help local authorities get the most out of bus priority measures including bus corridors. Further leaflets are being produced to be added to this pack and will be published within the next few months.</p>
	<p pid=".473W.2/4">Research shows that quality partnership schemes typically increase bus patronage by between 5 per cent. and 20 per cent. within the first 12 months of operation. These schemes also contribute towards modal shift, with surveys showing that around 33 per cent. of new users had previously undertaken their journey by car.</p>

The system can be deployed in minutes on bridges and in lay-bys and can read all types of GB and Northern Ireland plates, whether on the front or rear of a vehicle. Plates can be read in all but the most extreme weather conditions, and also in heavy or fast moving traffic. The system operates in conjunction with the police during DVLA's Vehicle Excise Duty campaigns.</p>

	<p pid=".477W.8/1">Hazard perception testing for learner car, lorry and bus drivers, motorcyclists and prospective driving instructors and examiners was introduced in November 2002 as part of the qualifying theory test. Research was undertaken over a 10 year period by the Transport Research Laboratory in advance of introduction of the test into the importance of hazard awareness in collision prevention. This indicated that performance in tests of hazard perception improved as experience is gained and that three hours of focused training could improve a new driver's hazard awareness to the average of experienced drivers.</p>

	<p pid=".479W.0/1">The Island Line franchise runs to 2007, and the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) is considering requirements beyond that date. The line has been proposed as a pilot project under the SRA's recently launched strategy for Community Rail Development, and this may be reflected in the specification for the franchise beyond 2007. The rolling stock has just received a major overhaul and should be adequate until the franchise is re-let.</p>

The task forces will be making recommendations to Government based on the outcome of their work; these will be included in the report. However it would be difficult to assess the value for money of the task forces. The nature of their work does not involve specific costs and benefits which can be quantified. But the work of the Advisory Group is highly valued by Government arid will be an essential input to the Government's future motorcycling strategy.</p>

	<p pid=".482W.3/1">All quality partnerships currently in operation are voluntary agreements, which do not need to be notified to central Government, as distinct from statutory schemes made under the Transport Act 2000, which need to be registered with the traffic commissioner for the relevant area. There is no agreed definition of a non-statutory quality partnership and some partnership agreements cover more than one area or corridor. Comprehensive information is therefore not available. However, a survey in 2001 found that quality partnership schemes existed or were being developed in 65 of the 85 local transport authority areas of England. The number may well have increased since 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".483W.2/1">The answer in the format requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".483W.2/2">Train operating companies (TOCs) confirm to the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) that their bid for timetabling paths delivers the passenger service requirement (PSR), which specifies maximum journey times. TOCs may seek derogations from the SRA where elements of the PSR cannot be delivered. The SRA reviews and considers each derogation request on its merits.</p>
	<p pid=".483W.2/3">Minor compromises to the TOCs bids are also made by Network Rail which can extend the journey times by small amounts in defined circumstances. The SRA's contract with TOCs permits this to happen without permission and such incidences are numerous. On occasions this may cause a journey time to be extended beyond the maximum specified in the PSR.</p>

Under RIDDOR the railways are required to report all incidents of a train striking a cow or horse, and for all other animals, where the train sustains damage requiring immediate or temporary repairs. There is no requirement under RIDDOR to report if the animal was killed or injured or if retrieved from the line. Trains only resume their journeys when it is safe to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".490W.2/2">Routine statistics do not record the primary cause of a road accident. However, research conducted on behalf of the Department for Transport has estimated on the basis of limited information that just over 3 per cent. of all personal injury crashes involve a driver subsequently prosecuted for unlicensed driving, which included driving while disqualified.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.2/3">Research also indicates that driver fatigue accounts for about 10 per cent. of all accidents on the road network in Great Britain. Under a pilot scheme some police forces have provided information on the factors that may have contributed to an accident. The data provided for 2003 indicates that in 1 per cent. of accidents within the pilot scheme driver fatigue was a contributory factor. This data is based on the opinions of police officers or, in the case of accidents reported by a member of the public at a police station, determined from the description of the accident. This pilot scheme also indicates that driver impairment due to drugs was a contributory factor in 1 per cent. of all accidents.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.2/4">Provisional estimates for 2002 indicate that 6 per cent. of all accidents involved a driver who had blood alcohol levels in excess of the legal limit.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.2/5">Information on accidents caused by people driving without insurance, a valid MOT certificate, driving in unlicensed cars, or drivers of stolen vehicles is not recorded in the national accident data collection system and therefore the data is not available.</p>

	<p pid=".493W.5/1">Work on the A36 Skew Bridge upgrading work commenced in June 2003. New structures are being installed on either side of the existing bridge to improve safety by providing new footways, cycle track and stronger parapets.</p>
	<p pid=".493W.5/2">A number of factors have delayed work. There was a delay of three months owing to unexpected poor ground conditions which necessitated significant redesign work and the need for strengthening works. High winds have also restricted planned operations of the crane, further delaying the progress of the work.</p>
	<p pid=".493W.5/3">The layout of the site is very confined. This dictates a strict sequence of operations and restricts the number of people that can work on the site at one time. For health and safety reasons, many tasks can only be carried out when both road and rail traffic are completely suspended. This relies on the agreement of Network Rail to close the railway line. To minimise disruption these closures only take place during off peak periods. The setting up and dismantling of heavy equipment on the road requires a length of time which is generally only available at weekends.</p>
	<p pid=".493W.5/4">All critical structural operations have now been completed and it is hoped the projectwill finish before the end of September.</p>

	<p pid=".495W.2/1">The deployment of safety cameras on motorways is governed by the same rules as those on other parts of the network. Motorways, being relatively safer than the rest of the road network due to the separation of opposing traffic streams and the limited amount of vulnerable users, present fewer locations that meet the criteria. However, cameras are used at locations where the speed limit has been reduced for reasons of safety, including road maintenance sites where they enforce temporary speed limits put in place for the protection of road users and workers alike.</p>

	<p pid=".502W.0/1">Excluding Export Credits Guarantee Department debt, outstanding debts to the UK Government are either old aid loans or loans formally held by the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) which were transferred to DFID when CDC was part-privatised in 1999. Many such loans have already been written off, either under Retrospective Terms Adjustment (RTA)&mdash;the policy to forgive loans to low income countries&mdash;or under the Commonwealth Debt Initiative (GDI) which was launched to reduce formal government to government debt for low and lower-middle income countries in the Commonwealth. It is also UK policy to write-off 100 per cent. of all bilateral debts for countries when they qualify for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. HIPC debt repayments are suspended at HIPC Decision Point and formally written off at Completion Point.</p>
	<p pid=".502W.0/2">UK Government debt outstanding on former aid loans to countries outside the EU and G10 was:</p>
	<p pid=".502W.0/3" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> on <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-01">1 April 1997</phrase>&mdash;&pound;389,627,196 (of which &pound;341,460,302 principal and &pound;48,166,894 interest)</p>
	<p pid=".502W.0/4" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>&mdash;&pound;146,807,222 (of which &pound;132,517,931 principal and &pound;14,289,291 interest)</p>
	<p pid=".502W.0/5">For accounting purposes, DFID adopts a process of cancelling debts as they become due. This means that some of the debts in the above figures have been officially cancelled but will continue to show up on DFID's accounts until the loans expire. The total amount of former aid loans cancelled under debt initiatives between 1997 and 2004, included in the above figures, is &pound;167,973,700 (of which &pound;143,405,982 principal and &pound;24,567,718 interest). However, since 1997, DFID has committed to cancelling &pound;266,100,904 (of which &pound;233,331,961 principal and &pound;32,768,943 interest) and countries do not have to make repayments on these debts, provided that they remain committed to poverty reduction. I have arranged for a copy of a table to show all former aid loans listed by country to be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".502W.0/6">Debts outstanding on loans made by the CDC to countries outside the EU and G10 were:</p>
	<p pid=".502W.0/7" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> on <phrase class="date" code="1997-12-31">31 December 1997</phrase>&mdash;&pound;283,118,860.52 (of which &pound;275,358,759.57 principal and &pound;7,760,100.95 interest)</p>
	<p pid=".502W.0/8" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-31">31 May 2004</phrase>&mdash;&pound;241,608,825.92 (of which &pound;165,957,368.44 principal and &pound;75,651,457.48 interest). Of this total amount, only &pound;96,366,201.28 is live debt, as the remaining &pound;145,242,624.64 has been suspended under RTA, CDI or HIPC.</p>
	<p pid=".502W.0/9">The total amount of former CDC debt cancelled under debt relief initiatives between 1997 and 2004 is &pound;16,498,403.48. A further &pound;128,761,546.29 has been suspended and will either be formally cancelled when the debtor country reaches HIPC Completion Point or reviewed on a year-by-year basis against the CDI criteria of the debtor Government's commitment to poverty reduction, sound economic policies and good governance. I have arranged for a copy of two tables entitled 'CDC loans in 1997 and in 2004' listed by country and an explanation of the amounts cancelled and suspended to be placed in the Library (Table 2&mdash;CDC Loans at <phrase class="date" code="1997-12-31">31 December 1997</phrase> and Table 3&mdash;CDC Loans at <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-31">31 May 2004</phrase>).</p>

As our White Paper, Fairness for All, has outlined, the Commission for Equality and Human Rights (CEHR) will provide institutional support for the provisions on age discrimination, working closely with partner organisations and key stakeholders to provide advice and assistance. The CEHR will be able to advise individuals of their rights under the legislation, and support some people to bring their cases before the courts. In addition, the CEHR will have powers to conduct an investigation into a named party where it has reasonable suspicion that the person is not complying with the statutory requirements of the age regulations. If unlawful discrimination or harassment is found, the CEHR will be able to require the discrimination to stop.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.3/2">The CEHR will promote equality of opportunity for people regardless of age. This will allow the CEHR to act in a broad range of areas, not just where there is specific legislative protection in employment and vocational training. For example, in respect of poor service or unfair treatment, the CEHR will promote and encourage good practice, working with central and local government, regional agencies and the private and voluntary sector. As part of this activity, the CEHR will have the power to conduct inquiries into age discrimination generally or unequal outcomes in respect of age.</p>

	<p pid=".509W.2/2">The introduction of a significant amount of intermittent renewable generation will require additional reserve capacity in the electricity market and the use of more short-term balancing services. The amount of reserve capacity that will be required depends on the overall mix of generation technologies and the approach taken to address intermittency in different timescales (for example, storage, demand side measures or flexible generation). The electricity trading arrangements give suppliers strong financial incentives to contract ahead to meet the demands of their customers and give generators strong financial incentives to deliver the power they have contracted to provide. It is a commercial matter for all generators, including those producing from the alternative renewable technologies, how they manage the risks associated with variability in the generation from their plant. Market participants are assisted by the information that NGC provides to the market in its role as System Operator about forecast future supply and demand for electricity.</p>

	<p pid=".511W.2/1">I have been disappointed that this industry remains one of the least attractive Science, Engineering and Technology (SET) areas for girls and women. Despite the initiatives which we have supported so far, the perceptions of IT as not female-friendly are hard to turn around. I am attaching the latest statistics which show a worrying decline of women working in IT. We will continue to support a number of programmes, including Computer Clubs for Girls and the information technology degree being developed by e-Skills UK, the Sector Skills Council for IT sector, which it is hoped will encourage girls and women to seek careers in information technology. We are also working with employers and others to address the situation by encouraging flexible working practices. The new Resource Centre for Women in SET will make working with employers in this area one of their top priorities.</p>

	<p pid=".513W.6/1">In its judgment in Case C-29/99, the European Court of Justice ruled that the Declaration of competence concerning the Euratom Community's accession to the international Convention on Nuclear Safety had failed to include certain fields covered by that Convention in which the Euratom Community had at least some competence. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-15">15 December 2003</phrase>, the Council agreed that the Declaration should be amended in line with the Court's judgment. This has no immediate bearing on nuclear safety decisions in the United Kingdom. These are still a matter for the national regulators. However, it remains to be seen how far, if at all, this Court judgment might lead to the development of Euratom measures on nuclear safety that previously would have been regarded as outside the field of Community competence. Any such measures, if agreed, would apply to all member states.</p>

	<p pid=".516W.2/2">However, it is more likely that wind will provide around three-quarters of the 10 per cent. target with the rest primarily from a mix of landfill gas, hydro and co-firing with biomass. If this is coupled with the development of significantly larger offshore turbines, (the Irish Arklow Bank site is already installing 3.6 MW turbines), then the number of turbines required is likely to be lower, around 5,000&ndash;6,000, including both onshore and offshore installations.</p>

	<p pid=".516W.5/1">The main forms of support that wind receives are via the Renewables Obligation and the Climate Change Levy. These currently amount to &pound;31.39 and &pound;4.30 respectively, for each MWh of electricity generated. Aside from this we have also provided &pound;117 million in capital grants as part of the Round 1 Offshore Wind Programme.</p>

	<p pid=".516W.5/3">Costs to 2010 from the Renewables Obligation and Climate Change Levy are difficult to estimate because they are dependent on the actual amount of wind energy generated. However, if we assume that wind accounts for around three quarters of our 10 per cent. target then support for wind could be in the region of &pound;800M/y by 2010.</p>

The creation of the new Pensions Regulator and the Pensions Protection Fund will enhance protection for pension scheme members and improve confidence in pension provision in general.

Other initiatives include the introduction of low cost saving products and the provision of more information so that people can make informed decisions about planning for their retirement.</p>

	<p pid=".524W.0/1">DWP administers state retirement pension to almost one million customers in over 200 countries worldwide, via International Pension Centre (IPC).</p>
	<p pid=".524W.0/2">In response to an issue identified by National Audit Office in the mid 90s, a strategy was introduced to confirm eligibility for state pension, and provide an acceptable level of assurance to Ministers, by way of issue and subsequent check of a letter sent to all customers living aboard. The strategy is designed to ensure that all customers will receive a letter within a maximum five year period.</p>
	<p pid=".524W.0/3">In the past five years, for period 1999 to 2003, IPC have issued a total of some 850,000 letters, known as life certificates. This represents an average issue of approximately 170,000 letters per year. These are sent to all customers who have entitlement to UK state pension, including, but not exclusively, British expatriate pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".524W.0/4">The current strategy is to send out approximately 200,000 letters per year to check entitlement, to ensure that all of the one million customers are contacted within a five year period. This is expected to continue over the next five years.</p>
	<p pid=".524W.0/5">An average of 4,900 pensioners worldwide have had their pensions stopped as a result of the exercise each year, totalling 24,500 over the last five years. This has resulted in financial savings of &pound;26.5 million in the period 1999 to 2003, at an average of &pound;5.1 million per year.</p>
	<p pid=".524W.0/6">There are very few circumstances where a state pension would be reduced and occurrences are rare. The life certificate exercise predominantly either confirms entitlement or leads to cessation of entitlement.</p>

	<p pid=".526W.3/1">We have taken many steps to tackle pensioner poverty, including the introduction of Pension Credit and Winter Fuel Payments, and since 2000, a 7 per cent. real rise in the level of the Basic State Pension. As a result, during 2004&ndash;05 we will be spending nearly &pound;10 billion more on pensioners, including &pound;5 billion more on the poorest third. This means that the poorest pensioners are on average &pound;33 a week better off than they would have been under the 1997 system.</p>

	<p pid=".539W.9/2">Invest NI has adopted a sectoral approach to its client portfolio, concentrating its knowledge of particular industrial and commercial areas in discrete client groups within the organisation. Clients of Invest NI are allocated a Client Executive to co-ordinate their interactions with various parts of the organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".539W.9/3">Every effort is made to clearly communicate the application process, offer practical advice and to process applications as promptly as possible. Invest NI is however responsible for the management of public funds and must therefore have in place rigorous and defensible appraisal procedures.</p>

	<p pid=".540W.2/1">A wide ranging strategy to raise literacy standards has been in operation since 1996. The strategy includes:</p>
	<p pid=".540W.2/2" class="indent">strengthened Education and Library Board structures to support schools;</p>
	<p pid=".540W.2/3" class="indent">target setting at school level (including a requirement on schools to set their own targets), as well as at overall level;</p>
	<p pid=".540W.2/4" class="indent">early intervention programmes for pupils struggling with reading;</p>
	<p pid=".540W.2/5" class="indent">a major programme of training for key teachers; and</p>
	<p pid=".540W.2/6" class="indent">the provision of summer literacy (and numeracy) schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".540W.2/7">The strategy has been regularly evaluated, and revised as appropriate, by the Literacy Strategy Steering Group; the Reading Recovery and Summer Schemes elements have also been evaluated externally. The need for future research will be assessed, taking account of developments in the curriculum such as the Enriched Curriculum.</p>
	<p pid=".540W.2/8">In 1996 Northern Ireland participated in the international Adult Literacy Survey (IALS). The survey, published in 1998, indicated that 24 per cent. of those aged between 16 and 65 in Northern Ireland performed at the lowest level of literacy, level 1. In October 2002, the Department for Employment and Learning launched the Essential Skills for Living Strategy and Action Plan in response to this survey.</p>
	<p pid=".540W.2/9">To date, the Department has supported 14,500 adult learners and aims to encourage a further 10,500 into learning during 2004&ndash;05. As the Essential Skills for Living Strategy and Action plan has been in place for less than two years, the Department has not yet conducted any research to determine the effectiveness of the Strategy. However an evaluation plan is being put in place; the next International survey of adult literacy is currently being planned for 2010.</p>

	<p pid=".544W.9/1">There is no Victims Commissioner for Northern Ireland. The idea of a Victims Commissioner was first put forward as a recommendation by Sir Kenneth Bloomfield in his report, &quot;We Will Remember Them&quot;, which looked at possible ways of recognising the pain and suffering of victims of the Troubles. Since its publication in 1998 Government have implemented the majority of his recommendations. However, the appointment of a Victims Commissioner was not pursued. A Victims Minister was appointed and since then over &pound;20 million has been allocated to victims initiatives. The role of Victims Commissioner as envisaged in the report was primarily that of a watchdog over the services and advice available to victims. The Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister are taking much of this work forward in their cross-departmental strategy; the consultation exercise they carried out indicated no clear view on the establishment of such a post. Government are currently reviewing their strategy for addressing the needs of victims of the Troubles, including how we deal with the past. This review will inform the development of the next phase of victims policy. We cannot pre-empt the outcome of the review.</p>
	<p pid=".544W.9/2">The Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill will make statutory provision for a Victims Commissioner in England and Wales who will champion the interests of victims and witnesses of all offences. The provisions have not been extended to Northern Ireland as the Criminal Justice Review made specific recommendations regarding victims and witnesses. The Review recommended that a group comprising of both statutory and voluntary bodies should be set up to maintain a specific focus on victims issues. The Victims, Vulnerable or Intimidated Witnesses Steering Group, representative of criminal justice agencies and Victim Support (NI), fulfils this role. The Review also recommended that the possibility of an advocate should be considered again in the future if new arrangements on behalf of victims are seen not to be working.</p>

	<p pid=".545W.6/2">The Asylum Intake Reduction/ Secure Borders sub-programme board was established in February 2003 under the chairmanship of the Senior Director, Operations of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. Initially it was intended that Ken Sutton should be included as a second Senior Director member, given his responsibility for Asylum Support, Casework and Appeals. However by April 2003 it was decided that, as Mr. Sutton already chaired or co-chaired two of the other sub-programme boards, he should not continue to be a member. Mr. Sutton has never attended any meetings of the board.</p>

	<p pid=".546W.2/1">Immigration officers operating the primary arrivals control at seaports and airports do not assess asylum applications.

	<p pid=".547W.2/1">Children who are sent from court to Prison Service accommodation are&mdash;save in exceptional circumstances and on a case-by-case basis&mdash;placed within the Service's juvenile estate, as commissioned and purchased by the Youth Justice Board. Children who have been remanded in custody are received under the Prison Rules 1999, while sentenced children are received under the Young Offender Institution Rules 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.2/2">In 2003, there were 4,918 children under sentence in Prison Service establishments in England and Wales. Figures for the preceding four years can be found in table 3.10 of the publication 'Prison Statistics England and Wales', a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library (total receptions cannot be calculated by adding together receptions in each category because there is double counting).</p>
	<p pid=".547W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-30">30 November 2003</phrase>, 485 remanded children and 1,769 sentenced children were held in Prison Service accommodation. The Home Secretary receives a variety of representations from a range of bodies and individuals on children in prison service accommodation. The Youth Justice Board has had responsibility, since April 2000, for commissioning and purchasing all secure accommodation for juveniles (those under 18) sentenced to custody, including Prison Service accommodation.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.2/4">The Board takes the view that custodial provision has an important place in the criminal justice system for young people, but believes that with the provision of robust and highly intensive new community sentencing alternatives, such as the Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme (ISSP), it is possible and desirable to reduce the use of custody and ensure that it is used only for those who clearly need it. The Board aims to reduce custody for children by 10 per cent. over the next three years. Custody for under 18s did fall by 11 per cent. between October 2002 and October 2003 and although there has been a recent increase, the Board does anticipate further reductions over time.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.2/5">The Youth Justice Board has no plans to discontinue the purchasing and commissioning of prison service accommodation. However, the Board has fulfilled the commitment made by the then Home Secretary in March 1999, to remove all girls aged under 17 from Prison Service accommodation.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.2/6">The Youth Justice Board and Prison Service are committed to improving the child protection and safeguards arrangements within the Prison Service juvenile estate. A comprehensive review of the arrangements in across the estate was undertaken during 2003 and a report launched in November. Its recommendations are currently under consideration. Every establishment has appointed a Child Protection Co-ordinator and has set up a Child Protection Committee with representation from the local Area Child Protection Committee, police and other relevant agencies. Anti-bullying strategies, and suicide and self-harm prevention policies have been put in place in all establishments in the estate.</p>
	<p pid=".547W.2/7">The Youth Justice Board's National Specification for Learning and Skills, introduced to the Prison Service juvenile estate in early 2002, focuses on improving numeracy and literacy; ensuring continuity of mainstream educational placements; reintegration into full-time education, training or employment; increasing employability through practical and vocational activities; and learning how to learn. Establishments provide a range of activities, including learning and skills, vocational training, work, physical education, enrichment activities, access to the library and offending behaviour programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".548W.8/1">The Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) in Chorley is an effective partnership bringing together some 40 partner agencies with contributions from across the local authority (Chorley borough council, CBC), the Police, Fire Service and Youth Offending Teams (YOT). Partnership meetings are attended by as many as 25&ndash;30 people. The CDRP is developing a closer working relationship with the Lancashire Drug Action Team.</p>
	<p pid=".548W.8/2">The partnership is assessed as working well by the Government Office in the North West (GONW). It has had a significant impact on crime and disorder over the last two years, with substantial reductions recorded in domestic burglary and theft of and from vehicles. There have been increases in violent crime, youth nuisance and criminal damage although changes in police recording of violent crime and criminal damage have affected the levels reported.</p>
	<p pid=".548W.8/3">The council has reviewed its youth policy and appointed an antisocial behaviour co-ordinator who has developed a strategy to tackle ASB and set up an action group drawing on a range of agencies including CBC Housing, Housing Associations, Lancashire Constabulary, Y.O.T. and Lancashire Fire and Rescue.

	<p pid=".551W.8/1">The Government have actively supported the current EU judicial co-operation agenda, as set out in the Conclusions of the 1999 European Council held in Tampere, Finland, and in the subsequent Justice and Home Affairs work programme (1999&ndash;2004). On the basis of a UK initiative these Conclusions established the principle of mutual recognition of member states judicial decisions as the basis for judicial co-operation in the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".551W.8/2">The UK has since been a strong supporter of key mutual recognition instruments, such as the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant and surrender procedures between member states, and the Framework Decision on the execution in the European Union of orders freezing property or evidence. These measures, and more like them, will help to ensure that criminals cannot evade justice in another member state, but without compromising the different legal traditions of member states.</p>
	<p pid=".551W.8/3">The 2005&ndash;2010 Justice and Home Affairs work programme is currently being negotiated. The Government aim to ensure that the principle of mutual recognition remains the cornerstone of judicial co-operation within the EU.</p>

These include counselling, support groups, and specialised psychological interventions. While evaluation of these interventions is, at present, very limited, evidence from research in non-prison settings suggests that male and female adolescents who self-harm repeatedly may benefit from group therapy. A network of establishments has been set up to develop interventions, facilitate evaluation and share good practice. Guidance to staff on managing people who self-harm has also been circulated to establishments.</p>

Studies of the sort proposed would not be viable because of the lack of an agreed and satisfactory definition and measure of visible police patrolling. We have, however, recently set a statutory performance indicator for the police which relates the numbers killed and seriously injured to the number of vehicle kilometres travelled. The level and nature of police enforcement activity will influence this.</p>

	<p pid=".569W.9/2">Treatment for drug misuse may involve clinical interventions (for example detoxification and prescribing) and non-clinical interventions (for example advice on lifestyle and thinking skills). Decisions on the clinical management of individual drug misusers are, and will remain, the responsibility of appropriately qualified health care professionals. Training in medicine is therefore not required for drug caseworkers, although they will be aware in general terms of the pharmacological effects of different drugs.</p>

An information sheet for patients about use of SSRIs in the September 2003 edition of current problems in pharmacovigilance highlighted the issue of withdrawal reactions. This was drafted with the input of patient representatives from the CSM's expert working group on safety of SSRIs. There have been warnings about the possibility of withdrawal reactions with paroxetine listed in the product information for prescribers since the drug was first licensed in 1990. These warnings are also reflected in the patient information leaflet. Ministers are satisfied with the actions taken by the MHRA and CSM in this area.</p>

Full guidance on prescribing and the use of synthetic and animal insulins, including possible side effects, is provided in the product information for prescribers via the summary of product characteristics and for patients via the patient information leaflet.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/2">Since the marketing of these products, although no formal research has been commissioned, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its sub-committee on pharmacovigilance (SCOP) have kept the safety of synthetic (human) and animal insulins under close review. These committees have considered the available data, including an independent review of clinical trial data by the Cochrane collaboration and any new publications, on a number of occasions. The most recent consideration in 2002 confirmed the committees' previous advice that, although some patients have experienced problems on transferring to human insulin and are better suited to animal derived insulins, there is no evidence of a safety concern specific to human insulin. Prescribers have been informed of this advice via the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency/CSM drug safety bulletin, &quot;Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".582W.8/2">For many years, national health service hospital contracting for pharmaceuticals in England has been organised on a group basis. Hospital pharmacists, on behalf of their NHS trusts, aggregate their hospital business which is then competitively tendered by the NHS Purchasing and Supply and Agency (NHS PASA). The groups adjudicate the framework agreements that are then awarded and managed, on their behalf, by NHS PASA. The approach is highly structured in terms of timing and management, and the groups share information and develop shared strategies through arrangements co-ordinated at the national level, by NHS PASA, to optimise performance.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.8/3">The 2003 review of the group contracts, commissioned by the Department, will lead to the introduction of national contracts for near patent expiry and generic medicines. These contracts are scheduled to start on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-01">1 November 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.8/4">Community contractors do not have access to these framework agreements.</p>

It also describes how people with particular disorders differ from those without any disorder on a range of factors: their background and personal characteristics, including employment and accommodation, physical health, current treatment and service use.</p>
	<p pid=".585W.2/5">Better or Worse: a longitudinal study of the mental health of adults living in private households in Great Britain, an 18 month follow up of people interviewed for the 2000 survey, has been published in 2003.

These are: Articles I&ndash;36(3), I&ndash;53(4), III&ndash;21, III&ndash;26.1b, III&ndash;79(3a), III&ndash;134, III&ndash;171, III&ndash;174, III&ndash;176, III&ndash;177, III&ndash;181, III&ndash;264, III&ndash;269, III&ndash;289 and III&ndash;289a(2b). One of these Articles (III&ndash;21) has an emergency brake mechanism which allows a Member State an effective veto. Article (III&ndash;171) has an emergency brake mechanism which can lead to enhanced co-operation, allowing a Member State not to participate in the action concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".592W.12/3">In CIG 86&ndash;04, 24 new Articles (or sub-paragraphs) are introduced at QMV.

	<p pid=".592W.12/4">Under the new Treaty, the UK will retain its existing 'Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland on policies in respect of border controls, asylum and immigration, and on judicial cooperation in civil matters' and therefore retains the right to take part in such measures on a case by case basis. Articles III&ndash;166, 167, and 168, covered by this Protocol, now provide for decisions by QMV under the new Treaty, but the Treaty of Amsterdam provided anyway for a potential move to QMV from <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>. Of the Articles mentioned above, the Protocol also covers Articles III&ndash;161 (under certain circumstances), and III&ndash;176(2a).</p>

European households were estimated to be &pound;3,800 richer (source: European Commission (2002) &quot;Internal Market&mdash;Ten Years without Frontiers&quot;).

The 3 million figure is calculated on the basis that the share of total UK employment associated with UK exports to the EU is equal to the share of total UK value added (GVA) generated by UK exports to the EU. Academics have estimated that the number of jobs is as high as 3.5 million, once secondary, eg consumption, effects have been included.</p>

These include private security contractors who are providing security services to Diplomatic Missions, the Multinational Force, International Consultants and other contractors defined in the Order, and their personnel. Such contractors will be immune from Iraqi legal process with respect to acts performed by them pursuant to the terms of a contract. Contractors must, however, respect Iraqi laws. Private security companies must comply with all CPA Orders and Memoranda. CPA Memorandum 17 obliges all such companies operating in Iraq to obtain a Business License from the Iraqi Ministry of Trade and an Operating License from the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior (MOI). The MOI will monitor the actions of such companies and can revoke their Operating License. The contracting state has the right to waive the immunity of such companies.</p>

	<p pid=".600W.12/1">Departmental budgets are set on an accruals basis and therefore reflect the full economic costs of service delivery. The term near cash was introduced in the 2002 Spending Review (paragraph B14 of the 2002 Spending Review White Papers, Cm 5570) as a means of allowing readers to reconcile the announced plans to the previous budgeting regime.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.12/2">Its definition has now evolved to simply describe departmental resource budgets less non-cash charges. The main non-cash charges currently included in budgets are depreciation and impairments, cost of capital, stock write-off, national audit fees, bad debts, profit and loss on disposal of fixed assets and movement in provisions. The term near cash is used rather than cash because it remains on an accruals basis and does not reflect the timing of actual cash payments.</p>
