	<p pid="c.1086W.3/1">DEFRA (and MAFF before it) has been helping the beekeeping sector to better equip itself to manage varroa infestations ever since the pest was first discovered in England in 1992. The Department has funded a range of measures delivered by the National Bee Unit, including the provision of a free diagnostic and inspection service to beekeepers and a comprehensive training and advisory programme, as well as R&amp;D.</p>
	<p pid="c.1086W.3/2">Although varroa continues to pose challenges to contemporary beekeeping particularly with the development of mite resistance to chemical treatments, it is now endemic in the UK and has been for several years. The Department has issued a consultation document on plans to remove the mite from the list of notifiable diseases in March 2006. However, the National Bee Unit will continue to offer advice to beekeepers about its management and control, as it does now for other serious but non-statutory diseases.</p>

Without any further policies the savings would remain at the same level to 2020. Current policies in this sector are being reviewed as part of the wider review of the UK climate change programme.</p>

According to available sources dating back to 1999 (which therefore relate in part to MAFF), the Department has in the last six years made 26 instruments which correct defective drafting.

	<p pid="c.1092W.2/1">The Government expects any water company proposing a major new water resources development, such as a reservoir, to have fully investigated the opportunities for enhanced levels of demand management. Enhanced levels of metering is one of the measures that should be considered.</p>
	<p pid="c.1092W.2/2">The legislation governing application for designation as an Area of Water Scarcity are The Water Industry (Prescribed Conditions) Regulations 1999. Under this legislation when determining an application the Secretary of State must have regard to, among other considerations, the water resources which are or could be made available for meeting demand in an area over the period-of 10 years following an application. This would include reservoir capacity.</p>
	<p pid="c.1092W.2/3">One of the projects the recently formed Water Saving Group will be doing is to encourage companies to better use the current powers they have for promoting metering and develop and take forward options for increasing the particular circumstances in which companies have the discretion to meter, particularly in water stressed areas. The Group will also consider the lessons learnt from a review of the current application for area of water scarcity status and encourage further applications for area of water scarcity status in water stressed areas as well as looking at ways of simplifying the application process.</p>

	<p pid="c.1098W.3/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has had no such discussions with the International Olympic Committee or other National Olympic Committees.</p>
	<p pid="c.1098W.3/2">However, the Government firmly believes that parents and their children have a right to believe that they will be safe and well protected whilst participating in all sport. All sports organisations that receive statutory funding through Sport England must have an active child protection policy in place. The Child Protection in Sport Unit&mdash;a partnership between the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Sport England, sportscotland, the Sports Council for Northern Ireland and the Sports Council for Wales&mdash;works with the various National Governing Bodies of sport on their child protection policies to ensure that this happens.</p>

	<p pid="c.1104W.0/5">With regard to support for wounded servicemen and women, the Government's priority has been to provide the best possible medical care to injured personnel, giving them the peace and quiet needed to allow a speedy recovery. It is the emotional support provided by friends and family that is of most importance to our injured soldiers. The Government supplement this through the wide range of welfare services made available by the Ministry of Defence.</p>

The Government have given a commitment to monitor the impact of the act on crime and disorder and the other licensing objectives.

	<p pid="c.1109W.8/2">HMIC will now use this baseline assessment to identify high performing forces&mdash;ie those with a majority of excellent or good and no poor grades&mdash;which will benefit from significant inspection freedoms. Instead of inspecting these forces across the board, HMIC will rely upon a significant degree of self-assessment and will limit its scrutiny to core governance issues&mdash;leadership, diversity and integrity&mdash;and those areas of greatest threat and vulnerability. Other forces will be subject to more inspection attention but this will be risk-based, focusing on activities attracting a poor grading and, as above, those activities that are high risk such as child protection, the management of dangerous sex offenders, civil contingencies and major crime.</p>
	<p pid="c.1109W.8/3">The inspection effort will also take into account the fact that forces/police authorities are engaged in a significant exercise to reconfigure policing for the 21st century. HMIC will support the process by advising on how current high levels of performance can be maintained, and by ensuring that forces go into new merged arrangements, where appropriate, with a clear balance sheet&quot; of their respective strengths and weaknesses. HMIs' assessments of force leadership will specifically address the chief officers' change management capabilities.</p>

	<p pid="c.1113W.2/1">The key elements of effective support for victims and witnesses of crime are receiving information, having a voice in the system and access to appropriate services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1113W.2/2">The code of practice for Victims of Crime, which will come into force in April 2006, sets out in detail victims' rights to information from all key parts of the criminal justice system. The code covers all stages of the criminal justice process from the point at which an offence is reported to post-sentence. Copies of the code have been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1113W.2/3">The Victim Personal Statement, introduced in 2001, gives victims a voice by giving them the opportunity to explain how a crime has affected them. The statement forms part of the case papers and can be seen by everybody who makes decisions about the case as it progresses. Building on this, in September 2005, we published proposals for those bereaved through homicide to have their views heard in court. Assistance and support services for victims and witnesses of crime are available at all stages throughout the criminal justice process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1113W.2/4">The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme provides financial help to blameless victims of violent crime. A national network of Witness Care Units is being implemented to provide a more customer focused service to witnesses, this includes the tailoring of services to help the witness attend court. The Home Office also provides &pound;30 million to the charity Victim Support to provide support to those affected by crime, regardless of whether the crime has been reported.</p>

	<p pid="c.1113W.5/1">Information on violent offences committed in connection with licensed premises by crime and disorder reduction partnerships is not collected centrally. Police forces returned data for basic command units but they were incomplete and of variable quality. These are given in the table and a copy will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1113W.5/2">Recording of such incidents will be dependent on levels of police activity and how police define such incidents locally. For example in certain areas where alcohol-related violence is particularly prevalent, local police are more likely to police city centres on Friday and Saturday nights thus recording more incidents of violent offences committed in connection with licensed premises.</p>

Congestion has implications also for the delivery of other objectives, for example relating to safety and the environment. The research on those objectives also contributes to the evidence base on congestion. Much of this is ongoing&mdash;though new research is commissioned to improve the evidence available and to address new issues.</p>

The strategy is expected to be published on the DfT website within the next few weeks. More details of the individual units' and agencies' evidence and research activities will be published on the Departments website in 2006.

	<p pid="c.1116W.3/2">Planning approval has been given for the development of Newcastle Great Park in phases. The earlier phases of the development have no planning conditions that require the A1 to be widened. However, in order for the later stages to be built the developer would have to fund the widening of a section of the A1 Western Bypass immediately adjacent to the development&mdash;between Ponteland Road and North Brunton Junctions&mdash;from two to three lanes in each direction, a distance of 4 kilometres. This would be under the provision of a S278 agreement which is equivalent to S106, but for a trunk road not a local road. The timing of the improvement is in the hands of the developer and the rate at which he wishes to implement the phases of the project, and is only guaranteed to go ahead if there is full development of the site.</p>

	<p pid="c.1117W.5/1">The Blue Badge scheme is a European and national scheme offering parking concessions primarily for disabled people with severe walking difficulties who travel as drivers or passengers. The scheme applies to on-street parking only.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.5/2">The Blue Badge scheme does not apply to off-street car parks, private roads or at most airports. Charges for and conditions of use in off-street car parks, which are likely to be privately owned and managed, are a matter for the landowner. It is unlikely that spaces in such off-street car parks marked for blue badge holders are legally enforceable and the regulation of such parking is at the discretion of landowners and depends on the courtesy and consideration of drivers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1117W.5/3">It is the Department for Transport's view that it is possible in law for the owners of a private car park to agree with the local authority that a parking place order be made in respect of that car park. Conditions of use can then be enforced as if it were a local authority car park, with penalties or excess charges levied on offenders. It would, therefore, be an offence under the Traffic Regulation Order rather the Blue Badge regulations.</p>

	<p pid="c.1118W.5/1">I am very concerned to reduce car accidents involving young drivers, especially those that result in deaths and serious injuries. The Department has recently consulted on a more structured approach to learning to drive and a copy of its decision letter in August 2004 is on the Department's website at&mdash;<a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_rdsafety/documents/page/dft_rdsafety_028178-01">www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_rdsafety/documents/page/dft_rdsafety_028178&ndash;01</a>.hcsp#P37_1339.</p>
	<p pid="c.1118W.5/2">The main conclusions were that:</p>
	<p pid="c.1118W.5/3" class="indent">the way forward is to improve the education environment so that learners have access to a more consistent and better standard of training;</p>
	<p pid="c.1118W.5/4" class="indent">the Department's Driving Standards Agency (DSA) should consider what further learning resources might be made available to learners and trainers. In particular, they will look at how modern learning techniques and information technology can be further developed and used to help learners develop safe driving skills for life; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1118W.5/5" class="indent">the regulatory arrangements for driving instructors will also be reviewed to ensure that the public can have confidence that the driver training services they are buying are of the highest quality. DSA will consult interested parties on measures to achieve these changes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1118W.5/6">We decided that further statutory regulation on the way new drivers learn would be unlikely to make enough of a contribution to road safety to justify legislative action at present.</p>
	<p pid="c.1118W.5/7">The Department has a substantial programme of research relating to learning to drive and new drivers. It is repeating and extending a cohort study of young and new drivers, which is a large scale evaluation of they way people learn to drive, and their attitudes and behaviour, and an evaluation of the effectiveness of measures introduced as part of the Government's Road Safety Strategy. Separate studies are being commissioned on DSA's Driver Record, and the Pass Plus scheme for newly-qualified drivers.</p>

We believe it is important that all drivers should acquire these basic skills at the earliest opportunity, ideally while they are learning to drive.</p>
	<p pid="c.1119W.2/2">When DSA has evaluated the effectiveness of this initiative, we will consider whether an assessment of eco-safe driving skills should form part of the driving theory and practical tests.</p>

	<p pid="c.1122W.14/2">Estimates are for the average cost faced by the transport user, net of any subsidy. Estimates for bus and rail average costs are based on revenue collected by operators and passenger mileage estimates.

Motoring costs include expenditure on car purchase, spares, maintenance, insurance, taxation, fuel and parking, but excludes costs paid by employers. The marginal cost of travelling by car is significantly less than the average cost as car purchase, and other fixed costs, would be excluded.</p>

This follows a review of the existing system of decriminalised parking enforcement which has been undertaken with the help of key industry stakeholders. We intend to consult on draft parking regulations and statutory guidance in spring 2006, with a view to issuing final regulations and guidance in early 2007. Our work on civil parking enforcement will be followed by regulations and statutory guidance on the civil enforcement of bus lanes and moving traffic offences.</p>

	<p pid="c.1132W.9/1">The Financial Services Authority (FSA) regulates all banks and financial services providers operating in the UK. The FSA has a statutory obligation to protect consumers and is responsible for policing the regulatory perimeter and for drawing attention to where the boundary lies. FSA rules require banks to explain to customers that a particular product or service is regulated by the FSA.</p>
	<p pid="c.1132W.9/2">The FSA Handbook includes requirements that firms must ensure that they should not make any misleading statements to a client, whether expressly or by implication, that its affairs, or any aspect of them, have the approval of the FSA. This does not, of course, prevent firms from indicating that they are authorised and regulated by the FSA, in conjunction with selling products regulated by the FSA.</p>
	<p pid="c.1132W.9/3">In addition to FSA regulation, the Banking Code is a voluntary code which applies to the large number of banks that subscribe to it. It covers some regulated services, such as deposit-taking, and some unregulated services, such as foreign exchange services. The existence of the Banking Code is one of the reasons why the FSA has not introduced significant additional conduct of business regulation except where required by European legislation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1134W.11/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has commissioned an extensive independent research programme to evaluate the operation of Local Strategic Partnership (LSPs). The main LSP research has been running for over three years and it includes a survey of all LSPs in 2002 and 2004 and in-depth case studies in different areas across the country. The full research programme can be found in the ODPM's website at: <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1136876">http://www.odpm.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1136876</a>. The final report of this phase of the evaluation will be published in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1134W.11/2">In addition, since 2004 all LSPs in receipt of Neighbourhood Renewal Fund resources have been required to develop a performance management framework. This is a self assessment process based on a framework of three core requirements&mdash;the review of outcomes, partnership working and improvement planning. To ensure the process is robust, regional Government offices have undertaken annual reviews with those LSPs, challenging their assessments to ensure they are an accurate reflection of performance. Government offices provide the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister with a report on each of the 87 LSPs in September each year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1135W.2/1">The Government have, with the support of all sides of the House, brought forward a reform of general fire safety legislation in the form of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (SI 2005 No. 1541). The Select Committees that considered the draft order (the Regulatory Reform Committee and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in another place) considered that continuance of the necessary protections afforded by the Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations Regulations 1989 (as amended) by the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 could be demonstrated by guidance. The Government are firmly of the view that all necessary protections are either continued or enhanced by the new regime. However, in the light of the consideration given by the hon. and noble Members of the Committees, the Government decided to withdraw revocation of the 1989 regulations until such time as guidance was in place which shows how the protections are continued.</p>
	<p pid="c.1135W.2/2">Although the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is convinced that the case is made, we always listen to concerns about fire safety. We therefore propose to run the new regime in tandem with the old so that ample evidence of the efficiency and broad ranging nature of the new regime can be shown. Once that evidence has been gathered we expect to proceed to remove the 1989 regulations. However, the evidence shows there to be a gap, or a problem we have not foreseen, then we will work to make sure any such gap or risk is fully addressed before the 1989 regulations are removed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1135W.2/3">We believe the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order, addressing as it does all general fire safety risks and placing prevention of fire and mitigation of the effects of fire as of equal standing to safe evacuation is the right way forward. However, the safety of the public using and staff working on the underground railway systems is of vital importance and it is not something we will compromise.</p>

From 2003, the survey is being carried out on a continuous rolling basis. Prior to 2001, however, this survey was conducted on a five-yearly basis. Hence, the number of households in fuel poverty is not available for all of the last five years.

	<p pid="c.1148W.0/1">The number of adoptions of children from care increased by 38 percent. between 1999&ndash;2000 and 2004&ndash;05. In 2004&ndash;5 there were 3,800. Although assessing social workers do look into the income and money management skills of prospective adopters, they do not classify families on the basis of income and none of the statutory returns asks for this kind of information.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.0/2">Statutory adoption pay (SAP) was introduced in 2003 as a measure of income replacement to help adopters to take time off work when a child is placed with them. Since its introduction the standard rate of SAP has been the same as the standard rate of statutory maternity pay (SMP) and maternity allowance (MA). The Work and Families Bill will enable us to increase the payment period of both maternity and adoption pay from the current 26 weeks to 39 weeks from April 2007 with an ambition to increase to one year by the end of this parliament. It is also our ambition to increase the flat rate of SAP, SMP, MA and statutory paternity pay over time.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.0/3">SAP needs to be considered as part of the overall package of support for adoptive families. Adopters have a right to be assessed for financial support under the Adoption Support Services Regulations 2003 (which will be replaced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-30">30 December 2005</phrase> by the Adoption Support Services Regulations 2005). We have provided nearly &pound;70 million of ring fenced grant to local authorities over the three year period 2003&ndash;04, 2004&ndash;05, 2005&ndash;06 to fund adoption support services and special guardianship support services. In addition, adoptive families will benefit from other support available to families, including working tax credit and child tax credit.</p>

	<p pid="c.1149W.2/1">The Government intend to make a policy announcement shortly on the implementation of this EU waste electrical and electronic equipment directive, including the timing of the WEEE regulations. The Government have been working towards practical implementation arrangements for the UK in extensive discussions with stakeholders. The Department has conducted three policy consultations in preparation of these regulations and development of the practical implementation arrangements. It has also consulted on proposals for cost recovery fees to cover the environment agencies' planned roles in relation to the registration of producers and monitoring of obligations, primarily producers' obligations, under the WEEE regulations. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs and the Northern Ireland Office have conducted separate consultations on draft regulations to implement the directive's requirements for the permitting of WEEE treatment facilities. The Environment Agencies have jointly consulted on draft technical guidance for the treatment of WEEE.</p>

	<p pid="c.1155W.0/3">In the last five years adult learners in Further Education (FE) were assumed to contribute 25 per cent. of the basic course cost of their learning unless fees were remitted because of the reasons stated above. This proportion increased to 27.5 per cent. in 2005/06 and will rise again to 32.5 per cent. in 2006/07 and 37.5 per cent. in 2007/08. In average terms this means a rise from an hourly rate of &pound;1.42 to &pound;1.94 by 2007/08.</p>
	<p pid="c.1155W.0/4">The responsibility for setting and collecting fees rests with the college. However, we know that historically many FE providers choose to waive the fees for some of these 'fee-paying' learners:</p>
	<p pid="c.1155W.0/5" class="indent">In 2003/04, FE providers collected &pound;152 million out of an 'expected' &pound;261 million</p>
	<p pid="c.1155W.0/6" class="indent">In 2004/05, &pound;159 million was collected out of an 'expected' &pound;277 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1155W.0/7">In order to increase the levels of fees collected, from 2005/06 the LSC agreed a fee income measure with each FE funded provider. To assist providers in developing a strategic approach to fees policy, the LSC published a good practice guide to fee income earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1155W.0/8">Clearly with the increase in fee assumption, it will be important that FE providers recover as much money as possible from learners as employers.</p>

	<p pid="c.1155W.3/1">The statutory National Curriculum Science Order requires that all pupils should learn about the effects of alcohol and other drugs. In addition, schools are expected to use the non-statutory frameworks for Personal Social Health Education (PSHE) and Citizenship at key stages 1 and 2, PSHE at key stages 3 and 4 and the Citizenship programme of study at key stages 3 and 4 as the context for developing drug and alcohol education further. It is for schools to decide how much curriculum time is necessary to meet these requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1155W.3/2">We are supporting schools to deliver better alcohol education. In 2004, we issued all schools with new guidance on all aspects of drug education, including alcohol. We have invested in the development of the PSHE certificate for teachers which supports standards in the teaching of PSHE, including alcohol education. We have made up to 2,000 places available in both 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06.</p>

The principles underpinning these are encapsulated in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights as well as legislation more specific to particular education sectors. However, such freedoms also bring responsibilities, and we have to balance freedom of speech with the need to protect national security and the rights of citizens not to be put at risk from criminal and violent acts.

	<p pid="c.1158W.2/1">This Government are committed to improving levels of attendance at school. Figures published in September for 2004/05 show that the level of absences from school have fallen for the fourth consecutive years to a record low level. The equivalent of 12,500 more pupils are in school each day on average in 2004/05 than in 2003/04. There are 50,000 more pupils in school each day on average than would be the case if absence rates were still at 1996/97 levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.1158W.2/2">This Government believe that, for most children, school is the right place in which to receive education. However, we respect parents' fundamental right, under section 7 of the Education Act 1996, to educate their children at home if they so wish. Where that happens, the parents must take responsibility for ensuring that the education provided is suitable and, for children of compulsory school age, is full-time. We have no plans to change this right.</p>
	<p pid="c.1158W.2/3">We have no current plans to amend section 8 of the 1996 Education Act which sets out when a person is of compulsory school age.</p>
	<p pid="c.1158W.2/4">Section 9 sets out the general principle that pupils are to be educated in accordance with their parents' wishes. The courts have ruled that, while local authorities must have regard to the general principle that pupils are to be educated in accordance with the wishes of their parents ... ... .&quot;, that this is subject to other considerations, and that there are many things to which the education authority may have regard and which may outweigh the wishes of (particular) parents'.</p>
	<p pid="c.1158W.2/5">How this operates in relation to school admissions is that section 86 of the school Standards and Framework Act 1998 gives parents a right to express a preference for the school they want their child to attend, and to give their reasons for that preference. If a school is oversubscribed, then the school's published admission arrangements (or 'oversubscription criteria') are applied to determine which applicants should be offered the available places. Those who are unsuccessful have a statutory right of appeal to an independent appeal panel.</p>

	<p pid="c.1160W.8/1">Sponsoring an academy is an act of philanthropic giving. Sponsors contribute up to 10 per cent. of the capital costs of a new academy (to a maximum of &pound;2 million), but their contribution is not just financial. More importantly they bring an experience of success, a personal commitment, energy, drive and ambition, as well as a whole new set of skills and experience. The 2005 PricewaterhouseCoopers evaluation found strong confidence in the role of sponsors&quot;, with 78 per cent. of staff surveyed in academies agreeing that the sponsor brings expertise that would not otherwise be available to the academy, and 82 per cent. of staff agreeing that the sponsor's resources had a positive impact on pupils' learning.</p>
	<p pid="c.1160W.8/2">The benefit that sponsors derive from their involvement in the programme is entirely personal and generally motivated by a desire to give something back to the community or from a sense of corporate responsibility.</p>

UKvisas are enhancing the role of the Independent Monitor to review the standard of decision making on visas, improving the training for entry clearance officers, and are recruiting a network of regional managers to spread good practice.</p>

	<p pid="c.1162W.8/1">The Department for Education and Skills has, in consultation with the Identity Cards Programme, developed its current best estimate of the cost of using the ID Cards Scheme to support the services which it oversees and these costs have been incorporated into the business case. The Department is represented on the Ministerial Committee on Identity Cards which oversees the work on benefits planning and realisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1162W.8/2">In deriving these estimates account has to be taken of the types of use required to support the particular services which this Department oversees. Not all services will require a high degree of integration between the ID Cards Scheme and other IT systems. Where there may be a need for integration, some costs can be absorbed into the usual cycles of system upgrades and technology refreshes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1162W.8/3">We cannot release the detailed estimated costs for integrating IT systems and the ongoing operation of the Identity Cards Scheme within the Department and the services which it oversees at this stage as these elements may be acquired from the market. The estimates are therefore commercially sensitive and to release them may prejudice the procurement process and the Department's ability to obtain value for money from potential suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="c.1167W.2/1">Many Sure Start settings offer a diverse range of activities to improve oral health in very young children, for example, by issuing free toothbrushes and toothpaste packs to families, free information leaflets and advice sessions. This is in addition to the Department of Health's pilot scheme 'Brushing for Life ' where Health Visitors are giving free packs containing a tube of fluoride toothpaste, toothbrushes and a leaflet on oral hygiene to families with children aged eight and 18 months living in areas with the highest level of tooth decay and in areas served by a Sure Start Local Programme where fluoride is not added to the water supply.</p>

	<p pid="c.1169W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1169W.2/2">When participants on new deal for young people (NDYP) and new deal 25 plus (ND25 plus) join the new deal, they enter a 'Gateway' period, lasting up to four months, in which a personal adviser works with them to improve their job prospects. At the outset, personal advisers consider whether it is appropriate to refer participants for a formal basic skills assessment and if a need is identified, participants can be referred to relevant provision aimed at addressing this.</p>
	<p pid="c.1169W.2/3">The new deal for young people is mandatory for all 18&ndash;24 year olds who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance (JSA) for 6 months. New deal 25 plus is mandatory for people aged 25 and over claiming JSA for 18 months or 18 out of the last 21 months. During their time on the Gateway, participants continue receiving the same rate of benefit they were receiving prior to joining the Gateway.</p>
	<p pid="c.1169W.2/4">Subsequent weekly Gateway interviews focus on moving people into work. Part of this process is the Gateway to Work course. Jobseeker's allowance (JSA) regulations state that it is mandatory for all NDYP customers, who are still unemployed by week four of the Gateway, to attend the two-week Gateway to Work course. ND25 plus customers can be required to attend the course if it is considered they will benefit from attendance. The two week course is designed to improve a person's employability and enhance their prospects of moving into full-time employment and off jobseekers allowance (JSA).</p>
	<p pid="c.1169W.2/5">NDYP participants who do not secure a job before the end of the four month Gateway period must then enter one of the four NDYP Options: the Subsidised Employment Option; the Full Time Education and Training Option; the Voluntary Sector Option or the Environment Task Force Option, all of which are aimed at helping people into work and off JSA. ND25 plus participants must enter an Intensive Activity Period which can combine work experience, work-focused training and help with motivation and job search, to help people into employment and off benefit.</p>

These difficulties have now been resolved and measures have been established to ensure applications reach institutions as soon as possible.

The great majority of applications are submitted on-line and the remaining paper applications are being turned around within five working days. It is not possible to say how many individual users experienced problems as multiple attempts may have been made by the same people to make contact, submit applications and give references.</p>

	<p pid="c.1172W.8/1">My Department allocates funds for post-16 education in school 6th forms and further education colleges to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) which is the planning and funding body for post-16 education and training in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.8/2">For school 6th forms the LSC allocated &pound;1.6 billion in 2005/06 to local authorities in England.

LSC Regions and local offices allocate funds to providers based on locally-agreed provider development plans, which are designed to reflect Government policy, priorities and targets. These funds are allocated in blocks to reflect activity supporting '16&ndash;18' and '19+' learners. There is considerable local flexibility to move funds around within the region each year and so it is not possible to say at this stage how those funds will eventually be used to support learning at each 'Level'. However, information (from the Individualised Learner Record') shows that for the most recently completed academic year, 2004/05, '16&ndash;18' funds were used in the following way:</p>

	<p pid="c.1174W.5/1">Attendance in learning over the age of 16 is voluntary. However our aim is that all young people should stay in learning up to age 19, and continue in learning throughout life, to secure the skills that they, and the economy, need. Participation and attendance in post-16 education and training depends on the quality, relevance, effectiveness and perceived value of the provision and outcomes for each learner alongside sound information, advice, guidance and pastoral care.</p>
	<p pid="c.1174W.5/2">Improved retention and attainment is underpinned by general funding principles and individual incentives and sanctions-to earn free funding for leavers, an institution must ensure that they both complete the course and achieve their qualification aims. Among the incentives and sanctions are:</p>
	<p pid="c.1174W.5/3" class="indent">Minimum standards of learner success (based on achievement and retention) for colleges and work based learning providers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1174W.5/4" class="indent">Education maintenance allowances designed to encourage young people to stay in learning by offering up to &pound;30 per week payments for remaining at school or college.Payments and bonuses are stopped for absenteeism.</p>

	<p pid="c.1174W.8/1">The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 recognise the different needs of pupils in day and residential schools. A greater provision is required in the latter because washroom facilities must be located near to sleeping accommodation, with easy access, in addition to the facilities required convenient to teaching accommodation. Some of the daytime provision may count towards that required for boarders if it is in an appropriate location and offers good access to residential pupils.</p>
	<p pid="c.1174W.8/2">The regulations do not specify the number of toilets that should be provided for staff and visitors, but do state that they should be separate from those provided for pupils. However, the Department's design team is producing new design guidance for extended schools. This does say that additional facilities may be needed to cope with a wider range of adult and child users, and gives the example of additional adult toilets being needed in a primary school. This should be published early in 2006. A review of the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 has not been undertaken and is not currently planned.</p>

	<p pid="c.1179W.3/1">We agree with the European Parliament's conclusion in resolution RC-B6&ndash;0592/2005 that the UN has a vital role to play in Burma. We strongly support the UN Secretary General's efforts to promote national reconciliation and democratisation in Burma, and agree with his most recent 'good offices' report of <phrase class="date" code="">10 October</phrase>. Human rights violations have been highlighted in successive highly critical UK co-sponsored UN resolutions on Burma, most recently at the UN General Assembly in November. These issues remain a focus for the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Burma, Professor Sergio Pinheiro, and the UN Secretary General's special envoy to Burma, Tan Sri Razali Ismail, whom we urge the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) to allow to return to Burma.</p>
	<p pid="c.1179W.3/2">We fully support US efforts to secure discussion of Burma by the UN Security Council. We believe that such a discussion, including covering the human rights situation, would increase the pressure on the Burmese regime to effect genuine change. It would send a powerful signal to the Burmese leadership that the UN Security Council&mdash;the body with primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security&mdash;is concerned about the situation in Burma.</p>
	<p pid="c.1179W.3/3">We believe that it is essential for the SPDC to enter into a constructive dialogue with all legitimate representative bodies, including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy, and the ethnic groups to promote national reconciliation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1179W.3/4">We share the European Parliament's concerns about the continuing detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. We have repeatedly called for her immediate release and that of all political prisoners in Burma, most recently in a statement on behalf of the European Union on <phrase class="date" code="">28 November</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.1179W.6/1">We remain concerned at the continuing tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea over their disputed border. We continue to underline to both parties that there must be no return to war; that the decision of the Boundary Commission is final and binding, and must be implemented; and that they should engage in dialogue on all the issues that divide them.</p>
	<p pid="c.1179W.6/2">United Nations Security Council Resolution 1640 (2005) allows Ethiopia and Eritrea 30 days to respond to the demands made of them in the resolution to withdraw troops from the border area, and for Eritrea to lift the ban on UN helicopter flights. After that period, the Security Council will consider imposing sanctions in the form of an arms embargo. We will continue to assess how an arms embargo would affect the situation, including the wider impact of an embargo, as the situation develops. We are working closely with UN and Security Council partners to find a way forward for this problem. The use of economic sanctions has not been specifically raised by Security Council members and we believe this action is unlikely to be proposed.</p>

	<p pid="c.1180W.2/1">As I said in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase>, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-14">14 October 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-10-14.642W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 642W</phrase>, there are several courses of action available to the Council of Europe.</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.2/2">The Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers can adopt interim resolutions expressing concern with respect to the slow or non-execution of a judgment. Peer pressure is increased to encourage rapid compliance with the court's judgment. In the vast majority of cases, this is sufficient to ensure compliance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.2/3">At the request of the Committee of Ministers, the Chairman in Office can write to or hold meetings with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the respondent state.</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.2/4">The ultimate measure available to the Committee of Ministers is recourse to article 8 of the Council of Europe's statute: suspension of voting rights in the Committee of Ministers, or even expulsion from the organisation. But this is an extreme measure, which would prove counter-productive in most cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.1180W.2/5">In order to strengthen the measures available, protocol 14 to the European Convention on Human Rights empowers the Committee of Ministers to bring infringement proceedings in the European Court of Human Rights against a state that refuses to abide by a judgment. We are urging all member states of the Council of Europe to ratify the protocol as soon as possible, as the UK has done, so that it can enter into force.</p>

	<p pid="c.1188W.2/1">DFID is working with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other donors to improve the predictability of aid flows, the effectiveness of IMF signalling, and countries own expenditure management capacity. This will ensure that countries are better able to plan for increased spending in health and other key sectors identified in their Poverty Reduction Strategies, while maintaining the fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability which are essential to long term growth and poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/2">DFID has supported a series of High Level Meetings on the health related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) over the past 18 months. These meetings have brought together senior representatives of Ministries of Health and Finance from developing countries, donors and international organisations including the World Bank and the IMF. The meetings have looked to develop solutions to the systematic barriers to faster progress in realising the MDGs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/3">The IMF's focus is appropriately, on maintaining fiscal sustainability and overall macroeconomic stability, as an essential underpinning to planned Government programmes and economic growth. Within these objectives, DFID has worked with the IMF on the issue of creating 'fiscal space'&mdash;that is increasing the financial scope for countries to expand their allocations to provide critical services such as health and HIV/AIDS services. The IMF has led much of this work.</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/4">The UK has also worked with the IMF to improve its role in 'signalling' and donor co-ordination. The unpredictability of future aid flows from donors is a significant constraint on countries' ability to plan future spending, creating uncertainty about both overall budgets, and about the availability of resources to finance individual programmes, including in the health sector. The IMF has a role to play in supporting countries' own budget processes, and in working with donors to improve the predictability of their aid.</p>
	<p pid="c.1188W.2/5">The UK is pushing for greater predictability and less volatility of aid and longer-term financial commitments. This would provide confidence to Ministries of Finance to establish more ambitious financial frameworks and take on the long term recurrent costs associated with, for example, scaling up comprehensive HIV/responses. Malawi is a good example where the IMF has worked effectively with the Ministry of Finance to support the implementation of an ambitious emergency human resource programme for health.</p>

	<p pid="c.1189W.0/1">The UK Government, led by DFID, has done a great deal of work to increase access to medicines for people in developing countries, including for children.</p>
	<p pid="c.1189W.0/2">In 2004 we published the UK Government's policy and plans on increasing access to medicines, which focused on: support to developing countries to build health services; support to countries to understand and appropriately use the flexibilities contained in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement that governs intellectual property rights; new work to increase investment in research and development (R and D) for diseases affecting developing countries; and direct engagement with the pharmaceutical industry to increase access. In DFID's 2004 HIV and AIDS Treatment and Care Policy, we made a commitment to focus on the needs of children, women and the poor.</p>
	<p pid="c.1189W.0/3">In March of this year we published jointly with the Department of Health (DH) and Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) a 'good practice' framework, building on good practice in the pharmaceutical industry and the work of the World Health Organisation, the (WHO) and others to set out recommended actions companies could take around pricing, Research and Development investments and how they work in developing countries, to help increase access to medicines. The framework had clear recommendations around the importance of ensuring medicines, including ARVs, were available in appropriate paediatric formulations. In the context of this work, DFID has convened a series of meetings with the industry, at which this issue has been addressed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1189W.0/4">The UK also played a key role in the <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-30">30 August 2003</phrase> decision by the WTO TRIPS Council to allow developing countries with no pharmaceutical industry of their own to import copies of patented medicines under compulsory licence in accordance with the provisions of the decision. This historic decision will help developing countries to negotiate with drug producers, and help to maintain access to cheaper copies, including for paediatric formulations where they exist.</p>
	<p pid="c.1189W.0/5">The UK has also taken a lead internationally to support more research into treatments and vaccines for diseases affecting developing countries, including for children. In the UK's AIDS strategy Taking Action&quot; (2004) the UK committed to increase our support for research into: microbicides; treatments and new technologies for the poor, women and young people including children; and the social, economic and cultural impact of AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="c.1189W.0/6">DFID continues to support Product Development Public Private Partnerships (PDPs) for the development of HIV vaccines. DFID has also funded research on the appropriate use of existing medicines in developing country settings including, clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of co-trimoxazole prophylaxis in reducing mortality among children, and co-funding trials with the Medical Research Council (MRC) accelerating the development and evaluation of ARV treatment protocols that are simple to use, but remain safe, effective and relevant to the needs of people with HIV and AIDS, including women and children, in resource poor settings.</p>
	<p pid="c.1189W.0/7">More does need to be done to ensure a long-term supply of affordable paediatric drugs for the treatment of HIV and AIDS in developing countries. We will therefore continue our work with the pharmaceutical industry, to support appropriate use of TRIPS and to increase R and D investment, and work to ensure that children are able to access the drugs they need in the formulations they need.</p>

	<p pid="c.1190W.2/1">Between 1997 and 2001, DFID funded over 1,000 housing units in Montserrat for displaced residents. Further housing assistance, agreed with the Government of Montserrat (GoM) in October 2001, focused on provision of 200 serviced residential lots, sheltered housing for the elderly and mentally ill, a self-build materials grant scheme for poorer households, and refurbishment of temporary housing. Additional support, including the preparation of serviced lots and the construction of 60 houses, is being funded by the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="c.1190W.2/2">Most displaced residents, who remained on the island, now have satisfactory accommodation.

	<p pid="c.1197W.2/1">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) makes a number of learning resources available to meet the work-related literacy and numeracy needs of its staff. These resources address specific business needs such as effective briefing and written communication with customers and are provided either as face-to-face courses or as blended learning solutions. All staff have a Personal Development Plan which is reviewed twice yearly with their manager and any development needs, including literacy and numeracy needs, are identified and addressed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.2/2">In addition, DWP has entered into a partnership with its main trade union, the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), to address the basic literacy and numeracy needs of its staff. Since March 2004 this has been the main focus of activity of the union learning representative (ULR) network that has been established within DWP.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.2/3">ULRs encourage staff to assess their skills and support them to address any learning need they identify through a local college or Learndirect. The DWP is committed to help staff by providing any necessary time off to attend learning designed to bring their skills up to level 2 of the national qualifications framework.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.2/4">The PCS has made provision for staff at our offices in Newcastle and Leeds to access learning to level 2 at their workplace. This type of internal provision is likely to increase as more staff assess their basic skills using an online diagnostic tool that will be available to them in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1201W.2/4" class="indent">All office closures are currently managed as part of the rollout of the new Jobcentre Plus service. Consultation with local stakeholders is an integral part of the planning process for rollout. Local managers are required to share their early plans for new service delivery arrangements with a wide range of local stakeholders and the communication will describe any proposals for site closures. The manager replies to comments and views received during the consultation. We try to respond positively to alternative proposals, but we do have to operate an efficient service and I am sure you will understand that we are not always in a position to meet everyone's expectations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1201W.2/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus managers write again to inform stakeholders of firm plans, explaining if necessary why they may have changed from those initially circulated and will also explain the reasons behind the changes. Where a site is planned for closure, the manager will write again around six weeks before the site closes to remind stakeholders of the new arrangements being put in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.1201W.2/6" class="indent">The consultation process is a mandatory one that takes place before implementation activity progresses into a detailed design phase. The consultation exercise should be seen in the context of broader ongoing communications with stakeholders as part of our routine business.</p>

Where a site is closing, our staff are likely to relocate to the new offices and contact centres.

When complete, customers will have access to our service in around 1,000 locations. Around 880 of these will be Jobcentre Plus sites. The remainder will be locations where we deliver services in conjunction with partner organisations. This flexible approach to service delivery might, for example, include locating a touch-screen Jobpoint and telephone in Local Authority premises, or delivering information and advisory services through third party premises.</p>

	<p pid="c.1202W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning what consultation with customers was undertaken prior to the implementation of the Customer Management System (CMS). This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.1202W.2/4" class="indent">It may be helpful if I explain that CMS is an Information Technology system used by staff in our contact centres to gather information from customers when they make a claim to benefit. To make a claim the customer calls a contact centre where CMS is used. Contact centre staff ask the customer a series of questions to assess their potential eligibility to Jobcentre Plus benefits and then arrange to call the customer back at a mutually agreed time, to assist in completion of a claim form. This removes the need for customers to complete a lengthy claim form and instead allows the customer to provide information by telephone.</p>
	<p pid="c.1202W.2/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus did not consult with customers about the introduction of CMS as it is an IT system used by staff. However, we do conduct an annual customer satisfaction survey which canvasses the views of our customers across the full range of our services, including the channels we provide. The surveys give us a clear picture of how our services are perceived by customers, including how well delivered they are, and how easy or difficult they are to access. These provide baseline information on customer expectations and satisfaction and also provide the basis for tracking, over time, how customer perceptions of the service change as Jobcentre Plus implementation is rolled out, helping to drive the process of performance improvement.</p>
	<p pid="c.1202W.2/6" class="indent">The results of the 2004 survey were published on 30th September 2004. The 2005 survey commenced in September. In addition, representatives from Jobcentre Plus routinely speak to groups and have meetings with stakeholders in order to better understand customer perception.</p>

	<p pid="c.1203W.3/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. She will write to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="c.1203W.3/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Leslie Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-06">6 December 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1203W.3/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning the cost of calls to contact centres using the Customer Management System (CMS). This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.1203W.3/4" class="indent">It may be helpful if I first explain that to make a claim, the customer calls a contact centre. Contact centre staff ask the customer a series of questions to assess their potential eligibility to Jobcentre Plus benefits and then arrange to call the customer back at a mutually agreed time, to assist in completion of a claim form. This removes the need for customers to complete a lengthy claim form and instead allows the customer to provide information by telephone.</p>
	<p pid="c.1203W.3/5" class="indent">With regard to the cost of the initial call to all Jobcentre Plus contact centres, a local BT rate 0845 number is available. Customers using mobile telephones or other landline networks are charged at their network provider's normal tariff for 0845 calls. Customers can also use warm phones&quot; in local Jobcentre Plus offices to make this call free of charge.</p>
	<p pid="c.1203W.3/6" class="indent">The average length of the inbound call is 11 minutes. BT call prices for 0845 numbers vary dependant on the time the customer calls, and can range from 1p to 3p per minute. Based on this information the cost of the inbound call would be on average between 11p and 33p.</p>
	<p pid="c.1203W.3/7" class="indent">In order to gather all the information for the customers claim to benefit, the outbound call is made from the contact centre to the customer. There is no cost to the customer for this call.</p>
	<p pid="c.1203W.3/8" class="indent">Prior to implementation of CMS, customers wishing to claim social security benefits were required to either telephone a local office, or visit an office to request a claim form. It would then be necessary for them to complete the form and return it by post or take it back to an office. If there was any need for further information, forms would be sent back to customers, who would then need to re-submit them, prior to their entitlement to benefit being established. Individual customer circumstances vary, as did standards of self-completion of forms and, therefore, the cost of this process for individual customers would vary greatly. It would particularly depend on the extent to which further information was needed following initial submission of claim forms.</p>
	<p pid="c.1203W.3/9" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="c.1206W.9/1">Quarterly work focused interviews (WFIs) were introduced in October 2005 for lone parents claiming income support (IS) with a youngest child aged at least 14. For lone parents who remain on IS until their youngest child reaches 16, this will involve a series of up to eight work focused interviews over a two year period, which is six more than under previous arrangements. The interviews aim to help as many lone parents as possible move into work, or closer to the labour market, before their child reaches 16 by providing information, advice and guidance on work opportunities and the range of help on offer.</p>
	<p pid="c.1206W.9/2">We estimate a total expenditure of approximately &pound;4.3 million on this initiative during 2005&ndash;06, &pound;0.7 million of which represents the cost of an anticipated increased participation in new deal for lone parents resulting from the WFIs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1206W.9/3">Potentially all Jobcentre Plus lone parent advisers could be involved in delivering these quarterly work focussed interviews, but funding for the initiative is based on a planning assumption of the equivalent of an additional 65 full-time staff for the period October 2005 to March 2006 or 130 for a full year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1206W.9/4" class="italic">Note:</p>
	<p pid="c.1206W.9/5">1. Expenditure and staffing figures are planning assumptions based on anticipated volumes of lone parents participating in quarterly WFIs.</p>

We launched the campaign in May this year, with a newsletter mailed to 1.4 million employers offering a range of guidance materials. Next spring we will be offering a further wave of guidance products. We will continue working alongside our business partners, such as ACAS, to help employers to prepare for age legislation, which is due in October 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.1214W.5/1">No DWP contact centres currently use predictive diallers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1214W.5/2">One of DWP's debt management centres did use a predictive dialling system during 2004&ndash;05. The total volume of calls made using the predictive dialling system is not available, nor are figures available for the number of 'silent calls' members of the public would have received as a result of the use of this system. This system was withdrawn from use in April 2005 in preparation for a new IT system.</p>
	<p pid="c.1214W.5/3">Debt management have reviewed the position in light of Ofcom's policy on silent calls. A new telephony system is due for operational implementation in debt management from January 2006. Current plans are that predictive dialling will then be replaced by outbound dialling campaigns in which the system will only make an outbound call if an agent is available to take that call.</p>

	<p pid="c.1225W.8/2">The Department does not allocate funding to national health service trusts. Primary care trusts (PCTs), with their specific local knowledge and expertise, are now responsible for the commissioning of all health services and, to reflect this responsibility, funding is allocated to PCTs. Funding for NHS trusts is therefore dependant on the level of services they are able to contract with commissioning PCTs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1225W.8/3">Significant levels of resources have been made available to the NHS. The latest round of revenue allocations to PCTs, covering the period 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, represents &pound;135 billion investment in the NHS. Over the two years covered by this allocation PCTs will receive an average increase of 19.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1225W.8/4">Each NHS trust has a statutory duty to break-even over a three-year period. While the financial situation for 2005&ndash;06 is challenging, the trust has a financial recovery plan in place and is forecasting to break-even in the current financial year.</p>

The data shown are only for 1996&ndash;97, rather than 1994&ndash;95, for two reasons: international classification of diseases (ICD) 10 codes as requested are not applicable for 1994&ndash;95 because ICD10 was only introduced in 1995&ndash;96. Attempts to back reference the codes to the ICD9 code list do not reveal a comparable data set. Secondly, strategic health authorities (SHAs) were introduced from 2002&ndash;03 and we have done a mapping exercise to apply the new boundaries back to 1996&ndash;97. Before this point, SHA breakdowns are not applicable. As such, 1996&ndash;97 has been presented as the earliest year where both diagnosis and geographical conditions can be met.</p>

	<p pid="c.1242W.2/1">From 2006&ndash;07, under a new incentive scheme all asset recovery agencies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will be able to get back 50 per cent. of the assets they recover. There are no conditions attached on how the money should be spent but agencies are encouraged to invest a portion in boosting asset recovery and, where appropriate, in local crime fighting projects.</p>

	<p pid="c.1269W.3/1">I understand from my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for DEFRA that, in-line with Government policy there has been no disposal of solid radioactive waste at sea since 1982. Any need to notify instances of disposal of radioactive waste at sea has therefore not arisen. In the unlikely event that such unauthorised disposals did arise, these would need to be reported to the appropriate environmental regulator as they would be in breach of the Radioactive Substances Act 1993, and therefore would constitute an illegal act. The environmental regulator in Northern Ireland would be the Environment and Heritage Service; in England and Wales, the Environment Agency; and in Scotland, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>

	<p pid="c.1271W.2/1">Evidence from elsewhere suggests that, in addition to protecting the public and employees from exposure to second-hand smoke, comprehensive controls help to reduce smoking prevalence which is greater among lower socio-economic groups. During the course of my fact-finding visits to Dublin and New York in July, I was struck by the strength of the argument that partial controls would, in effect, create a two-tier work force whereby some employees would be protected and others would not.</p>
	<p pid="c.1271W.2/2">There is widespread support for comprehensive controls in Northern Ireland with local trades' unions stressing the need to protect all of their members in the hospitality sector, many of whom are among the lower paid.</p>

	<p pid="c.1272W.8/1">Water charges will not be based on the level of local rates levied on a domestic property. However, it is planned that domestic water charges will be introduced from April 2007 on the basis of a hybrid charging regime. This will mean that separate charges for water and sewerage services will be based on a standing charge, together with a variable charge based on the discrete capital value of the property. The charges will be levied and collected by the water company and will be entirely separate from local rates.</p>
	<p pid="c.1272W.8/2">The Valuation and Lands Agency (VLA) is currently valuing all domestic properties in Northern Ireland as part of the reform of the domestic rating system. The capital value used in the calculation of water and sewerage charges will be the valuation determined by VLA.</p>

	<p pid="c.1273W.2/1">The chief executive of Water Service (Mrs. Katherine Bryan) has been asked to write to the hon. Lady in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="c.1273W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mrs. Katherine Bryan, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-06">6 December 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1273W.2/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question about what changes there have been in the number of staff working at the Water Service telemetry centre in Derry in each of the last three years, and what plans he has to re-locate the Water Service telemetry operations to one site (33974). I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1273W.2/4" class="indent">Water Service has four telemetry centres, based in Londonderry, Belfast, Ballymena and Craigavon, which monitor water and sewerage installations across Northern Ireland. There has been no change over the last three years to the number of Water Service staff working in the Londonderry telemetry unit based at Altnagelvin.</p>
	<p pid="c.1273W.2/5" class="indent">Following a review of telemetry operations, Water Service decided to centralise the telemetry function on one site to achieve efficiencies and standardisation of practices. This will be introduced through a phased approach with the four units reducing to two at Londonderry and Belfast in early 2006 and centralisation on one site in early 2007. The site for the centralised telemetry operation has not yet been identified. In conjunction with this centralisation the hardware and software of the telemetry monitoring system will be upgraded.</p>
	<p pid="c.1273W.2/6" class="indent">The centralisation of telemetry services will provide significant benefits for Water Service and its customers including standardised telemetry practice, improved monitoring services and savings on manpower costs.</p>
