	<p pid=".5W.2/1">The European Commission's approval of the Assisted Areas map in Great Britain lasts until the end of 2006. It is not possible to increase the coverage in one area without reducing it in another. This would be likely to require an overall review of the map and new negotiations with the Commission, with no assurance that any particular area could be covered. The Government are therefore not planning to review the Assisted Areas map until it is necessary to develop proposals for the subsequent period.</p>

	<p pid=".14W.3/1">At the conference in Tokyo in 2001 the international community pledged over US$4 billion to the reconstruction of Afghanistan over periods of 1&ndash;5 years. In the current financial year close to the $1.8 billion pledged at Tokyo for the current financial year has been disbursed to Afghanistan. This has been through a number of avenues, including the UN system, NGOs and the Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). The money directed through the ARTF is available for the Afghan Transitional Administration to utilise as it chooses. To date the ARTF has received over US$200 million from donors.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.3/2">The international community is committed to the reconstruction of Afghanistan but at the same time it is important to continue to address the needs of the returning and returned refugees, the internally displaced people and those who continue to struggle to survive, particularly during the winter months. To this end many donors continue to provide both humanitarian and reconstruction assistance. The distinction between humanitarian and reconstruction projects is often undefined, with many humanitarian activities having longer-term reconstruction outcomes. In the current financial year DFID has provided &pound;55 million to Afghanistan, &pound;24 million of which has been for reconstruction purposes. The international community as a whole provided $1.067 billion of support to the UN Immediate and Transitional Assistance Programme.</p>

	<p pid=".16W.5/1">DFID recognises the key role that water plays in the reduction of poverty and is committed to assisting those in the developing world to assess and manage their water resources in a sustainable manner. Nearly two-thirds of the world's population will be living in countries of significant water stress by the year 2025. 1.2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water and 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation. Strong commitments were made at the 2002 Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development for Better Management of Water Resources and Improved Access to Drinking Water and Sanitation, and these must now be implemented.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/2">In 2002, my Department has continued to support a substantial number of on-going activities, which seek to contribute to the prevention of water shortages. Such shortages may be caused because insufficient water is available or because of a lack of infrastructure, poverty or pollution which mean that people cannot access the resource.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/3">The sustainability of the quality and quantity of water resources depends on the balance of agricultural, industrial and domestic uses and environmental needs against the prevailing hydrological conditions. DFID, with most other bilateral and multilateral organisations, is promoting integrated water resource management, which is the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/4">My Department is supporting a number of global initiatives, including the Global Water Partnership; the International Hydrological Programme; the Dams for Development Unit of the World Commission on Dams; Water for Food and Nature Dialogue and the International Programme for Technology and Research in Irrigation and Drainage. My Department also supports initiatives for assessment and monitoring of the status of the world's water through the UNESCO-led World Water Assessment Programme and the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme. Our Knowledge and Research Programme also supports a number of projects that aim to improve meteorological and hydrological assessment, collection, analysis and modelling for improved water resource assessments, as well as projects that investigate improvements in the efficiency of irrigation water use.</p>
	<p pid=".16W.5/5">There is an increasing possibility of conflicts over water becoming more common in regions of water stress. Equitable sharing of water between users at national and at local level has a significant contribution to make towards reducing conflict and promoting peace and security. The Nile Basin Initiative is a current example of an initiative being supported by the World bank, my Department and other donors, to manage competition for water equitably.</p>

	<p pid=".17W.5/1">WFP's logistical arrangements have been modified and adjusted as appropriate during the first six months of this emergency operation. The graph shows that the actual corridor use and the estimated use of corridors in the period July-December 2002. The shift, which can be attributed to the GMO and milling issues, has in particular affected the Beira corridor which was expected to supply Zambia and Zimbabwe in much higher quantities. The GMO issue demanded that an increased tonnage of non-GM cereals was purchased in Tanzania and the Republic of South Africa (RSA) whereas as a result of the need for milling of GM cereals, more cargo was routed through the RSA for milling prior to dispatch to Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid=".17W.5/17">It is not realistic simply to extrapolate the actual use of the various corridors during the past six months in order to determine the logistics plan for the next six months. Due to the fact that the availability of non-GM cereals in the region is now limited, WFP will need to make future purchases on the international market and therefore cargo is expected to arrive through the originally planned points of entry. It should be noted that this shift to international purchases will negatively impact on the lead time for arrivals of cereals at the points of entry.</p>
	<p pid=".17W.5/18">As a result of the increased tonnages of non-GM cereals being purchased on a FCA basis in the RSA, the logistical set-up in Johannesburg had to be revamped when WFP became a major exporter of food commodities rather than an importer.</p>

	<p pid=".18W.5/1">The UN has been able to provide food aid to an additional 1 million vulnerable Angolans since the ceasefire agreement last April.

Re-opening them is a UN priority and the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs has contributed US $460,000 from the Emergency Response Fund (ERF) to clear the mines from some of the main transport arteries used to deliver emergency supplies. My Department has allocated &pound;500,000 to the ERF and a further &pound;300,000 to UNDP for a project aimed at improving the effectiveness of mine action through strengthened co-ordination at the provincial level. The United Kingdom also contributed 19.7 per cent. of the 6 million euros which the EC has made available for mine action in Angola. This included 5 million euros to a variety of mine clearance agencies.</p>

	<p pid=".21W.8/1">Before a country can qualify for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, it must produce an interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) at Decision Point, setting out what action it will take to develop a full PRSP. To reach Completion Point, the full PRSP must be in place, and under implementation for at least one year. The PRSP sets out the policy action governments are taking to reduce poverty and provide a budgetary framework not only for spending the savings from debt relief but also for allocating all other aid and government revenues that they have the greatest impact on poverty reduction. We believe strongly in the value of the PRSP process, which is leading to improved economic management and social reform. The additional bilateral debt relief provided by the UK goes towards these poverty reduction programmes. The UK is also aligning its development assistance programmes with the PRSPs.</p>

	<p pid=".25W.5/1">The main aim of the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative is to ensure that countries exit the HIPC process with sustainable levels of debt. The current framework of the initiative has the flexibility to provide, when appropriate, additional debt relief at completion point, so called &quot;topping up&quot;, to countries whose debt sustainability outlook has changed due to exogenous factors since reaching their decision point. The UK is pressing the World bank and the IMF to widen their approach to topping up, so that any HIPC country facing unsustainable debts, that has demonstrated its commitment to poverty reduction and economic reform, should qualify for this additional relief. Debt relief alone, however, cannot guarantee future sustainability. This requires sound macroeconomic policies, strong growth and export bases, including access to markets of developed countries, access to adequate financing on highly concessional loan and grant terms, and prudent policies on new borrowing. The UK is co-financing a debt strategy project aimed at helping HIPC Governments to strengthen their debt management capacity.</p>

Of these, five countries&mdash;Bolivia, Mauritania, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda&mdash;reached their floating completion point either within the timescale assumed at decision point or between one and five months after the assumed date. Burkina Faso reached its completion point in April 2002&mdash;one year late. The reason for this was the delay in completing its PRSP, and the decision by the World bank and IMF to defer consideration of the completion point until spring 2002, in order to reassess the country's external debt position and to update the debt sustainability analysis. As a result of this delay, Burkina Faso became the first country to receive additional relief, so called, &quot;topping up&quot; at completion point, to enable it to exit the HIPC process with sustainable levels of debt.</p>

	<p pid=".26W.2/1">The UK continues to play a leading role in the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative, to ensure that as many countries as possible benefit from the enhanced framework. Following UK pressure, it was agreed that the World bank and the IMF would provide additional relief to countries that risk exiting the HIPC process with debts above the 150 per cent. debt/exports ratio. This was reconfirmed at the spring meetings in 2002, when Burkina Faso became the first country to benefit from &quot;topping up&quot;. Although we welcome this change, it does not go far enough. The UK has proposed that, in calculating topping up, additional bilateral relief should be excluded from the calculations. We also want to see a more flexible interpretation of the rules, so that any HIPC country facing unsustainable debts, that has demonstrated its commitment to poverty reduction and economic reform, should qualify for this additional relief. The UK has also asked the bank and fund to come forward with proposals to promote the full participation of all creditors in the initiative, including technical assistance to HIPC countries facing legal challenges from non-participating creditors.</p>

The overall objective of the Plan is to contribute to reducing poverty in Peru by 50 per cent. by 2015. We aim to do this by promoting the development of an inclusive society, which is responsive to the rights of the poor and excluded. The Plan focuses on three outcomes: promoting social inclusion, Government working for the poor and economic opportunities for the poor. To achieve these outcomes, we work closely with Peruvian organisations&mdash;both the Government and broader society&mdash;and the major multilateral development agencies, to improve the effectiveness of national policies, programmes and international assistance.</p>

There is no evidence in the national budget of receipts from the Congo Desk of the RPA.

	<p pid=".31W.5/1">Official figures for agricultural production are not issued in Zimbabwe until late February following the national assessment. Preliminary figures indicate that the area planted to maize, the staple crop this year is larger than last. However widespread shortages of tillage, seed and fertilisers will suppress yields. Early planted crops in some areas wilted and had to be replanted. The condition of the maize in the main growing areas is reported to be average. Providing the rains continue then Zimbabwe is expected to produce between 850 000 to 1.0 million tonnes, an improvement over 2002 but only 60 per cent. of its annual maize requirement.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.5/2">No figures have been released for the late 2002 wheat harvest but a figure of 160,000t is being used which was 50 per cent. less than the previous year. This year's wheat crop will be planted in July as usual.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.5/3">The harvesting of flue-cured Virginia tobacco, the main foreign exchange earner for Zimbabwe, is just starting. The main producer group is forecasting a total crop of 80 million kilogrammes, considerably lower than the 165 million kg in 2002 and the 202 million kg produced in 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".35W.0/1">Counter pollution operations at sea are best dealt with through the aerial spraying of dispersants. However, ships with a counter pollution capability to support the recovery of spillages can be resourced from commercial shipping companies, oil spill response organisations and ports. The numbers and locations will vary depending on the primary role of these ships. In Lyme Bay, for instance, craft with a counter pollution capability may be available in the ports of Plymouth, Poole, Weymouth or Portland, but there are no ships solely dedicated for that purpose. The Government has substantial counter pollution stockpiles with mechanical recovery resources to assist in the collection of marine pollution from the sea.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.0/2">Companies and shippers involved in the carriage of hazardous chemicals have plans and equipment for dealing with emergencies whilst the substances are in transit. If an incident escalates expertise and facilities from relevant industries and the MCA are available. The MCA's main response would utilise the specialist chemical equipment in the UK's 'at sea' stockpile and its contracted chemical strike team, who provide both manpower and advice. The UK's National Contingency Plan and the Secretary of States Representative's (SOSREP) powers extend to chemical incidents.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.0/3">The MCA annually commissions a report on the different types of marine pollution in the waters around the British Isles from the Advisory Committee on Protection of the Sea (ACOPS). In the ACOPS Report the type of pollutant has been classified since 2000 into mineral oils, chemicals, garbage, vegetable/animal oils and other substances. Oil and diesel are categorised into the same group. Before 2000 the ACOPS report did not include this level of detail.</p>

	<p pid=".36W.2/1">My Department does not make any specific funding available to coastal local authorities for counter-pollution measures. However, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) provides accredited training courses for the maritime local authorities to prepare them for such operations. These courses are primarily based on a response to oil pollution, but the response issues covered are also pertinent to chemical spills. The MCA runs two specific areas of training for local authorities:</p>
	<p pid=".36W.2/2" class="indentitalic">Oil Pollution, Contingency Planning and Response</p>
	<p pid=".36W.2/3" class="indent">A residential training course (five days) for local authority management staff involved in contingency planning and oil spill response. This is run four times a year at locations around the UK, including the MCA's Training Centre in Dorset.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.2/4" class="indentitalic">Oil Pollution Response</p>
	<p pid=".36W.2/5" class="indent">A two day hands-on training course in counter pollution response for local authority staff, who would expect to be involved in supervising beach clean-up operations and protective booming operations. These are run eight times a year at locations hosted by maritime local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.2/6">In the last 24 months the MCA have trained over 150 people on the oil pollution, contingency planning and response courses. The MCA have also run two day hands- on training courses for councils in the following areas since the summer of 2000: Suffolk, Lincolnshire, Merseyside, Hampshire, West Sussex, Cumbria, Somerset, Argyll and Bute, Fife, Kent, Pembrokeshire, Cornwall, Essex, Teeside, Highland and South Wales. Before April 2002 courses will also be run in Inverclyde, North East Scotland, North Devon, Humberside, the Isle of Wight and Dorset.</p>
	<p pid=".36W.2/7">Additionally, the MCA runs a series of decision making in oil spill response courses for the statutory nature conservation bodies, the environmental regulators, the Government Fisheries Departments and the public health authorities in the UK. These are designed to brief, train and prepare the staff of these agencies for their role in the multi-agency response to a pollution incident from shipping. The MCA have run nine of these courses since the beginning of 2000. The MCA also offer 24 hour incident response advice and support to local authorities and maintain a large stockpile of shoreline clean-up equipment at Southampton and Inverness that can be mobilised to an incident if required. The MCA has published a large range of scientific, technical and operational notices to provide guidance for local authorities on a wide range of response issues.</p>

Motorists are converting to LPG at an increasing rate, with the number expected to increase by about 25,000 per year over the next two years, prompted by the Government grants available, and the fact that low-cost LPG fuel is now available in all areas of the country.</p>

	<p pid=".43W.9/1">The 1971 Roskill report (page 191) projected 123 million passengers at Heathrow, Gatwick, and a third London airport in 1991 and 260 million passengers in 2006. Over the period 1969 to 2006, traffic was projected in Roskill to grow over 15 fold. (Forecasts were presented in terms of passengers, rather than air traffic movements and runway utilisation.) Actual passengers through all London airports in 1991, the year before the Gulf war, was 62.8 million passengers (69.5 million passengers in 1992). In 2000, the corresponding actual figure was 117 million passengers. Our consultation documents report an unconstrained forecast of 301 million passengers in 2030, ie a 2.6 fold increase over 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.9/2">The Roskill report forecasts are one of a number of projections of air traffic growth. Since the early 1970s traffic growth has fallen as the industry has matured. More recent forecasts produced by the Department in the 1990s have tended to under-</p>

	<p pid=".46W.11/2">We have noted the proposals for a new network to provide financial education, information and generic advice, with interest. Many organisations are already involved in the provision of those forms of help, such as adviser and product provider firms, trade associations and Government and regulators.

We also welcome the work the FSA will be doing to develop a more general strategy for consumer education, information and advice. We understand they plan to consult on this in the summer of 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".54W.11/1">Most of these countries reached Decision Point in the HIPC initiative in 2000, with the exception of Ethiopia and Chad (which reached Decision Point in 2001), and Ghana (which reached Decision Point in 2002). Under the HIPC initiative a country receives interim debt relief on payments due when it reaches Decision Point, and subsequently the debt is irrevocably cancelled at Completion Point.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.11/2">To reach Decision Point and demonstrate their commitment to poverty reduction, a country must prepare an Interim-Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), to get to Completion Point they need to develop a full PRSP, and usually make progress in, implementing it for one year.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.11/3">The UK always goes beyond HIPC terms and offers 100 per cent. debt relief, including 100 per cent. interim debt relief from Decision Point. The HIPC initiative has helped increase social expenditures in countries receiving HIPC debt relief by US$1.7 billion in 2001&ndash;02, equivalent to 1.2 per cent. of Gross Domestic Product. On average, health and education spending account for 65 per cent. of the resources freed by HIPC debt relief.</p>

Dstl always looks to develop the talents and capabilities of existing staff and would look to existing staff to fill any vacancies at a more senior level, at the same time continuing to recruit and train staff to fill in behind them. Dstl does not therefore envisage a significant increase in such costs attributable to their relocation plans.</p>

	<p pid=".69W.0/22">A direct correlation between the locations of those being withdrawn and the replacements cannot be made.

	<p pid=".70W.3/2">The Ministry of Defence, like other Government Departments, has recently completed a thorough review of its retirement policy for civilian staff in light of the Government's policy. Some two-thirds of the work force already have the option to work up to the age of 65. The review concluded that our current policy was consistent with departmental needs and that any change, including extending this option to those who currently have to retire at age 60, should be made through the implementation of the legislation on age discrimination that the Government are committed to introduce by 2006. We shall also have regard for the outcome of the consultation on greater flexibility for individuals to work beyond the present retirement age which the Government have initiated in the recently published Green Paper on Pensions.</p>

	<p pid=".71W.6/1">The threat from terrorist attack is kept under constant review and the Ministry of Defence works closely with other Government Departments on the protection of merchant shipping. The Royal Navy's worldwide Maritime Trade Operations&mdash;known as UK MTO arrangements&mdash;enable a number of options to be offered in support of merchant shipping, graduated to the prevailing threat. These range from the provision of routine advice and guidance through to naval supervision. The appropriate level of MTO support required in a given area remains under constant assessment. For example, UK MTO arrangements in the Gulf have been enhanced since October 2001 by the establishment of a UK MTO liaison cell in the region. If necessary, higher level Maritime Trade Operations can be implemented very quickly. Information on specific measures to protect naval shipping were provided in my answer to the hon.

	<p pid=".78W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;The attacks of September 11 demonstrated that terrorists are prepared to use any means to cause terror and inflict appalling casualties on innocent people. We commit ourselves to prevent terrorists, or those that harbour them, from acquiring or developing nuclear, chemical, radiological and biological weapons; missiles; and related materials, equipment and technology.

	<p pid=".78W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;In a major initiative to implement those principles, we have also decided today to launch a new G8 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction. Under this initiative, we will support specific co-operation projects, initially in Russia, to address non-proliferation, disarmament, counter-terrorism and nuclear safety issues. Among our priority concerns are the destruction of chemical weapons, the dismantlement of decommissioned nuclear submarines, the disposition of fissile materials and the employment of former weapons scientists. We will commit to raise up to $20 billion to support such projects over the next ten years. We will review progress on this Global Partnership at our next Summit in 2003.&quot;</p>

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) regularly engages with Guyanese politicians to discuss the political situation there, and register concerns on the escalation in crime.</p>
	<p pid=".79W.2/2">My right hon. Friend, the Foreign Secretary, last met President Jagdeo and the leader of the opposition, the late Desmond Hoyte, in April 2002 to discuss the political situation. My noble Friend, Baroness Amos met President Jagdeo four times in the last year in April, May and September and most recently during her visit to Guyana in November 2002. We keep in close contact with Guyanese politicians through our High Commissioner in Georgetown. The FCO is following closely the Commonwealth Secretary General's efforts to mediate between the two parties. The FCO and Department for International Development (DFID) have provided help to assist the Commonwealth Secretary General's efforts to facilitate a resumption of talks between the two parties.</p>

But these resolutions also contain provisions calling on parties other than Israel to take certain action (for example agreeing a cease-fire, recognising Israel's sovereignty).

Under the common law, only the Attorney General can make such an application, because the courts have recognised that he represents the public interest before them. The power is exercised in his independent judgment in that role rather than as a member of the Government. This is the long-established position in relation to functions the Attorney General exercises in the public interest. In 1951 the then Attorney-General, Sir Hartley Shawcross, said:</p>

If political considerations which in the broad sense that I have indicated affect Government in the abstract arise it is the Attorney General, applying his judicial mind, who has to be the sole judge of those considerations&quot;.

	<p pid=".86W.9/17">The decrease in the numbers of inspections is directly related to the increasing number of investigations (of both incidents and complaints) and the complexity of those investigations. Investigations take much longer than inspections and so it is inevitable that more investigations mean fewer inspections. HSE has also taken action to increase their other preventive work including seminars, conferences and awareness days.</p>

	<p pid=".87W.2/1">In accordance with Action Point 14 of the Revitalising Health and Safety Strategy, a High Level Forum (HLF), comprising representatives from all main Government Departments to provide leadership on health and safety management issues within the civil service was established in January 2001. On behalf of this group, Sir Richard Mottram circulated the ministerial checklist referred to in Action Point 12 in July 2001. In August 2002, HLF issued a Good Practice Guide to all Departments and their agencies reminding them of the current legal requirements that they should meet and setting out a number of basic aims which they should look to have in place. These included having in place a Health and Safety Policy Statement, a nominated Board member with responsibility for Health and Safety, a report on health and safety performance in annual reports (Action Point 13) and a properly structured health and safety management system linked to adoption of the ministerial checklist (Action Point 12) and the Health and Safety Executive's guidance Successful Health and Safety Management (HSG 65).</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/2">The High Level Forum is currently reviewing progress made by Departments in the adoption of the checklist and guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/3">Within the Department for Work and Pensions a new Health and Safety Policy Statement was signed in October 2001. This is implemented through a structured health and safety management system, and in particular though Statements of Internal Control.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/4">As with all Departments, the Permanent Secretary takes overall responsibility for health and safety. At departmental board level the Director of Human Resources has been given particular responsibility and, in addition, Jobcentre Plus, the Department's largest agency with some 85,000 staff has appointed a full-time Director of Safety. The DWP departmental report published in May 2002 sets out the new arrangements including the resetting of baselines against which rigorous targets for reductions in work-related accidents and ill health can be set. Details of progress against these targets will be published in future reports.</p>

The English Tourism Council has co-ordinated various forms of ongoing assessment at an operational level, including the reaction of both industry and consumers. The Government consider that more emphasis is also required on improving quality at the bottom end of the scale and will pilot a new fit for purpose initiative to address the problem of unsatisfactory hotels and guesthouses. Total membership has of the harmonized schemes has risen, with benefits in occupancy levels for members, but not as much as had been hoped. Therefore, a two-stage review of NQAS is being planned. The first stage will start very soon and consider harmonizing the schemes across Great Britain. The second will relate to England and look at matters such as the efficiency of inspections and the level of promotion.</p>

	<p pid=".91W.6/1">The Government consider not just regeneration of traditional tourism but also the generation of new activity, in line with developing consumer tastes, to be hugely important. Building on Government strategy in Tomorrow's Tourism, the English Tourism Council published 'Sea Changes', which outlines recommendations for successful regeneration of England's traditional resorts. A key point is that tourism may well play an important role in resort regeneration, but will rarely be the sole source of a sustainable local economy. Local government recognises the importance of tourism and its document 'A Change of Scene', which this Department supported, sets out many useful ideas for dealing with tourism-related regeneration. The Government's view is that local government has a key role in improving and supporting the regeneration of resorts, amenities and services, as do the regions, the private sector and its trade associations, and many central government departments. In line with Tomorrow's Tourism, much progress has been made, including, for instance, initiatives on accommodation quality (including the lower end of the market) and programmes to improve bathing water standards and beach amenities (now better than ever before). Local Authorities are well aware that other services they provide, such as visitor information or the provision of litter services, contribute significantly towards the creation of attractive environments and lead to improvements in visitor experience. Our recently announced new emphasis on domestic marketing and the regional dimension to tourism strategy, will help stimulate focus on the importance of maintaining high quality amenities and services for tourism across the country, including our traditional resorts.</p>

	<p pid=".96W.8/2">The leadership review flows from the Joint Strategic Review of Defra, carried out by the Department jointly with the Office of Public Service Reform. The Joint Strategic Review examined how Defra operated, and identified both the strengths it could build on and the areas it needed to improve to become a high-performing Department. This included a study of the kind of leadership Defra would need. The purpose of the leadership review is to: (i) develop and introduce a 'leadership profile' for Defra staff from top down to G7; (ii) implement a programme of Development Centres and supporting coaching based on the leadership profile and which also builds on earlier leadership development; (iii) focus future learning on supporting the change in culture and performance identified by the Joint Strategic Review; (iv) help individuals reduce any gaps between current and desired skills and competencies; and (v) generate a culture of learning within Defra so that staff outside the target group are properly supported in their own learning and development.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.8/3">A pilot Development Centre is scheduled to run in March 2003, with rollout across Defra from April 2003, and completion planned for July 2004. Following attendance at the centre participants will undertake coaching and other training for a period of at least a year.</p>

However it has been recognised that it would be useful to develop a methodology for a more consistent approach to the assessment of coastal erosion risk. To that end Defra will be forming a working group with representatives from the coastal groups to consider what research is needed, and the outcome will inform future reports for this High Level Target.</p>

	<p pid=".100W.8/2">&pound;7 million has been allocated over the next three years for the leadership development programme. &pound;429 thousand has been set aside for the current financial year. The profile of expenditure for individual years has yet to be agreed within the Department. The leadership review will combine development and some assessment. Most people who go through the Development Centres will continue to work in Defra, making use of a leadership development programme which will follow up training and development needs identified at the centres. For some, it is expected that the results will encourage them to seek early retirement. To meet that eventuality, &pound;3 million, &pound;7 million and &pound;7 million have been earmarked over the next three financial years respectively. There are no staff reduction targets or estimates of the numbers likely to leave Defra following participation in the leadership development programme.</p>

	<p pid=".103W.3/1">This Department, as an aid for planning by all flood and coastal operating authorities, commissioned research to produce a national appraisal of the assets at risk from flooding and coastal erosion in 1999. The results were published in July 2000 and an update version was published in September 2001. Further research on large scale risk assessment has since been carried out under the joint Environment Agency/Defra research programme in flood management and results of the first phase of this work have been applied to the latest information collated for input to the national flood and coastal defence database. The results of this research application which take account of updated estimates of property flood damage from other research are currently being compiled and reviewed. They will be made available once the necessary quality checks have been completed. It should be stressed that the new research methodology is at the leading edge of developments in risk analysis at this scale so the results will have to be interpreted with some caution.</p>

	<p pid=".106W.3/1">DEFRA is the lead Government Department with responsibility for the co-ordination of the UK response to overseas nuclear accidents. RIMNET3 will replace the existing RIMNET (Radioactive Incident Monitoring Network) system which was developed and put in place in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. DEFRA is responsible for ensuring the operation and maintenance of the RIMNET system but all Government Departments and Agencies with responsibilities to respond to an overseas nuclear accident have access to the system and each is individually responsible for negotiating support and maintenance contracts with the prime support contractor (Siemens).</p>
	<p pid=".106W.3/2">The RIMNET3 supply, support and maintenance contract was let to Logica plc in 1992 following an international competitive tender exercise. As RIMNET3 is not yet operational, the support and maintenance provisions have not yet been implemented and no research has been undertaken on its effectiveness in use. However, the RIMNET Co-ordinating Committee brings together representatives from the appropriate Government Departments and Agencies and all their requirements have been reflected in the design and development process. RIMNET3 will deliver all the functionality of the existing RIMNET system on more up-to-date technology and using commercially available software. There is a planned &quot;technology refresh&quot; during the 10-year life of RIMNET3 and any required improvements identified through regular testing of the system and through the extensive programme of domestic and international emergency exercises, will be implemented as appropriate.</p>

	<p pid=".107W.11/2">Power plants are currently regulated under the Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) regime. IPC is established by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and regulates industrial pollution through a system of permits. Operators are required to demonstrate that they would be carrying out the Best Available Techniques not Entailing Excessive Cost (BATNEEC) for their activities before being issued an authorisation to operate. BATNEEC is applied to prevent, and where that is not practicable, to minimise releases of substances to air, water and land.</p>
	<p pid=".107W.11/3">Authorisations set strict limits for sulphur dioxide emissions for the given power plant. In demonstrating the use of BATNEEC the operator would be required to consider techniques that would reduce emissions (including the application of flue gas desulphurisation). Each application is considered on a case by case basis, but all applicants must demonstrate BATNEEC.</p>
	<p pid=".107W.11/4">IPC is being superseded by the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) regime, established by a Directive of the same name (EC/96/61). Existing power plants will be regulated by IPPC from 2006; new plants or those undergoing substantial change will be required to apply for an IPPC permit with immediate effect. Operators are required to demonstrate that they use the Best Available Techniques (BAT) for their activities prior to a permit being issued. Again, permits will include limits on sulphur dioxide emissions.</p>

	<p pid=".112W.0/1">There is no government-wide approach to the procurement of Fairtrade products. However, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development has made clear, the Government are committed to supporting ethical trading wherever possible and provides significant support to the Fairtrade Foundation's efforts in promoting the supply and marketing of Fairtrade products.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.0/2">Catering in the Northern Ireland Departments is contracted out to private sector service providers and it is primarily a matter for them as to where they procure the goods which they require. The Department of Finance and Personnel has facilitated War on Want NI by jointly organising with them an event at Parliament Buildings to promote the aims and objectives of the Fairtrade Campaign.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.0/3">All of the major catering service providers to the Northern Ireland Departments attended the event and it was acknowledged as being very successful in raising awareness of Fairtrade issues within the Northern Ireland catering supply chain.</p>

	<p pid=".113W.6/1">The future of rail services on the Lisburn to Antrim line has been uncertain since the Railways Task Force produced its report in September 2000. The Consolidation Option in this report included the mothballing of the Lisburn to Antrim line when the line from Antrim to Belfast via Bleach Green junction reopened. Subsequently the Northern Ireland Assembly, in its budget of December 2000, agreed to provide funding for railways on the basis of the Consolidation Option. Since taking office I have been giving careful consideration to the future services on this line. On the basis of the data available the case for the continuance of regular services on this line is not compelling. I am awaiting receipt of a further economic appraisal on an option for the line. It is my intention to make a written statement on this matter in the near future. Clearly, that statement will be informed by the additional economic appraisal and made against the backdrop of competing transportation priorities in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid=".124W.2/1">The Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) undertakes microbiological and epidemiological surveillance of E. coli 0157 infections and has given a high priority to work on Vero cytotoxin-producing E. coli 0157.</p>
	<p pid=".124W.2/2">Research by the PHLS has led to significant improvements in laboratory methods for the detection of E. coli 0157 from clinical specimens as well as animals and foods. They produced guidelines on the testing of samples for E. coli 0157 in 2000. These guidelines include advice from the advisory committee on microbiological safety of food that all diarrhoeal stool samples submitted to public health laboratories for testing should be examined for E. coli 0157. Shared protocols for testing E. coli 0157 are being developed with the veterinary laboratories agency to ensure consistency in both animal and human diagnostics. In addition to providing full identification and typing for all E. coli, the PHLS reference laboratory also subtypes E. coli 0157 using a range of methods, and is currently evaluating a simple non-invasive test for antibodies to E. coli 0157 in saliva. Molecular methods for the detection of E. coli 0157 are now used routinely.</p>
	<p pid=".124W.2/3">The Food Standards Agency has set itself a target of reducing foodborne disease by 20 per cent., by April 2006. This includes foodborne cases of E. coli 0157. The strategy for achieving this target, which was published on the Agency website (<a href="http://www.food.gov.uk">www.food.gov.uk</a>) in July 2001, involves a range of measures to reduce microbial contamination of foods and to improve food handling and preparation. Laboratory reports of E. coli 0157 in the UK fell from 1,139 cases in 2000 to a provisional figure of 1,049 in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".124W.2/4">The Department has taken steps to increase the awareness of both the public and the medical profession of the risks of this infection and how to avoid them. The Department has worked with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the Scottish Executive, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Education and Skills in producing guidance for farmers, for schools and for those at risk from recreational activities. The Department, together with the HSE, is also planning to undertake a renewed educational and public awareness campaign on the risks in the agricultural environment.</p>

	<p pid=".125W.2/1">There are a number of research projects in progress that are directed at both providing a better understanding of the virulence mechanisms of E coli-0157 and leading to improved typing methods for application in epidemiological investigations. A number of case-control studies have already been conducted in the UK and have helped to define the risk factors for E coli-0157infection.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.2/2">Enhanced surveillance of E coli-0157 infections has been co-ordinated by the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS). A study of childhood haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is also being conducted by the PHLS in association with the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit, the British Association of Paediatric Nephrologists, the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health and the Royal Hospitals Aberdeen national health service trust.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.2/3">The use of antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated diarrhoea is discouraged. The Department has issued specific advice to medical personnel to ensure that they are aware that the use of antibiotics for the treatment of E coli-0157 may increase the risk of severe kidney disease.</p>
	<p pid=".125W.2/4">The task force on E coli-0157 consulted widely with relevant charities and voluntary organisations. Officials representing both the Department and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) regularly meet representatives of HUS charities to discuss matters including research, diagnosis and treatment. The FSA has regular meetings with stakeholders to discuss its policies and their implementation.</p>

	<p pid=".128W.6/1">Resources to both local National Health Service bodies and local authorities take account of variations in local circumstances, while leaving these bodies to decide the best distribution of services in response to those circumstances. A number of recent initiatives in funding allocations have recognised the need to take account of remoteness.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.6/2">The NHS revenue allocations for 2003&ndash;04, 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 announced on <phrase class="date" code="">11 December</phrase> were made using a new formula. The new formula provides a better measure of health need in all areas. In calculating health need in rural areas, it takes account of the effects of access, transport and poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.6/3">The NHS confederation is currently negotiating a new general medical services (GMS) contract with the general practitioners committee of the British Medical Association. The two sides have commissioned York University to develop a GMS allocation formula that will take account of the costs and pressures of delivering high-quality primary care in different areas, including those associated with rurality and remoteness. The current timetable envisages that this work will be completed early in the New Year, when general practitioners will be balloted on the detailed and costed framework.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.6/4">For social services funding, we will be increasing the sparsity factor in the older people's social services funding formula from 2002&ndash;03 onwards, in response to new evidence on travel effects in the provision of domiciliary care commissioned by the county councils network.</p>
	<p pid=".128W.6/5">Improving access to services, especially in rural and other areas which are currently under-served, was identified as a priority in the cross-cutting spending review on health inequalities. The review also recognised that there are pockets of deprivation right across the country and that health inequalities will need to be tackled in all these areas if the national health inequalities targets are to be met. The results of the review are being fed into a cross-government delivery plan on action to tackle health inequalities and meet the targets. The delivery plan will be published in the New Year.</p>

The plan contains a range of proposals, options and questions on how NHSU could support learning for staff working in and for the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.0/2">NHSU is currently undertaking a period of consultation with the NHS, with clinical teams, staff and managers, and with stakeholders including higher and further education institutions on what role NHSU should play in supporting learning and what its priorities should be.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.0/3">One proposal in the development plan is to offer junior scholarships to young people aged 14, 15 and 16 years. The aim of these scholarships is to encourage people from communities that are under-represented in our health services to consider 'earning and learning' opportunities in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.0/4">The operation of junior scholarships will build on existing development within the NHS being led by work force development confederations. The scheme will require local partnerships between schools, NHS work force development confederations and trusts, parents and the young people themselves.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.0/5">An indicative number of 100 places per year per work force development confederation (around 3,000 places nationally) has been proposed.</p>
	<p pid=".132W.0/6">The details of the scholarships will be developed following the period of consultation, which concludes in February next year, taking into account comments and feedback received. The scheme is likely to be piloted in 2003.</p>

Any NHS body can commission treatment abroad for its patients and a relatively small-scale pilot was undertaken to establish good practice.

Information on meeting the 2001 and 2002 milestones has been collected from health and social care organisations. Less formal information gathering takes place regularly through a network of national health service and social services older people leads. A two-year progress report is due to be published in March 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".138W.5/2">Overseas treatment is an option open to national health service commissioners seeking to increase the number of patients treated, and reduce waiting times. Any NHS body can legally commission treatment abroad for its patients. However, it is up to local commissioners to decide, in the light of capacity constraints across their local health economies, and taking into account the different commissioning options available to them, whether or not to refer patients overseas for treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".138W.5/3">The Department has advised any trust wishing to refer patients overseas to contact one of the two &quot;lead commissioners&quot; who are responsible on behalf of the NHS in England for selecting overseas providers and contracting with them for treatment for NHS patients. These lead commissioners are based in Guy's and St. Thomas' Trust, and Kent and Medway Health Authority.</p>

	<p pid=".141W.5/1">Good progress has been made since the national health service prostate cancer programme was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-06">6 September 2000</phrase>, setting out the Government's approach to improving prostate cancer services in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".141W.5/2">As part of the prostate cancer risk management programme (PCRMP), evidence-based primary care resource packs were sent to all general practitioners in England from <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-23">23 September 2002</phrase> to aid them in counselling men who are worried about prostate cancer, ensuring the men make an informed choice about whether or not to have a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test.</p>
	<p pid=".141W.5/3">Other elements of the PCRMP include ensuring that a systematic and standardised follow-up pathway is available for individuals whose test result is above the PSA threshold and action to improve the quality of laboratory testing of PSA samples. Primary care and laboratories were informed of recommendations from the scientific reference group which supports the PCRMP in September 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".141W.5/4">By 2003&ndash;04 the Department of Health will be directly funding &pound;4.2 million of research a year on prostate cancer. This is a 20-fold increase compared with 1999&ndash;2000. Two National Cancer Research Institute prostate cancer research collaboratives have been established in Newcastle and London. Funded research includes studies on various treatments for prostate cancer, improving the PSA test and ethnic differences in prostate cancer incidence. The National Cancer Research Institute considered prostate cancer as part of its Strategic Analysis in 2002, but made no specific recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".141W.5/5">The Department of Health is funding a Section 64 grant to the Prostate Cancer Charity to increase further information about prostate cancer. This is supporting the creation, review, provision and dissemination of a range of awareness material, supported by &pound;135,000 over three years.</p>
	<p pid=".141W.5/6">92.4 per cent. of patients with suspected urological cancers (including prostate) were seen for their first outpatient appointment within two weeks of their general practitioner deciding they should be urgently referred, and the hospital receiving the referral within 24 hours, in April to June 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".141W.5/7">The cancer services collaborative is modernising cancer care, including prostate cancer, by reducing unnecessary delays in the system for patients throughout the cancer journey.</p>
	<p pid=".141W.5/8">The number of consultant urologists grew from 382 in 2000 to 427 in 2001, and is set to grow to 504 in 2005. There may be around an additional 100 trained specialists available to take up consultant posts in urology.</p>
	<p pid=".141W.5/9">The National Institute of Clinical Excellence's guidance on urological cancers, including prostate cancer, entitled 'Improving Outcomes in Urological Cancers: The Manual', was published in September 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".147W.2/1">National health service organisations covering the Thames Gateway area, in North East London, South East London, South Essex and North Kent, are actively working with a range of partners on developing plans for the Thames Gateway. The aims are to ensure new communities are sustainable, and both enjoy good health and have access to high quality health services.</p>
	<p pid=".147W.2/2">The Department is ensuring that there is a strategic overview and will analyse the outcome of this local planning in the form of a 'Health Scenario' for the Thames Gateway as a whole. This work will detail the additional health and social service provision needed to support the development of new sustainable communities. It is anticipated that this work will be finalised in the spring.</p>
	<p pid=".147W.2/3">Planning for the Thames Gateway is led by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and co-ordinated by the Thames Gateway Strategic Partnership. I represent the Department on this partnership.</p>
	<p pid=".147W.2/4">Funding for services in the Thames Gateway will be allocated in the normal way through primary care trusts. Those PCTs covering the Thames Gateway area will see an overall increase of 34 per cent., or nearly &pound;705 million, in monies available to them over the next three financial years. Some PCTs will see a much bigger increase, including Barking and Dagenham PCT, whose resources will increase by 42.5 per cent. This increased level of resource, along with additional capital building programmes in the Gateway, including a new &pound;230 million, 860 bed hospital at Romford, will result in an expansion in the services available to the residents of the Thames Gateway.</p>
	<p pid=".147W.2/5">The increased growth in population resulting from promoting the Thames Gateway as an area of population growth is expected to take place beyond 2006&ndash;07. The resources needed to support additional health and social care provision in the Thames Gateway will therefore need to be identified in future Spending Reviews.</p>

However, partial restrictions on some admissions may be applied for a range of reasons including winter vomiting virus. These restrictions usually apply for very short periods until operational pressures have eased.</p>

This includes more than doubling child care spending.</p>
	<p pid=".149W.9/4">By March 2004, new child care places for 1.6 million children will be created, with further new places established for 450,000 children by 2006. Specific initiatives, such as the establishment of Children's Centres and Neighbourhood Nurseries, will expand high quality, safe child care in disadvantaged areas, increasingly provided alongside early education and family support.</p>

	<p pid=".150W.2/1">The arrangements for consulting the groups in question on changes to regulations are in line with the arrangements that we have for consulting schools more generally in England on proposed changes to regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/2">The Department follows the code of practice which was issued by the Cabinet Office in November 2000. In planning distribution and coverage we take a number of factors into account including <i>(a)</i> the likely impact and burden of bureaucracy on schools in automatically being sent mailings from DfES; <i>(b)</i> the likely time resource that is required at the school end to respond in a full and effective way to consultation documents within the specified time and <i>(c)</i> the type of regulation, or changes to regulations, proposed.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/3">With these factors in mind documents are sent to a randomly selected and representative cross sample of schools within a particular school type category. Simultaneously consultation documents are routinely placed on the DfES public website and recorded in the DfES publication &quot;Spectrum&quot; which allows all types of schools and other bodies to access and view consultation documents as they see fit.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.2/4">As well as the random cross sample of schools to which consultation documents are sent, a number of organisations and bodies external to schools also receive them. These will generally include intermediaries such as dioceses who are sent paper copies of consultation papers about school matters. The following list shows the consultations of relevance to schools that have taken place in the past 12 months to which, through a variety of means, intermediary bodies will have had access.</p>

This programme will give many young people at Key Stage 4 the chance to pursue vocational courses in colleges, with training providers and with employers. Early indications are that education/business links organisations and small and medium sized enterprises are involved in the local delivery of the programme.</p>

	<p pid=".160W.2/1">If a fire should happen in a school, the Department's primary concern is for the safety of pupils, teachers and other users. Regulation 17 of the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 requires that every part of a school building, and of the land provided for a school, shall be such that the safe escape of the occupants in case of fire is reasonably assured. Schools are also covered by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and by subsequent related regulations. These include aspects of fire safety.</p>
	<p pid=".160W.2/2">To help schools manage fire safety, the Department published Managing School Facilities Guide 6, &quot;Fire Safety&quot;, in 2000. This offers guidance on how to minimise the risk of fire, including identifying hazards and carrying out risk assessments. It also gives advice on training and on fire detection and alarm systems.</p>

	<p pid=".160W.5/1">Since April 2001, all new construction work at schools has been subject to approval under the Building Regulations. Projects will not be approved unless they are designed in accordance with the 2000 edition of Approved Document B (Fire Safety), which accompanies the regulations. The Building Regulations do not require the installation of fire sprinkler systems in new school accommodation and the Department does not intend to seek such a change.</p>

	<p pid=".161W.6/1">The central Government funding available for investment in school buildings will rise from &pound;3 billion this year, to &pound;3.8 billion for 2003&ndash;04, and will rise further to over &pound;5 billion by 2005&ndash;06. The bulk of this funding is allocated by formula to schools and to local education authorities (LEAs) to support investment in their priority needs. LEAs have Asset Management Plans (AMPs) to prioritise these needs locally in a rigorous, open and consultative process, based on a full survey of the building needs of all their schools, including for science teaching and learning, and reflecting government priorities such as our aim to improve the provision of laboratories. Schools now receive substantial direct capital funding, to give them a direct stake in investment in their buildings, including in laboratories. A secondary school of 1,000 pupils will in 2003&ndash;04 receive about &pound;75,000 of direct capital, and this funding can be rolled over for up to three years to allow major projects to be addressed.</p>

The bulk of this money will go to schools and local education authorities, with additional funds targeted on Excellence in Cities areas, and in support of our national Key Stage 3 strategy to raise standards in the early secondary years.

For example, the unit 'Respect for property' helps pupils in KS 1 and 2 (age 5&ndash;10) to discuss and learn about the consequences of crime and the concept of taking responsibility for property in the community. In another unit 'Crime' pupils in KS3 (age 11&ndash;14) build on what they have learned in primary schools to explore how crime affects young people, victims of crime and their communities.</p>

	<p pid=".164W.12/1">Currently the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no plans to intervene in the contractual relationship between private landlords and their tenants by legislating for a third party to intervene and adjudicate in their disputes. However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has issued a consultation paper &quot;Tenancy money: probity and protection&quot;, in which views were requested on whether to move to a mandatory system for the protection of tenancy deposits; and, if so, what arrangements should provide for it. The deadline for responses is <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-28">28 February</phrase>. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will consider whether and how to legislate in the light of responses received.</p>

In order to take this further, now that the CRB is operational, we have established a Voluntary and Community Sector Working Group to provide a specific forum for discussion between the sector and the CRB. The Group has already begun to address issues identified by the sector, including ensuring that there are appropriate and cost-effective arrangements to access the Disclosure service.</p>

Ex gratia payments will be made only to applicants and not to employers, potential employers or others.</p>

Friend the Home Secretary appointed Patrick Carter to lead a team of three to conduct an independent review of the Criminal Records Bureau so as to identify the longer-term measures needed to ensure that the Bureau is able to meet the demand for Disclosures. The team provided some initial oral feedback to Ministers in September and reported their final conclusions and recommendations at the end of the year. These took the form of advice to Ministers, including advice on matters that are commercially confidential; as such they are not in a form suitable for publication. We shall be considering the review team's findings and recommendations very carefully and are minded to publish a summary document, together with the Government's response, in due course. A judgment will be reached on Basic Disclosures in the light of the team's findings.</p>

	<p pid=".178W.2/2">In care homes for adults, only providers and managers were subject to checks prior to <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>. An estimated 100,000 new staff per year will continue to be subject to CRB checks, as will providers and managers. But an estimated 300,000 staff who were already in post on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> and who have not already applied for checks will not need to be checked for the time being. These checks will now be required during the course of 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".178W.2/3">Both new and existing nurses supplied by nurses agencies, and staff supplied by domiciliary care agencies, will also not need to be checked for the time being. A requirement for all such personnel to be checked in the current financial year would have entailed up to an estimated 200,000 in each group.</p>
	<p pid=".178W.2/4">Thereafter, it is estimated that some 50,000 staff supplied by nurses agencies and 60,000 staff supplied by domiciliary care agencies would have needed to be checked each year. Nurses supplied as new staff to establishments where requirements for mandatory checks are in force (including adult care homes and children's homes) will continue to be subject to checks. So will providers and managers of nurses agencies and domiciliary care agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".178W.2/5">Finally, school governors will also not be required to have CRB checks for the time being. Such checks would have generated an estimated 70,000&mdash;90,000 applications per year.</p>

	<p pid=".179W.5/3">The diagnostic criteria for entry into different types of drug treatment are not directly comparable. The needs of individuals and the background to their substance misuse will have an effect on the type of treatment most appropriate for them. Comparisons between the relative effectiveness of the two types of treatment are therefore complex and potentially misleading. The National Treatment Outcome Research Study, funded by the Department, reported that around half, or 47 per cent., of drug users who have gone through residential programmes and more than a third, or 35 per cent., of those from methadone programmes are still abstinent from opiates at four to five years.</p>

	<p pid=".181W.3/1">The increase in the female prison population, and the wider consequences of this in terms of disrupting families and the lives of children, supports the need to respond specifically to the particular needs and characteristics of women offenders if there is to be a reduction in offending by women and the numbers ending up in custody with child-care responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid=".181W.3/2">We are taking forward the 'Women's Offending Reduction Programme' over the next three years to respond to the range of factors that have an impact on why women offend, and encourages joint working between departments, agencies and other organisations to tackle those factors. A primary focus will be on improving community-based interventions that are better tailored to the needs of women. Childcare facilities in the community, is one of the issues being looked at. Greater use of such interventions will be encouraged to ensure that custody is only used for women offenders who really need to be there.</p>

	<p pid=".182W.3/1">Helping women leaving prison to find appropriate accommodation is one of the key factors in effective resettlement, and we are continuing to improve the range of housing advice available in women's prisons, including prisoner-led schemes. Alongside employment, improving accommodation outcomes for released prisoners forms part of the Prison Service's Custody to Work initiative, in which we are investing &pound;14.5 million a year from April 2003. A proportion of this will be allocated shortly to the women's estate and will be available to support the further development of housing advice services. We have no plans to allow courts generally to defer commencement of sentences, but the new sentence of intermittent custody planned in the Criminal Justice Bill will enable offenders to maintain activities, such as child care, while serving their prison time during certain parts of the week. Additionally, although intermittent custody begins immediately it is imposed by the court, the court can defer the first custodial period. This would enable the offender to make child care arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".183W.0/41">It is not possible to determine the number of these applications which remain outstanding as this information is unavailable and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records. At the end of September 2002, there were a total of 37,200 asylum cases awaiting an initial decision, including work in progress. This figure relates to the number of cases ie the number of principal applicants. On the same date, there were an estimated 47,000 appeals lodged with the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) that had not yet been sent to the Immigration Appellate Authority. This figure includes non-asylum appeals.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.0/42">Of those persons who have been refused over this period, it is not possible to determine how many have subsequently been removed as this information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case records. Asylum applicants do not always inform the Immigration Service prior to leaving the United Kingdom, so information is not available on how many refused persons have left the country or have disappeared.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.0/43">Information on asylum applications, initial decisions, appeals and removals is published quarterly.

	<p pid=".190W.3/1">The available information held centrally is set out as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".190W.3/2" class="italic">(i) Collection and publication of data</p>
	<p pid=".190W.3/3">The Home Department uses a postal address file in major surveys conducted by the Home Office such as the British Crime Survey, Home Office Citizenship Survey and Crime and Justice survey. This involves sampling at postcode sector level (or sometimes in segments of postcode sectors). Sampling is undertaken by independent survey companies and the Home Office is not informed of which areas/addresses have been selected to ensure that the anonymity of respondents is preserved but they do attach other data to the survey datasets using the postcode link (eg indices of local deprivation).</p>
	<p pid=".190W.3/4">Also, statistics showing the area of residence of asylum seekers supported by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) are currently published for NASS-defined administrative regions and cluster areas. Recent analysis of postcode information recorded on the Asylum Seekers Support System (ASYS), the administrative system maintained by NASS, has allowed provisional statistics to be compiled for standard administrative areas (Government Office Regions and Local Authorities). In the case of those asylum seekers in receipt of subsistence only support, this provides much greater geographical detail than is currently available. These statistics are currently being quality assured and are intended for publication once this process is complete.</p>
	<p pid=".190W.3/5" class="italic">(ii) Formulae for the distribution of grants and awards</p>
	<p pid=".190W.3/6">The Home Department is responsible for devising formulae to allow for the effective distribution of police grant and geographic information (such as postcodes) are used. These data form part of an annual assessment of population within Force and Basic Command Unit (BCU) boundaries (based on estimates of population movement and of changing boundaries within or between Forces).</p>
	<p pid=".190W.3/7">The information is based on the most current estimates of population and demography available, and is updated at least every year. In addition the forthcoming analysis of the Census will lead to a more substantive revision than is normally the case, as these figures will be used to re-normalise estimates. In addition to the Police Funding Formula, these population changes within Basic Command Units contribute to the crime rates for certain offences. For example Robbery is commonly quoted as a rate per 1,000 (resident) population, as boundaries change and populations change this is therefore reflected in the rates calculated.</p>
	<p pid=".190W.3/8">Each year based (in some part) upon the demography within a BCU, the home department also revise the so-called BCU families. These families group BCU's in clusters, this grouping uses many variables, and again as boundaries change the characteristics of each BCU changes and this can be reflected in a change of grouping. These groups are currently used for comparison of performance and identifying exceptional performers such that this 'good practice' can be shared.</p>
	<p pid=".190W.3/9" class="italic">(iii) Use of postcodes in the delivery of services</p>
	<p pid=".190W.3/10">In certain instances the Home Department and its agencies work with police and Criminal Justice System (CJS) agencies on special operations which have a specific geographic location such as a specific crime 'hot spot'. Special Home Office funding is often used to support these operations. In these cases the postcodes are more incidental than proactively driving the delivery of services.</p>
	<p pid=".190W.3/11">The Home Department used postcode data for the locks for pensioners scheme. To be eligible for the scheme the house had to be in a BCU with an above average burglary rate; the Home Department had to translate BCU areas into postcodes so that the scheme managers could tell whether applicants were eligible.</p>
	<p pid=".190W.3/12">The scheme officially ended in June 2002&mdash;ie that was the last day that applications were accepted&mdash;but surveying and installation work continued after that date. Most, if not all, should be completed this month.</p>
	<p pid=".190W.3/13">We also used postcode data on the Crime Reduction Website (<a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a>) to provide a facility for people to check if they were eligible for the scheme. Now that the scheme has finished, the facility has been removed.</p>

	<p pid=".193W.5/19">The Prison Service has &quot;safer cells&quot; that can complement a regime providing care of at risk prisoners. The design of these cells has several features which can assist staff in the task of managing those at risk from suicide, such as specially designed furniture and fixtures which are manufactured and installed to make the attachment of ligatures very difficult, and access to window bars prevented via non-opening windows with integral ventilation grills.</p>
	<p pid=".193W.5/20">The Prison Service is half way through a three-year programme to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and self-harm in prisons. This work includes increasing the numbers of safer cells and making safer cell furniture more easily available to establishments. To date installations have been carried out to provide 2,100 adult male and 610 juvenile and young offender safer cells. In addition a further 880 adult male safer cells are planned to come on line in 2003&ndash;04. Prototypes for large-scale production of safer cell furniture aim to reduce the current cost of safer cell furniture installations by approximately one third.</p>

Of the files for the period since 1914, only those relating to more serious offences, resulting in the imposition of a custodial sentence of five or more years for mutiny and insubordination, have been selected for permanent preservation.

	<p pid=".201W.5/1">In 2001 there were 55,030 contact orders granted in England and Wales. Deliberate refusal to obey a contact order is a contempt of court and may be punishable by a fine or imprisonment. In cases that involve the care of children those remedies might not be in the interests of the children at the centre of the parents' dispute. In recognition of this my Department asked the Children Act Sub-Committee on Family Law (CASC) to consult on the issue. Their report, &quot;Making Contact Work&quot;, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-08">8 February 2002</phrase> to which the Government responded on <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-06">6 August 2002</phrase>. As part of that response, a stakeholder group has been established to look at the facilitation and enforcement of contact. The group comprises members from the judiciary, legal professionals, CAFCASS, other Government Departments and the voluntary sector. As well as considering how parents may be assisted to reach workable solutions, the group will be looking at alternative enforcement mechanisms. It is due to report in the summer.</p>
