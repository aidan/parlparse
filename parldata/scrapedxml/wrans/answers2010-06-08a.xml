All dairy cattle, in whatever system they are kept, are protected by comprehensive animal welfare legislation in England. It is important to recognise that poor welfare can occur in both intensive and extensive systems, and the most significant influence on the welfare of livestock is the stock-keeper, not the system in which it is reared.</p>

Lord Justice Jackson conducted a comprehensive review of civil litigation costs which also covered the operation of CFAs. His report: &quot;Review of Civil Litigation Costs: Final Report,&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-14">14 January 2010</phrase>, has recommended significant changes to the operation of CFAs. We are considering Lord Justice Jackson's proposals carefully to assess their impact before determining what reforms might be necessary to the operation of CFAs to ensure proportionate access to justice.</p>

The UK has recently welcomed China's participation in the Shared Awareness and Deconfliction (SHADE) group, which manages the plethora of multi-national and national counter-piracy activity in the Gulf of Aden.

Nonetheless, it is recognised that further, appropriate, incentivisation could help QinetiQ to attract more work of this kind. However, we must also ensure that in doing so we comply with our EU Treaty obligations and avoid any state aid. These are complex issues, but my officials are working to develop an incentive regime for all LTPA facilities, which would meet these criteria.</p>

In practice, however, the likelihood of an event occurring that would require the operation of the relief valves is small during normal operation.

	<p pid="a.97W.0/1">The downturn in the global economy has had a severe impact in both Anguilla and the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI). Public finances have also suffered as both territories have relied heavily on tourism and construction for a large part of their revenue base. Between 2008 and 2009 Government revenues fell by 28% in Anguilla and by around 33% in the TCI. This sharp downturn in Government revenues has put pressure on public finances and-as in other jurisdictions-there has been a need to reduce public expenditure. The Governments of the TCI and Anguilla are aware of the need to take action to put their public finances on a sustainable footing. We are working closely with both to address these challenges, including funding revenue studies in both Territories, and an expenditure study in Anguilla.</p>
	<p pid="a.97W.0/2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) continues to monitor the economic and financial position of the Overseas Territories. Officials from the FCO and the Department for International Development undertook a joint mission to the TCI in May to assess the situation. The FCO will send a similar mission to Anguilla in June.</p>

The responses of British nationals detained there varied; some did not want to engage legal assistance, some asked us to contact the organisers' lawyers, and some asked us to provide lists of English speaking local lawyers. Our consul in Tel Aviv returned the next day with lists of English speaking local lawyers, however due to the speed with which the prisoners were transferred to Ben Gurion airport before they were deported, he was unable to provide this list to those who requested it.

	<p pid="a.102W.2/1">A Pitcairn Child Safety Review, commissioned by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Department for International Development was completed by independent experts in June 2009. The review concluded that further work was needed to improve the management of the risks to child safety on Pitcairn. The Government are working to implement the recommendations made in the report. A further review is planned for 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.102W.2/2">The UK Government take its responsibilities for child protection on Pitcairn very seriously. There is a significant community of professionals on Pitcairn, including a police officer, a trained social worker, a teacher and a doctor. An FCO official stationed on the island is the designated Children's officer. There are established policies and procedures in place for handling specific child protection concerns. All professionals receive child protection training before they go to the island, and most members of the island community have also attended human rights training and child protection training.</p>

	<p pid="a.102W.5/1">President Medvedev has highlighted corruption as a serious problem in Russia, affecting many areas of life. Russia slipped to 120th out of 183 countries in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business survey 2010. It ranks 147th on Transparency International's corruption index.</p>
	<p pid="a.102W.5/2">The Government welcome President Medvedev's focus on the need to strengthen the rule of law in Russia. Implementation of this agenda would significantly enhance Russia's ability to meet the standards it set itself when it joined organisations such as the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. We also welcome the work that Russia is doing on accession to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and joining the anti-bribery convention.</p>

	<p pid="a.103W.8/1">The UK is concerned about the security situation in Yemen. The terrorist threat in Yemen is high and we judge that attacks are highly likely, as we make clear in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.103W.8/2">However, terrorism is not the greatest or only threat facing Yemen today. We are particularly concerned about decreasing stability across the country and about the resultant increase in local conflict. Al Qaeda look to exploit instability where they can-the root causes of which are often wider social, economic and political problems. Rising insecurity, conflict and extremism in Yemen will pose a threat to UK long-term interests of stability in the region and beyond, including energy security and global trade flows. Increased radicalisation directly threatens economic and security interests in the Gulf and could pose an indirect threat abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.103W.8/3">Central therefore to the UK's approach to counter terrorism in Yemen is the reality that counter terrorism cannot be looked at in isolation. It is linked to Yemen's other security and daunting economic challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.103W.8/4">The attempted assassination of the British ambassador to Yemen, Tim Torlot, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-26">26 April 2010</phrase> highlights the stark threat posed by terrorists in Yemen, who have no regard for the lives of the innocent Yemeni citizens caught up in such atrocities.</p>
	<p pid="a.103W.8/5">The Government of Yemen has committed publicly to combating terrorism both inside and outside of Yemen and has conducted successful operations, including against members of Al-Qaida in Yemen. The UK is committed to helping the Yemeni Government tackle terrorism in Yemen. Our bilateral support helps the Yemeni Government address the underlying economic and social causes of terror and radicalisation, and enhances their capacity to pursue and prosecute terrorists in Yemen. This includes through the provision of expert advice and through our increasing development programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.103W.8/6">We have also been working in concert with other international partners, including as part of the Friends of Yemen process, to support and encourage reform in Yemen.</p>

	<p pid="a.106W.5/1">I have not made a specific assessment of the effects of the games on the economies of the Pendle constituency or Lancashire. However, the North West stands to gain from the wide range of opportunities created by the games, through businesses winning games-related work and increased tourism. Locations across the UK, particularly those that have non-London games venues and those that are hosting international teams in pre-games training camps, will have the opportunity to create further economic benefits, including inward investment, through the international attention that will follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.5/2">We are already seeing good progress in these areas, for example, 11 of the Olympic Delivery Authority's suppliers are businesses registered in Lancashire, and more are winning work in the supply chains of its contractors. The Old Trafford football stadium will be one of the key non-London venues hosting football matches. Additionally, 68 facilities in the region are included in the official London 2012 Pre-Games Training Camp Guide, and to date memoranda of understandings are in place with 17 of the Oceania National Olympic Committees, the National Olympic Committee of Thailand and Australia's swimming team, formalising their intentions to use facilities in the region in the run up to the games.</p>

	<p pid="a.111W.0/3">However, anaerobic digestion is currently undeveloped in the UK and decisive leadership from Government, together with collaborative working with industry and other stakeholders, is required to rapidly ramp up deployment and build a strong industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.111W.0/4">I am working with Ministers from DEFRA and other Government Departments to determine an action plan for increasing use of anaerobic digestion in the UK, and expect to announce further details later this summer.</p>

Regional and local proposals to do this should be discussed with those affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.113W.9/2">We are advised that individual primary care trusts (PCTs) in the West Midlands believe they are not best able to deliver efficiencies by operating alone. The West Midlands Strategic Health Authority (SHA) has therefore introduced a new model of working in which it has created five clusters in which the 17 PCTs will operate; delivering efficiency savings and reduced management costs through close collaborative working.</p>
	<p pid="a.113W.9/3">We understand that the SHA is clear that this development is not a precursor to PCT mergers. Individual PCTs remain responsible and accountable for their own performance for the overall health of their population and for commissioning ervices for their population.</p>

The Electoral Commission's report published in March 2010, &quot;The Completeness and Accuracy of Electoral Registers in Great Britain&quot;, considers local and regional variations in registration levels. The report notes that the highest concentrations of under-registration are most likely to be in metropolitan areas, smaller towns and cities with large student population and coastal areas with significant population turnover and high levels of social deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.122W.0/3">The Electoral Commission found that under-registration and inaccuracy are closely associated with the social groups most likely to move home: young people, private sector tenants and BME residents were cited in particular.

	<p pid="a.129W.11/2">Policy on the Green Belt is currently set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 2, Green Belts (PPG2), published in 1995. PPG2 establishes a presumption against inappropriate development on Green Belt. If a proposal for such development is received, the local planning authority has to consider whether any harm to the Green Belt would be outweighed by other considerations, and whether very special circumstances exist to justify planning permission.</p>
	<p pid="a.129W.11/3">In the Coalition Agreement the Government stated that it will publish and present to Parliament a simple and consolidated national planning framework covering all forms of development. Announcements on the future of planning policy will be made in due course. However, the Agreement also undertakes to ensure that the protection of Green Belt by local planning authorities is maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.129W.11/4">Finally, I have already announced the Government's intention to rapidly abolish regional spatial strategies and return focus on planning and housing to local councils. Given that the regional spatial strategies have themselves been a source of 'top down' pressure to remove green belt protection their removal will strengthen the position of local authorities in protecting green belt.</p>

It will be for individual councils to make decisions about where savings are found. We have retained formula grant funding at the level approved by Parliament for 2010-11 (&#163;29 billion), and have also gone further by lifting restrictions on how local government spends its money, by de-ringfencing more grants. This gives councils the maximum flexibility to focus budgets on those services which local people most want to see.</p>

	<p pid="a.140W.8/1">The Secretary of State has not held any discussions directly with local authorities on the subject of one-to-one tuition. He has, however, confirmed that he will protect front-line spending for schools, and the &#163;256 million allocated to schools and local authorities for one-to-one tuition in 2010-11 is included within that category. The Department has handed &#163;47 million back to the Treasury as part of the Government's broader drive to secure public sector savings over the course of the financial year 2010-11. These savings have been made from centrally held funding for one-to-one tuition which had not yet been allocated and for which no spending plans had been announced.</p>
