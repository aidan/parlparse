	<p pid="a.1904W.8/1">The UK authorities do not produce official statistics of workers' remittances disaggregated on the basis of destination country. The breakdown of the size of immigrant communities in the UK provides one indicator on the destination of the bulk of remittance flows out of the UK. Estimates of the size of UK remittance market, can be found in the report of the UK Remittances Working Group<sup>(1)</sup>, established in 2004 by the Department for International Development (DFID). This shows that DFID believes the most reliable estimate for total remittances from the UK to developing countries to be &pound;2.3 billion in 2005 and that&mdash;based on the size of diaspora communities&mdash;the primary developing country recipients of UK remittances are India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Caribbean, Kenya, Nigeria and China.</p>

	<p pid="a.1907W.9/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1907W.9/2" class="italic"> Letter from Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1907W.9/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent question asking what estimate has been made of the total taxation paid by each income decile group in each year since 1997-98. I am replying in her absence. (115525).</p>
	<p pid="a.1907W.9/4" class="indent">Estimates of tax paid by each household income decile group are based on the ONS analysis 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household income'. The latest analysis for 2004/05 was published on the National Statistics website on 12th May 2006 at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. The analysis is based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS), which is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1907W.9/5" class="indent">The table below shows the average tax paid by households in each income decile group, both in per year, and as a percentage of gross household income. They have been calculated from the numbers appearing each year in Table 14 of the taxes and benefits analysis. Data has been provided back to 1997/98.</p>
	<p pid="a.1907W.9/6" class="indent">Gross income includes income from wages, occupational pensions, self-employment income, investment income, and income from state benefits, all before tax. Direct taxes include income tax, national insurance contributions and council tax. The indirect taxes include VAT, duties, and a number of smaller items such as television licences. Indirect taxes also include intermediate taxes - these are indirect taxes paid by companies which are deemed to be passed onto households through the prices they pay for goods and services. A more detailed breakdown showing each of the different taxes appears in the annual article.</p>
	<p pid="a.1907W.9/7" class="indent">There was a change in the way the figures were compiled in 2002/03 which will effect the estimated tax burden. Up until 2001/02, charges for water, environmental and sewage services were treated as local taxes, whereas from 2002/03 onwards they were excluded. The local tax category now just includes council tax and Northern Ireland rates, and in the annual article it is labelled as such. Based on figures for 2001/02, the effect of this definitional change is to reduce average household payment of local taxes/council tax from 3.0% of gross income to 2.2%. This obviously reduces the overall estimate of total tax as a percentage of gross income by 0.8%.</p>
	<p pid="a.1907W.9/8" class="indent">There was also a change to the way that tax credits were treated from 2003/04 onwards. Up until 2002/03 tax credits were treated as cash benefits. From 2003/04, they are classified as negative income tax, but only to the extent that income tax less tax credits, remains greater than or equal to zero for each family. So for households paying relatively little or no income tax, tax credit payments were still regarded either partially or wholly, as cash benefits. Based on figures for 2003/04, the effect of this change is to reduce the estimate of total tax as a percentage of gross income for all households by 0.3%.</p>
	<p pid="a.1907W.9/9" class="indent">The tax burden, when expressed as a proportion of gross income appears particularly high for the bottom income decile, although this result needs to be interpreted carefully. The apparently high tax burden is due to payment of indirect rather than direct taxes. Estimates of indirect taxes are imputed based on household expenditure. It should be remembered that measured expenditure will not necessarily balance with measured income for the year. This is especially true for the bottom income decile where average measured income is significantly lower than average expenditure. For these households, when their payment of indirect taxes (which reflect expenditure) are expressed as a proportion of gross income, the result is a high calculated tax burden.</p>
	<p pid="a.1907W.9/10" class="indent">There are a number of plausible reasons why for some households, expenditure might exceed income. Households with low incomes may draw on their savings or borrow in order to finance their expenditure. In addition, the lower decile in particular includes some groups, who have, or report, very little income (for example, self-employed people starting a business or someone who has just been made redundant). In these cases, expenditure is not being met from current income. Some types of receipts are not included as income in the EFS e.g. inheritance and severance payments. In some cases, the information given on expenditure is not consistent with that on income received because of timing differences.</p>

	<p pid="a.1914W.0/2">There has been no transfer of command of the International Security Assistance Force mission in Helmand province, which remains under UK command. The transfer of overall command of the International Security Assistance Force to a composite HQ under the command of a US general took place in February and the UK will assume command of the two-star headquarters in Regional Command South in May 2007. NATO remains committed to the ISAF mission, including providing the necessary security to allow the Afghan government to conduct counter-narcotic operations. Transfers of command such as these are routine and do not indicate a change in the approved ISAF mission or in relations with the Afghan authorities or with civilians, nor do they necessarily have any implications for the number of UK casualties.</p>

Only the second part has so far been released to the family; it was mistakenly assumed to have been the complete report. The first part of the board of inquiry, which is the main report that investigated the circumstances surrounding his death, is now being prepared for release in the normal way and will be released to Private Smith's family, their solicitor and Her Majesty's Coroner for Oxfordshire by early March.</p>

Once deployed, training is continued by language-proficient staff augmented by the Theatre Education Centre. Every soldier is also issued with a language card which is taught during pre-deployment training and is practised regularly by all in theatre. Education on the culture of an operational area is also provided during pre-deployment training. This is delivered through cultural awareness presentations to all troops. In addition, commanders and unit instructors are issued with cultural awareness material.</p>

	<p pid="a.1922W.3/1">The information requested has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1922W.3/2">The most common and internationally recognised threshold to measure poverty is income below 60 per cent. of median. We do not present information covering 40 per cent. of median income in our households below average income series as it is not a good measure of poverty. This is because for a number of those households with an income below this level, their incomes will not reflect their living standards. There are a number of reasons why these households' living standards tend to be higher than their incomes suggest, for example this low income may be a temporary phenomenon. In addition, it is widely recognised that there are difficulties in obtaining timely and accurate income information from self-employed people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1922W.3/3">We measure progress on child poverty using three indicators: absolute low income, relative low income and relative low income and material deprivation combined. This three tiered measure provides the right balance between clarity and comprehensiveness. In March 2005, UNICEF called the UK measure transparent, credible and not too complicated to be useful.</p>
	<p pid="a.1922W.3/4">Specific information regarding low income for Great Britain is available in &quot;Households Below Average Income 1994/95-2004/05&quot; (HBAI). This annual report, which is a National Statistics publication, includes the numbers and proportions of individuals, children, working age adults and pensioners with incomes below 50 per cent. 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median income, and the proportions in persistent poverty. The 60 per cent. median income level, before housing costs, is the internationally recognised threshold of low income.</p>
	<p pid="a.1922W.3/5">Our aim, to ensure that every child gets the best start in life and has the opportunity to fulfil their potential, is to halve child poverty by 2010 and eradicate it by 2020. This is the first time that any government has set itself such a goal. By setting these targets, we have ensured that we have made huge progress, and that we will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.1935W.5/1">No decisions have yet been made as to what our collection and recycling strategy for batteries should be, or what financial support will be offered in order to meet obligations under the EC directive on batteries and accumulators. This is a producer responsibility directive and we are discussing the implementation with the businesses likely to be affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1935W.5/2">We have asked the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to carry out work to determine the most cost effective way of collecting batteriesto meet the targets under the forthcoming directive.

	<p pid="a.1935W.5/3">Consultation on the implementation of the batteries directive is in the initial stages and discussions with interested parties are ongoing. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-10">10 January</phrase>, Defra and the Department of Trade and Industry jointly held a 'Futurefocus' event with 19 industry representatives to brainstorm initial ideas about the directive.

	<p pid="a.1938W.5/1">Under the rules set by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), new equity investments by CDC count as Official Development Assistance (ODA). However, the sale of investments counts as negative ODA. In 2005, CDC's purchase of equities of &pound;136.075 million was exceeded by the sale of investments which totalled -&pound;181.898 million. Other CDC figures included investments of &pound;9.428 million, principal repayments of &pound;0.134 million, administration costs of &pound;6.156 million, and debt relief under Naples Terms of &pound;18.221 million. This leaves a net sum of -&pound;11.884 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1938W.5/2">Due to market conditions, there will be occasions when the sale of investments is commercially the most appropriate strategy for CDC. This was the case in 2005, leading to this small negative ODA figure. Cash receipts are retained by CDC for subsequent re-investment in accordance with its agreed mission of investing in private sector enterprises in the poorer countries. These new investments will count towards ODA in future years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1939W.3/1">Cars in the Government Car and Despatch Agency fleet travelled approximately 2,394,200 miles in 2004-05 and 2,834,000 miles in 2005-06, the only years for which figures are available. Figures for earlier years could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1939W.3/2">These figures are for the entire car fleet operated by GCDA, including its short term hire and Green Car services. The increase in mileage in 2005-06 compared to 2004-05 mainly reflects increased use of GCDA's short term hire and Green Car services. Usage of the allocated car service for ministers and senior officials was broadly in line with the previous year.</p>

The Audit Committee has reviewed a number of VFM audit reports from the Internal Review Service which works in partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers. The most recently completed VFM studies were on agency staffing, the use of consultants and on cleaning services (phase II). The National Audit Office, the House's external auditors, produced a VFM study of the covered walkway in Star Chamber Court that was considered by the Audit Committee in March 2006.</p>

The Attorney-General has discussed the issue on a regular basis with the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland as part of the routine process of superintendence. He regularly meets with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in respect of his duties as a Criminal Justice Minister in Northern Ireland and the subject of &quot;On the Runs&quot; has arisen on a number of occasions.

	<p pid="a.1944W.3/2">The view of the Attorney-General has always been that the position of &quot;On the Runs&quot; can only be addressed by the prosecution process in a very limited way: by applying the usual test for prosecution to identify those cases where the evidential test is no longer met and, importantly, is no longer capable of being met. Given the serious nature of most of the offences concerned, the public interest is inevitably strongly in favour of prosecution. Political considerations play no part of that process.</p>

	<p pid="a.1945W.11/1">The Attorney-General has had discussions with the DPP about the Director's consideration of possible prosecutions arising out of the Stevens report as part of the normal processof superintendence. The Attorney-General has not discussed the Stevens report with the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.1945W.11/2">I have had no discussions with either the Director or Prime Minister regarding the Stevens report.</p>
	<p pid="a.1945W.11/3">There was no single Stevens report. The Stevens team provided to the Public Prosecution Service a vast amount of material in the form of statements and documentary exhibits&mdash;including lengthy transcripts of interview. This material was submitted over a period of time which reflected the progress of their inquiry. The material would be accompanied by a covering report. The last report was received on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-15">15 April 2003</phrase>. It was the task of the PPS to analyse all the material provided, not to merely consider a police report. The analysis included cross referencing to earlier material that resulted from the two previous Stevens investigations and, in particular, prosecutorial decisions based on those investigations. The advice of senior counsel was sought and the Stevens team were asked to carry out further work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1945W.11/4">The Attorney-General has not seen the Stevens reports or the evidence submitted. The PPS, with the assistance of counsel, prepared a number of detailed analyses of the evidence and underlying legal principles. The analyses alone filled 16 files which were contained in eight separate binders. They were received by the Attorney-General's Office on different dates between mid 2004 and mid 2005. It is the nature of superintendence that the Director will discuss with the Attorney-General cases of particular complexity or seriousness. The decisions remain those of the Director.</p>
	<p pid="a.1945W.11/5">A great deal of additional work has been carried out since, including further advices from (three) senior counsel. Decisions are close to being finalised.</p>

	<p pid="a.1947W.10/1">The Home Office monitors and evaluates neighbourhood policing nationally through a strategic research programme rather than measuring the performance of individual teams. Implementation is measured by repeat surveys of all forces and BCUs, and results are being compared with outcomes in the Police Performance Assessment Framework (PPAF). Outcomes which should be affected include crime and antisocial behaviour, feelings of safety and security, and satisfaction with and confidence in the police. An additional study is testing theimpact of neighbourhood policing at a BCU level, following the successful evaluation of the ward level National Reassurance Policing Programme. Surveys are being carried out in four Pathfinder BCUs each matched to a comparison site, to measure change in public perceptions and experiences. Results will be published in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1947W.10/2">The Home Office also continues to assess police performance through PPAF. The statutory performance indicators in PPAF on public confidence in the police (2a) and perception of antisocial behaviour (10b) measure the impact of neighbourhood policing. Finally, HMIC's baseline assessments also provide a qualitative measure of neighbourhood policing delivery.</p>

	<p pid="a.1950W.0/1">The UK Passport Service did not routinely collect information on the number of lost and stolen passports prior to 1999. Up until the introduction in December 2003 of a comprehensive system for the reporting and recording of lost and stolen passports, only the total number of these passports was recorded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1950W.0/2">The information shown in the table for 1999 to 2003 cannot therefore be broken down between the UK and abroad. Also it is mainly based on information contained in applications for replacement passports. It may not therefore show the true number of passports lost and stolen in these years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1950W.0/3">The 2004-06 figures are taken from the improved reporting and recording arrangements introduced in 2003. The figures relating to losses abroad are compiled from electronic reports received from Foreign and Commonwealth Office (F and CO) posts overseas. The increase in F and CO reports between 2004 and 2005 is a reflection of the phased implementation of the lost and stolen reporting arrangements at overseas posts.</p>

	<p pid="a.1950W.3/1">Reviews of the international literature by Sherman and Eck (2002) and Weisburd and Eck (2004) have found that there is a consistent body of strong evidence to support the targeting of police patrols to crime hotspots. Research shows that directed patrol is effective in reducing both crime, antisocial behaviour and calls for service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1950W.3/2">Recent Home Office research shows that foot patrol, as part of a neighbourhood policing strategy that includes problem-solving and community engagement, can deliver improvements in crime, perceptions of crime and antisocial behaviour, feelings of safety, and public confidence. Home Office Research from 2004 highlights the value of high visibility foot patrol targeted in robbery hotspots. The research site experienced a 16 per cent year-on-year reduction in street robbery.</p>

	<p pid="a.1951W.2/1">Doorstep contact in a recent literature review is described as door-to-door visits made by the police to residents with the purpose of seeking or giving out information. They are shown to reduce both crime and disorder.</p>
	<p pid="a.1951W.2/2">In delivering neighbourhood policing, door-knocking is one method of engaging communities to identify local priorities. On the Bletchley Estate in Thames Valley, the hotspots identified by local residents at community meetings are followed up by door knocking in those areas. The officers and PCSOs use door knocking to find out what the problems are in the hotspots in order to target their activity, and to invite people to street briefings. Home Office research from 2006 provides evidence in support of community engagement that goes beyond traditional public meetings and includes methods like door knocking. It showed that engagement was linked with improved public confidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.1952W.5/2">Two (of four) research reports have already been published on, respectively, the setting up of the pilots and the delivery of the process. The third and fourth reports on victim and offender satisfaction, and the impact of restorative justice on reconviction rates and cost-effectiveness are expected to be published this year. This research will inform the longer term strategy for adult restorative justice. In the meantime, we have created further legislative opportunities for the use of adult restorative justice, for example, through conditional cautions, which are currently being rolled out nationally. Best practice guidance for practitioners was published in December 2004 and this now forms the basis for National Occupational Standards, which are another building block towards for the further expansion of restorative justice.</p>

	<p pid="a.1955W.6/1">We have regular discussions with other Departments about ways in which Government can sensibly use the network. However, it is clear that people increasingly choose to access services in different ways&mdash;using direct debits, ATMs and the phone and internet. Government cannot ignore these changes and has to offer choice in how its services are accessed. Our proposals for the network will help it become more competitive in the future and better placed to win contracts on commercial terms including Government contracts.</p>

	<p pid="a.1962W.0/1">Data on Apprenticeships and Advanced Apprenticeships is collected on the Learning and Skills Council's Individualised Learner Record (ILR). The following table shows the number of learners having met all the requirements of their Apprenticeship framework in the Hendon parliamentary constituency (based on learner home postcode) in the latest three years for which data are available.</p>
	<table>

	</table>
	<p pid="a.1962W.0/11">These figures are based on the Learning and Skills Council's Individualised Learner Record and are consistent with figures underpinning the national success rates published in the National Statistics Publications: 'Further Education and Work Based Learning&mdash;Learner Outcomes in England: 2004/05' and 'Further Education and Work Based Learning&mdash;Learner Outcomes in England: 2003/04'. These showed the national success rate for complete frameworks in apprenticeships has improved from 27 per cent. in 2002/03 to 40 per cent. in 2004/05. Comparable official statistics for 2005/06 will be published in the Statistical First Release 'Further Education and Work Based Learning&mdash;Learner Outcomes in England: 2005/06' but latest management information suggests that there has been significant further improvement to around 53 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962W.0/12">A target has been set to increase the volume of completions to 75,500 in 2007/08. We are on target to meet that with 99,000 completions in 2005/06 based on latest management information.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962W.0/13">In order to successfully complete an apprenticeship the learner must achieve each element required by their particular framework; that would include an NVQ, Key Skills and any other required qualification.</p>

	<p pid="a.1963W.6/1">Trade unions offer an important opportunity for learners with literacy, language and numeracy skills to access the learning opportunities they need for sustainable employment and progression at work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1963W.6/2">Figures for the number of courses delivered at Trade union centres are not available. However, in 2005-06, &pound;16.9 million was available for unionlearn and Union Learning Fund activities. Funding supported over 107,000 learners to improve their skills. For that year, figures for the number of people undertaking ESOL courses are not available. However, we expect 3,245 learners to improve their English language skills through unionlearning funded activity in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.1963W.6/3">Minister of State Bill Rammell met with the TUC and union leaders as part of the Race Equality Impact Assessment process. The changes to ESOL funding include the withdrawal of automatic fee remission from ESOL courses, but learners who are in receipt of jobseeker's allowance and income related benefits will still be eligible for full fee remission. This includes low paid workers earning up to &pound;15,050 who are eligible for working tax credit. The Government will continue to support the cost of learning for those who are asked for a contribution and will fund around 62.5 per cent. of the course fee.</p>

Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of Standard Spending Assessment/Education Formula Spending (EFS) settlements and exclude the pensions transfer to EFS.<br/> 3. Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES Departmental Expenditure Limits relevant to pupils aged 3-10 and exclude Education Maintenance Allowances (EMAs) and grants not allocated at LEA level. For those authorities in receipt of advance of grant under the transitional support arrangements for 2004-05, advance grant funding is included in the year of payment (2004-05). There will be a consequential reduction in DfES grant for these LEAs in future years (either 2006-07 and 2007-08 or 2006-07 to 2008-09, depending on the terms on which the advance was given to the LEA).<br/> 4. The pupil numbers used to convert m figures to per pupil are those underlying the SSA/EFS settlement calculations plus PLASC 3 year old maintained pupils and estimated 3-4 year olds funded through state support in maintained and other educational institutions where these are not included in the SSA pupil numbers.<br/> 5. Rounding: Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br/> 6. 1997-98 figures for authorities subject to Local Government Reorganisation in that year have been estimated, pro-rata to their post LGR figures.<br/> 7. The introduction of the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) in 2006-07 means that consistent figures are not available for 2006-07 onwards.<br/> 8. The (DSG) fundamentally changed how Local Authorities are funded. Previously, authorities funding was based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. In 2006-07 funding for schools changed with the introduction of the DSG which is based largely on an authority's previous spending.<br/> 9. In addition, DSG has a different coverage to EFS: EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.1986W.6/1">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has planning and funding responsibility for all post-16 education and training other than higher education. The full details of their funding strategy for 2007/08 are explained in the LSC's Annual Statement of Priorities which was published in October 2006. The budget for English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) is expected to remain comparable in 2007/08.</p>
	<p pid="a.1986W.6/2">The demand for ESOL is expected to remain high with waiting lists continuing in many parts of the country. From September, additional ESOL for Work qualifications will be introduced; these will be flexible, more work-focused and aimed at meeting the immediate English language acquisition needs of learners who are in employment or who are intending to work in this country, but who do not intend to settle here.</p>

	<p pid="a.1994W.5/11">NHS dental activity is measured through units of dental activity, which are a weighted measure of the number of courses of treatment provided. The latest published information on primary care trust (PCT) dental commissioning shows that, as at <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase>, PCTs had commissioned services that will, over a full year, provide 78.6 million units of dental activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1994W.5/12">It is not possible to make a precise comparison with courses of treatment provided in previous years, but our best estimate is that the courses of treatment provided in 2005-06 would have equated to some76.7 million units of dental activity. It will not be possible to measure the full impact on access or levels of activity until all of these newly commissioned services are operational.</p>
	<p pid="a.1994W.5/13">It is too early to assess the impact of the dental reforms on inequalities in oral health. The main factors affecting oral health are exposure to fluoride, oral hygiene, and diet and nutrition. However, the new contracts are designed to allow more time for preventative advice. The new system of local commissioning also gives PCTs greater flexibility to match services to local needs. There are already several examples of PCTs that have set up new dental practices in areas of greater oral health need.</p>

It is for primary care trusts to work with providers of national health service dental services locally to review evidence from contract monitoring and from clinical governance activities that is relevant to patterns of treatment. The Information Centre for health and social care publishes periodic reports on dentists' earnings and expenses that will provide evidence on any general trends in the expenses incurred by NHS providers following the introduction of new dental contracts. The Department is considering with the other parties that give annual evidence on dental services to the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration what additional evidence could be produced on patterns of treatment and their impact on workload and expenses.</p>

	<p pid="a.2006W.2/1">Significant parts of the current National Blood Service (NBS) infrastructure are not adequate for modern processing and testing requirements. The NBS plans to modernise its estate by investing in three blood processing and testing facilities. These will be located in Filton in Bristol, Manchester and Colindale. This configuration provides a good geographical spread of activity, maximising productivity, while maintaining adequate contingency and flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.2006W.2/2">This will not impact on the local availability of products and services to patients. The NBS will maintain a network of local blood banks to ensure hospitals and patients continue to get the blood and blood components they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.2006W.2/3">The centre in Filton will be a new building and is currently being constructed, on schedule and to budget. It is expected to be fully operational in March 2009. An outline business case is being prepared for the development of the Colindale and Manchester centres. It is planned that the development of these centres will be completed by March 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.2008W.5/1">The national health service continues to respond to advances in medical technology and the rising expectations of patients. Improvements to services are wide ranging. Clinicians tell us that specialist care needs to be concentrated in centres of excellence. For example, specialist cancer surgery is now undertaken in cancer centres and a selection of hospitals have teams who can use angioplasty to unblock coronary arteries in patients suffering heart attack. The public also tell us that they want more services closer to their homes, where this is appropriate and safe. GPs are responding by providing a far wider range of treatments and services?including check ups which previously were often done in hospital outpatient appointments. The reports from the National Clinical Directors are their personal accounts as national clinical leaders of the reasons why services need to change.</p>
