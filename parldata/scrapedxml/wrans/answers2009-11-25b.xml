The aim of the project is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of casework handling between the police and the CPS. Teams will be mostly located in police stations. IPT is functional in 16 Boroughs (50 per cent.) across London. A further five boroughs have commenced the IPT implementation process. The remaining eleven Boroughs will co-locate during the period December 2009 to July 2010. The project includes provision for a post implementation review. The outcome from this review will enable the CPS to consider whether this London initiative has wider application across England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="b.132W.6/3">CCTV Cameras allow real-time traffic conditions to be monitored by the Highways Agency's National and Regional Traffic Control Centres, enabling an efficient response to be made to incidents.

	<p pid="b.132W.6/4">Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras link to a system which converts and anonymises number plates to 'tag' codes for each passing vehicle at each camera location. The 'tag' codes are then used to calculate traffic flows and speed between camera locations in order to inform our understanding of network performance.</p>
	<p pid="b.132W.6/5">Average speed cameras are positioned temporarily at major roadwork sites to improve safety for road users and the workforce on the motorway. The cameras monitor vehicle speed between two points and check the average speed compliance with the speed limit.</p>

	<p pid="b.133W.8/2">The Department for Transport is currently consulting on amendments to Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 (TSRGD) which include the mandatory use of both imperial and metric units on road signs warning of or imposing height restrictions. These signs are currently prescribed in TSRGD but the use of dual-unit signing is discretionary.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.8/3">The consultation document is on the Department's website at the following address and the consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-24">24 December 2009</phrase>:</p>

	<p pid="b.133W.8/5">Evidence presented by Network Rail suggests that 10-12 per cent. of bridge strikes involved foreign lorries and this is disproportionately high. Current policy has also been informed by a 2004 TRL research report 'Measures to Reduce the Frequency of Over-Height Vehicles Striking Bridges: Final Report', which covers signing issues. The report is on the Department's website at the following address:</p>

	<p pid="b.133W.8/7">The consultation proposals are intended to help reduce the risk of bridge strikes by foreign lorry drivers who may misunderstand imperial-only measurements.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.8/8">There are no centrally-held records on the nature of traffic signs placed for all locations where vehicles have struck bridges.</p>

	<p pid="b.140W.10/1">No additional revenues would be raised. Companies capital gains are charged to corporation tax as part of their total profits, at the same rate as any income profits. Consequently companies' chargeable gains are already taxed at the relevant rate of corporation tax for 2009-10. It is highly probable that there would be a fall in net receipts once account is taken of any accumulated capital losses which are currently only given relief against future capital gains, rather than income.</p>

	<p pid="b.149W.8/3">Food and Incidental Allowance is paid at a daily rate of &#163;12.78 (&#163;383.40 per month, pro rata). This is paid to assist single and unaccompanied Service personnel in the UK to meet the necessary costs of food and incidental expenses when they are without access to Service accommodation/messing facilities, but have self-catering facilities, and does not require submission of receipts.</p>
	<p pid="b.149W.8/4">Recruitment and Retention Allowance (London) is paid at a daily rate &#163;3.76 for all Service Personnel who work within five miles of the statue of King Charles I at Charing Cross. This is paid to counter reluctance to serve in designated London locations by contributing to the higher costs encountered during a permanent assignment in London and by compensating for the reduced quality of the supporting infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.149W.8/5">Get You Home Travel, the rate of which is determined by the distance from a family home and the place of duty. The minimum amount payable is &#163;1.07, commencing at 20 miles, and the maximum amount payable is &#163;13.39 per day. The latter represents a family home being 530 miles away from a place of duty. It is paid to support the mobile nature of the Services and improve retention by reducing the financial impact of separation on Service personnel.</p>
	<p pid="b.149W.8/6">Home to Duty (Public) is paid to those eligible service Personnel who reside in Forces Family Accommodation, to assist with the daily cost of travel between their home and place of duty. In certain circumstances, Service personnel in receipt of Get You Home Travel will not be eligible for concurrent payment of Home to Duty (Public). Dependant on the distance and method of travel used the following maximum rates are payable:</p>

	<p pid="b.149W.8/29">Most allowances are payable on qualifying criteria other than rank held. The status of 'staff officer' has a number of different meanings and could be applied to a specific appointment undertaken by a Junior Military Officer or those officers of starred rank. As a result it would be difficult to obtain information on recipients of 'staff officer' status, as it would require the application of varied parameters to a number of different searches which could be provided only at disproportionate cost. All of these allowances are applicable to commissioned and non-commissioned personnel.</p>

	<p pid="b.151W.0/1">All of the protective personal equipment provided to armed forces personnel is constantly under review. The Osprey body armour systems are considered to be among the best in the world, and the survival rates are testimony to that. However, a direct by-product of that is that personnel are now surviving with other associated and sometimes life-changing injuries. We are continually seeking ways to further protect our personnel, and work is well under way to research ways of providing additional protection including for the whole perineal area.</p>

	<p pid="b.151W.3/1">The Defence Medical Services (DMS) provide an extensive range of medical treatment and wider support for wounded Service personnel. Since 2001 we have made numerous clinical and administrative improvements to the treatment that we provide, all of which are intended to improve the quality of care that our wounded personnel receive. Where these are a consequence of operational requirements, they have been funded from the Reserve (Conflict Prevention Fund). The Government have also funded many improvements from within the Defence budget, such as &#163;24 million of additional funding over four years for the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC), Headley Court, announced in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.151W.3/2">For personnel on operations, the care starts in the operational theatre, with life-saving medical treatment on the frontline and in our field hospitals. Those who need further specialist care back in the UK are normally returned to the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine at Birmingham's Selly Oak Hospital, which is at the leading edge in the treatment of multiple trauma injuries as commonly sustained by our battle casualties, and has since 2006 had a military-managed ward.</p>
	<p pid="b.151W.3/3">If patients require further rehabilitation care they may be referred to Headley Court, or for outpatient treatment at one of MOD's 15 military Regional Rehabilitation Units. We also provide mental healthcare for those who need it, primarily through our 15 military out-patient Departments of Community Mental Health across the UK (plus centres overseas); in-patient care is arranged for those who need it.</p>
	<p pid="b.151W.3/4">Wider support to those who are injured is overseen by a Welfare Coordinator, who will work with appropriate specialists to offer support and advice in such areas as housing, access to services and counselling if required, as well as providing support through key transition points, such as a move to or from Headley Court.</p>
	<p pid="b.151W.3/5">Medical policy for the DMS is overseen by the Surgeon General's Department. However, the organisational structure of the DMS means that comprehensive budgetary planning information on medical care could be provided only at disproportionate cost as substantial elements are disaggregated and embedded in the budgets of the single Services, individual military units, and overall operational budgets.</p>

	<p pid="b.154W.2/1">The European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) aims to address shortfalls in military strategic air transport capability, for example through the pooling of aircraft or shared procurement. The UK will indirectly benefit from the improved aircraft availability across Europe for support to operations through increased burden sharing. The UK procures military aircraft according to our national requirements and does not have spare capacity to contribute to the EATF. Therefore, we do not currently plan to participate in the programme. As such we have not carried out any detailed assessments of the potential wider benefits to the UK. We will continue to monitor the EATF programme and keep our position under review.</p>

	<p pid="b.154W.8/1">There are two principal European initiatives on naval interoperability, the European Amphibious Initiative (EAI) and the European Carrier Group Interoperability Initiative (ECGII). Both initiatives seek to enhance European interoperability and capability in Amphibious and Carrier Strike Group operations respectively through greater cooperation and combined training and exercising at both the tactical and operational level. The main objective of these initiatives is that, by working more closely together in peacetime, it will allow for a more rapid and effective deployment of a multinational Amphibious or Carrier Strike Group force, when required, in the framework of NATO or EU-led operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.154W.8/2">As a permanent member, along with France, Italy, Netherlands and Spain, and with its well developed and balanced Amphibious forces, the UK plays an important part in the EAI. The UK provides the Permanent Secretariat and in 2010 will assume the chair, which is rotated on an annual basis between its members.</p>
	<p pid="b.154W.8/3">The UK, as a lead nation in operating Vertical and Short Take Off aircraft (VSTOL) from the sea, also plays an important role in the ECGII as one of its permanent members, along with Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.</p>

In the face of insecurity and threats to its 160,000 staff across Afghanistan, it enabled millions of Afghans to come out and make their voice heard in choosing the future leadership of their country. While there were minor complaints about the quality of some of the materials it used, such as the hole punches to mark the voter cards, the operation overall was well resourced. The UK contributed &#163;16.5 million to the UN basket fund for elections, which included recourses and capacity building for the IEC.</p>
	<p pid="b.164W.8/2">Clearly there are lessons to be learned for future elections. But the processes in place provided for an independent audit of the results that came through the IEC. The audit process, conducted by the Electoral Complaints Commission, in co-operation with the IEC following election day on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-20">20 August</phrase>, was robust and transparent: flaws in the process were reported, investigated and decided on, and fraudulent ballots removed.

	<p pid="b.165W.2/1">We have not received any reports on the levels of human trafficking in Somalia. The extremely fragile security situation in Somalia means that the UK does not have any presence on the ground with which to monitor issues such as human trafficking. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has not held discussions with his Somali counterpart on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.165W.2/2">The February 2009 report of the UN Independent Expert on Human Rights in Somalia identified human trafficking, along with many other human rights issues and criminal acts, as an important challenge to be addressed. The report recommends that the Transitional Federal Government make human rights the foundation of its transitional period and that the UN address the root causes of smuggling and trafficking of people across the Gulf of Aden. The UK works closely with the UN Political Office for Somalia to progress the UN-led Djibouti peace agreement.</p>

	<p pid="b.174W.2/1">Information about English local housing authorities' actions under the homelessness legislation (Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected at local authority level, and published by the Department in the quarterly Statistical Release on Statutory Homelessness, available both in the Library and via the CLG website:</p>

	<p pid="b.174W.2/3">Data collected includes the number of households accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty (to secure that suitable accommodation is available). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available, and this information is also collected.</p>
	<p pid="b.174W.2/4">The regional figures for the number of applicants accepted as owed a main duty and the number of households in temporary accommodation, for each financial year since 1998-99 can be found in Tables 3 and 7 of the latest Statistical Release. The equivalent 1997-98 figures can be found in earlier additions of the Release, accessible from this link:</p>

West Sussex comprises of the following local authorities: Adur, Arun, Chichester, Crawley, Horsham, Mid-Sussex, and Worthing.</p>

	<p pid="b.183W.11/1">The Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS) assesses 29 categories of housing hazards, such as excess cold, electrical hazards, falls, fire, explosions etc. It applies to all residential property regardless of tenure. If a local authority considers that there is a serious (Category 1) hazard, it has a duty to take the most appropriate action.</p>
	<p pid="b.183W.11/2">As far as assessing the risk from fire is concerned, the lack of smoke detectors and or heat detectors, or defective smoke detectors and or heat detectors with alarms are considered relevant matters in an HHSRS assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.183W.11/3">In 2001 the Department issued guidance to all local authority housing directors emphasising the importance the government attaches to encouraging the wider provision of smoke alarms in domestic properties.</p>
	<p pid="b.183W.11/4">More broadly, it has been our policy for some time that smoke alarms have a vital role to play in saving lives as they provide the vital early warning of fire and therefore help people to escape. Since 1987, the Government have conducted high profile national and regional television campaigns promoting smoke alarms which have proved very successful. Ownership has increased from 9 per cent. in 1987 to the current level of 80 pert cent. and we are seeking to raise it further as evidence suggests that those without alarms are often in those groups who are most at risk from fire. The Government are currently running a national media advertisement to promote smoke alarms ownership and maintenance messages.</p>

	<p pid="b.184W.6/1">One of the aims of the Government's Sexual Health and HIV Strategy for England is to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies. The standard national health service contract for 2009-10 includes a new clause to ensure that abortion providers improve access to the full range of contraception for women undergoing abortion. A specification for abortion services is currently being developed to support implementation of this new requirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.6/2">The Department has invested &#163;20.5 million in 2009-10 to improve access to contraception to improve all women's knowledge of, and access to the full range of contraception and help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, abortion and repeat abortions. This includes &#163;7 million for a &quot;contraceptive choices&quot; media campaign and a further &#163;10 million to strategic health authorities (SHAs) for local action.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.6/3">Primary care trusts and SHAs were asked to use their funding to improve access to all contraceptive methods to reduce teenage conception, abortion and repeat abortion rates, particularly in areas where teenage pregnancy rates were high. We are actively working with the SHAs to monitor additional spend and share best practice.</p>

	<p pid="b.194W.3/1">While we have made no formal assessment, we consider that it is unlikely the scheme has made any significant impact on the availability of other drugs used to treat multiple sclerosis. The drugs included in the scheme are used within criteria developed by the Association of British Neurologists. The national health service is obliged to fund other drugs approved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) within the terms of the appraisal guidance. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is the only other licensed medicine which has an impact on the course of the disease and has been recommended by NICE for use in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="b.194W.3/4">We estimate that the costs incurred since the scheme's inception are in the order of &#163;350 million. This figure is made up of &#163;200,000 a year representing the Department's 20 per cent. share of running the contract; an average &#163;35,000 a year to meet the MS Trust's administration costs for the scheme and drug costs of around &#163;50 million a year.</p>

	<p pid="b.196W.5/2">The size, and hence speed, of the N3 network connection is adjustable to take into account the systems and services used, and the number of staff employed, at any given national health service location. To exemplify the range of speeds delivered, large acute hospital sites are typically connected to N3 by 100 megabits per second (mbps) Ethernet services. General practitioner practice sites might receive as much as eight mbps, though typically rather less depending, among other factors, on distance from the telephone exchange.</p>

	<p pid="b.210W.2/41">The Home Office adopts a variety of mechanisms by which to determine the allocation to each local authority. In relation to grants, there are the following mechanisms:</p>
	<p pid="b.210W.2/42" class="indent">Formula based (e.g. Safer Stronger Communities Fund)-each local authority has a pre-determined allocation based upon a formula that ensures a commensurate allocation throughout the country</p>
	<p pid="b.210W.2/43" class="indent">Bid based-all local authorities are entitled to bid for funding as per the business plan that they provide. These bids are then considered, and assessed against criteria such as value for money and allocations determined accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="b.210W.2/44" class="indent">Funding pot availability-a specific maximum amount per grant is set, and each local authority may submit a bid within that maximum ceiling.</p>
	<p pid="b.210W.2/45" class="indent">Fixed rate basis (e.g. UASC-Unaccompanied Asylum Seekers Children)-the grant payable to local authorities is on a fixed rate (e.g. per UASC per night), with many authorities having different grant rates, according to their numbers of UASC and individual circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.210W.2/46" class="indent">Fixed rate once specified thresholds exceeded (e.g. Leaving Care grant)-paid to local authorities, at a rate of &#163;100 per week per former UASC aged over 18, after the first 25 cases have been discounted.</p>

	<p pid="b.213W.6/1">There are no official private policing services. Communities should have the confidence that the police will be there for them when they need it. Public confidence that the police and local council are dealing with the crime and antisocial behaviour that matters locally is improving (from 45 per cent in March 2008 to 50 per cent in the latest figures to June 2009).</p>
	<p pid="b.213W.6/2">In December 2008 we introduced the Policing Pledge in England and Wales which sets out the minimum standards of service that the public can expect to receive from the police including for response times, visibility, and access. We have also invested heavily to ensure that all neighbourhoods now have a dedicated and named Neighbourhood Policing team.</p>
	<p pid="b.213W.6/3">It is up to the public and local authorities to decide if they wish to spend money on private security. Private security guards have no more powers than any other citizen except when they are accredited under Community Safety Accreditation Schemes (CSAS). CSAS is a scheme which allows Chief Officers to designate limited powers to employees of organisations which contribute towards community safety and tackling antisocial behaviour (ASB) such as park wardens, train operators and private security guards. These powers enhance the contribution of people in roles that are already concerned with keeping communities safe, and mean that there are more people on the streets with powers to tackle and not tolerate ASB.</p>

	<p pid="b.222W.5/2">In June 2009 Ofsted carried out a further inspection of Haringey's safeguarding services to assess progress following the joint area review (JAR) report of December 2008. Ofsted's subsequent report made clear that the leadership and management team in Haringey had made progress in a number of important areas, but it highlighted issues relating to front line practice that needed prioritising. The Secretary of State met with the leadership of the council to discuss the report and subsequently wrote to the council on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-03">3 July</phrase>. In his letter to the council, he made clear that Haringey must prioritise improving standards of front-line practice and supervision and that Haringey's plans must be kept under vigilant review with progress accelerated to keep children safe. He explained that Peter Lewis' monthly reports, alongside the rigorous monitoring the Department has put in place and the independent scrutiny of the LSCB, would be used to ensure that all partners keep focused on the priorities identified in Ofsted's report. He has asked Ofsted to conduct a further progress inspection before the end of January 2010, at which point he will decide whether any further action is needed to keep children safe in Haringey.</p>

	<p pid="b.228W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) produced an analysis of the role of skills in economic growth in 2008. This drew attention to the gender differences in the complex relationship between levels of education and skills and economic growth. More evidence at a country level is needed in this area, but this initial work suggested that the rates of return for higher levels of female education were particularly significant to economic growth. The World Bank found that every 1 per cent. increase in the level of women's education generates an additional 3 per cent. in economic growth. Importantly, failure to achieve gender parity at post-primary levels could be a bottle neck in the growth of the economies of our partner countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.228W.2/2">DFID currently funds a five-year research programme co-ordinated by the University of Cambridge worth &#163;2.5 million which is currently undertaking analysis of the different rates of return on various levels of education which includes looking at gender differences.</p>

	<p pid="b.228W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is committed to achieving the millennium development goals (MDGs) for universal primary education and gender parity by 2015. DFID is spending at least &#163;8.5 billion between 2006 and 2015 in support of education in developing countries. Through this long-term commitment we are supporting poor countries to invest in quality basic education, including lower secondary, to ensure that all girls and boys attain the fundamental skills they need to participate in social and economic life.</p>
	<p pid="b.228W.5/2">For example, DFID is currently helping the Government of India to prepare its plans for expanding enrolments at secondary education from 53 per cent. to 70 per cent. over the next three years. The majority of these gains in enrolment will be girls. A raft of interventions are proposed for achieving this, including girls' scholarships and bursaries, free uniforms, textbooks and bicycles for girls as well as free hostels and residential schools for the poorest girls. Attention to equity, particularly in terms of eliminating gender disparities is now a key part of DFID policy dialogue on and support for the development of secondary education in India.</p>

	<p pid="b.237W.3/1">The National Offender Management Service has not mandated how body orifice security scanner (BOSS) chairs must be used and currently has no plans to do so. As is the case for many searching technologies and techniques, the decision on how to use the BOSS chairs is for individual governors to make, and will depend on their local circumstances, including their existing local searching strategies. The relevant Prison Service Instruction says:</p>
	<p pid="b.237W.3/2" class="indent">'The frequency of searches using the BOSS and policies for its use are for local discretion'</p>
	<p pid="b.237W.3/3">and makes it clear that this can include using the BOSS chair to search staff and visitors. Searching strategies and levels of searches are based on a number of factors, including local resources and intelligence. The recently published Mobile Phones Good Practice Guide also provides specific advice on tackling the smuggling of mobile phones by staff and visitors.</p>

These incidents are in a format that cannot readily be interrogated electronically. To provide the information requested would involve the manual inspection of more than 100,000 incident records which could be achieved only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.237W.6/2">NOMS has in place a strategy to reduce both the supply and the demand for alcohol with a comprehensive range of security measures and searching techniques to detect items of contraband, including alcohol, and prevent smuggling into establishments. It is a criminal offence to convey alcohol into prison and prisoners caught in possession of alcohol within prison will face disciplinary action. Alcohol consumption is a cause of criminality in society and many prisons have programmes in place to assist prisoners to lessen their dependence on alcohol.</p>

	<p pid="b.242W.2/1">Formerly prisons were ranked on their performance in the prisons weighted scorecard. However, this formed only one element of the final ratings for prisons. A new prison rating system was introduced for 2009-10, but the version used to produce the ratings for Quarter 1 did not lend itself to the production of a performance table. The system has been refined and will produce for internal use by NOMS prison rankings as part of the package when Quarter 2 ratings are published.</p>
	<p pid="b.242W.2/2">The new system produces initial quarterly assessments based on available data. Additional factors such as escapes and recent inspection results are then taken into account in the final ratings by an independent external moderation panel which includes a non-executive representative and is chaired by the Director of Criminal Justice Group in the Department. For this reason the final quarterly ratings published by the Department may differ from the data-driven rankings produced by NOMS.</p>

	<p pid="b.244W.5/1">Management information on the multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) is published in local area MAPPA annual reports. The MAPPA Annual Reports have included in each of the last five years the number of offenders managed at MAPPA levels 2 and 3 who have been charged with serious further offences. Areas have not so far been asked to report on charges of serious offending against MAPPA level 1 offenders, so the data requested is unavailable.</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.5/2">The purpose of the MAPPA annual reports is to show what multi-agency intervention and resources bring to local public protection arrangements. The focus of the information in the annual reports, therefore, has been upon the offenders managed at level 2 and 3 rather than at level 1, where offenders are managed through ordinary agency management.</p>
	<p pid="b.244W.5/3">However, in order to provide data on the whole offender population eligible for multi-agency management and resources, since April 2009 all areas have been required to record instances of offenders managed at level 1 of MAPPA who are charged with serious further offences (as well as those managed at levels 2 and 3), with a view to inclusion in next year's annual reports.</p>

	<p pid="b.245W.2/1">VAT is payable only on the places commissioned by the youth justice board in secure training centres and private sector young offender institutions. VAT is not payable on the places in secure children's homes or public sector young offender institutions. Therefore, VAT is excluded from these figures in order to provide a valid comparison between sectors.</p>
