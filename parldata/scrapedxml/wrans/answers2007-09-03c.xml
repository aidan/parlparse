	<p pid="c.1586W.2/1">The UN Secretary-General reports to the Security Council on a quarterly basis on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1701. The last two reports, produced in March and June, cover the period of the last six months. The UK continues to support full implementation of UNSCR 1701 and is working with the Governments of Lebanon and Israel towards this.</p>
	<p pid="c.1586W.2/2">In these reports the Secretary-General reported that Israel has continued regular overflights of Lebanese territory with both manned and unmanned aircraft. The number of these overflights reduced in early 2007, but has risen again recently. These flights occur on an almost daily basis with up to 32 overflights occurring on some days.</p>
	<p pid="c.1586W.2/3">The Secretary-General also reported several breaches of the Blue Line that separates Israel and Lebanon. The most serious of these occurred in February when Israeli and Lebanese forces exchanged fire across the Blue Line during an Israeli incursion into Lebanon. Another incursion occurred on <phrase class="date" code="">28 May</phrase> when Israeli vehicles also moved 60 metres into Lebanon. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) claim that this incursion was unintentional. Nevertheless there has been some progress on co-operation between the IDF, the UN Interim Force in Lebanon and the Lebanese army through the tripartite mechanism. This co-operation is aimed at minimising breaches of the Blue Line.</p>
	<p pid="c.1586W.2/4">The reports do not record in detail instances of IDF activity in the Sheba'a farms area. The IDF did arrest some hunters who had strayed into this area, although they were subsequently released.</p>

	<p pid="c.1589W.9/1">During the period July 2006 to July 2007 DFID recorded spend of &pound;64,367 on newspapers and magazines. This includes the costs of subscriptions centrally funded in our Headquarters offices. Within DFID, individual departments and overseas offices may on occasion subscribe to relevant publications. To identify all non-centrally funded costs within our current systems would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.1591W.0/1">DFID has not made its own assessments of the management of oil revenues or the extent of corruption within the oil sector. It relies on the assessment of the IMF and World Bank, for reasons of efficiency and the avoidance of duplication. Their latest assessment of progress in improving oil sector governance and reducing corruption indicates progress on increasing transparency has been slow. The World Bank is providing technical assistance to ensure that there are no capacity constraints preventing the Congolese authorities from implementing the necessary transparency reforms.</p>
	<p pid="c.1591W.0/2">The UK discusses governance issues and the need for increased transparency in the oil sector with the Congolese government in conjunction with European partners and through the World Bank and IMF. The IMF missions to Brazzaville (October 2006 and May 2007) met with the President, Prime Minister, Planning and Finance Ministers, Central Bank Director and other senior officials, representatives of the donor community and civil society. We continue to urge for greater political support for improvements in accountability, and have argued strongly that oil revenue windfalls should be directed to activities which support poverty reduction.</p>

	<p pid="c.1601W.2/18">The amounts paid to agencies for temporary staff are inclusive of their service charges and the salary costs of the staff supplied.</p>
	<p pid="c.1601W.2/19">The significant increase in the level of fees paid to agencies in the last two years is largely attributed to the need to bring in additional resources quickly to staff up the Department's team working on the Olympics 2012 programme following London's successful bid. Now that permanent staff have been recruited or transferred into the team, agencies fees are expected to fall back to levels paid previously in the years prior to 2005-06.</p>

The same principles apply to medical examinations regardless of the specific status and location of the detainee.</p>
	<p pid="c.1607W.2/2">Military doctors charged with the medical care of prisoners and detainees are required to follow MOD policy directives based on medical ethics as advised by the General Medical Council, UK law and, where relevant, United Nations declarations and international law, including the Geneva Conventions. Initial military training courses for Service doctors cover the medical support to be provided to persons detained by UK forces whilst deployed on operations.</p>

As a result no pelts have been purchased in recent years by the contractors who make the caps for the Department. Previously, when pelts have been purchased, they have been bought from regulated fur traders operating under the jurisdiction of the Canadian authorities.</p>

These are currently being assessed against the requirement in terms of both quantity and quality. The Progress Catalogue, due to be published in November, will make clear whether the offered forces are sufficient to meet the requirement and, if there are any deficiencies, will provide an assessment of the military risks associated with them, and the potential impact on the EU's ability to achieve its level of ambition.</p>

	<p pid="c.1631W.0/1">No specific research has been commissioned into these techniques and none is needed. The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate licence conditions for the Atomic Weapons Establishment demand that appropriate safety cases are generated as a matter of routine in the evaluation of risk. Deterministic and probabilistic risk assessments are tools employed in defining and ranking the postulated hazards. The use of such risk assessment techniques is considered best practice within the nuclear industry. Their use by AWE plc is regularly benchmarked against&mdash;and compares favourably with&mdash;other nuclear operators.</p>

	<p pid="c.1636W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Steve Bundred<i> , </i> dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-26">26 July 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.1636W.2/3" class="indent">I am writing in response to your parliamentary question asking why the Audit Commission decided to change the indicators used to assess comprehensive performance assessments prior to their replacement with comprehensive area assessments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1636W.2/4" class="indent">The Commission published a consultation document on the framework for CPA 2007 in April this year. In this document a small number of changes were proposed to the performance indicators used in the Audit Commission service assessments for housing, environment and culture, to ensure that CPA remained relevant and continued to drive improvements in public services. The proposals included supplementing the existing set of indicators with four newly available indicators that measure outcomes recognisable by local residents or vulnerable people. It was also proposed to remove four indicators (where there are issues with data availability, data quality or national consistency) and replace three indicators with more meaningful measures of performance. These represent only a small proportion of the total number of indicators; in 2006 there were 31 indicators included in the environment service assessment, 20 in housing and 18 in culture.</p>
	<p pid="c.1636W.2/5" class="indent">The majority of consultation responses expressed a strong desire for stability in the CPA framework and the Commission considered these at its meeting this morning. We will be publishing a document within the next few weeks setting out our final decisions and explaining the reasons for them. I am able to confirm at this stage, however, that a number of the changes proposed in our consultation document will not now go ahead.</p>
	<p pid="c.1636W.2/6" class="indent">It is worth noting that the Commission is also considering the framework and transitional arrangements that it puts in place for 2008, as this is the last year they will carry out assessments under the CPA methodology. The new CAA framework is due to be in place from April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.1636W.2/7" class="indent">A copy of this letter will be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.1640W.9/1">The distribution of formula grant to local authorities in England takes account of the circumstances of each authority's area and its relative ability to pay council tax, expressed in terms of the council tax base. The calculation of a council's tax base takes into account the Band D-equivalent number of second homes and has done so since council tax was introduced in 1993. Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, although billing authorities have been able to reduce the council discount for second homes in their area (to between 10 and 50 per cent.), a discount of 50 per cent. has continued to be assumed for all authorities in calculating the tax base for the purposes of distributing formula grant.</p>
	<p pid="c.1640W.9/2">Other things being equal, the smaller the council tax base of a council's area, the larger its formula grant. This effect has, however, been modified in recent years by the application of grant 'floors', which guarantee a minimum percentage increase in grant each year on a like-for-like basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.1640W.9/3">For this reason, and because formula grant is not hypothecated&mdash;i.e. it can be used for any purpose&mdash;it is not possible to calculate an amount of formula grant payable for second homes.</p>

	<p pid="c.1642W.9/6">The Task Force published its second report in March 2007, and in response, we removed the requirement for local authorities to report on a further seven BVPIs or parts of BVPIs. We are considering further recommendations from both reports in the context of the new performance framework for local government and the national indicator set which will underpin it, to be introduced from April 2008.</p>

The Secretary of State may therefore only issue a direction under clause 2 from after the enactment and commencement of Part 1 of the Bill (likely to be November 2007) up until <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-25">25 January 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1646W.3/10">As to the future use of sunset clauses, the appropriateness of a sunset clause for the whole or part of any proposed legislation is considered on a case by case basis. It is also addressed when a regulatory impact assessment relating to legislation is being prepared.</p>

	<p pid="c.1650W.12/1">This information requested is not held centrally. However almost all housing development in London takes place on brownfield land (97 per cent. in 2005). Also, the stock of available brownfield land is not static as new sites are coming forward for development all the time. Historically, studies to provide a comprehensive technical analysis of London's potential for future housing growth have been the responsibility of the Mayor of London, or predecessor body, and the boroughs. Regular studies have been undertaken, namely London's Housing Capacity (Greater London Authority, September 2000) and the 2004 London Housing Capacity Study (GLA, July 2005). As a result, housing targets for London have recently been increased, from 23,000 homes per year to 2006-07, to 30,500 homes per year from 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="c.1653W.8/1">Regional Civil Contingencies Committees (RCCCs) are designed to be implemented in the case when an incident(s) within a Government Office region requires co-ordination at regional level. During the June flooding incidents, this was not necessary as the Strategic Co-ordination Groups within the regions managed the events locally.</p>
	<p pid="c.1653W.8/2">During the recent flooding in Gloucester, the Government Office for the South West (GOSW) set up two meetings of the RCCC on 23 and <phrase class="date" code="">24 July</phrase>. Both provided a useful opportunity for high-level, regional partners to hear about the flooding situation at first hand, to discuss resourcing issues and mutual aid, and to consider consequence management and longer term issues relating to recovery.</p>
	<p pid="c.1653W.8/3">As the situation in Gloucestershire has become less critical, it has been agreed to stand down the RCCC, but with the option of reconvening it should the situation change. Meanwhile, RCCC members are being kept closely in touch with developments by e-mail, and considering ways of supporting the Strategic Co-ordination Group with preparatory work on recovery.</p>
	<p pid="c.1653W.8/4">The effectiveness of the RCCC mechanism during the flooding will be assessed by the independently-led committee that will consider, more broadly, issues identified from these events.</p>

	<p pid="c.1656W.11/3">Information reported each quarter includes the number of households accepted by local authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty. The duty owed to an accepted household is to secure suitable accommodation. If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority may secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1656W.11/4">This data is published in our quarterly statistical release on statutory homelessness, which includes a supplementary table showing the breakdown of key data, including acceptances and temporary accommodation, by each local authority, including Leeds, Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees and Wakefield. This is published on our website and placed in the Library each quarter. The latest release was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-11">11 June 2007</phrase> and contains data for the period January to March 2007:</p>

	<p pid="c.1662W.0/8" class="indent">&quot;to ensure the public has as much access as possible to information on the risk of flooding to allow them to take appropriate precautions, be adequately informed on developments as an emergency unfolds, and be looked after properly in the immediate aftermath.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.1663W.0/1">The Government offer housing assistance to key workers under the Key Worker Living (KWL) scheme in areas experiencing severe recruitment and retention difficulties. Key Worker Living funding is divided between Open Market HomeBuy (equity loans to purchase properties on the open market) and new build products such as New Build HomeBuy (shared ownership of newly built homes) and intermediate rent (newly built homes where the rent is set at a level between that charged by social and private landlords).</p>
	<p pid="c.1663W.0/2">The number of newly built homes only available for, and sold or let to, key workers in London since the launch of KWL in 2004 is provided in the following table. We do not have the figures requested on an annual basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.1663W.0/3">The table shows that, of the units that had not been sold or let, 58 were under offer from key workers, 608 had been marketed to key workers for less than three months and 170 had been marketed to key workers for between three and six months. It normally takes between three and six months to market and sell a unit. So to date, 67 per cent. of new build homes only available to key workers under Key Worker Living have been sold or let to key workers.</p>

	<p pid="c.1663W.0/14">Since the introduction of the New Build HomeBuy product in April 2006, we no longer fund specific key worker only schemes. Instead key workers access our New Build HomeBuy programme as a priority group alongside other priorities such as social tenants. Any key worker specific schemes yet to complete will have been funded under old shared ownership programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1663W.0/15">In addition to the numbers in the table above, we have helped 4,982 key workers in London through our KWL Open Market HomeBuy scheme and 4,168 key workers in London through the Starter Home Initiative (SHI). SHI was the predecessor to KWL and ran from 2001-2004. The majority of SHI completions were as Open Market HomeBuy, with a small number of newly built units that were grant funded via an equity loan for the purchaser.</p>
	<p pid="c.1663W.0/16">Since the launch of KWL the Housing Corporation has been collecting data on when the construction of a scheme has been completed and when the final unit has been occupied. The purpose of this data is to actively manage the portfolio of new build properties and take action to prevent long term voids&mdash;it does not permit us to produce an average of the time it takes from completion of construction to occupation of individual units.</p>
	<p pid="c.1663W.0/17">Responsibility for marketing and sale of the units lies with Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) and Homebuy Agents. The longest period of time that a unit built exclusively for key workers on our intermediate rent and shared ownership schemes has been unoccupied is 12 months and 20 months respectively. The former property remained unoccupied for this amount of time due to delays as a result of prospective tenants dropping out which meant that the property had to be remarketed. The latter property remained unoccupied as a result of legal issues, which were only recently resolved. These were exceptional circumstances and the Department has made clear to RSLs operating the scheme that speedy action needs to be taken when legal or other problems arise.</p>
	<p pid="c.1663W.0/18">At present there are no properties available exclusively for key workers that have been unsold for more than six months.</p>

	<p pid="c.1666W.14/2">The Government offer housing assistance to key workers under the Key Worker Living (KWL) scheme in areas experiencing severe recruitment and retention difficulties. Key Worker Living funding is divided between Open Market HomeBuy (equity loans to purchase properties on the open market) and new build products such as New Build HomeBuy (shared ownership of newly built homes) and intermediate rent (newly built homes where the rent is set at a level between that charged by social and private landlords).</p>
	<p pid="c.1666W.14/3">As at March 2007, 5,845 newly built homes had been made available for key workers only in London, South East and Eastern regions through the Key Worker Living programme, of which 4,577 have been sold/let with a further 268 under offer. Of the 1,000 homes currently being marketed to key workers, 800 of these have been completed only in the last three months and a further 200 homes have been marketed for three to six months. It normally takes between three and six months to market and sell a unit. None of the properties currently available for key workers have remained unsold for more than six months.</p>
	<p pid="c.1666W.14/4">The number of newly built homes only available for, and sold or let to, key workers since the launch of KWL in 2004 is provided in the following table. We do not have the figures requested on an annual basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.1668W.2/2">Housing association and local authority tenants who purchase a share in a house are responsible for all repairs and redecoration both internally and externally. Purchasers buying a share in a flat will be responsible for internal repairs and will contribute a share of the costs incurred by their landlord in maintaining the building and common parts. Details are set out in their shared ownership lease.</p>
	<p pid="c.1668W.2/3">The Social HomeBuy pilot scheme is running until March 2008 and is subject to an ongoing independent evaluation. Initial indications from early participants are that responsibility for all maintenance may contribute to affordability and sustainability issues, particularly for tenants purchasing smaller shares. The Government are exploring various options for improving affordability for tenants.</p>

	<p pid="c.1671W.2/1">The Design for Manufacture competition was run by English Partnerships (EP) on behalf of Communities and Local Government. The aim of the competition was to deliver more than 1,100 high quality, well designed homes on ten publicly owned sites for a construction cost of &pound;60,000 per unit. In order to ensure mixed communities, the homes will provide a mix of accommodation under a variety of tenures: affordable rent, shared ownership and private sale at full market value. The aspiration is to reach 50 per cent. affordable housing of all tenures across the 10 sites, significantly higher than the percentage of affordable housing achieved through section 106 agreements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1671W.2/2">The homes for affordable rent will be transferred into the ownership of the registered social landlord (RSL) partnering the preferred developer on each site and will not therefore be offered for sale. The remaining affordable homes will be available for those who qualify for shared ownership arrangements, either through the First Time Buyers Initiative operated by EP or through the Homebuy scheme operated by RSLs. Should the purchaser under the shared ownership arrangements take the decision to sell, EP and the RSL have the right of first refusal to buy back the home. Should they not exercise this right, they would in any case benefit from any uplift in value on the proportion of the equity which they retain when the home is sold on.</p>
	<p pid="c.1671W.2/3">The homes for private sale are being sold at full market value and will not therefore be subject to any restriction upon re-sale.</p>

	<p pid="c.1673W.5/1">The Open Market HomeBuy product which is provided in partnership with lenders, enables purchasers to buy a property on the open market with the help of two 12.5 per cent. equity loans, one from Government and one from a lender. If house prices fall, and the property is sold, the proceeds of the sale are used to firstly pay off the balance of the mortgage and then the value of the lender's equity loan. For three of the participating lenders this will be the original value of the equity loan, as they do not share in a fall in value. For one lender the loan will have fallen in value to reflect the fall in value of the property.</p>
	<p pid="c.1673W.5/2">If the house price has fallen dramatically, then the proceeds of the sale may not cover all of these debts. If the proceeds are not sufficient to pay off the lender's conventional mortgage and equity loan then they have 'recourse' to the borrower. This means that the borrower is still in debt to the lender after the property is sold.</p>
	<p pid="c.1673W.5/3">Government, however, do not have recourse to the borrower. This means that if there are not sufficient proceeds from the sale, Government are not paid and cannot recover the debt from the borrower. This means that Open Market HomeBuy purchasers are less vulnerable to negative equity than those with a purely conventional mortgage.</p>

	<p pid="c.1679W.2/1">By the end of June 2007, the Buildings Research Establishment (who administer the scheme and train and accredit assessors) advise us that 432 trained and accredited assessors were available to undertake assessments for the Code for Sustainable Homes (the Code), and that they are training approximately 50 assessors a month and anticipate having approximately 900 assessors in place by April 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.1679W.2/2">The Code involves a two-stage assessment process. At design-stage the different types of homes in a development are assessed rather than each individual home; the post construction check is against a sample of the home-types that have been completed. The Government are consulting on proposals for homes to receive a mandatory rating but not a mandatory assessment. Some homes might therefore have no assessment and simply receive a zero rating or non rating. Therefore, it is not clear yet how many assessors would be needed. If new house building were to be around 165,000 new homes and all of these were assessed against the Code, the existing 432 assessors would need to carry out 51 assessments each a year. Based on the current growth assessor numbers the estimated 900 assessors available in April 2008 would need to carry out about 25 assessments each a year. These figures are based on the average development size, and the number of different types of properties on each development. In the past year one assessor has completed 60 assessments and registered a further 350 against the Code or its predecessor Ecohomes. These issues will be considered further as part of the consultation.</p>

They are fully acquainted with the Fraud Act, the Proceeds of Crime Act, etc. The section assists the Department in building a culture of fraud awareness and prevention.</p>
	<p pid="c.1688W.5/2">In the Adewumni case the internal audit acted to investigate and find the level of the fraud, and to provide advice to management on necessary improvements. In this case there was a lack of compliance with laid down systems of control. Internal audit has further enhanced its compliance reviews as a result of this fraud. The Department improved its guidance for its managers and made some changes to processes Action was also taken to enhance financial/HR processes. This will reduce the risk of fraud through improving processes for prevention and detection.</p>

	<p pid="c.1701W.9/1">For the financial year 2007-08 the average revenue funding per pupil at academies is &pound;5,966 excluding any payments made by or through local authorities. The budget share for an academy is calculated using the funding formula for the local authority in which it is situated.

	<p pid="c.1701W.9/2">Since 2006-07 secondary schools have been funded by the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG). The DSG is distributed through a single guaranteed unit of funding per pupil so a split between primary and secondary funding is not available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1701W.9/3">In 2007-08 the national average DSG allocation was &pound;3,888 per pupil for nursery, primary and secondary school aged pupils. Additional revenue grants were &pound;571 per pupil, making a total of &pound;4,459 per pupil.</p>
	<p pid="c.1701W.9/4">The revenue grants figure is provisional and does not include grants allocated by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC).</p>
	<p pid="c.1701W.9/5">The academies figure is not comparable with that for maintained schools because it includes 16+ funding; and most academy pupils are of secondary age whereas the DSG figure is for pupils aged three to 15. Furthermore, most academies have high levels of deprivation and this increases their funding level per pupil.</p>

	<p pid="c.1702W.2/2">30 local authorities have been rewarded for successfully achieving adoption targets in their local public service agreements (LPSA). The better outcomes and amount of 'performance reward grant' (PRG) each has received over the three years 2004/05 to 2006/07 in relation to their performance in these targets is set out in the following table. In addition, 13 local authorities did not achieve the adoption targets in their local PSA and hence received no PRG for this target. One local authority is still to make a claim</p>
	<p pid="c.1702W.2/3">Local PSAs&mdash;which are negotiated between local authorities and central Government policy departments, facilitated by the DCLG&mdash;have helped to incentivise local authorities and partners to provide better public services to their citizens around priorities for improvement locally. Evaluation shows they have been successful in doing this, with real benefits in improved outcomes for local people and communities.</p>

	<p pid="c.1705W.6/4" class="indent">152736&mdash;To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service's self-regulated appeals procedures.</p>
	<p pid="c.1705W.6/5" class="indent">Cafcass current complaints procedures provide for a review process in relation to all decisions made in response to service users complaints. An important part of the complaints procedures rests with the problem solving stage in which Cafcass makes every effort to understand the service users complaint, to address it and to respond to it. Cafcass has mechanisms for learning from those complaints and ensuring that lessons learnt from them are applied to its practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.1705W.6/6" class="indent">Independent scrutiny of the application of Cafcass complaints procedures is provided by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, who, on request, will consider any complaint that Cafcass has not operated its complaints procedures in a fair and reasonable way.</p>
	<p pid="c.1705W.6/7" class="indent">In 2006 the former DfES produced new guidance and standards for complaints procedures for Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) and Local Authorities to put in place for children's services. On publication of the DfES guidance, Cafcass undertook an examination of its own complaints procedures as a direct comparison against those advised by the DfES Guidance. In December 2006 this comparative report was presented to the Cafcass Board Task Group on complaints procedures, which decided in principle that Cafcass should begin work on a revised complaints procedures that builds on the strengths of its current procedures whilst meeting the standards set down by the DfES guidance, unless in any specific respect there were clear reasons related to the nature of the work of Cafcass not to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.1705W.6/8" class="indent">In particular, the Cafcass Board made the decision that Cafcass complaints procedures should be revised to meet the requirements laid down within the DfES guidance in two respects:</p>
	<p pid="c.1705W.6/9" class="indent">1. For the services of independent observers to be employed to oversee the progress of complaints investigations, in order to guarantee the process in terms of fairness and reasonableness.</p>
	<p pid="c.1705W.6/10" class="indent">2. To include a final appeal process involving a panel of independent people.</p>
	<p pid="c.1705W.6/11" class="indent">As a consequence Cafcass is currently in the process of redrafting its complaints procedures to meet these standards of independence as well as other aspects of the DfES guidance.</p>

	<p pid="c.1706W.2/1">The Transformation Fund was introduced in April 2006 as a time-limited initiative to test out approaches to improving the qualifications of the early years workforce in the private, voluntary and independent sectors and to raise standards in the provision of early education and child care. Its particular focus has been to initiate action directed at ensuring all full day care settings are led by a graduate, through the availability of a quality premium, a recruitment incentive and, since December 2006, a home grown graduate incentive. It has also supported broader upskilling of the workforce to raise the numbers of staff qualified at Level 3, 4 and 5 as well as to train staff to work with children with additional needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1722W.2/1">Reading mentors are an invaluable resource for many schools in supporting children to read well. The Department is currently providing funding to Volunteer Reading Help (VRH)&mdash;a charitable organisation which recruits, trains and places volunteers to give one-to-one help twice a week to children aged 6-11 years who find reading a challenge. Currently VRH has around 2,000 volunteer readers working with around 5,000 children.</p>
	<p pid="c.1722W.2/2">In the 'Making Good Progress' pilot, each pilot local authority will be responsible for making arrangements for delivering tuition including overseeing the recruitment of suitable tutors, who must be qualified teachers, and organising locations for the tuition to take place. We know that some local authorities are liaising with community groups who have offered venues for tuition.</p>
	<p pid="c.1722W.2/3">The wider picture is that over &pound;1 billion has been invested in personalised learning by 2007-08, Our guidance to schools indicated that our priorities for the funding were: to support intervention and catch-up provision for children who have fallen behind in English and maths; to support the education of gifted and talented learners; and to help learners from deprived backgrounds to access after school and year-round activities. It is for schools to decide how to use this money to provide more tailored support for their pupils.</p>

	<p pid="c.1722W.5/1">In the &quot;Making Good Progress&quot; pilot one-to-one tuition will be an out of school hours programme of up to 10 hours of individual tuition in English and/or mathematics. Tutors will liaise with the class teacher to ensure that the tuition that they offer meets the needs of the child and is closely tied in to the work that the child is doing in class. Each pilot local authority will be responsible for making its own arrangements for delivering tuition, including overseeing the recruitment of suitable tutors, who must be qualified teachers, and organising locations for tuition to take place.</p>
	<p pid="c.1722W.5/2">We are now in the third and final year of the &quot;Every Child a Reader&quot; pilot, funded by a collaboration between the DfES, KPMG Foundation and other charitable trusts. The pilot is helping 5,000 six-year-olds with significant learning difficulties to learn to read. It does this by placing specialist literacy teachers into schools to provide intensive one-to-one or small group support to children most in need. Results from the first year of the pilot showed that children made well over four times the normal rate of progress. As a result, a national roll-out will begin from 2008-09 benefiting over 30,000 children a year by 2011.</p>

	<p pid="c.1724W.5/1">PricewaterhouseCoopers recently completed an evaluation of the Department's programme of work with the Anti-Bullying Alliance, the main organisation which the Department funds for anti-bullying work. The PWC report was generally positive, but suggested that some elements of the work should be put out to tender.

I refer the hon. Member to previous answer 147174, making clear that data on the number of schools supported are not held by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="c.1724W.5/3">The National Strategies began to monitor use of the Anti-Bullying Charter to inform effective policy and practice in secondary schools in March 2006. They have recorded a steady increase in the use of the principles of the Charter over the twice-yearly reporting cycle. They began to monitor primary schools as well in March 2007. The National Strategies advise that nearly 75 per cent. of secondary schools and over 50 per cent. of primary schools are using the principles of the Charter to draw up their own anti-bullying policies.</p>

Funding not allocated to external organisations was used to support a variety of activities, including anti-bullying resources such as DVDs and hard-copies of guidance documents, local and national events, the preparation of guidance, research, and publicity campaigns.</p>

	<p pid="c.1725W.2/1">The performance points for qualifications reported in the Achievement and Attainment Tables are determined by the size of each qualification and the challenge it represents, where size is an indication of the time spent by a centre in supporting a learner and challenge based on the grades it is possible to achieve at a particular level within the National Qualifications Framework. Size is converted into a measure based on the guided learning hours attached to a qualification, with GCSEs having a size measure of one. The Cache Certificate in Child Care and Education at Level 2 currently accredited (Qualification Accreditation Number 100/0645/X) requires 480 guided learning hours which converts to a size measure of five.</p>
	<p pid="c.1725W.2/2">A revised version of this qualification has recently been accredited into the National Qualifications Framework (Qualification Accreditation Number 500/1886/3) and will be available to learners from <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November 2007</phrase>. The revised version will require 300 guided learning hours and will, therefore, have a size measure of three.</p>
	<p pid="c.1725W.2/3">The size indicators are based on set ranges of guided learning hours, or bands. At Levels 1 and 2, a qualification with between 90 and 144 guided learning hours (such as a GCSE) will have a size indicator of one, while a qualification with between 415 and 504 guided learning hours (such as the CACHE Level 2 Certificate in Child Care and Education) will have a size indicator of five. For the purposes of the SCAAT, the CACHE Level 2 Certificate has a size equivalence of five GCSEs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1725W.2/4">The challenge indicators are based on grades. Performance points are assigned to each grade within a grade range at each National Qualifications Framework level. An A* grade for a GCSE will attract 58 points, while a Distinction in a qualification with a three grade scheme such as the CACHE Level 2 Certificate in Child Care and Education, will attract 55 points. The points for a qualification are then multiplied by its size indicator to obtain its overall performance points scores.</p>
	<p pid="c.1725W.2/5">The performance points that a qualification attracts are used solely as a measure of an institution's performance, and are not a reflection of the amount of work a learner may need to undertake to achieve the qualification.</p>
	<p pid="c.1725W.2/6">A revised version of this qualification has recently been accredited into the National Qualifications Framework (Qualification Accreditation Number 500/1886/3) and will be available for learners from <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November 2007</phrase>. This revised version has a volume of 300 guided learning hours and will therefore have a size indicator of three.</p>

	<p pid="c.1726W.2/1">HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to the hon. Member to explain how Ofsted will use information obtained from its questionnaires about lifestyles. A copy of her reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1726W.2/2">I am aware of two letters received by the Department about the recent 'Tellus2' survey undertaken by Ofsted, both of which were referred to Ofsted for reply. I understand that Ofsted itself received seven queries from primary schools during the response period, three of which questioned the general suitability of some questions for younger children. Of these three, one specifically mentioned the question on drinking. These queries did not result in a complaint. Since the closure of the survey, Ofsted has received nine communications from parents, of which two expressed concern about the nature of the questions and two specifically mentioned the question on drinking. One of these latter two also mentioned the question on smoking. The primary school questionnaire did not include a question on drugs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1726W.2/3">Respondents to such questionnaires quite rightly have their anonymity protected. In the case of the Tellus2 survey, children and young people responded using an individual, randomly generated 'log in' identifier, rather than their names or dates of birth. Postcode information was collected, at the request of local authorities, to enable summary information to be produced about groups of children living in different parts of an authority. However, this was on the basis that data would only be reported if no individuals or schools could be identified from it.</p>

	<p pid="c.1728W.0/1">The Department does not collect information about the cost of school meals or school lunch take-up. It has also not made an assessment of the new standards for school meals on levels of demand. However, the School Food Trust will be publishing in August the results of its annual survey on school lunch take-up. Early figures from that survey indicate that take-up in primary schools is down by 1.8 percentage points (to 40.6 per cent.) and in secondary schools by 5.3 percentage points (to 37.4 per cent.). And a recent survey by the Local Authority Caterers Association reported that total meal take-up has dropped over the three year period from 2003/04 to 2006/07. In primary schools the drop is 3 percentage points (to 40 per cent.) and in secondary schools 7 percentage points (to 35 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="c.1728W.0/2">The take-up figures are not unexpected as schools often experience falling demand with the introduction of healthier food. But we are in the early stages of our long-term ambition to transform school food: and we have other measures planed for the short and the longer term to promote school lunch and encourage children to eat more healthily. We also know that where schools take steps to manage the changes carefully through, for example, good marketing and pupil and parent involvement, take up can rise sharply.</p>

	<p pid="c.1729W.5/1">Detailed information for Ribble Valley schools is not held centrally as the Department makes capital allocations mainly on a local authority area basis. All local authorities and schools receive capital allocations to support their local priorities. This is in addition to our strategic programmes such as Building Schools for the Future (BSF) and, from 2008-09, the roll out of the new Primary Capital Programme. In addition to Lancashire's investment through its BSF wave 1 project, over the current spending review period, 2005-06 to 2007-08, Lancashire authority and its schools have been allocated capital support of just over &pound;139 million, of which over &pound;41 million was allocated to Lancashire authority through the Single Capital Pot, including &pound;4.4 million to support: the Schools Access Initiative to help make schools increasingly accessible.</p>

Religious education syllabuses for maintained schools without a religious designation are drawn up by an agreed syllabus conference which advises the local education authority. The non-statutory framework for Religious education was published in October 2004 and provides that pupils should be taught about Christianity, at least one other principle religion and a religious community with a significant local presence.

	<p pid="c.1733W.0/1">In order to enter an initial teacher training programme, trainee teachers must have at least a grade 'C' or equivalent in GCSE maths and English. For those teaching primary pupils, a grade 'C' or equivalent qualification in a science subject is also required.</p>

	<p pid="c.1738W.10/1">The information collected by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform identifies the number of motoring offences fixed penalty notices issued by result at police force area level. Data are collected on the disposal, (i.e. paid, fine registration certificate issued etc.). However because of the time taken for the procedures for payment to be enforced the data are collected approximately nine months later than the period of issue and published in the following years' annual volume covering motoring offences.</p>
	<p pid="c.1738W.10/2">2003 data are provided in Table A. 2004 data will be published in the autumn in the publication &quot;Offences Relating to Motor Vehicles, England and Wales 2005, Supplementary Tables&quot;. It is expected that 2005 data will be published in 2008 and 2006 data in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.1738W.10/3">The penalty notice for disorder (PND) scheme was rolled out to police forces in England and Wales in 2004 under the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. Data on the number of the penalty notices issued, paid, contested in court as well as unpaid PNDs registered as fines, for 2004 and 2005 in Essex, are provided in Table B. In addition, provisional data show that a further 4,357 PNDs were issued in 2006; detailed information on the number paid, contested in court and fine registered will be available this autumn.</p>
	<p pid="c.1738W.10/4">Under the scheme, the police are able to issue penalty notices of either &pound;50 or &pound;80 for a specified range of minor disorder offences. The recipient of a PND has 21 days to either pay the penalty or seek a court hearing. If the recipient takes no action and the notice remains unanswered, a fine of one-and-a-half times the penalty amount is registered against them. The courts are responsible for enforcing PNDs in the same way as any other unpaid fine.</p>

	<p pid="c.1740W.5/2" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1740W.5/3">The number of persons aged 10 to 15 cautioned for all offences in West Yorkshire police force area for the years 2001 to 2005, along with the number of defendants of all ages cautioned by offence type in West Yorkshire police force area, and the number of defendants of all ages cautioned for sexual offences in England and Wales for the years 2001 to 2005 can be viewed in the following tables. This information is from the court proceedings database held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform.</p>
	<p pid="c.1740W.5/4">Information on cautions collected by the police is only reported to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform broken down at force area level, not by police division, so it is not possible to separately identify the number of cautions in Leeds from our data.</p>
	<p pid="c.1740W.5/5">Technically an offender could receive a second caution for a similar offence but it should be in very extenuating circumstances. The Home Office Circular discourages repeat use of the same penalty with the same offender. Someone who offends again needs to know that the next response will be a tougher one. And where a serious offence is committed, then the case should go to court.</p>
	<p pid="c.1740W.5/6">Therefore both national and locally held records must be checked before a caution is given. If the suspect has previously received a caution then a further caution should not normally be considered. If there has been a sufficient lapse of time to suggest that a previous caution has had a &quot;significant deterrent effect&quot; then a caution can be administered, but it is at the discretion of the police and CPS. The lapse of time varies, in practice, between forces.</p>

	<p pid="c.1742W.3/2">We have increased public investment in further education by 48 per cent. in real terms between 1997-98 and 2005-06 and funding for adult education has increased by 7 per cent. between 2005-06 and 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="c.1742W.3/3">In October 2005 the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) published &quot;Priorities for Success&quot; which set out our funding strategy for 2006-07 and 2007-08 and was updated in October 2006 with the publication of the LSC's Annual Statement of Priorities. The strategy set out our funding priorities and in line with our Skills Strategy focused public funding on helping adults to develop the skills they will need for sustained employment and further progression in learning.</p>
	<p pid="c.1742W.3/4">The LSC has worked with providers across the country including in Liverpool to align provision to meet these priorities. Where providers have previously delivered large volumes of short courses and other lower priority activity then this has resulted in significant shifts of funding towards more substantive programmes that meet national priorities. In these circumstances the LSC have looked at the extent to which provision can be aligned in a single year taking into account historical levels of delivery and the needs of the local community.</p>
	<p pid="c.1742W.3/5">In terms of provision outside of these priorities we have safeguarded &pound;210 million for personal and community development learning, including leisure learning in both 2006-07 and 2007-08. We also recognise the need to ensure that we have sufficient provision at lower levels to support progression through to higher level qualifications and we will be supporting this activity through the Foundation Learning Tier.</p>

The unique learner number (ULN) will enable the linking of two mutually exclusive records and episodes of learning to estimate the volume of learners progressing to advanced apprenticeship. The ULN is expected to be rolled out to all provision from January 2008, with a plan to compel use by LSC funded provision from September 2008. It will then take some years to work through the system before the ULN can be used to comprehensively monitor the progress of learners across provision, where there has been a break in the training.</p>

	<p pid="c.1745W.0/2">DIUS are working closely with NOMS on an initiative to deliver resettlement services electronically to offenders. The Programme for Offender Learning and Resettlement Information Services (POLARIS) is being trialled in selected London prisons to develop a secure means of offering prisoners access to e-learning, including on-line examinations, and other resettlement services.</p>

	<p pid="c.1746W.0/1">The available information is shown in the tables. The figures are taken from data collected by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) which are limited to students who apply to full-time undergraduate courses via the UCAS application system. The figures do not therefore cover part-time students, nor those full-time students who apply directly to Higher Education Institutions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1746W.0/2">UCAS do not allocate applicants to specific course types because students can submit up to six applications to one or more of First Degree, Foundation Degree, HMD or other courses. For acceptances, the figures for Degrees include both first degrees and foundation degrees.</p>
	<p pid="c.1746W.0/3">A new classification of ethnic group was introduced in 2001 which allowed those students of mixed ethnicity to be classified in more detail. Figures for 2000 and earlier are therefore not strictly comparable with those for 2001 and later years.</p>

	<p pid="c.1758W.0/2">The adult residential colleges designated under section 28 of the further and Higher Education Act 1992 are a small, distinct group of colleges which were brought into the further education (FE) sector in 1993 in order to be eligible to receive public funding alongside other further education colleges.</p>
	<p pid="c.1758W.0/3">The role of these colleges, which are all registered charities, differs according to their historical background but all focus primarily on helping adults who currently have either no or few qualifications often due to financial, personal or social barriers experienced in the past and who are seeking a return to learning. The residential facilities provide a network for personal and learning support encouraged through events and activities outside the formal timetable.</p>
	<p pid="c.1758W.0/4">Courses range widely from those designated to develop personal skills and the basic skills necessary for employability to those resulting in formal academic and vocational qualifications. Some colleges also offer higher education courses or help prepare students for progression to university.</p>

	<p pid="c.1758W.6/2">A group of five universities are being supported by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) as 'third stream as second mission' institutions (Brighton, Central England in Birmingham, DeMontfort, Sheffield Hallam, and Hertfordshire Universities) and these are exploring how such institutions can address issues relating to the country's productivity and competitiveness, in addition to pursuing their widely-recognised teaching activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.1758W.6/3">Beyond this, currently a further seven HEIs are funded under HEFCE's 'employer engagement pilots' initiative and exploring links with work force development. The Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF)&mdash;&pound;238 million for 2006/07&mdash;is an important source of support for all HEIs, helping the sector to engage in a broad range of knowledge transfer activities with business, public sector and community partners, for direct or indirect economic benefit.</p>

	<p pid="c.1760W.0/1">The Department has a policy of encouraging universities to increase their interaction with business. The Higher Education Innovation Fund, which provides funding to all Higher Education Institutions in England, is a key incentive. The funding for this programme has increased from &pound;187 million for the two academic years 2004/05-2005/06 to &pound;238 million for 2006/07-2007/08. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has allocated &pound;60 million of its research funding (QR) in 2007/08 by reference to research grants and contracts from business. And HEFCE fund a range of projects that respond to, and increase, employer demand for workforce development. Future funding allocations will be announced at the appropriate time.</p>

	<p pid="c.1760W.3/1">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and officials will continue to monitor the levels of interaction between higher education institutions (HEIs) and employers as indicated by HEFCE's annual 'HE: Business and Community Interaction' survey of HEIs (HE-BCIS).</p>
	<p pid="c.1760W.3/2">What is important is that HEIs recognise the value of, scope for, and ways to establish, more and better ways to collaborate with this wider community for their mutual benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.1760W.3/3">Although many HEIs are playing a significant role in fostering productivity and economic growth, through activities as diverse as contracted research for businesses and the provision of continuing professional development (CPD) courses, numerous ones are in receipt of specific funds from HEFCE to support projects, which in itself gives some recognition of progress and achievements in this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.1760W.3/4">This funding includes &pound;238 million for the third round of the Higher Education Innovation Fund. One portion of this was allocated by competition to large-scale collaborative initiatives including partners from business and community organisations and another recognised the extent of HEIs' existing business interactions as indicated by the HE-BCIS survey.</p>
	<p pid="c.1760W.3/5">HEFCE supports a range of project activity exploring ways to grow and respond to employer demand for HE-level skills within their work forces, notably three regional 'Higher level Skills Pathfinders' and, currently, eight single-institution 'employer engagement pilot' projects. There are also five 'third stream' HEI projects to demonstrate the potential economic benefits of such a focus by institutions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1760W.3/6">The council also funds 74 Centres for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETLs) that recognise and reward excellent teaching practice, and several involve HEIs, or substantial parts of them, working closely with business in areas such as work-based learning.</p>

	<p pid="c.1761W.5/32">The Learning and Skills Council became operational in April 2001. The figures provided are for the average number of staff employed by the LSC each year and include temporary staff and agency staff. The reduction in the average number of staff in post between 2006 and 2007 is a consequence of the announcement in September 2005 by Mark Haysom, the Learning and Skills Council's chief executive, of proposals for a new structure for the organisation. This process is expected to result in a reduction in the LSC's overall establishment figure (that is the number of posts required to run the organisation) from around 4,700 to around 3,630&mdash;a reduction of almost 1.100 posts. This will achieve estimated savings of up to &pound;40 million, which could be released to the front line for the further benefit of learners. As a result, the LSC will have a strong regional and local capacity, spending less time on transactional processes and more time developing relationships with key partners and stakeholders.</p>

It is a contribution by the Government to the joint efforts of charities and higher education institutions to make charity-funded research financially sustainable by the end of this decade. In the 2007/08 academic year, the Charity Research Support Fund will be worth &pound;180 million. Allocation of that money by the Higher Education Funding Council for England will be based on charity funding of eligible projects in 2005/06, which totalled &pound;599.85 million.</p>

The latest provisional figure for 2005/06 is 43 per cent. The HEIPR is not calculated at local authority level.</p>

	<p pid="c.1766W.0/1">As set out in &quot;Machinery of Government: Departmental Organisation&quot;, in order to provide strong strategic leadership for the 14-19 phase, overall planning responsibilities for that phase will transfer to the Department for Children, Schools and Families, as will all funding for 14-19 learners. Subject to consultation on the details and timing, to ensure there is no disruption to schools, colleges and training providers and the introduction of new diplomas, and the need to pass the necessary legislation, funding for school sixth forms, sixth form colleges and the contribution of FE colleges to the 14-19 phase will transfer from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to local authorities' ring-fenced education budgets. No decisions have yet been made about the proportion of LSC funding which will transfer to local authorities' ring-fenced education budgets and I estimate that it will be 2010/11 when the necessary legislative changes can take effect. In the three years until then, the LSC retains the legal responsibility for securing and funding all forms of post-16 education and training outside higher education, including 16-19 provision. We will be working closely with the LSC and other national partners, along with schools, colleges and training providers, to ensure that the changes are well managed, including any impact on the deployment of staff.</p>

	<p pid="c.1776W.2/3" class="indent">257,680 aged 16.</p>
	<p pid="c.1776W.2/4" class="indent">197,230 aged 17.</p>
	<p pid="c.1776W.2/5" class="indent">64,860 aged 18.</p>
	<p pid="c.1776W.2/6" class="indent">1,880 aged 19.</p>
	<p pid="c.1776W.2/7">The threshold for EMA support is lower than the threshold for HE student support. Therefore under current arrangements all students in receipt of EMA would be eligible for some level of HE student support if their household incomes did not increase. We do not currently have information on how many more students would qualify for HE maintenance support under the new proposals.</p>
	<p pid="c.1776W.2/8">Under the new proposals all 16-year-olds who receive EMA will be guaranteed a minimum level of support if they undertake a higher education course even if their household incomes increase. All 16-year-olds who receive the maximum level of EMA will be guaranteed the maximum level of maintenance grant (currently 2,700). This financial security will allow young people to look ahead to progressing to HE with confidence and no doubts about the finance support they will receive.</p>

	<p pid="c.1781W.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">14 June</phrase> the Government launched the Skills Pledge with commitments from 157 employers with more than 1.7 million employees. Since the launch, employers have continued to register their interest in the Skills Pledge through the Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) Train to Gain website and helpline. The Learning and Skills Council is responsible for the operational aspects of the Skills Pledge, including recording which of those employers making a Skills Pledge are from the public sector. Mark Haysom will write to the hon. Member and a copy of his letter will be placed in the Library of the House. Employers who make a commitment to a Skills Pledge are able to access the support of a skills broker. These independent, impartial experts will help employers identify the skills needed to meet their business needs and any sources of public funding available. Those employers who have already committed to the Skills Pledge are now working through how best to fulfil their commitment, including any requirement for public funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.1781W.3/2">Information on which of these employers hold a contract with Government agencies is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="c.1781W.3/3" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-31">31 July 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.1781W.3/4" class="indent">As the Learning and Skills Council is responsible for the operational aspects of the Skills Pledge the Minister for Skills, David Lammy, has asked me to respond to your recent parliamentary question; which employers who signed up to the Skills Pledge receive a) all, b) more than 50 per cent. and c) any relevant funding from the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.1781W.3/5" class="indent">When a company or organisation registers its intention to make the Skills Pledge, it will have the option of accessing support and advice from a Skills Broker through Train to Gain. In respect of Central Government Departments, we are currently liaising with Government Skills to agree Skills Pledge support and advice arrangements. We are also working with DIUS to finalise criteria for Government Departments and their Agencies accessing public funding through Train to Gain/Skills Pledge.</p>
	<p pid="c.1781W.3/6" class="indent">Of the 156 employers who made the Skills Pledge on the 14th June 2007 those which could be classified as public sector bodies include: 21 Central Government employers, 15 Non-Departmental Public Bodies, 8 Regional Development Agencies, 6 Local Authorities and 8 other public sector bodies.</p>

Mark Haysom, the LSC Chief Executive will write directly to the hon. Member and a copy of his reply will be placed in the Library</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-07">7 August 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.2/3" class="indent">I am writing in response to your recent Parliamentary Questions regarding Train to Gain. I have answered them in turn below.</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.2/4" class="indent">What proportion of businesses that have participated in the Train to Gain scheme have five employees or less; and what percentage of the Train to Gain budget is allocated to those businesses:</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.2/5" class="indent">LSC collects employer data by the following size bands: 1-49 employees, 50-249 employees, 250-4,999 employees and 5,000 plus employees. In the first 16 months of Train to Gain, 67% of organisations engaged are from the 1-49 band.</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.2/6" class="indent">The Train to Gain budget is not allocated by these employer size bands. Instead, Skills Brokers are currently required to achieve a target of 51% of employers engaged being 'hard to reach' which means they have not supported their employees to participate in vocational training leading to qualifications in the previous 12 months, and are not an Investors in People recognised company. Typically, micro and very small organisations are most likely to be 'hard to reach' so a high proportion of employers engaged to date will nave fewer than 50 employees.</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.2/7" class="indent">How many and what proportion of each level of qualification have been achieved under the Train to Gain scheme in the last 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.2/8" class="indent">The following achievements have been secured the period April 2006-June 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.2/9" class="indent">Level 2/3 47,880</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.2/10" class="indent">Basic Skills 11,680</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.2/11" class="indent">While it is relatively early in the life cycle of Train to Gain and success rates will change in the next few months as providers submit success data, the current evidence indicates success rates of about 70% for both programme areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.2/12" class="indent">What proportion of training conducted under the Train to Gain scheme has resulted from the use of skills brokers:</p>
	<p pid="c.1782W.2/13" class="indent">It is early in the life cycle of Train to Gain and the LSC is still collecting and analysing data from providers and brokers. However, early indications are that 30% of learners have arisen from skills brokers who are targeting &quot;Hard to Reach&quot; employers that tend to be small organisations. This percentage is in line with original DfES and LSC planning assumptions.</p>

	<p pid="c.1783W.7/2">The research has provided us with a greater understanding of the impacts of acid rain on both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and there is now evidence of recovery in some of the most acid-sensitive sites in the UK.</p>

However, the UK contributes significantly financially, and through provision of scientific expertise, to the work of the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution. The ongoing review of one of the Protocols under the Convention (the Gothenburg Protocol) has highlighted significant reductions in sulphur deposition and consequent impacts on ecosystems across the UNECE region. Aquatic and forest ecosystems have also become less acidified.</p>

	<p pid="c.1786W.5/1">A specific technology that the Government are keen to promote is anaerobic digestion (AD). This is an effective source of renewable energy that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture by capturing methane from manures and slurries, as well as from the decomposition of other organic materials, such as food wastes. The UK Biomass Strategy and the Waste Strategy for England include details of how we will work with stakeholders to drive a faster growth in the use of AD by local authorities, businesses and farmers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1786W.5/2">The electricity derived from anaerobic digestion is eligible for market support through Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs). Alongside the Energy White Paper, the Government launched a consultation on differentiated support levels for different renewables technologies. Under these proposals, anaerobic digestion of agricultural wastes would receive additional support in the form of 2.0 ROCs/MWh. We are also examining the case and prospective mechanisms for long term support for the renewable heat sector and possible means to support the development of local infrastructure and supply chains.</p>
	<p pid="c.1786W.5/3">The treated liquid from anaerobic digestion plants, known as digestate, has the potential for use as a fertiliser and soil conditioner. The Environment Agency and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) aim to develop a standard and protocol for digestate by spring 2008. These would provide regulatory clarity and confidence in its recovery on land. WRAP will support the development of the market for digestate alongside its work to establish markets for waste-derived compost.</p>

	<p pid="c.1787W.8/1">There is no current intention to reconcile these two factors as they have been produced for different purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1787W.8/2">In general terms, the carbon emission factor for grid electricity will vary from minute to minute as the fuel mix (e.g. renewables, gas, oil, coal, nuclear) and availability varies. To derive a factor for the purpose of calculations, it is therefore necessary to determine a period over which to average.</p>
	<p pid="c.1787W.8/3">For the Act On CO2 calculator, the purpose is to get as accurate a measure as possible for <i> current</i> CO2 emissions. The factor of 0.527 kg carbon dioxide/kWh is the most recently available figure based on 2005 data from the DTI DUKES electricity supply data for major power producers and CO2 emissions from the UK greenhouse gas inventory.</p>
	<p pid="c.1787W.8/4">For the Government's Standard Assessment Procedure for Energy Rating of Dwellings 2005 edition consistency of comparison over a longer period of time is important. A longer averaging period has been used. The factor of 0.422 kg carbon dioxide/kWh is based on the 2000 DTI projections for expected mix of electricity supply for the average of the Central Growth/Low Price and Central Growth/High Price scenarios between 2000 and 2010.</p>

Capital figures reflect spend on new and improved capital measures to reduce flood risk, including on flood warning infrastructure. Maintenance figures reflect spend on maintenance of existing assets. Other Flood Risk Management (FRM) spend covers the cost of delivering flood warning services, flood mapping, development control, data management such as the National Flood and Coastal Defence Database, regional flood defence committees and other associated costs such as investment in and provision of information systems (IS), accommodation and overheads.</p>

	<p pid="c.1802W.5/11">The additional spend in 2005-06 was largely funded from financial balances. These had been held by Regional Flood Defence Committees to meet the cost of unforeseen events such as severe flooding, as at the time the Agency's spend on flood risk management was largely funded from levies on local authorities. Since 2004, this spend has primarily been funded by DEFRA and such balances are no longer maintained.</p>
	<p pid="c.1802W.5/12">The Environment Agency is the principal operating authority with responsibility for flood risk management in England. However, Government-funded works are also carried out by local authorities and, in areas with special drainage needs, internal drainage boards. The Agency incurs spend on other activities related to flood risk management such as operational costs, advising on plans for new development.</p>

	<p pid="c.1803W.2/1">The Environment Agency produces annual Medium Term Plans setting out their proposed flood risk management capital schemes for the following five years. This year's exercise is due to be completed in the autumn and will be reviewed by the Department. It will inform targets and funding allocations for the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR07) period (2008-09 to 2010-11).</p>
	<p pid="c.1803W.2/2">The Environment Agency currently develop a maintenance programme each year based on their assessment of the condition of its flood defences. Outcome Measures for flood risk management have recently been defined and it is anticipated that these will be used to set targets progressively during the CSR07 period, starting with the capital programme in 2008-09 and extending to maintenance and other flood risk management activities from 2009-10. This should enable a direct comparison of, and more efficient allocation between, capital and maintenance works.</p>

	<p pid="c.1803W.5/1">The legislative framework for internal drainage board (IDB) funding is the Land Drainage Act 1991. Under the Act, there are three mechanisms by which IDBs can receive public funding to support their flood risk management and associated activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1803W.5/2">IDBs may impose special levies on local authorities (district and unitary authorities) to fund their work in the district. This is not permissive (or discretionary) expenditure and the levies must be paid. Relevant councils do sit on the IDBs and while these members are not appointed to represent local authority interests on the IDB, they are in a position to have some influence on the sums raised through special levies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1803W.5/3">All properties within a drainage district are deemed to derive benefit from the activities of an IDB. Every property is therefore subject to a drainage rate paid annually to the Board.</p>
	<p pid="c.1803W.5/4">For the purposes of rating, properties are divided into (a) agricultural land and buildings and (b) other land (such as domestic houses, factories, shops etc). Occupiers of all &quot;other land&quot; pay council tax or non-domestic rates to the local council who then are charged by the Board under the special levy arrangements above. The Board, therefore, only imposes drainage rates direct on agricultural land and buildings.</p>
	<p pid="c.1803W.5/5">The basis of this is that each property has been allotted an &quot;annual value&quot; which were last revised in the early 1990s. The annual value is an amount equal to the yearly rent, or the rent that might be reasonably expected if let on a tenancy from year to year commencing <phrase class="date" code="1988-04-01">1 April 1988</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1803W.5/6">The annual value remains the same from year to year. Each year the Board lays a rate &quot;in the &pound;&quot; to meet its estimated expenditure. This is multiplied by the annual value to produce the amount of drainage rate due on each assessment. A breakdown of the rate in the &pound; is shown on the reverse of the demand note to show how money is spent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1803W.5/7">DEFRA funds individual capital improvement projects promoted by IDBs, subject to relevant economic, social, environmental and prioritisation criteria.</p>

	<p pid="c.1810W.8/1">The following answer is current at 11:00 on <phrase class="date" code="">Thursday, 26 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1810W.8/2">Flooding has rendered the Mythe water treatment works inoperable. Current estimates are that 140,000 premises are currently without tap water across the region and that it could take between seven and 14 days to restore services. It is estimated that 10,000 of these premises are in the Tewkesbury area.</p>
	<p pid="c.1810W.8/3">A temporary solution has been devised by Severn Trent Water which will allow some water from the Strensham treatment works to be directed to the piped system serving Tewkesbury. Pumping is planned to start on <phrase class="date" code="">26 July</phrase> and should build up to 20 megalitres a day. However, this supply will be intermittent and discoloured and customers will be advised that it should not be used for drinking. Customers that do get this water should continue to rely upon bottled water and, after boiling, water from bowsers for drinking purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1810W.8/4">The priority is to increase the supply of drinking water. Across the region, over 900 water bowsers and tanks have been deployed. More are being obtained and the number is expected to increase to 1,800. Some 75 road tankers are filling the bowsers every day and more have been sourced. Bottled water distribution points have been set up and up to 5 million litres of water are being provided every day. A list of vulnerable people and isolated communities has been collated.</p>
	<p pid="c.1810W.8/5">We understand few households are now lacking power. Emergency measures to prevent flooding of Walham electricity switching station have so far been successful in ensuring continued operation of this major component of the power supply system.</p>

	<p pid="c.1811W.5/1">Flood risk management is a devolved responsibility and this answer relates to England only. Changes in the way land is used can impact on the speed and volume of flood water run-off. However, deforestation is not a significant factor increasing flood risk in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.1811W.5/2">There has been research on the impacts of woodlands and forestry on flood run-off. Mature forests can reduce the rate of run-off. New plantations can in fact increase it though this can depend on the nature of any drainage infrastructure installed in connection with them. Evidence to date suggests that, while there can be a significant impact on smaller flood events at the local scale, effects are likely to be much less for more extreme floods at the wider catchment level.</p>

	<p pid="c.1813W.0/1">The Landfill Allowances Trading Scheme (LATS) is not a revenue raising measure. It is a flexible scheme intended to ensure that England meets, as cost effectively as possible, its share of the national limits in the European Union Landfill Directive on landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste.</p>
	<p pid="c.1813W.0/2">LATS encourages local authorities with the lowest diversion costs, to landfill less than their allowances permit and sell the surplus to authorities that face higher costs of diversion. Conversely, authorities with higher costs of diversion may prefer to meet their obligations under the scheme by buying allowances at a lower cost than actually undertaking the diversion themselves.</p>
	<p pid="c.1813W.0/3">The Government takes account of all the costs of waste management when allocating local government funding. It is the responsibility of each individual local authority to plan its own expenditure. No assessment has been undertaken on the effect of local authority compliance with LATS obligations on other areas of sustainable waste management.</p>

	<p pid="c.1813W.3/1">DEFRA has initiated a study undertaken by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency to test <i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i> S. aureus</i>) isolates obtained from bovine clinical submissions for methicillin-resistant <i> S. aureus</i> (MRSA). This project commenced in autumn 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.1813W.3/2">The methodology employed in the study involves determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration of oxacillin using the agar dilution method of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. All isolates are also examined using the disc diffusion method of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and a 10 microgram cefoxitin disc. Two different susceptibility testing methods are therefore used to check for the presence of methicillin resistance in the isolates.</p>
	<p pid="c.1813W.3/3">Additionally, all isolates are also examined using a molecular technique (polymerase chain reaction) for the presence of the mecA gene (the gene which confers resistance to methicillin in MRSA).</p>
	<p pid="c.1813W.3/4">Finally, a latex agglutination test is used to check for the altered penicillin binding protein of MRSA in any isolates which are not susceptible or which possess the mecA gene.</p>
	<p pid="c.1813W.3/5">The latest available figures are that 658 bovine S. aureus isolates from cases of clinical disease in cattle in England and Wales (mainly cases of mastitis for which milk samples are collected) have been tested and no MRSA isolates have been detected.</p>

	<p pid="c.1814W.2/1">DEFRA has funded many research projects into the welfare aspects of animal transportation. Of these, there has been one specific project assessing the devices installed in vehicles to provide liquid to un-weaned calves. This study confirmed that calves can use mechanical systems to satisfy their fluid requirements, but may need time to become familiar with such systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.1814W.2/2">All member states are required to approve vehicles for long journeys. This approval involves an assessment of the vehicle equipment for providing water to animals. In the UK, there is a detailed checklist to ensure an inspector systematically assesses and thoroughly checks the vehicle and equipment, including the means of provision of feed and water.</p>
	<p pid="c.1814W.2/3">Vehicles must be equipped with a water supply from which the attendant can provide water instantly when needed. Watering devices must be of suitable design, be positioned for access to water by each animal, and carry a water supply of a capacity 1.5 per cent. of that of the maximum payload. Attendants must be able to check the water level of the tank, and drain and clean it after the journey.</p>
	<p pid="c.1814W.2/4">There are a wide range of devices used on livestock vehicles to provide liquid to un-weaned calves. At a basic level there are systems with buckets or bowls which can be fixed at a suitable height to ensure they are not overturned. Troughs are used on some vehicles, which are either fixed in place or fitted temporarily at the appropriate rest period. There are also more elaborate systems with nipple drinkers and other variations which allow calves to obtain liquid.</p>
	<p pid="c.1814W.2/5">No particular mode of delivery is specified in Regulation 1/2005EC. It does, however, require that water and feed be presented in a way that minimises contamination and that due regard is paid to the need of animals to become accustomed to the mode of feeding and watering.</p>
	<p pid="c.1814W.2/6">Animal Health assesses vehicles at markets, during roadside checks, at ports and at supervised loadings. If suitable equipment is not carried on a vehicle the journey can be prevented by the service of a notice requiring the correction of the problem, or additional requirements before the journey is started. The type and number of water delivery mechanisms, their height and location within the vehicle, and the calves' familiarity with them are assessed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1814W.2/7">Animal Health also issues and approves journey logs as required by Regulation 1/2005EC and ensures that any failure to comply with the welfare aspects of the legislation are investigated. When appropriate, enforcement action is considered, together with notification of the non-compliance to the appropriate member state if the transporter is registered outside Great Britain.</p>

	<p pid="c.1816W.5/1">Funding for research into potential Environment, Health and Safety impacts of Nanomaterials is co-ordinated across Government Departments, their Agencies and the Research Councils through the Nanotechnology Research Coordination Group. Direct funding from Departments up to the end of 2006 amounted to around &pound;13 million. This was supported by responsive mode funding through the Research Councils' Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration on Nanotechnology of &pound;19.8 million between 2002 and 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1816W.5/2">At this stage there are no plans to increase funding levels however, in order to maximise the use of available funding, my Department is working to achieve greater cooperation and collaboration between the above funding bodies and will seek more joint working with the nanotechnologies industries. DEFRA is working closely with the Research Councils to influence more funding in 'directed mode', in an approach similar to that adopted by the DEFRA co-funded Environmental Nanoscience Initiative and we will be working with the Department for Innovation Universities and Skills' Technology Strategy Board and National Measurement Systems Programme to identify further opportunities. In this way we would seek to encourage the development and safe use of nanotechnologies in universities and the nanotechnologies industries.</p>

For example in the south east, where there are secure populations of red squirrel on the Isle of Wight and Poole Harbour Islands, the focus is on ensuring that grey squirrels do not arrive on the islands and are controlled if they do. In northern England the focus of attention is on 16 reserves designated for red squirrels and preventing or reducing the impact of grey squirrels in these areas.

The MTP is also undertaking a scoping study to determine which other products use significant amounts of water.

	<p pid="c.1820W.6/1">Data on the number of defendants aged 10 to 17 years who were found guilty at all courts for the offence of being drunk and disorderly, broken down by gender and London court area for the years 1996-2005, are provided in the table.</p>
	<p pid="c.1820W.6/2">Additionally, suspects age 16 or over may be issued with a Penalty Notice Disorder (PND) for drunk and disorderly behaviour. Paying the penalty discharges all liability to conviction of the offence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1820W.6/3">In Greater London there were 51 PNDs issued to males aged 16 to 17 in 2004 for being drunk and disorderly in a public place, with four issued to females. These figures rose to 74 for males and 10 for females in 2005. Detailed information on court proceedings including convictions, cautions and PNDs for 2006 will be published in the autumn of 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.1832W.2/1">The licensing system under the Animals (Scientific procedures) Act 1986 is demand-led and provides the Home Office, as regulator, with no mechanism for reducing animal use. Instead the Act requires that the procedures authorised must cause the minimum possible suffering to the smallest number of animals of the least sentience. The Act also requires that, before a project licence is issued, we must weigh the benefits to humans, other animals, or the environment against the costs to the animals involved. A licence cannot be granted if the work could be carried out without using animals. The overall amount of animal research which takes place is determined by a number of factors, including the economic climate and global trends in scientific endeavour.</p>
	<p pid="c.1832W.2/2">We are, however, fully committed to encouraging the development and use of alternatives to animal experimentation where this is possible. The establishment of the national Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) by the Government in May 2004 and continued contributions to its funding by the Home Office demonstrates our ongoing commitment in this area. The NC3Rs provides the opportunity to co-ordinate and stimulate research and good practice in the 3Rs (reduction, replacement and refinement). It is able to fund high-quality research and facilitate the exchange of information and ideas, the identification of knowledge gaps, and the translation of research findings into practice to benefit both animals and science. The Centre submits an annual report to the Minister for Science and Innovation on its activities and that report is available on their website at <a href="http://www.nc3rs.org">www.nc3rs.org</a>.</p>

	<p pid="c.1833W.5/1">The Government are committed to eradicating the threat of animal rights extremism and have in place a robust inter-departmental strategy to achieve this. The strategy is centred on an improved law enforcement approach, with additional resources provided to the police to tackle animal rights extremism, a central team set-up to drive forward police action nationally and legislation enacted to protect animal research organisations. The result has been a significant fall in illegal extremist activity, and many significant convictions of animal rights extremists in the past 18 months, with others awaiting sentence and other major investigations ongoing. The Government will maintain pressure on animal rights extremists and, in co-operation with law enforcement agencies and extremist targets, will continue to develop protective measures against the extremist threat.</p>
	<p pid="c.1833W.5/2">While the Government are clear that cruelty to animal is unacceptable, it is equally clear that the targets of animal rights extremism in the vast majority of cases are involved in wholly lawful activities. The UK bioscience and medical research sector, the main target of animal rights extremists, complies with the most rigorous regime in the world for animal testing, designed to minimise suffering and ensure the highest welfare standards, and is at the forefront of developing new medicines and treatments for life-threatening conditions including cancer, malaria and cystic fibrosis.</p>

	<p pid="c.1840W.5/1">Enforcement of offences is an operational matter for individual chief officers of police enforcement of road traffic. Section 41D, Road Traffic Act 1988 consists of failing to have proper control of a vehicle and using a mobile phone while driving. The likelihood of detection of such offences has increased through the increasing numbers of police, including the deployment on roads of teams involved in the use of automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) equipment. They can stop vehicles as a result of direct observation, as well as an ANPR hit. Otherwise, the police enforce as operationally appropriate, taking into account other demands on their resources. Training for roads policing duties including the enforcement of Section 41D offences is a matter for individual chief officers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/2">Section 41D is an offence to do with vehicle construction and use. All such offences are only triable summarily. All magistrates receive training in road traffic offences as they constitute a large part of the work of the magistrates' court. While there has been no direct training in s41D, the construction and use provisions of the Road Traffic Act 1988 provide the basis of part of the Judicial Studies Board induction training for magistrates about sentencing in road traffic cases. Magistrates also receive advice in court from the clerks and legal advisers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/3">For monitoring purposes, the Department for Transport undertakes observational surveys of the number of drivers using mobile phones while driving on a regular basis. The survey for 2007 is under way at the moment and the results will be published later this year. The most recent survey published in August 2006 is TRL Leaflet 2100 which is available online at:</p>

Work is under way to ensure that the magistrates courts case management system currently being implemented by the Ministry of Justice reports all motoring offences to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. This will enable more complete figures to be disseminated. 2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces.

They are: Al Ghurabaa, the Baluchistan Liberation Army, Saved Sect (or Saviour Sect), Teyre Azadiye Kurdistan, Tehrik Nefaz-e Shari'at Muhammadi, and Jammat-ul Mujahideen Bangladesh. These additions were made because the organisations were considered to be concerned in terrorism. Section 3 of the Terrorism Act 2000 sets out that an organisation is concerned in terrorism if it: (a) commits or participates in acts of terrorism, (b) prepares for terrorism, (c) promotes or encourages terrorism, or (d) is otherwise concerned in terrorism. Section 21 of the Terrorism Act 2006 extended the meaning of 'promotes or encourages terrorism' to include the unlawful glorification of terrorism. The sufficiency of the list of proscribed organisations is kept under review.</p>

	<p pid="c.1861W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-23">23 July 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.2/2">The number of persons aged 10 to 15 cautioned for all offences in West Yorkshire police force area for the years 2001 to 2005, along with the number of defendants of all ages cautioned by offence type in West Yorkshire police force area, and the number of defendants of all ages cautioned for sexual offences in England and Wales for the years 2001 to 2005 can be viewed in the following tables. This information is from the court proceedings database held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.2/3">Information on cautions collected by the police is only reported to the Office for Criminal Justice Reform broken down at force area level, not by police division, so it is not possible to separately identify the number of cautions in Leeds from our data.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.2/4">Technically an offender could receive a second caution for a similar offence but it should be in very extenuating circumstances. The Home Office Circular discourages repeat use of the same penalty with the same offender. Someone who offends again needs to know that the next response will be a tougher one. And where a serious offence is committed, then the case should go to court.</p>
	<p pid="c.1861W.2/5">Therefore both national and locally held records must be checked before a caution is given. If the suspect has previously received a caution then a further caution should not normally be considered. If there has been a sufficient lapse of time to suggest that a previous caution has had a &quot;significant deterrent effect&quot; then a caution can be administered, but it is at the discretion of the police and CPS. The lapse of time varies, in practice, between forces.</p>

There is, however, a consultation on the way services are provided at Hinchingbrooke Hospital, but the SHA has assured us that all A&amp;E service currently provided by Hinchingbrooke will continue to be available although the way they are provided may change to improve care for patients.</p>

To achieve this individual NHS bodies must achieve energy usage targets of between 33 and 55 GJ/100cu.m per annum (Gigajoules/100 Cubic Metres) for all new capital developments and major redevelopments or refurbishments; and that all existing facilities should achieve energy usage of between 55 and 65 GJ/100cu.m per annum.</p>
