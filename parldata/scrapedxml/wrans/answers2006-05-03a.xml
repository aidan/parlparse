	<p pid="a.1556W.3/1">All children, including those with disabilities or living in difficult circumstances, should have the opportunity to fulfil their right to access and complete a good quality education.</p>
	<p pid="a.1556W.3/2">Tackling exclusion, including exclusion based on disability within the education system, is part of our work with partner governments. Copies of DFID's policy paper entitled 'Reducing poverty by tackling social exclusion' which sets out our broad based approach to tackling social exclusion across all sectors, have already been deposited in the Libraries of the House. This strategy highlights specific issues of discrimination which explain a large part of the disadvantages faced by children with a disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1556W.3/3">DFID provides its funding for poverty reduction in support of partner governments' own plans for poverty reduction. In fulfilling our financial commitments to partner governments, including the significant commitment announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-10">10 April</phrase> that DFID will spend some &pound;8.5 billion in support of education in developing countries over the next 10 years, the UK Government have taken a significant step forward in improving the opportunity for inclusive education to become a realistic goal for partner governments. We encourage partner governments to ensure that as wide a range as possible of stakeholders participate in the consultations on national poverty reduction strategies, including groups representing disabled people. Issues of social exclusion and targeted interventions for excluded groups will be addressed in the discussions our Country Offices will have with governments on developing 10 year plans for education.</p>
	<p pid="a.1556W.3/4">DFID's social exclusion strategy also emphasises the importance of the role of civil society in tackling all forms of social exclusion and the importance of DFID's partnerships with organisations involved in advocating for the rights of disadvantaged groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.1557W.2/1">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Guide on Resource Revenue Transparency defines 45 developing countries (and eight developed countries) as rich in hydrocarbons or mineral resources. Of these, 19 countries have committed to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The Government are presently in discussion with a further ten countries who have not yet begun implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557W.2/2">The Government believe that improved transparency over revenue management will bring a number of benefits to any resource rich country&mdash;in terms of improved governance, greater economic and political stability and an improved investment climate. The EITI International Advisory Group, which is supported by a Secretariat housed in the Department for International Development, is currently considering other incentives to encourage participation in EITI, and how these might be strengthened.</p>

	<p pid="a.1557W.8/1">DFID has engaged extensively with the pharmaceutical industry as part of our work to increase access to medicines in developing countries. In January 2005, we published a set of recommendations for the industry, that specifically looked at pricing policies, investment in research and development for diseases affecting developing countries, and ways of working in developing countries. These recommendations built on existing good practice in the industry. Many companies have made significant progress in making their medicines more available and affordable in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557W.8/2">To date, our discussions have focused on major communicable diseases such as HIV, malaria and TB, and on neglected tropical diseases, such as sleeping sickness. However, discussions with the industry have also emphasised the degree to which treatments for non-communicable diseases such as cancers really should also be the subject of differential pricing offers given the significant public health needs in developing countries. There are in fact higher rates of cervical cancer deaths in Ghana than in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557W.8/3">This is an area we will continue to work on with the industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.1558W.2/2">The Government are fully aware of the social, environmental, commercial and energy security issues associated with this project.

	<p pid="a.1560W.6/1">The Department has had discussions with both the horticultural and farming industries on this subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.6/2">The horticulture sector is making efforts on a number of fronts to reduce carbon emissions. Under the new Climate Change Agreement, growers will be entitled to an 80 per cent. discount on the levy provided they meet prescribed energy saving targets. Under the new Energy Scheme, it is possible for businesses to claim capital allowances on items such as thermal screens and insulation, variable speed pumps, certain heating equipment (including combined heat and power plant) and lighting. In addition, both Defra and the Horticultural Development Council carry out research into energy efficiency issues and the Carbon Trust (funded by Defra) provides advice and organises free energy services to assist in the identification of energy saving steps that can be implemented in nurseries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.6/3">The Government are very much aware of the link between farming and the environment. The Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food (SFFS) was launched in England in 2002 and sets out the basis for a new relationship in which Government works in partnership with the farming industry in England to make farmers more market, and less subsidy focused, while managing their businesses in more environmentally and socially responsible ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.6/4">Achievements under SFFS include: CAP reform which, by breaking the link between subsidy and production, means there is no incentive to overproduce; the cross compliance element of the Single Payment Scheme where subsidies are linked to the delivery of environmental and animal welfare standards; the launch of Environmental Stewardship to which all farmers are eligible to apply to earn payments for undertaking environmental management of their land; and the launch of the Rural Developments Service Farm Advice Unit which oversees delivery of technical and environmental advice to farmers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.6/5">In addition, the Department is working closely with the agricultural industry to reduce it's contribution to climate change. The Department has set up the Agricultural Change and Environment Observatory to monitor, and where possible anticipate, changes in agriculture and at farm level, and to asses consequent implications for the environment. A Stakeholder Advisory Group has been set up with the aim of advising priorities for the work of the programme, providing feedback on emerging results and their implications, identifying new and emerging areas on which the Observatory could usefully focus their work and to provide a channel of communication with a wider stakeholder community. Further information can be found on Defra's website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/observatory/background.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/observatory/background.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1560W.6/6">A vital element of Defra's policy on agriculture and climate change is to raise awareness within the industry of the issues and possible actions to be taken. The Rural Climate Change Forum has been established to provide a high level forum for dialogue with Government, and authoritative advice and leadership to rural stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="a.1563W.0/1">British farming is valued for the contribution it makes to the economy and to the environment, through producing our food, safeguarding and enhancing our landscapes, and increasingly to contribute to tackling the problems of a changing world&mdash;such as meeting our energy needs. Through the strategy for sustainable farming and food, the Government have put in place a comprehensive and long-term plan to deliver a profitable and sustainable future for farming in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1563W.0/2">Key to successful delivery of the strategy is the partnership between Government and industry, based on a commitment to shared goals. Through this partnership much has already been achieved, including: the delivery of CAP reform which, by breaking the link between subsidy and production, will help bring farmers closer to their markets; the cross compliance element of the single payment scheme through which subsidies are linked to the delivery of environmental and animal welfare standards; the launch of environmental stewardship, for which all farmers are eligible to apply to earn payments for undertaking environmental management of their land; and launch of &quot;Partners for Success&quot; a regulation and charging strategy for the farming sector, through which Government will continue to work with industry to regulate better and smarter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1563W.0/3">An independent delivery group chaired by Sir Don Curry will continue to oversee and drive forward delivery of the strategy over the next three years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1564W.5/1">The Department is in regular contact with the Department of Trade and Industry to discuss a whole range of issues related to bio-energy, including the impacts on biodiversity. Most transport biofuel feedstocks will be grown in rotation as part of a mix of several crops on the farm. Production from a mix of feedstocks and replacing crops for food would have a neutral effect on biodiversity. Any replacement of spring sown break crops with winter oilseed rape would have a negative effect on crop diversity and farmland birds. If arable crops replaced natural-regeneration set-aside, this would reduce habitat diversity. In the longer term, as technology improves, straw and wood could be used for bioethanol production without significantly affecting biodiversity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564W.5/2">Research suggests that, in comparison with arable crops, energy crops such as short rotation coppice grown for heat and power generation can encourage biodiversity, particularly for birds and insects.</p>

In order to reflect the creation of the single equality body the Commission for Equality and Human Rights and also reduce the burden to the business DEFRA has decided to do this as a joint equality scheme (JES) that will fully address both race and disability issues. The JES can be adapted to include other legislation as it comes on line, for instance gender and age.</p>
	<p pid="a.1565W.5/5">DEFRA's diversity and equality unit (DEU) wrote to all business units earlier this year seeking information on the impact of the equalities legislation on their areas of work and the actions they would take to address this. The information provided has been used to develop a draft JES, including a departmental action plan covering a three-year period from 2006&ndash;09. At the end of the three year period, DEU will have responsibility for reviewing the scheme. As a result of the review the DEU will launch a revised scheme, which will run for a further three years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1567W.2/1">A Regulatory Reform Order to amend the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 and the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 was laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March 2006</phrase>. The order is currently going through the parliamentary scrutiny process, but, if adopted, the amendments should make it easier for tenant farmers to diversify. In particular, the amendments would enable potential successors to a tenancy to carry out diversified activities on a holding with the consent of the landlord, without jeopardising the right to succession to the tenancy. The amendments should also facilitate tenant diversification by encouraging landlords to agree to improvements to the holding and by making it easier to restructure holdings held under a 1986 Act tenancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1567W.2/2">In addition to the proposed, Defra in conjunction with the Tenancy Reform Industry Group, has published a Code of Good Practice for agri-environment and diversification projects within agricultural tenancies. This sets out a framework to help tenants and landlords come to agreement on proposals for diversification or participation in an agri-environment scheme. Where tenants and landlords are unable to agree in accordance with the Code of Good Practice, Defra has provided funding for an adjudication scheme, free at the point of use, to enable the proposal to be considered by an independent adjudicator. The adjudication scheme is administered by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. The Code of Good Practice is available on the Defra website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/tenancy/trig/trig-cogp.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/tenancy/trig/trig-cogp.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1567W.2/3">The Tenancy Reform Industry Group put forward its recommendations to Government in June 2003 and has not since put forward any further proposals for change. The Government responded to the Group's recommendations in December 2003. The Government keeps in close contact with the Tenancy Reform Industry Group on landlord/tenant issues and will continue to do so.</p>

The initiative was therefore not established as a national funding programme, but as a means of enabling regional partnerships to target towns in their region according to regionally agreed selection criteria.

	<p pid="a.1570W.2/2">No. The options for proposed changes to veterinary supervision arrangements within the meat hygiene service (MHS) are set out in the 12-week public consultation launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-11">11 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1570W.2/3">Development of the proposals has been informed by Professor Wall's independent inquiry into the failure of the MHS in 2004 to ensure all relevant at risk 24 to 30 month bovines had been tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and recommendations to minimise the risk of failure recurring (with three recommendations in particular directed towards improving the veterinary structure). The proposals have also been informed by two subsequent reports commissioned by the Food Standards Agency and the MHS from DNV Consulting and the independent advisory group's requirements relating to the over 30 month rule change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1570W.2/4">The various reports are publicly available and comments are invited on the proposed changes as part of the consultation process. A regulatory impact assessment will be completed in light of comments received during the consultation and from more detailed engagement with those stakeholders that are directly affected by the proposed changes, such as veterinary contractors.</p>

	<p pid="a.1573W.12/1">Accommodation charges for service personnel are recommended annually by the independent Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB), and a copy of their 2006 report has been placed in the Library of the House. Where levied, charges vary depending on the type and grade of accommodation occupied and, for service families accommodation (SFA) whether it is furnished, part furnished or unfurnished. Single living accommodation (SLA) charges include a rental element plus heating and lighting; whereas SFA charges include a rental element, but occupants are responsible for heating and lighting payments. In Germany, SFA fuel charges are protected by MOD's fuel and light scheme which aims to ensure that occupants of SFA are no better or worse off financially than they could reasonably expect in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1573W.12/2">UK civil servants, including schoolteachers, on normal tours of duty in Germany, are provided with accommodation without charge as part of their overseas terms and conditions of service. Heating and lighting are also provided without charge up to a specified annual consumption limit. Any usage over and above this limit is charged for at actual rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1573W.12/3">The exception to this is UK civil servants, including schoolteachers, specially recruited for overseas service on or after <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-01">1 September 2001</phrase>. The 2001 review of overseas terms and conditions of service withdrew the provision of free accommodation and utilities for these staff five years after taking up their appointment. The first staff affected by this rule will arise on or after <phrase class="date" code="">1 September 2006</phrase>. The charges for accommodation and utilities will be broadly the same as those that are applied to service personnel, and details of these charges are to be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1583W.2/1">The Highways Agency is responsible for about 2200 Variable Message Signs (VMS) on England's motorway and trunk road network.</p>
	<p pid="a.1583W.2/2">About 350 'information' VMS are located at key decision points (i.e. before major junctions). They are used to inform drivers about major incidents and advise diversion routes. These VMS are operated by the National Traffic Control Centre (NTCC) in Birmingham. The NTCC gathers information on conditions on the network from its control centre in Birmingham. This is a 24/7/365 operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1583W.2/3">About 1850 'safety' VMS are located mostly on motorways to manage traffic locally in the event of incidents and emergencies, and to provide warnings of slow moving or stationary traffic in order to protect queuing traffic. Operation of these signs is currently transferring from the police to the Highways Agency's Regional Control Centres (RCCs).</p>
	<p pid="a.1583W.2/4">There are seven RCCs which monitor conditions on the motorway and trunk road network within their regions of England and allocate resources such as Traffic Officers to manage incidents. They set messages on VMS for safety reasons, to inform drivers and to assist with incident management. Incidents (and VMS settings) are monitored from control rooms and messages displayed on VMS are reviewed and removed as necessary. Currently only one RCC, the West Midlands RCC, is working at full capacity and it has an established system for monitoring consistency and timeliness of sign setting to support the Agency's goal of demonstrably improving the accuracy of VMS. The system involves checking timeliness of response both when incidents are identified and when cleared. Results are used to identify and implement improvements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1584W.0/1">The Department for Transport has not made any general estimate of safe or desirable limits on peak aircraft noise for all airports.</p>
	<p pid="a.1584W.0/2">The departure noise limits at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, set by the Secretary of State, are 94 dBA Lmax between 0700 and 2300; 89 dBA between 2300 and 2330, and 0600 and 0700; and 87 dBA in the night quota period, 2330&ndash;0600. The noise limits relate to a fixed reference distance 6.5 km from start-of-roll. The full reasons for applying these limits are set out in the document 'Noise limits for aircraft departing from Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports: decision of December 2000' which is available in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.1584W.0/3">At other airports noise management is the responsibility of the airport operator. All civil aircraft operating in the UK must comply with relevant international noise certification requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1584W.0/4">The Department for Transport has not set limits on equivalent continuous noise level (Leq). However, based on research, the Government use various levels of Leq as indicators of disturbance or of potential annoyance, or as criteria for mitigation measures, including advice for land use planning purposes. For example, the Government use 57 dBA Leq as the level of daytime noise marking the approximate onset of significant community annoyance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1584W.0/5">Daytime noise contour criteria for mitigation schemes were set out in the 'Future of Air Transport' White Paper. In particular, we expect operators of larger airports (those with over 50,000 air transport movements per year) to offer relocation assistance to households subject to daytime noise of more than 69 dBA Leq and to offer acoustic insulation to non-domestic noise-sensitive buildings, such as schools and hospitals, exposed to daytime noise levels of 63 dBA Leq or more.</p>

	<p pid="a.1585W.0/1">The Government sets departure noise limits at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports which are designated for the purposes of section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982. We will consider exercising similar powers at other airports if there is evidence that a major noise problem is not being dealt with adequately through local controls; otherwise, such limits are the responsibility of the airport operator.</p>
	<p pid="a.1585W.0/2">The present noise limits at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted have applied since early 2001 and have been subject to further review. The results were published in the Civil Aviation Authority's Environmental Research and Consultancy Department (ERCD) Report 0207, &quot;Departure Noise Limits and Monitoring Arrangements at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted Airports&quot;, in April 2003. The main findings were summarised in our April 2003 consultation paper on night flying restrictions, together with a broad indication of how we would take them into account. This has been taken forward in the Stage One and Stage Two consultation papers on night flying restrictions published in July 2004 and June 2005 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1585W.0/3">In the Stage Two consultation, we proposed possible changes to the departure noise limit applying in the night shoulder periods (11 pm to 11.30 pm and 6 am to 7 am). We also proposed that two additional noise monitors should be sited at Heathrow. We will announce our conclusions in due course. Copies of all the consultation papers and of ERCD 0207 were placed in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.1592W.5/1">The total overall spend on all adult programmes for 2004&ndash;05 was reported in the Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) Annual Report and Accounts as &pound;2,999 million. Our planned funding for the LSC's major programmes only for adults for 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;2,942 million and for 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;2,946 million. Estimated spend on smaller programmes and experience of the previous two years suggests final funding for adults will be in the order of &pound;3.2 billion each year. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-01">1 October 2005</phrase> the Government set out their priorities for post-16 education and training. This established our priorities for the learning and skills sector and the impact on funding in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. While overall spend on adult learning will remain broadly constant the pattern of that learning will change. To meet our national priorities, we need to shift the pattern so that we provide a greater number of longer and more expensive courses for adults, to equip them with the range of skills they need for employability and further progression to higher levels of training. We have consistently said that public funding alone cannot and should not pay for all the training necessary in a competitive economy. To support this shift, there has to be a new balance of responsibilities between Government, employers and learners so we do not accept that withdrawal of LSC funding means that courses automatically have to close. Where provision is valued by learners, where it is high quality, and where learners and employers are prepared to pay more, we expect colleges to consider providing courses on a full-cost recovery basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1592W.5/2">The Department's guidance to the LSC on the deployment of its funding allocations is outlined in the Secretary of State's annual grant letter to the LSC Chairman and for 2006 to 2008 in Priorities for Success the document that sets out our funding strategy for the next two years. This document is available on the LSC's website.</p>

	<p pid="a.1599W.9/1">Current housing benefit and income support regulations require that a person must have a right to reside and be habitually resident in the United Kingdom, The Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or the Republic of Ireland (generally known as the Common Travel Area). If a person does not have a right to reside then they are not habitually resident and are not entitled to those benefits. A person who has a right to reside must also show that they are habitually resident in the Common Travel Area unless they fall into an exemption category such as EU workers. There is no set time limit for being habitually resident and each case is considered on its own merits and the claimant's individual circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1599W.9/2">From <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-30">30 April 2006</phrase> persons who claim an income-related benefit including income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, state pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit will still be required to have a right to reside as well as being habitually resident in the Common Travel Area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1599W.9/3">The Social Security (Persons from Abroad) Regulations 2006 which come into force on that date will amend the 'right to reside' aspect of the test. This is to ensure economically inactive EU nationals who only have a right to reside under Directive 2004/38/EC for the first three months of their stay in the Common Travel Area, will not be entitled to those benefits. EU work seekers will have a right to reside and once they are habitually resident will be entitled to claim income-based jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit but they will not be able to claim income support or state pension credit. EU workers will have a right to reside and will continue to be exempt from the habitual residence test.</p>

	<p pid="a.1602W.5/1">Since income support was introduced in 1988, a single person aged 18 to 24 has been paid at a lower rate than single people aged 25 and over. It would be a new initiative and not a restoration to pay single customers aged 18 to 24 at the same rate as single customers aged 25 and over.</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.5/2">I am not aware of any reports that have been produced, that give consideration to payment of the full rate of income support to single young people under the age of 25.</p>

	<p pid="a.1602W.8/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. She will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.8/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Lesley Strathie</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.8/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking how many Jobseeker's Allowance applicants have taken <i>(a)</i> more than 12 days, <i>(b)</i> more than 18 days, <i>(c)</i> more than 24 days and <i>(d)</i> more than 48 days to process in the last month for which information is available; and if he will make a statement. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.8/4" class="indent">The information you have asked for is not available. Jobcentre Plus measures the time taken to process a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance as the Actual Average Clearance Time. This is measured against a Key Management Indicator which is agreed at the beginning of each year. For 2005/06, this was set at 12 working days. Latest figures show that for the year to February 2006 claims were processed in an average of 14.3 working days.</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.8/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is transforming the service it provides by making it available via the telephone, via the Internet and through the personal service offered to people in Jobcentre Plus offices. With change on this scale there can be difficulties at the beginning and, as a consequence, average clearance times have increased. This is clearly causing unacceptable delays for customers and we have taken action to address the delays.</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.8/6" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase> we launched a National Action Plan designed to reduce clearance times. The plan requires that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.8/7" class="indent">all delivery units work through a Health Check and address the areas where they are under-performing;</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.8/8" class="indent">senior managers regularly review and address poor performance; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.8/9" class="indent">delivery units performing below the required level develop a recovery plan to improve performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.8/10" class="indent">Senior Operational Managers were required to provide a formal assurance at the end of February that all elements of the plan are being complied with, although it has been acknowledged that concentration on backlogs of work may initially cause average clearance times to rise. The Chief Operating Officer is monitoring performance very closely.</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.8/11" class="indent">In order to focus management attention on this issue, the Actual Average Clearance Times measure, which will remain at 12 days for Jobseeker's Allowance claims, has been added to the suite of Jobcentre Plus Targets for 2006/07.</p>
	<p pid="a.1602W.8/12" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

Based on our current planning assumptions, we expect that just under one half of our financial savings will come from improvements in transactional processing, around one quarter will come from the direct payment of benefits to customers, over one quarter of savings will come from improvements in central services and around one tenth from improved value for money in procurement.

	<p pid="a.1610W.5/2">The new procurement directives, simplify, clarify and modernise public procurement procedures. These were implemented in the United Kingdom on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January 2006</phrase>. There are new provisions on framework agreements, competitive dialogue for complex procurements, central purchasing bodies and electronic procurement methods such as e-auctions and dynamic purchasing systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1610W.5/3">The directives allow contracts to be reserved for supported factories and businesses, and provide greater clarity on the extent to which social and environmental issues can be incorporated into procurements. There is also a requirement for the mandatory exclusion of companies that have been convicted of offences related to fraud and corruption. The rules applying to purchases by utilities now incorporate an exclusion mechanism where a sector is subject to normal competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1610W.5/4">Concerning the effects on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the new directives, and the regulations that implement them, apply rules directly to purchasers rather than to suppliers. There are, therefore, no compliance costs to business from these new rules. The new procurement methods that the rules provide for, including electronic systems, together with the simpler and clearer rules generally, reduce the burdens of the procurement process and should encourage suppliers, including SMEs, to participate in public procurement opportunities either directly or as sub contractor.</p>
