These groups consist of regional and local farming and food sector representatives, alongside other stakeholders from the health and environment sectors. The groups were brought together by Government offices and regional development agencies to decide initially upon the priorities within these plans, and then subsequently to oversee delivery.</p>

	<p pid="a.1442W.5/1">The Forestry Commission has always worked closely with farmers and other landowners as it carries out its functions and duties under the Forestry Act and other legislation. These include the provision of advice and incentives for woodland management and creation as well as regulation of tree felling. DEFRA's Rural Strategy published in 2004 is leading to delivery reforms, including the creation of Natural England with which the Forestry Commission will be aligned. This will help to deliver services to farmers and the rural community in a more streamlined customer-focused way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.5/2">The English Woodland Grant Scheme (EWGS), introduced earlier this year is simplifying arrangements for farmers who seek financial support for creating new woodlands by bringing together in a single scheme contribution to cost grants and income foregone payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.5/3">The introduction of woodland options under the Environmental Stewardship scheme has provided new opportunities for farmers. In order to help farmers understand the woodland support options available to them, the Commission and DEFRA have produced guidance for farmers, entitled Funding for Farm Woodlands in England. The Commission has also been working closely with the Rural Development Service through joint Environmental Stewardship staff training events.</p>
	<p pid="a.1442W.5/4">The Commission is also a major land manager, which gives it a unique insight and understanding of countryside management and the needs of its neighbours, many of who are farmers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1448W.8/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-07">7 December 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.8/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking <i>(a)</i> what the average percentage increase was in net income in the UK over the past three years and <i>(b)</i> what the rate of inflation was over the same period, (34678)</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.8/4" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> It has been assumed that the question relates to gross disposable income of the household sector. The latest information available for gross disposable income is for the second quarter of 20057 (2005Q2). The growth in this series over the three years to 2005Q2 was 12.4%; equivalent to an average of 4.0% per annum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.8/5" class="indent">The series quoted is gross disposable income for the combined household and non-profit institutions, serving-households (NPISH) sectors. The accounts for the household and NPISH sectors are currently combined; separate estimates are not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.8/6" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> In the UK, there are two main measures of inflation, the Consumer Prices Index (GPI) and the Retail Prices Index (RPI). The Government's inflation target is based on the CPI. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee sets interest rates to meet this target. The RPI is the more familiar measure of inflation. Tax allowances, state benefits, pensions and many other payments are often revised in line with this index.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.8/7" class="indent">The figures are published each month on the National Statistics website, <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk">www.statistics.gov.uk</a>, in a First Release, on a Tuesday about a month, after the index date. The publication dates are announced six months in advance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.8/8" class="indent">The most recently available three-year period is for October 2002&mdash;October 2005, During this period, the CPI increased by 5.0 percent while the RPI increased by 6.9 percent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448W.8/9" class="indent">The-figures for the last three years are shown in full in Annex A. Figures are presented for both the CPI and the RPI. Monthly figures and the most recently available annual averages for the last three years are presented.</p>

	<p pid="a.1452W.2/1">The Government assessed the costs of implementing a statutory Operating and Financial Review against those of implementing an enhanced Business Review in a Regulatory Impact Assessment, which was published alongside the DTI's formal response to consultation. It was estimated that a statutory Operating and Financial Review would cost business &pound;33 million per annum more than the Business Review. Most of these additional costs related to the different audit requirements applying to the OFR compared to the Business Review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1452W.2/2">Consistent with its approach to company law reform of simplifying company law, reducing the regulatory burden on business and promoting effective shareholder engagement, the Government have concluded that a requirement for an enhanced Business Review, in line with the requirements of the European Accounts Modernisation Directive, is preferable to a requirement for a statutory Operating and Financial Review for quoted companies. The enhanced Business Review will meet key narrative reporting requirements, while imposing considerably less cost than the Operating and Financial Review. The new reporting regime demonstrates the Government's ongoing commitment to strategic forward looking narrative reporting.</p>

	<p pid="a.1457W.5/1">In its White Paper &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot; the Government stated that larger UK airports&mdash;those with more than 50,000 movements a year&mdash;are expected to offer acoustic insulation to noise&mdash;sensitive buildings such as schools, which are exposed to medium to high levels of noise, that is 63 dBA Leq or more. The dBA value relates to the Leq 16 hour daytime period from 07.00 to 23.00.</p>
	<p pid="a.1457W.5/2">The White Paper recognised the difficulties associated with insulating some noise-sensitive buildings. We say that where acoustic insulation cannot provide an appropriate or cost-effect solution, airport operators should endeavour to provide alternative mitigation measures such as environmental grants, provisions of quiet rooms for reading or music, or funding for school trips away from the noisy environment, especially where the loss of amenity outdoors may be severe. In such cases we expect the priority of need and the level of any contribution to be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the airport operator and relevant stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="a.1459W.12/1">We have introduced &quot;accessibility planning&quot; into the local transport planning process to encourage local authorities and other agencies to assess more systematically whether people can access transport services in their areas. This process covers all forms of transport from buses, coaches and taxis to cycling and walking networks. Making provision for disabled people is a condition against which the resulting Local Transport Plans (LTPs) are assessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1459W.12/2">Swindon borough council is using its LTP funding for an on-going programme of improvements at bus stops that will assist disabled passengers. The programme involves provision of raised kerbs at bus stops to minimise the step height between the pavement and the bus. This allows easier access for wheelchair users and for other people who have difficulty with high steps such as many older people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1459W.12/3">Routes to bus stops are also being improved with new link paths and dropped-kerb road crossings and bus Stop Clearways are introduced to ensure that parked cars do not obstruct the stops allowing buses to pull up alongside the raised kerbs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1459W.12/4">Local bus operators are providing new accessible low floor buses in Swindon and the Local Transport Plan funding to improve bus stops will allow the benefits of this investment in new vehicles to be maximised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1459W.12/5">Rail services in Swindon are already accessible to disabled people. The station has lifts to all platforms and recent access improvements have been made to the forecourt and bus stop areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1459W.12/6">At a national level there has been significant progress in making public transport accessible to disabled people through regulations made under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA 1995). We made the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations in 2000 and many of the trains calling at the station comply with those. Although the older rolling stock serving Swindon doesn't comply it can nevertheless accommodate passengers travelling in a wheelchair.</p>
	<p pid="a.1459W.12/7">More generally disabled people in Swindon as elsewhere in the country will also benefit from the provisions in the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (DDA 2005). We have already laid regulations which will, from December 2006, lift the transport exemption in Part 3 of the for land-based public transport, vehicle hire, breakdown services and vehicles used on leisure and tourism transport services. We will also be consulting shortly on draft regulations to set an &quot;end date&quot; of no later than <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2020</phrase> for when all trains will have to meet the rail vehicle accessibility regulations and to apply those regulations to older trains when they are refurbished.</p>

For example, we have introduced regulations significantly improving access for disabled people to all new trains, buses and coaches; over 4,700 accessible rail vehicles will be in service by the end of 2005 and almost half of the bus fleet is already accessible across the country, with much higher proportions in many urban areas.</p>

These include extending to transport services the &quot;right of access&quot; disabled people currently have to services such as shops and banks. The new Act also allows us to set an &quot;end date&quot;, of no later than <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2020</phrase>, by which time all trains will have to be accessible. We are on course to implement these measures in December 2006 in line with our published timetable.</p>

	<p pid="a.1469W.2/1">The London Development Agency (IDA) is responsible for acquiring the land in East London that will be needed for the Olympics and has recently made two compulsory purchase orders to this end. Other regional development agencies (RDAs) at Olympic sites elsewhere in the UK will also be able to acquire land (compulsorily or by agreement) if that proves necessary. Under the London Olympics Bill, currently before Parliament, the new Olympic Delivery Authority will have powers to acquire land by agreement&mdash;including, with the consent of the Secretary of State, on the same terms as for compulsory purchases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1469W.2/2">The Government made an amendment to the London Olympics Bill at Report Stage, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-06">6 December</phrase>, which will ensure the necessary land can be assembled without delay and used for Olympic development. Where a RDA purchases land for the purpose of preparing for the Olympics, the amendment has the effect of: removing the need for a special parliamentary process to approve the compulsory purchase of 'special land' where equivalent land is not being provided in exchange; clarifying that 'special land', once acquired, can be built on; allowing the compulsory purchase of Crown land and any interest in Crown land; and extinguishing all existing rights over the land acquired (while providing for compensation to those who have rights removed).</p>
	<p pid="a.1469W.2/3">Anyone owning an interest in land that is being acquired by compulsory purchase will be entitled to fair compensation, based on the principle that they should be paid neither more or less than their loss. If the amount payable cannot be agreed between the parties it will be settled by the Lands Tribunal.</p>

	<p pid="a.1470W.2/1">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Education and Skills share an ambitious Public Service Agreement target to increase the percentage of 5 to 16-year-olds who spend a minimum of two hours a week on high quality PE and school sport, within and beyond the curriculum, to 75 per cent. by 2006 and 85 per cent. by 2008. Long-term&mdash;by 2010&mdash;we want to offer children the chance to do at least four hours of sport every week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1470W.2/2">The target is being delivered through the national PE, School Sport and Club Links (PESSCL) strategy being implemented jointly by both Departments. Over &pound;1.5 billion is being invested over the five years to 2008 to deliver the strategy through nine inter-linked programmes of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1470W.2/3">We have produced a range of guidance documents including:</p>
	<p pid="a.1470W.2/4" class="indent">'High Quality PE and Sport for Young People&mdash;A Guide to recognising and achieving high quality PE and sport in schools and clubs';</p>
	<p pid="a.1470W.2/5" class="indent">'Do You Have High Quality PE and Sport in Your School&mdash;A guide to self-evaluating and improving the quality of PE and school sport';</p>

	<p pid="a.1470W.2/8" class="indent">'Dance Links';</p>
	<p pid="a.1470W.2/9">which provide information and advice to school sport partnerships, schools, sport clubs, local education authorities, national governing bodies, county sport partnerships and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.1470W.2/10">The 2004&ndash;05 School Sport Survey, the largest in Europe, confirms that the national strategy is on track to meet the public service agreement target.

	<p pid="a.1474W.0/1">The cost of home heating oil in Northern Ireland is determined by a competitive market and, on average, has been lower than the equivalent cost in the remainder of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.1474W.0/2">The competitive market reflects developments in the international oil market. Global oil prices have been high and volatile over the past eighteen months as a result of very strong growth in global demand and accompanying pressure on supplies. Most recently, disruptions to US Gulf of Mexico production and refining capacity, as a result of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, led to prices rising to record levels in early September 2005. These developments were reflected in a corresponding record increase in the price of home heating oil in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1474W.0/3">A recovery of global oil production and refining facilities, together with a slight reduction in demand has resulted in a subsequent moderation of prices. This, in turn, has led to a corresponding reduction in the average price of home heating oil in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="a.1475W.0/1">Prosecution data are not readily available broken down by Northern Ireland constituency. The statistics included within the response are based on the 12 police divisions for the years 1994 to 1999 and police district command units for 2000 to 2003. Police district command units became operational in April 2001. However, for the purposes of comparability, calendar year 2000 data are also disaggregated by DCU, rather than police division. It is not possible to disaggregate data by DCU for years prior to 2000.</p>

	<p pid="a.1477W.2/1">The Chief Constable has advised me that no precise records are held that can show exactly how many times consultation occurred. In addition, the confidentiality of many community consultations and contacts must be respected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1477W.2/2" class="italic">East Belfast</p>
	<p pid="a.1477W.2/3">The CCTV cameras in East Belfast were installed in three phases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1477W.2/4" class="indent">(i) A single camera was installed at Albert Bridge/Lagan Walkway in 1998 after consultation with Laganside Corporation, Belfast city council and BT who were the partners in that CCTV scheme. Its role was primarily to prevent antisocial behaviour in the new Laganside development area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1477W.2/5" class="indent">(ii) The second phase was in 2001 and consisted of two cameras at Madrid Street and Newtownards Road respectively. There was no consultation with community groups prior to the initiation of planning work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1477W.2/6" class="indent">Sinn Fein and Loyalist community representatives were informed about the positioning of the Madrid Street and Newtownards Road cameras in 2001 prior to the installation of the equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1477W.2/7" class="indent">(iii) The third phase consisted of five cameras that were erected in 2002 after the prolonged violence that summer. No consultation was carried out prior to the installation as there was a clear operational need to provide a technological alternative to the use of large numbers of police and military personnel in the Cluan Place/Short Strand area. Representatives from Sinn Fein, DUP, UUP and a loyalist community group were informed of the intention to erect cameras prior to their installation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1477W.2/8" class="italic">South Belfast</p>
	<p pid="a.1477W.2/9">The CCTV system in operation in South Belfast was developed more than 10 years ago. As with most developments in the city centre, police would have spoken with city council, planning authorities, the Chamber of Commerce and other relevant groups in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1477W.2/10" class="italic">North Belfast</p>
	<p pid="a.1477W.2/11">Between <phrase class="date" code="2001-06-01">1 June 2001</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-31">31 May 2002</phrase> 174 riots occurred in North Belfast in which 723 police officers were injured. The initial roll out of CCTV in North Belfast was undertaken by PSNI as an urgent response to the on-going interface violence in the DCU, with no time for community consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1477W.2/12">The initial cameras were situated at the main flashpoints including Limestone Road, Ardoyne Shopfronts, North Queen Street/Duncairn Gardens, Whitewell Road and Ardoyne Road.</p>
	<p pid="a.1477W.2/13">The second phase roll out allowed for wider community-based consultation, including community representatives, political representatives and other interested parties. The exact timing of such contacts is not held.</p>

	<p pid="a.1487W.9/1">I am advised that as explained in the Commissioner's previous correspondence about statistics, the database that the Commissioner's office uses to record complaints about breaches of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (PECR), which includes the TPS scheme, does not enable his office to determine how many of the complaints they receive about telephone calls are TPS registered. In addition, due to the nature of the casework management system previously used, his office is unable to provide specific numbers for telephone marketing complaints prior to 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.1487W.9/2">The number of letters the Commissioner's office wrote to organisations that were alleged to be at fault was 597 in 2004 and 1,125 so far this year. The increase in complaints corresponds with the sharp increase in TPS registrations. On the issue of multiple warning letters to individual companies, his office is unable to provide precise statistics from their database, although there are a number of companies that they have written to on several occasions for potential breaches of PECR. Where it is considered that a company has persistently breached PECR, cases are sent to their new Regulatory Action Division who consider enforcement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1492W.2/1">The Government acknowledges the damaging impact that dumping and trade-distorting subsidies have on developing countries, particularly on their agriculture sectors. We fully support the commitment made at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Doha Ministerial meeting in 2001, which agreed that agriculture negotiations would aim to achieve: substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1492W.2/2">The package of reforms to the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) agreed in June 2003 and May 2004 mark a significant shift in the EU's agricultural policy. The de-coupling of subsidies from production should connect European farmers much more closely to the market and have real impacts on reducing excessive production, which results in dumping and harms developing countries. The Government will continue to be at the forefront of those pushing for further reform of the EU's agricultural policy and I welcome the fact that the Commission has re-affirmed its commitment to ensuring that the EU plays a full and constructive role in the WTO agriculture negotiations. I also welcome the commitment in the WTO to agree to set an end date for all export supports. The UK believes these should end by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1492W.2/3">The Doha Development Agenda and specifically the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong represent an important opportunity to make a significant contribution to reducing global poverty. The UK Government is working to achieve an outcome that delivers real gains for developing countries, including the poorest. These gains should include improved participation by developing countries in the world trading system, through substantially increased market access for developing countries and the dismantling of trade-distorting agricultural subsidies by industrialised countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.1493W.0/1">The UK Government are committed to the development of an open and rules-based international trading system that fulfils its potential to contribute to the reduction of poverty in poorer countries. Our key policy commitments on trade and development, as well as our objectives for the current round of multilateral trade talks, are set out in the Government's White Papers, &quot;Making Globalisation a Force for Good&quot;(July 2004) and &quot;Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work for the Poor&quot; (December 2000). The UK Government are working hard to support the poorest and most vulnerable producers, be it through multilateral negotiations in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or regional trade agreements such as the Economic Partnership Agreements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1493W.0/2">The UK Government do not support forced liberalisation or unfettered free trade but trade that is fair as well as free. The UK government supports the view that developing countries need to decide on the timing, pace and sequencing of any market opening in line with their own national development and poverty reduction plans. In the context of the WTO negotiations we are firmly committed to ensuring that developing countries are given appropriate flexibility to adjust to trade reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1493W.0/3">In the longterm, the removal of trade barriers, if managed properly, can help developing countries gain better access to developed country markets and more competitively priced inputs. By increasing Aid for Trade, (AFT) the UK hopes to help poorer countries seize the opportunities presented by more open markets. DFID will treble its support to &pound;100 million a year by 2010 to help boost poor countries' capacity to trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.1493W.0/4">At the WTO ministerial in Hong Kong we are working with international partners to deliver on the ambition of Doha and build on G8 commitments. The UK Government are working to achieve an outcome that delivers real gains for developing countries, including the poorest.</p>

	<p pid="a.1493W.3/1">DFID has been funding several programmes specifically around, or incorporating activities, on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) flexibilities in the context of its global strategy to improve access to essential medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.1493W.3/2">We have been providing support to the World Health Organisation's Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and Public Health (CIPIH), which is reporting in January 2006, with the secondment of an official to lead the secretariat of the Commission (three-year project: &pound;240,000).</p>

	<p pid="a.1493W.3/4">DFID also supports country-focused work on the issue. In Ghana, we support an Access to Medicines Initiative (ATMI) through the Ghana National Drugs Programme that includes work on TRIPS flexibilities. The DFID Health Resource Centre commissioned a series of studies that looked at access to medicines in under-served markets, including country case studies in Kenya and Malawi. A study on China and India investigates the effects of changing intellectual property legislation on the pharmaceutical industry in these countries, and in a recent update, the consequences of the alignment with TRIPS obligations in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.1499W.7/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has issued no guidelines on not cutting hedges by more than a third. Paragraph 6.24 of our publication 'High Hedges Complaints: Prevention and Cure' advises that Councils cannot order remedial works that would kill a hedge. In our view this would amount to the same as removing the hedge altogether and, under section 69(3) of the 2003 Act, Councils are expressly prevented from ordering action involving removal of a hedge.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499W.7/2">How far you can reduce a hedge before it is killed will vary according to the particular circumstances and, to illustrate the point, we give the example of a healthy Leyland cypress hedge which will usually respond well to a reduction by up to one-third whereas an older specimen may not. There will be circumstances where Leyland cypress, or other species, may be reduced by more than one-third without destroying them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499W.7/3">Where local councils have concluded that remedial action is required to ensure reasonable enjoyment of a property, it is for them to decide what height the hedge should be reduced to while ensuring its survival. That judgment depends on the species of the shrubs or trees in the hedge, their age and health, and past management. We recommend councils, therefore, to consider each case on its merits and to obtain arboricultural advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499W.7/4">Copies of 'High Hedges Complaints: Prevention and Cure' are available in the Library of the House. Further information is published on the Frequently Asked Questions pages of our website at <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk/treesandhedges">www.odpm.gov.uk/treesandhedges</a>, under the heading 'Remedial works'. This acknowledges that there may be some cases where councils could be prevented from requiring action that would provide a full remedy to the problems identified because it would kill the hedge. Nevertheless, they would still be able to order works that offer some relief to the complainant. In addition, if a complainant considers that the action specified in a remedial notice does not go far enough, they can appeal against the council's decision to the Planning Inspectorate.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-12-08a.31848.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-12-08a.1501W.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="1501W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051208/text/51208w19.htm#51208w19.html_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.1501W.6/1">Mainstream Government funding is, by its nature, determined by the relevant Government Departments based on their own procedures for allocating funding towards meeting their objectives under their Public Service Agreement. For most Government programmes, this is covered by the periodic spending reviews. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has been working with Departments towards ensuring that growth is given due consideration in the allocation of funding. In a number of cases this would follow in the ordinary course, simply because funding levels are based on (among other factors) population. In other cases, specific mechanisms are available to safeguard rapidly growing areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1501W.6/2">To give an example from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's own departmental expenditure, population is an important factor in the allocation of revenue support grant (RSG) to local authorities. As a result of recent changes to the formula for allocating RSG, namely the abolition of &quot;ceilings&quot; and (as from 2006&ndash;07) the use of forward-looking population data, local government funding will be more responsive to the relatively rapid population growth associated with growth areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1501W.6/3">By way of example from another Department, capital funding from the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) for new schools places responds formulaically to local authorities' estimates of pupil numbers. Local authorities in the growth areas should therefore be taking account of growth plans in their submission to DfES. Nonetheless, a &quot;safety valve&quot; mechanism has been put in place to allow exceptional needs resulting from unanticipated factors (which could include growth in pupil numbers) to be taken into account. A number of growth locations have accessed funding under this mechanism.</p>
	<p pid="a.1501W.6/4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has made grant funding available exclusively in support of projects in the growth areas. The total amount of such funding, up to and including 2007&ndash;08, is around &pound;1.25 billion. This does not include the &pound;200 million to be made available to the growth areas by Department for Transport under the community infrastructure fund. Expenditure beyond 2007&ndash;08 will be subject to the forthcoming Comprehensive Spending Review. This expenditure will lever in funding from other sources. For example, it was estimated that the initial round of ODPM funding (amounting to just over &pound;600m) would lever in funding of over &pound;3 billion from other public and private sector partners (not including Department for Transport funding).</p>
	<p pid="a.1501W.6/5">Private sector investment will respond to opportunities presented by the growth areas, e.g. investment by the privately owned utilities in water, wastewater and electricity supply infrastructure. In addition, housing developers will be expected to contribute to the infrastructure costs associated with housing development through Section 106 contributions. A good example of this is in Milton Keynes, where the local delivery vehicle Milton Keynes Partnerships Committee has been negotiating a standard charge of over &pound;18,000 per house from developers in the east and west expansion flanks. This will generate approximately &pound;300 million of funding to complement circa &pound;900 million of funding from public sources in support of infrastructure to facilitate construction of 15,000 houses to 2016.</p>

It aims to ensure that flood risk is taken into account at all stages in the planning process to avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding and to direct development away from areas at highest risk. PPG25 advises that the Environment Agency should be consulted on planning applications in flood risk areas, including areas shown on the Agency's Flood Maps, and that planning applications in such areas should be accompanied by a Flood Risk Assessment.

	<p pid="a.1515W.8/1">An environmental impact assessment (EIA) would almost certainly be necessary before any such proposal could be considered. EIA is mandatory for all open-cast mining at sites in excess of 25 hectares. In all other cases the proposals would be considered for EIA against the potential impacts, as would any works involving river canalisation in excess of 1 hectare. The Environment Agency would be consulted as part of the EIA process, and if it was decided in the light of the resulting environmental statement that the development should proceed, it could require conditions on the monitoring of river quality to be attached to the mineral permission. Planning policy for England is set out in PPS23, &quot;Planning and Pollution control Annex 1&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.1518W.2/1">Planning Policy Guidance note 3: Housing (PPG3), published in March 2000, asks local planning authorities to review their non-housing allocations of land (including employment land) when reviewing their development plan and consider whether some of this land might be better used for housing or mixed use developments. This built on the general policy approach in the previous PPG3 published in 1992.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518W.2/2">The PPG3 update 'Supporting the Delivery of New Housing', published in January this year, added a new paragraph to PPG3. This advocates the re-use of industrial and commercial land where it would be better used for housing and mixed use development unless a compelling case can be made for the retention of the current allocation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1523W.12/1">In 2003, the last year for which information is available, there were around 764,000 procedures on genetically modified animals, which represented 27 per cent. of all regulated procedures reported in that year. The number of actual animals used is very close to the number of procedures, because nearly all animals are used once only.</p>
	<p pid="a.1523W.12/2">The number of procedures carried out on animals carrying a genetic modification, broken down by species and type of procedure, is given in tables three and 3.3 of the annual publication Statistics of scientific procedures on living animals, Great Britain, 2003 (Cm 6291), a copy of which is in the Library. Over 97 per cent. of genetically modified animals used in 2003 were mice; most of the remainder were fish.</p>

	<p pid="a.1525W.2/2">The Home Secretary has held various discussions with other EU Ministers about illegal immigration from North Africa, both bilaterally and at EU level, including at recent JHA Councils and at the G5 in Evian. It has been a UK presidency priority to make progress on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.2/3">Illegal migration across the Mediterranean is an humanitarian problem affecting source, transit and host countries alike. Discussions have focused on the need to take urgent action to prevent loss of life at sea, tackle human trafficking and assist transit countries in North Africa to build capacity to manage migration flows more effectively. In parallel, there is a need for the EU and African countries to work in partnership to develop a comprehensive, long-term approach to strengthen and enhance dialogue and practical cooperation and to address the root causes of migration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525W.2/4">This approach was recognised by EU Heads of State at the informal summit in London on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October 2005</phrase> and is strongly reflected in the Commission Communication on Priority actions for improving migration management published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-30">30 November 2005</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.1527W.8/1">The current best estimate for the total average running costs for issuing passports and ID cards to UK nationals, for which fees will be charged, is &pound;584 million per annum, 70 per cent. of which is attributable to the cost of the biometric passport. Within our current best estimates of the ID cards scheme as a whole, it will be affordable to set a charge of &pound;30 at current prices for a stand-alone ID card, valid for 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1527W.8/2">The Home Office is not breaking this cost down further, nor publishing details of set-up costs because this information is commercially sensitive and discussion of estimated costs for individual elements of the scheme, such as the stand-alone identity card, may prejudice the procurement process by limiting the Department's ability to secure value for money from the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.1527W.8/3">The Government recognises the need to have independent assurance so the public can place trust in the figures produced. Thus, KPMG a world leading audit and accounting firm, were commissioned to produce an independent review of the costing methodology and key assumptions in the business case. They concluded that the methodology used to cost the identity cards proposals is robust and appropriate for this stage of development.</p>

	<p pid="a.1535W.2/1">Developing robust childminder networks attached to children's centres and extended schools is one of the objectives set out in the 10 year strategy for childcare. The Government have given local authorities the scope to use funding flexibly to develop and sustain childcare services, rather than allocate funds for specific purposes. Leeds city council will receive 405,982 over 2004&ndash;06 for the sustainability element of their Sure Start general grant. They will decide how much is required to support childminder networks, and where to direct this funding. The council can also use a proportion of their children's centre revenue funding (&pound;1,615,171 over 2004&ndash;06) on network development to meet the requirement to integrate childminders with children's centre services.</p>

	<p pid="a.1535W.5/1">We do not expect employers to pay for employees to attain the skills they need to give them a sound basis for sustainable employment in the economy. That is why we have introduced an entitlement to free training for adults who lack basic skills or a first full level 2 qualification. Beyond this, where there are tangible returns to business, the Government believe it is right that employers make an appropriate contribution to the cost of training provided through the further education system. We expect this contribution to grow to 50 per cent.&mdash;of course fees costs&mdash;by 2010. This is what we stated in the LSCs 'priorities for success' in October 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.1543W.2/1">Although the Department is not taking any steps specifically aimed at take-up of benefits in these areas, it maintains close working relationships at operational level with local authorities and the voluntary sector across the country, to ensure that all those entitled to services and benefits from the Department receive them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1543W.2/2">Nationally, we have recently begun the third annual publicity and marketing awareness campaign aimed at getting everyone who is entitled to council tax benefit to claim it.</p>

Activity has included direct mail, telephone calls and, where appropriate, home visits.

	<p pid="a.1543W.2/4">As with all matters relating to the Department's responsibilities, we maintain ongoing dialogue with the Welsh Assembly Government at an operational level.</p>

	<p pid="a.1546W.2/5" class="indent">The Departmental wide contract with EDS sets out a number of performance related criteria that are designed to measure their ability to deliver the operational services.

	<p pid="a.1546W.2/6" class="indent">The main criteria on which EDS performance is measured in respect of CS2 are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1546W.2/7" class="indent">The level of system availability (where the target is 99.2%);</p>
	<p pid="a.1546W.2/8" class="indent">Response times (where the target is 95% of responses within 3 seconds); and</p>

	<p pid="a.1549W.3/1">The Department for Work and Pensions has, in consultation with the Identity Cards programme, developed its current best estimate of the cost of using the ID Cards Scheme to support the services which it oversees and these costs have been incorporated into the business case. The Department is represented on the Ministerial Committee on Identity Cards which oversees the work on benefits planning and realisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1549W.3/2">In deriving these estimates account has to be taken of the types of use required to support the particular services which this Department oversees. Not all services will require a high degree of integration between the Identity Cards Scheme and other IT systems. Where there may be a need for integration, some costs can be absorbed into the usual cycles of system upgrades and technology refreshes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1549W.3/3">We cannot release the detailed estimated costs for integrating IT systems and the ongoing operation of the Identity Cards Scheme within the Department and the services which it oversees at this stage as these elements may be acquired from the market. The estimates are therefore commercially sensitive and to release them may prejudice the procurement process and the Department's ability to obtain value for money from potential suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1549W.6/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. She will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="a.1549W.6/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Leslie Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-08">8 December 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.1549W.6/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning how many Jobcentre Plus clients live more than 20 miles away from their nearest Jobcentre Plus office; and what arrangements are made to assist with their travel requirements. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1549W.6/4" class="indent">We do not hold information on the distance our customers have to travel to their nearest Jobcentre Plus office. However, this government is investing in modern, welcoming offices which provide a single point of access to Jobcentre Plus services. Previously, a customer may have had to visit a Jobcentre to access job vacancies, and a social security office to arrange payment of benefit. The new service brings both together in an integrated, personal service for customers. In fact, customers in receipt of benefit other than Jobseeker's Allowance have increased access to our offices, as there will be approximately double the number of Jobcentre Plus locations compared with the number of social security offices they could have previously contacted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1549W.6/5" class="indent">In planning the new network of Jobcentre Plus offices, local managers take into account many factors including population spread, availability and cost of public transport and the distance between offices. We aim to locate our new offices where there are good transport links. Inevitably as the office network changes, there will be some customers who will find they will have to travel further. Jobcentre Plus is actively working with local partners to ensure these hard to reach communities have access to services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1549W.6/6" class="indent">In many locations, particularly rural locations, we are often able to provide outreach facilities, ensuring access to job vacancies, advice and information through third party premises. In practice this means that with our new network, very few of our customers would have to travel more than 20 miles to access Jobcentre Plus services, other than in the most remote rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1549W.6/7" class="indent">Customers are now using our offices differently. More of our face-to-face customer contact is on an appointment basis and information on job vacancies is readily available by telephone and the internet. This enables staff in our offices to focus on those customers in greatest need of support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1549W.6/8" class="indent">There are long established rules for reimbursing travelling costs for Jobseeker's Allowance customers attending a Work Focused Interview, principally where the interview does not fall on their normal signing day. For normal fortnightly attendance to sign-on, customers are expected to meet the cost of their journey to the office. Where the closure of an office means customers having to travel over an hour to the nearest office, we will consider if postal signing is appropriate. Customers in receipt of Income Support and Incapacity Benefit can claim for reimbursement of their expenses in a similar way when requested to attend the office.</p>

	<p pid="a.1555W.6/1">We have regularly urged the Colombian Government to do more to tackle the issue of collusion between state officials and the paramilitary groups. President Uribe has publicly stated on a number of occasions that he will not tolerate such collusion and will act decisively against those who are proved to have such links. The Colombian Government has a clear duty to undertake thorough judicial investigations into all attacks and abuses, including those where there are credible allegations of collusion. We have made this point to the Colombians on many occasions and will continue to do so. We have also made it clear that a culture of impunity must not be allowed to flourish.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555W.6/2">We have been encouraged by recent, stronger action by the Colombians to address these issues. This has resulted in dismissals from the security forces, and in some cases, arrests and imprisonment of both high-ranking army officers and police. Such action sends a strong message that collusion with illegal groups and involvement in drug trafficking will not be tolerated. It also helps increase public confidence in the security forces. We commend the Colombian Government for this and urge them to continue, and strengthen, their efforts to crack down on collusion and to deny impunity to wrong-doers.</p>

I am placing in the Library of the House a copy of the Contact Group (United States, UK, France, Germany, Italy and Russia together with representatives of the European Union) Guiding Principles. These are there to support the work of the Status Envoy.</p>

The Department for International Development (DFID) looked into a justice programme, but could not proceed for lack of a suitable local partner. Further, there are several other donors present in Monrovia better placed to cover this sector. The UK, however, played a key role in negotiating and getting agreement on the Governance and Economic Management Assistance Programme (GEMAP), which has a justice component. The UK representative in Monrovia is also involved in the Rule of Law Taskforce, and DFID is running a governance programme with an anti-corruption component.</p>

For any peace talks to succeed the LRA needs to demonstrate that they are seriously pursuing a sustainable peace that ensures those indicted by the International Criminal Court face justice in The Hague.</p>

	<p pid="a.1568W.2/1">When the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline on the assessment and treatment of people with fertility problems was published in February 2004 we advised primary care trusts (PCTs) to offer a minimum of one cycle of invtro fertilisation (IVF) by April 2005 to those who meet the clinical criteria in the guideline, giving priority to couples with no children living with them. Following up the implementation of the guideline, NICE has carried out surveys measuring its impact and these are available on the NICE website at <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk">www.nice.org.uk</a> The surveys have found that 95 per cent. of the PCTs who responded are offering at least one cycle of IVF to those defined as eligible according to local criteria. The primary responsibility for the implementation of the clinical guideline on the assessment and treatment of people with fertility problems produced by NICE rests with the national health service at local level, in discussion with patients' groups and local health bodies. Local policies will reflect local needs and priorities. We have advised that we expect the NHS to make progress to full implementation of the guideline in the longer term.</p>

	<p pid="a.1571W.9/1">There has been some confusion between seasonal flu, avian flu and pandemic flu. Avian influenza is a disease which mainly affects birds. Seasonal flu refers to the viruses that circulate in the human population and cause widespread illness each winter. Pandemic flu will only occur after an avian virus has mutated into a strain to which large numbers of the population have not been exposed and which can spread easily between humans.</p>
	<p pid="a.1571W.9/2">We are finalising a contract for the purchase of a two to three million doses of vaccine against the H5N1 strain currently circulating in South East Asia and other areas. This vaccine can be used for research and for possible use for healthcare workers in an emergency, and may provide some limited protection against a pandemic emerging from that source. We hope to award this contract shortly and would receive some stocks early next year.</p>
