	<p pid="b.1022W.0/2">While we are supporting a range of automotive support initiatives, we do not believe that introducing a general wage subsidy for all employers is a feasible, cost effective and sustainable option for the UK.

	<p pid="b.1026W.2/2">The individualised learning record (ILR) data LSC collected for 2006/07 do not allow us to answer the specific questions on the range of grades achieved. However these data show that during the 2006/07 academic year there were a total of 68 GCSE achievements by 15 to 17-year-olds in Prison Service YOIs, of which:</p>
	<p pid="b.1026W.2/3" class="indent">19 people achieved one GCSE;</p>
	<p pid="b.1026W.2/4" class="indent">Five people achieved two GCSEs;</p>
	<p pid="b.1026W.2/5" class="indent">13 people achieved three GCSEs;</p>
	<p pid="b.1026W.2/6">The LSC's young persons' learning 1 (YOL1) data show that during the 2007/08 academic year, for young people under the age of 18, there were 106 GCSE achievements between grades A and C, and 159 GCSE achievements below grade C. However the data set allowing us to break this down into the number of people achieving different numbers of GCSEs (i.e. ILR) is not yet available for the 2007/08 academic year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1026W.2/7">Also, note that the figures quoted will not include all of the GCSEs achieved by young people in juvenile custody, as some young people in custody are still registered at schools and colleges and any GCSEs that they achieve while in custody will be reflected in achievement figures of schools and colleges, rather than the figures reported by the LSC in these statistics.</p>
	<p pid="b.1026W.2/8">Also, many young people stay in custody only for a very short time, and therefore it is not realistic for them to achieve long-term qualifications while they are in custody, especially as GCSEs can only be taken at certain points of the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1033W.0/1">There is no strict definition of &quot;community use&quot; in the Building Schools for the Future Programme. As set out in the Extended Schools prospectus, published in June 2005, the Government have encouraged all schools to offer a core set of extended services by 2010, including wider community access to sports facilities. However, it is up to individual governing bodies to decide the extent to which they do this, since they are responsible for controlling the occupation and use of school premises both during and out of school hours. Governing bodies are also best placed to define what the community is that each school serves.</p>
	<p pid="b.1033W.0/2">Secondary schools built or upgraded under the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme must conform to the Department's Building Bulletin (BB) 98, &quot;Briefing Framework for Secondary School Projects&quot;. This recommends that each school should have, as a minimum, a &quot;four-court&quot; sports hall designed to Sport England's specifications that cover community use. BB 98 also includes recommendations for outdoor sports pitches and games courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1033W.0/3">BSF investment is therefore ensuring that secondary schools will have sports facilities for use by the communities in which they are placed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1042W.9/1">The distribution of formula grant to local authorities in England takes account of the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the authority, together with its relative ability to raise council tax, expressed in terms of the council tax base. We then ensure that every authority receives at least a minimum percentage increase (the 'floor') year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. In order to pay for the cost of the floor, we scale back the increase in grant above the floor for other authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1042W.9/2">Since the introduction of multi-year settlements, we have used projected tax base data in the calculation of formula grant. The starting point for the tax base projections used in the current three-year settlement, covering 2008-09 to 2010-11, is the tax base as at <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-08">8 October 2007</phrase> adjusted for student exemptions. This is then increased annually by the Secretary of State's estimate of the average annual increase in the tax base for the authority between <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-10">10 October 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-08">8 October 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1042W.9/3">The actual discount applied to long-term empty homes is applied for all authorities in calculating the tax base for the purposes of distributing formula grant. Any reduction in the discount applied to long-term empty homes commencing after <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-08">8 October 2007</phrase>, will not be reflected in the projected taxbase calculations until the 2011-12 settlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1042W.9/4">Since <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>, although billing authorities have been able to reduce the council tax discount for second homes in their area (to between 10 and 50 per cent.), a discount of 50 per cent. has continued to be assumed for all authorities in calculating the tax base for the purposes of distributing formula grant.</p>

As required by the affordability criterion for the unitary bids, implementing the unitary proposals is self-financing, and the savings generated by the new unitary councils are available to be invested in front-line services or to reduce the pressure on council tax; hence, implementing a unitary council has no additional impact on departmental expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1043W.8/1">The final results from the Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) were published by the Audit Commission in March 2009. These showed the highest ever number of top-performing councils, with more than ever before assessed as 'improving strongly'.</p>
	<p pid="b.1043W.8/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April</phrase> we introduced the new system for assessment and inspection of local outcomes, Comprehensive Area Assessment (CAA), as part of the new local performance framework. CAA builds and improves on CPA, covering outcomes delivered by local authorities acting alone or in partnership, and is carried out jointly by six local public service inspectorates. The first CAA reports will be published in November 2009. For each local area the reports will comprise an area assessment&mdash;which looks at how well local public services are delivering local priorities and how likely they are to improve in the future&mdash;and organisational assessments of individual local public bodies, including local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1043W.8/3">Ahead of CAA, following sign-off of the new Local Area Agreements (LAAs) in June 2008, a review of local areas' initial efforts to prepare for LAA delivery was carried out by the Government Offices earlier this year. The review indicated that local authorities and their partners were progressing well with their LAAs, with the vast majority of areas strengthening partnership and delivery arrangements to enhance their ability to meet improvement targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1043W.8/4">Where performance issues are not being addressed sufficiently quickly or effectively in local areas, Government Offices will work with local partners and central Government to provide challenge, broker appropriate action, and monitor improvement. This may range from additional support from the local government sector, to consultancy support, inspection, or ultimately formal intervention action.</p>

In December, in the Government's reply to Sir Michael Pitt's Review, we said that the aim would be for an inaugural meeting in the first half of 2009. The National Security Forum has since met for the first time, in March, which has helped us review proposals for the National Resilience Forum. Detailed proposals and the issue of invitations will commence as soon as possible after this review is complete.</p>

	<p pid="b.1065W.2/1">The Diplomatic Service Compensation Allowance hardship allowance is based on scores supplied by an independent company, Employment Conditions Abroad (ECA). ECA score posts around the world in 16 different categories including personal security and socio-political tension, based on their own independent research and information derived from the annual location ranking survey completed by their member organisations. They reflect conditions for an average expatriate living in the city concerned. These scores are then re-weighted by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (multiplied by 1.389) to reflect the additional security risk staff may face because of their higher profile as official Government representatives overseas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1072W.5/1">The UK is opposed to torture and is one of the most active countries in the world in the fight to eradicate it. Ensuring the welfare of British nationals detained abroad is one of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's highest consular priorities, and any allegation of abuse or torture is taken particularly seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.1072W.5/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> we have collated statistics on the number of cases where we have, with the permission of the British national concerned, raised concerns with the detaining authorities over allegations of torture or abuse.

	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.1072W.5/5"> <td></td> <td><i> Number of allegations raised</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.1072W.5/6"> <td>April-December 2005</td> <td>39</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1072W.5/12">Our case files also record all instances where UK nationals have approached departmental staff overseas claiming to have been mistreated overseas. Until this month we did not centrally collate these records, and to extract this information would incur a disproportionate cost. However, since May 2009 we have introduced a new system to record the total number of cases of mistreatment raised with us anywhere in the world, and we expect the first data to be available in October 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.1072W.5/13">While we cannot conduct investigations in another sovereign country ourselves, the objective of our representations to foreign Governments is to end any ongoing mistreatment, and have the incident investigated and the perpetrators of any abuse brought to justice.</p>

Since 2002 the rate of evictions has slowed. Many of the remaining farmers have been forced to keep a low profile, so maintaining accurate records of farm ownership has been challenging for farming organisations.

	<p pid="b.1074W.5/1">The Government have made tackling health inequalities a top priority, and the most comprehensive programme ever in this country is in place to address them. For coronary heart disease (CHD), the target to reduce deaths from cardiovascular disease (CHD, stroke and related diseases) by 40 per cent. in people under 75 by 2010 was met five years early and the mortality rate has now fallen by 44 per cent. when compared to the 1995-97 baseline. Death rates from CHD between the most deprived areas and the national average has narrowed and we are on track to deliver the 2010 target of at least a 40 per cent. reduction in the gap.</p>
	<p pid="b.1074W.5/2">From April 2009, the national health service is being asked to implement a systematic and integrated vascular risk assessment and management programme&mdash;the NHS Health Check programme. This will provide a mechanism to identify earlier people at risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease and support them to reduce their risk through the provision of lifestyle advice and interventions, and smoking cessation, and preventative medication such as statins. The programme has significant potential to narrow inequalities and many primary care trusts (PCTs) are using it as a major tool in tackling health inequalities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1074W.5/3">Other mechanisms available include the work of the National Health Inequalities Support Team in spearhead areas (the areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators), the Health Inequalities Intervention Tool, jointly developed with the Association of Public Health Observatories that support PCTs and local authorities in local priority setting (including prioritising vascular conditions), planning and commissioning of services and the work of the Improvement Foundation Programme in improving early presentation of cardiovascular disease in the spearhead areas. This is in addition to the work that PCTs are doing to address some of the risk factors for vascular disease such as making available smoking cessation, weight management and physical activity programmes in a way that is accessible to the groups within the population who most need them.</p>

	<p pid="b.1076W.5/2">Article 4(8) of the Food Supplements Directive placed an obligation on the European Commission to submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the necessity for specific rules in relation to the use of substances in food supplements other than vitamins and minerals. This report was published in December 2008 and the Commission's conclusion was that the current legislative framework is sufficient to regulate the use of substances other than vitamins and minerals in food supplements and that additional legislation in this area is not justified at this stage. No additional information is held by the Department or the Food Standards Agency in relation to the report.</p>

	<p pid="b.1082W.5/1">For the period April 2007 to March 2008, the revenue raised from prescription charges collected by pharmacists and appliance contractors and from prescription prepayment certificate fees was &pound;432 million. In addition, dispensing doctors collect charges which are retained by primary care trusts and not collected centrally. Abolishing prescription charges in England would result in the loss of income available to the national health service.</p>

	<p pid="b.1086W.0/1">The expenditure figures in Table 5.2 of the Home Office Annual Report 2007-08 reflect those in the HM Treasury database as reported in the Main and Supplementary Estimates 2007-08 and approved by Parliament. To remain consistent with the figures approved by Parliament, information in the Annual Report was grouped under the Strategic Objectives published by the Home Office in February 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1086W.0/2">The expenditure identified in the table as dedicated to crime reduction resource covered a wide range of locally determined and national interventions aimed at tackling crime and antisocial behaviour. It formed an important contribution, along with investment in the Police Service, towards the delivery of an 18 per cent. reduction in crime between 2002-03 and 2007-08 as measured by the British Crime Survey. Over the same period, this expenditure also helped to secure a 24 per cent. reduction in crime within the 40 high crime areas. A detailed breakdown of expenditure by activity could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1095W.6/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is aware that some countries supported by the Global Fund are at risk from health facility stores temporarily running out of essential antiretroviral drugs (stock-outs). DFID officials have spoken to the fund's secretariat about this, including recently at the Global Fund's Executive Board (5-<phrase class="date" code="2009-05-06">6 May 2009</phrase>). Formally, the UK supported a resolution made at the board meeting which obliges the fund's secretariat to address this issue urgently, to report on whether its existing procedures are adequate, and to propose solutions which would minimise the risks of disruptions to treatment both in the short term and on an ongoing basis. In developing countries such as Zimbabwe, DFID is also assisting, where possible, in the provision of drugs while problems in Global Fund supported programmes are being addressed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1096W.2/1">The UK Government have taken various steps through different channels to mitigate the adverse effects of the economic crisis on developing countries. These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1096W.2/2" class="indent">Taking the appropriate steps to restore growth at home which will reinvigorate trade and financial flows to developing countries;</p>
	<p pid="b.1096W.2/3" class="indent">Acting through multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and IMF to provide timely and effective assistance; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1096W.2/4" class="indent">Providing support directly through our bilateral programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1096W.2/5">Through its leadership, the UK was instrumental in the announcements made at the London Summit to increase the resources of the IMF including the extension of special drawing rights (SDRs) which will provide vital assistance to developing countries facing short-term balance-of-payments problems. In total, an additional $50 billion was made available to low income countries (LICs).</p>
	<p pid="b.1096W.2/6">In March this year, DFID pledged &pound;200 million towards the rapid social response fund to be administrated by the World Bank providing immediate help to meet the daily needs of the poorest people in the poorest countries in the economic downturn.</p>
	<p pid="b.1096W.2/7">DFID continues to work closely with our development partners and international financial institutions to ensure that developing countries are provided with timely and effective assistance&mdash;e.g. capital increases for the Asian Development Bank; reforms to the exogenous shock facility (ESF).</p>
	<p pid="b.1096W.2/8">DFID will be spending more on its bilateral programmes than ever before&mdash;2009-10 budget is &pound;2.6 billion. We remain committed to achieving the target of 0.7 per cent. of gross national income (GNI) devoted to official development assistance (ODA) by 2013.</p>
	<p pid="b.1096W.2/9">Country programmes are designed to be flexible to respond to changing needs. Where appropriate, existing scheduled country programme spend has been adjusted accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1096W.5/2">The spring meetings helped to underline support for optimal use of the Bank's balance sheet, with lending of up to $100 billion over three years. The UK, along with other shareholders, welcomed Bank initiatives to protect the poorest, reinvigorate trade finance, maintain investment in infrastructure and support the financial sector. We expect these initiatives to complement DFID's own programmes and projects in the countries in which we work together.</p>

UXO has been cleared from all UN Relief and Works Agency schools, as well as other public areas such as market places.

	<p pid="b.1099W.8/1">Applications to alter the register of title are made using the forms and procedures prescribed by the land registration legislation. Applications must be accompanied by the appropriate documents and evidence needed to justify the alteration. Land Registry publishes a range of public and practice guides that provide guidance about the different types of application that can be made.</p>

If an application is not in order Land Registry may reject it on receipt or may send a written requisition for the defect to be put right. The application may be cancelled if the requisition is not complied with by a specified date.</p>
	<p pid="b.1099W.8/4">In some cases notice of an application is sent to interested parties and time is allowed for them to agree or object to the application. Any objection which is not groundless and cannot be resolved by agreement is referred for hearing by the adjudicator to HM Land Registry and the application cannot then be completed until the dispute has been resolved.</p>
	<p pid="b.1099W.8/5">If the application is in order, or when all requisitions and objections have been dealt with, the application is approved and the register is altered. The alteration takes effect from the time when Land Registry received the application.</p>

	<p pid="b.1104W.2/1">Department for Transport Ministers have not had any recent discussions with representatives of West Lancashire district council. However, Ministers have had discussions with representatives of other councils within the Lancashire region.</p>
	<p pid="b.1104W.2/2">Departmental officials have met with representatives of the Lancashire Concessionary Travel Scheme, of which West Lancashire is a member. This group comprises the districts and unitary authorities of Lancashire plus the county council. These discussions focused on the concerns that some local authorities in Lancashire have regarding the allocation of concessionary travel special grant funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.1104W.2/3">I am aware that authorities within the Lancashire County Scheme already choose to pool a proportion of their funding. This year West Lancashire will receive &pound;252,714 of special grant funding to meet the cost of the new England-wide concession. This represents an increase of 23 per cent. on the authority's spend on concessionary travel in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1104W.2/4">As funding for concessionary travel is not ring-fenced, local authorities are free to spend the money on any services, provided they meet their statutory obligations. This is consistent with wider policy on local government funding of giving authorities greater freedom and flexibility.</p>

The Department for Transport therefore provided no separate funding to West Lancashire district council for concessionary bus travel from 2001, when the statutory minimum was first introduced, until 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1104W.5/2">The Department did however provide West Lancashire with &pound;50,404 in 2007-08 for the cost of producing and issuing the new England-wide bus passes to all those eligible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1104W.5/3">In 2008-09 West Lancashire district council received additional special grant funding from the Department for Transport of &pound;246,891 to meet the additional cost of the new, England-wide concession.

	<p pid="b.1106W.0/1">There is no requirement to annuitise at any age. Rather there is a requirement that an income be taken from pension savings by age 75.</p>
	<p pid="b.1106W.0/2">The Government have considered this requirement to secure an income from a pension fund at age 75 in light of recent conditions in financial markets but has no plans to change it. 95 per cent. of people take an income from their pension savings by the age of 70.</p>
	<p pid="b.1106W.0/3">The current rules already allow a considerable degree of flexibility. A pension income can currently commence at any time between the ages of 50 and 75, and can be taken from a pension fund without annuitising, through income drawdown. Even at 75, it is not compulsory to annuitise; alternatively secured pensions are available for those for whom they are suitable and who do not wish to buy an annuity.</p>

These suspensions have been applied because staff are under police investigation for matters in their private lives, because they are under criminal investigation by HMRC's internal investigators, or because they are under investigation for potentially serious disciplinary offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.1108W.8/4">Both Departments keep their disciplinary policies under review.</p>
