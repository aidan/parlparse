	<p pid="c.1048W.2/1">The Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) is a loan guarantee to encourage additional bank lending to viable SMEs that lack collateral to secure a normal commercial loan. As such, the Department does not allocate funds to particular sectors or businesses. But rather it is for the accredited lender to make commercial lending decisions to individual SMEs seeking finance on a case-by-case basis. The Department plays no role in the application or decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1048W.2/2">The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC code) for each business offered and/or drawing down a loan backed by EFG is recorded. Whilst businesses in these sectors comprise elements of several SIC codes we are able to give the following estimate of lending to businesses under EFG since its launch in January 2009 to date.</p>
	<p pid="c.1048W.2/3">As of <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-02">2 December</phrase>, over 760 businesses in the tourism sector have been offered loans with a value of almost &#163;68 million. Of which, nearly 640 businesses have drawn down loans totalling over &#163;56 million. As for the creative industries sector, over 670 businesses have been offered loans with a value of over &#163;76 million. Of which, over 600 businesses have drawn down loans totalling over &#163;66 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1048W.2/4">In addition, the Government acknowledge that creative industries sector businesses-particularly those relying on intangible assets-may suffer particular difficulties in accessing the finance that they need. For this reason, in &quot;Financing Growth: The Government's response to financing a private sector recovery&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-01">1 November</phrase>, the Government announced that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport will work together to understand whether creative businesses are experiencing greater difficulties than others in accessing financing. This review will be carried out to a Budget 2011 timetable.</p>

	<p pid="c.1051W.3/1">The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) uses two mechanisms to ensure the value for money of its expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.3/2">Firstly, NERC adopts standard HM Treasury guidance on its decisions regarding major equipment purchases, conducting a rigorous business case process that accommodates investment appraisal evidence. NERC ensures the level of delegated authority afforded to individual budget holders and the sub-committees they manage is appropriate to their level of experience and training. For example, approximately &#163;100 million of NERC's expenditure is awarded as research grants, each of which are subject to a rigorous and independent process that assesses value for money before authorisation. All of these internal mechanisms are then supported by NERC's involvement with the Research Councils' Shared Service Centre whose strategic and operational procurement functions ensure NERC's expenditure is spent with the most competitively priced suppliers who have met their assessment of quality goods or service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.3/3">Secondly, NERC contributes to Research Council targets for value for money savings, administrative efficiency and asset disposals. The original targets were set out in the NERC allocation of the science budget for 2008-09 to 2010-11 (dated October 2007) and have since been increased as part of the April 2009 Budget. The specific level of the NERC contribution to these targets is agreed collectively by Research Councils through the Value for Money Efficiency Delivery Project Board. This board reports quarterly to my Department, recording savings achieved and forecasting savings for the remainder of the spending review period. These savings are subject to independent audit by the Research Councils' Internal Audit Service.</p>

	<p pid="c.1051W.6/1">The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), via its Research Centres and Surveys, its science programmes and knowledge exchange activities, engages directly and frequently with private sector marine science providers and their representative trade bodies, through a range of formal and informal mechanisms and interactions. Collectively these strategic partnerships inform the development of NERC strategy for its science programmes, knowledge exchange activities and the delivery of national capability and infrastructure. Such engagement enables the exploitation of NERC funded science in support of new business developments in the marine and maritime sector and contributes knowledge to inform the sustainable development of the wider industrial community.</p>
	<p pid="c.1051W.6/2">NERC has recently engaged with private marine science providers during its Ship Management Review which it completed in February 2009. NERC met ship owners in the UK, Ireland and Germany and three private sector ship operating companies. The review demonstrated that NERC manages its ship operations to a level of efficiency and effectiveness that matches industry standards. NERC continues to monitor its performance against that of commercial operators of Government research ships. In addition, since 1987 NERC has been a member of the International Research Ship Operators' Meeting which shares best practice in Government research ship operations. The group now consists of 19 countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.1054W.10/1">The Prime Minister's Office and the Deputy Prime Minister's Office form an integral part of the Cabinet Office. The Cabinet Office, including its agencies and non-departmental public bodies, follows the specifications set out in the UK Government's Timber Procurement Policy when purchasing timber. This policy requires that all timber and wood-derived products procured by central Government Departments must be exclusively from independently verifiable legal and sustainable sources or FLEGT (Forest Law, Enforcement, Governance and Trade) licensed timber or equivalent. Such procurements are carried out either by the Department's total facilities manager providers or via a framework contract.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.10/2">The policy's definition of sustainability is based on internationally agreed criteria for sustainable forest management. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (UN FAO) have not set criteria for sourcing sustainable timber as such, but refer to the same internationally agreed criteria. Therefore, the Department's compliance with any criteria to which the UN FAO would refer to is ensured.</p>

	<p pid="c.1059W.0/1">There is no agreed definition of net neutrality. However, the Government are absolutely committed to an open internet. The internet has brought huge economic and social benefits across the world, precisely because of its openness and that must continue.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.0/2">A contributing factor to the success of the internet has been the lack of legislative restraints that have been placed on it. It is our belief that improved transparency requirements provided by recent revisions to the Electronic Communications Framework, along with a competitive market place and the ability to easily switch providers will mean that regulation in this area will be unnecessary. It is important that we give the market the opportunity to self-regulate, but Ofcom will closely monitor how the market develops and if it develops in an anti-competitive way they will intervene.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.0/3">In addition, I have made it clear that the Government expect all operators providing an internet access service-both fixed and mobile-to offer all legal content. Consumers should always be able to access any content or service they want to and at the speed they have contracted with their ISP to receive, while content providers and applications should be able to access consumers. ISPs should not be able to discriminate unfairly against services or users. That means no blocking or discriminatory degradation of services or applications for commercial reasons.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.0/4">There is not yet any evidence that discriminatory practices are emerging in the UK, or that there is a problem with regards to how ISPs or networks manage the traffic that flows over them (something they all engage in for technical reasons to deliver the best possible service to consumers). And this is reinforced by the initial responses to Ofcom's recent consultation on the issue. However, I would like to stress again that should the market develop in a way that damages openness or impedes innovation in spite of the safeguards I have detailed above, we will not hesitate to step in to ensure that the internet remains the open, innovative place we all benefit from.</p>

	<p pid="c.1059W.3/2">The latest anticipated final cost (AFC) of the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) programme is forecast at &#163;7.232 billion as set out in the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games Quarterly Report published in November 2010. As reported since February 2010, the ODA will take on additional responsibilities for the operation of the Olympic Park, and its venues and facilities, between 2011 and the handover to legacy owners. The additional forecast funding of around &#163;126 million for this work will bring the ODA's AFC figure to around &#163;7.358 billion.</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.3/3">Following the Government's spending review announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-20">20 October 2010</phrase>, the total public sector funding package for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games remains at &#163;9.3 billion. The funding package will, however, be reconfigured to reflect the changing focus of the programme from construction to operational delivery, as described in the latest Quarterly Report on the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, a copy of which has been placed in the Libraries of the House, or can be accessed at:</p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.3/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk/publications/7535.aspx">http://www.culture.gov.uk/publications/7535.aspx</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1059W.3/5">The reconfigured funding package will provide funding to ensure that all venues are secure, during the preparatory phase, through six weeks of Olympic and Paralympic competition, and for defined operational requirements. These requirements include shared responsibilities for the safety of spectators and visitors between transport hubs and sporting venues where existing budgets cannot cover the additional requirement, and specific extra responsibilities for host local authorities where the burden imposed for Games-time operations is of such a scale that it should not be borne solely by local council-tax payers. The Government also remain committed to the public sector funding half of the incremental cost of the Paralympic Games. The remainder of the funding package-around &#163;0.5 billion-will be held as an Olympic contingency for cross-programme issues, including any major changes in security circumstances. Further details will be included in the next Annual Report for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games which is due to be published in February 2011.</p>

	<p pid="c.1063W.3/2">The coalition Government's approach differs from that of the last Government. While the network helped schools to increase participation rates in the areas targeted by the previous Government, the fact remains that the proportion of pupils playing competitive sport regularly has remained disappointingly low.</p>

	<p pid="c.1066W.5/1">DECC follows the sustainable operations on the Government estate framework which sets targets and standards for sustainable operations, including procurement, within central Government. Under this framework, only timber and timber products that comply with the UK Government's timber procurement policy, i.e. timber originating from independently verified legal and sustainable sources, or from licensed Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) partners, can be required for use on the Government estate.</p>

	<p pid="c.1066W.5/3">DECC is in the process of setting up its own in-house procurement section having previously used the procurement services of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and more recently a shared service with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.

	<p pid="c.1071W.0/1">Benzodiazepines have been used for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia since the early 1960s. When the Medicines Act 1968 came into force in 1971 all medicines that were on the United Kingdom market at the time were automatically given a Product Licence of Right (PLR). The licence for lorazepam (brand name Ativan) was originally issued by the then Medicines Division of the Department of Health and Social Security in 1972. For products with a PLR, product information had been prepared by the manufacturers and the PLRs were subsequently reviewed by the Committee for the Review of Medicines (CRM), an independent scientific advisory body set up for this purpose. CRM advised that full product licences should be granted for lorazepam.</p>
	<p pid="c.1071W.0/2">In 2008 the product licences for all oral Ativan products were cancelled following a notification from the then marketing authorisation holder (Wyeth) stating that these products along with a number of other Wyeth products were no longer marketed in the UK. This notification was made under Article 23a of 2001/83/EC (as amended) which requires the marketing authorisation holder to notify the competent authority if the product ceases to be placed on the market either temporarily or permanently.</p>
	<p pid="c.1071W.0/3">Since 1980, a total of 26 generic licences have been granted for lorazepam containing products and the dates of authorisation of these product licences are provided in the following table. No clinical trial data were submitted in support of these licence applications. Under Directive 2001/83/EC clinical trial data are not required for generic licences. Article 10.1 of the directive enables applications for generic medicinal products to refer to the safety and efficacy data of the reference product provided bioequivalence to the reference product has been demonstrated. After a period of clinical use (10 years in the UK) safety and efficacy will have been better established and repetitive tests on humans or animals are not justified without over-riding cause. Since 2003, approximately 5,200 product licences have been granted under Article 10.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC, encompassing around 400 drug substances. Prior to this date records are not held in a similar searchable form.</p>
	<p pid="c.1071W.0/4">Under the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's record management policy all application files (files that are submitted by a manufacturer for the licensing of a product) and data for licences are held for 15 years. After this period, files are destroyed unless there is a legal, regulatory, or business need to keep them, or unless they are considered to be of lasting historic interest. In line with this policy the original licence applications for lorazepam, diazepam, nitrazepam and oxazepam products are no longer held.</p>

	<p pid="c.1078W.12/1">In September the Secretary of State visited the work of the Protection of Basic Services programme in Ethiopia, which is helping to train some 9 million farmers in new agricultural techniques. My right hon. Friend stayed with farmers in a district in the south of the country who had benefited from this support and observed the new higher value crops that had been introduced as a result.</p>
	<p pid="c.1078W.12/2">I have visited several such projects since June 2010. In Uganda I met with the Northern Ugandan Farmers Cooperative, a network of around 30 cooperatives across the Acholi region, which brings together farmers (up to 3,000 in each location) to store and sell produce and to learn new methods of production. I have also visited the Land Tenure Regularisation programme in Rwanda, which is registering landholders to provide them with security of their ownership and encourage investments, and the terraces building programme under the Social Protection Programme. While in Nigeria, I visited the PrOpCom agriculture programme, designed to enhance commodity and services market development in the agriculture sector. I have also witnessed how private sector investment and innovative business models are providing livelihood opportunities in Ghana, through the Ghana Grains Partnership (GGP) Maize Farm. I also visited a tree nursery in Ghana and stayed with a family in their hut in Gupanerigu, Northern Ghana, who were maize and groundnut farmers. In Sierra Leone I met farmers from Bo district where we discussed the issues of land licensing, market access and labour skills, especially for women. While in Tanzania I launched the Coastal Rural Support Programme (CRSP) where I met representatives from farmer groups that have already benefited from the programme in the neighbouring region of Lindi.</p>

Such a directive would have its legal base in article 126(14) of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union and would be agreed by Qualified Majority Voting: according to the current Commission proposal member states would have three years to comply with its provisions. The UK has a high quality and robust national framework, with independent fiscal and statistical authorities and a multiannual budgetary framework. This means that the UK would already comply with many of the proposed minimum standards.</p>

The retail prices index (RPI) includes mortgage interest payments, which caused it to fall in 2009, leading to some elements of the state pension-principally additional pensions (i.e. SERPS and S2P)-being frozen.</p>
