	<p pid="a.1064W.8/1">The Highways Agency is obliged, by the Environmental Protection Act 1990, to remove litter from motorways, including the central reservations, verges, and embankments. This arrangement has regard to the nature and use of the highway, and the need to limit disruption to traffic. To comply with the Act, which specifies, through a supplementary code of practice, standards of cleanliness and response times, the agency undertakes a regime of sweeping and litter picking on the M60 motorway.</p>
	<p pid="a.1064W.8/2">Litter picking on the verges and embankments is undertaken at three-monthly intervals on the M60. The offside lane and central reserve are also routinely swept and litter-picked every three months.</p>
	<p pid="a.1064W.8/3">The hard shoulders are swept every two months. Where the agency's daily routine inspections identify a particular problem, additional litter picking and sweeping is undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1064W.8/4">The high winds of <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-18">18 January</phrase> scattered litter across vegetation and against motorway fencing and safety barriers, making it even more visually intrusive. The agency responded by increasing the scale of its litter picking activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.1069W.7/2">In 2006-07 DFID expects to provide 70 per cent. of its support to Afghanistan to the government budget. &pound;10 million was channelled through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), a multi-donor pooled fund which supports the government's operating costs and priority development activities but earmarked for specific programmes. These included &pound;5 million each for the National Solidarity Programme (NSP), and the Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA). NSP has so far created 16,000 community development councils across all 34 provinces of Afghanistan with over &pound;147 million spent on over 22,000 projects in the areas of agriculture, education, health, irrigation, power, public buildings, transport and water supply. MISFA has so far provided small loans to 234,000 clients. Nearly 75 per cent. of those receiving loans are women.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069W.7/3">A further &pound;10 million has been committed as our first contribution to the Helmand Agriculture and Rural Development Programme (HARDP), a programme to facilitate the roll-out of the government of Afghanistan's national programmes specifically in Helmand province. To date 150 wells are being constructed, with a further 150 wells and 49km of road construction commencing this week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069W.7/4">&pound;50 million of this was channelled as unearmarked support to the ARTF. Three-quarters of all ARTF funds are spent on civil servants in key service delivery sectors. For example, 40 per cent. goes towards salaries for 100,000 teachers each month. We have in place robust safeguards to ensure DFID money is being well spent. The World Bank, as administrator of the ARTF, ensures rigorous checks against all payments made from that fund, which are only reimbursed if they are considered eligible. Annual ARTF audits are undertaken by an independent accounting firm. These reports have been favourable and show improving financial management trends. By law, the government has to submit the national budget audit to Parliament. This was done for the first time in 2006. Also DFID has been leading the group of donors to the ARTF, in setting up a monitoring mechanism to better assess the development impact from ARTF funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069W.7/5">In the case of HARDP, we provide the funding direct to an account at the Ministry of Finance. All procurement procedures use the recently adopted government law based on World Bank procurement best practice. Given that HARDP is supporting existing programmes, the existing monitoring and audit systems are used, managed by the World Bank. In addition the Ministry of Finance are required to provide DFID with annual audited statements by the government of Afghanistan Auditor General.</p>

	<p pid="a.1071W.0/2">The Ministry of Defence regularly receives and actions requests for a wide range of equipment. Some of these are addressed through existing resources; other emerging requirements are met through the Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) process. The UOR process is an effective means of providing new capabilities for use in theatre, and we receive a large number of requests through this process. Since early 2006, when the decision to deploy into southern Afghanistan was announced 261 UORs have been approved, of which 108 have already been delivered; the others are in progress. These UORs were identified by UK commanders either in Afghanistan or in the UK.</p>

One of the objectives of the development brief was to address the parking shortfall in Coleraine town centre. The Department is currently assessing the development proposals which have been submitted in response to the development brief. It is hoped that the Department will be in a position to appoint a preferred developer or developers for these sites by mid 2007. This would allow construction work to commence on one of them by early 2008 and be completed by mid 2009.</p>

	<p pid="a.1077W.3/1">In considering possible changes to the current compensation arrangements, discussions within the Cattle Compensation Advisory Group have focussed on the industry representatives' suggestions for enhancing compensation rates (in the identified sectors) for 'higher quality stock'.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.3/2">A decision on how we consult interested parties about possible system changes will be made once the different suggestions have been fully evaluated. As noted previously, any changes would need to be justified and fair to farmers and the taxpayer. They would also need to take account of the extensive evidence on the level of over-valuation experienced under the previous system based on individual valuations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1077W.6/1">Mobile phones are a good example of widely used products where much has already been done&mdash;by producers and consumers&mdash;to reduce waste. However, more can and should be done to reduce the impacts of waste disposal at each stage of the product cycle.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.6/2">DEFRA is working closely with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on the implementation of the EU waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) directive, which, from July this year, will make producers financially responsible for the treatment and recycling of electronic equipment, including mobile phones, when it becomes waste. In particular, DEFRA have made the regulations transposing the treatment and permitting requirements of the directive, which are intended to improve the environmental performance of operators directly involved in the treatment of WEEE.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077W.6/3">DEFRA also worked with the DTI on the implementation of the EU RoHS (restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment) directive. Since <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-01">1 July 2006</phrase>, the RoHS regulations have restricted the use of six substances in the manufacture of mobile phones and other electrical and electronic equipment, meaning that they will be easier to treat and recycle when they become waste.</p>

We have published a Regulatory Impact Assessment and a Race Equality Impact Assessment, and both the legislation itself and the operation of the scheme must comply with the Human Rights Act 1998 and Data Protection Act 1998. The Identity Cards Act makes unauthorised disclosure of information from the National Identity Register a criminal offence.

	<p pid="a.1094W.8/1">The unduly lenient sentence scheme can have an impact on the prison population to the extent that references by the Law Officers result in some sentences being increased by the Court of Appeal. However, the Law Officers' power to refer cases is limited to sentences passed for certain criminal offences and only where they are considered to be unduly lenient.

	<p pid="a.1101W.6/3" class="indent">The China Task Force was set up in November 2003 at the request of the our Prime Minister and the Chinese Premier, and since that time has been working to deepen relations, foster mutual understanding, and further co-operation between China and the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.6/4" class="indent">It has met in full on nine occasions. Three of these meetings took place last year, and the next meeting is due to take place shortly. The Task Force last met in full on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-12">12 September 2006</phrase>, prior to Premier Wen's visit to the UK. Members of the Task Force met Premier Wen during the visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.6/5" class="indent">Much of the Task Force's work is carried out through sub-groups and correspondence. For example, in November last year I held a meeting with senior members of the China British Business Council and in December with a group of sustainability experts to discuss sustainable cities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.6/6" class="indent">The Task Force has developed into a strategic high level contact mechanism, recognised and valued by the Chinese. Its achievements include the recommendation of annual Prime Minister level summits between the UK and China, signature of a high-level Dialogue on Sustainable Development issues, and enhanced co-ordination across Government of policy initiatives relating to China in the 7 key areas under its remit. The Task Force agreed a new focus on sustainable cities at its last meeting and work is ongoing to present a framework paper on this issue to the Chinese Government during my next visit to China in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101W.6/7" class="indent">Details of China Task Force meetings and achievements are listed on the DPMO website at <a href="http://www.dpm.gov.uk">www.dpm.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid="a.1109W.5/1">Schools receive funding for personalised learning through the following funding streams: the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG), the Standards Fund (SF) and the School Standards Grant for Personalisation (SSG(P)). The DSG is distributed to local authorities who should consult locally through their schools forum to decide how best to distribute it in a way that reflects national priorities and local needs. The SF is allocated to local authorities who should target this funding at those schools with the highest number of pupils who have fallen behind.

	<p pid="a.1109W.5/14">This funding reflects the Government's commitment to tailor the support available for every child that allows them to reach their full potential, irrespective of their background or circumstances. This also provides extra support for those who need additional help to catch up and those who need further stretch to develop a particular gift or talent. Schools need to decide on their own plans to deliver personalised learning and determine how best to invest their additional resources and deploy their staff to deliver them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1110W.3/2">The final selection panel consists of sponsors advised by a DfES representative. Sometimes a LA representative is present as an observer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1110W.3/3">In addition, we have employed an executive recruitment agency to conduct a national advertisement (to provide a pool of potential principals who have passed an assessment centre and interview process).

	<p pid="a.1112W.5/2">We expect to have the report finalised in March and will disseminate key lessons and findings shortly after to all local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1112W.5/3">It is the responsibility of local authority children's services to provide support for runaways. They have statutory responsibility for safeguarding children in their area and are best placed to assess the needs of runaways, and if deemed necessary, to provide them with overnight accommodation. Different options already exist, such as emergency foster care and placement in a children's home, and this will remain the case after April.</p>
	<p pid="a.1112W.5/4">Most children who run away do not require refuge though; they need counselling support and mediation services to help them return home and to address the causes of their running away, and local children's services can provide this. The number of runaways requiring immediate accommodation in any one area is likely to be low, and specialised 'static refuge' may not be seen as a sustainable, effective or cost-effective way of providing solutions to the problems young people face.</p>

	<p pid="a.1113W.2/1">The Department has not itself commissioned research into the specific impact of adverse Ofsted inspections. However, a number of reports have been produced which examine the impact of inspection, including in relation to the impact of adverse Ofsted inspections on individual schools. Ofsted published, in July 2004, 'Improvement through Inspection&mdash;An evaluation of the impact ofOfsted's work'. The National Audit Office (NAO) published 'Improving poorly performing schools in England' in January 2006. In November 2006, Ofsted published 'Improving behaviour: lessons learned from HMI monitoring of secondary schools where behaviour has been judged unsatisfactory'.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113W.2/2">The evidence indicates that an adverse Ofsted inspection report can be a catalyst to turning around poorly performing schools and most schools judged to be causing concern go on to make the necessary improvements. Based on evidence from monitoring visits of schools in a category of concern which have unsatisfactory behaviour, there is steady progress between these visits in eliminating unsatisfactory behaviour. In relation to learning outcomes, evidence from the NAO report shows that GCSE results for schools that have come out of Special Measures or benefited from Fresh Start do improve. The evidence has not specifically addressed the self-esteem of pupils in schools causing concern. However, Ofsted estimates that around half a million pupils have benefited from a better education as a result of improvements generated by special measures.</p>

The Good Practice Guidance on ASDs which the Department published, in association with the Department of Health, in 2002 encourages local authorities to develop and range of provision to meet the range of autistic children's needs. This would include provision in mainstream schools and in units attached to such schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1114W.2/2">The Good Practice Guidance gave pointers to good practice for local authorities, schools, including mainstream secondary schools, and others to help them develop and audit their autism provision. A number of local authorities and the Regional Partnerships, funded by the Department, have produced guidance to support pupils with ASDs in mainstream secondary schools, such the North West Region's guidance on strategies for accessing the curriculum at key stages 3 and 4 for children with autism.</p>
	<p pid="a.1114W.2/3">The Department, through its Autism Working Group, is beginning to develop an ASD resource pack for schools, including mainstream secondary schools. The pack will complement the Good Practice Guidance by giving practical advice to schools on meeting the needs of children with ASDs and will be developed as part of the SEN strategy's Inclusion Development Programme in association with the National Primary and Secondary Strategies.</p>

However, the &quot;Children's Homes&mdash;National Minimum Standards&quot; (NMS) and &quot;Children Missing from Care and from Home&mdash;a guide to good practice&quot;, issued by Government in 2002, specifies that upon return to a children's home after being missing, a young person should be given the opportunity for a return interview, to discuss the reasons for their absence. These standards require children's homes to keep written records of the circumstances of all missing incidents, including reasons for absence given by the young person. Records are made available when homes are inspected by officers from the Commission for Social Care Inspection.</p>
	<p pid="a.1115W.8/3">Also, it has always been policing good practice to interview all runaway and missing persons on return, to establish why they went missing, where they went, were they victims or perpetrators of crime, and whether they came to any other form of harm. The National Centre of Police Excellence estimate that 90 per cent. of children are spoken to as part of this return-home process. This is formalised in the 2005 Association of Chief Police Officers' document &quot;Guidance on the Management, Recording and Investigation of Missing Persons&quot;.</p>

In order to fulfil this duty they have powers to propose changes to the provision of schools. These include the power to propose the closure of a secondary school where this is judged to be in the best interests of local pupils. In doing so, local authorities will take account of the number of pupils to cater for and the range of provision to be offered. They will continue to do so in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1118W.5/1">Ministers at the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) are responsible for school food policy, including final decisions on standards for school food. The School Food Trust (SFT) is a Non-Departmental Public Body, established by DfES as its key delivery partner for school food. Its objectives include working with schools, local authorities and others to identify and, where possible, overcome barriers to transforming school food. It is also responsible for developing a strategy to increase demand for school lunches by at least 4 percentage points by March 2008 and 10 percentage points by autumn 2009. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is an independent Government Department established to protect the public's health and consumer interests in relation to food. It advises DfES on scientific and technical aspects including food safety, nutrition and diet.</p>
	<p pid="a.1118W.5/2">Responsibility for ensuring the school food standards are met rests with local authorities. This responsibility is transferred to the governing body of any school that has the budgetary element for school lunches delegated to them. Ultimately, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills has powers to direct a school to meet the standards where they are failing to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1118W.5/3">The School Meals Review Panel (SMRP) was established by DfES to advise on standards for school lunches. It reported to Ministers in September 2005 and, as part of its wider recommendations, recommended the standards it proposed for school lunches be extended to cover food other than lunch. DfES Ministers subsequently commissioned the SFT to develop such wider standards. Based on the recommendations of both the SMRP and the SFT, DfES Ministers announced final standards for all school food in May 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1118W.5/4">During the formulation of these recommendations, evidence was considered from a variety of sources including published scientific studies, evaluative projects and lessons learnt from schools and local authorities. Reports giving details of the recommendations and sources of information are at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1118W.5/6">Officials from the FSA acted as observers at SMRP meetings and provided technical advice on the standards. The FSA has also developed voluntary target nutrient specifications for manufactured foods used in school meals, which will help schools work towards meeting the nutrient standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1118W.5/7">In March 2006, the SFT undertook its &quot;First Annual Survey of School Meals Take-up in Schools in England&quot;. Results from this survey were published in July 2006. The next SFT annual survey will be undertaken in April 2007 and results will be published in May 2007. All results will be available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1119W.2/2">The strategy is delivering an ambitious public service agreement target to increase the percentage of 5-16 year olds who spend a minimum of two hours a week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent. by 2006 and then 85 per cent. by 2008. The 2005-06 school sport survey results found that overall, 80 per cent. of pupils of the 17,122 schools taking part were participating in at least two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week&mdash;surpassing the target by 5 percentage points. The long-term ambition, by 2010, is to offer all children at least four hours of sport every week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1119W.2/3">All schools in Hendon are now in a School Sport Partnership. Some are part of the Barnet South Partnership, which was established in 2005 and is receiving funding of &pound;508,286 in 2005-06 to 2007-08. The proportion of pupils in the partnership who are participating in at least two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week is 83 per cent. The national average is 80 per cent. The other schools are in the St. James' Partnership, which has the host site in Hendon. The partnership was established in September 2006 and will receive &pound;414,579 in 2006-07 to 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.1119W.2/4">The Department is currently developing its plans on how the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. We will be using the Games to widen participation in sport for children and young people. The key aim will be to sustain the impact of the current School Sport Strategy through to 2012 and beyond.</p>

Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES departmental expenditure limits relevant to pupils aged 11 to 15 and exclude education maintenance allowances (EMAs) and grants not allocated at LEA level. For those authorities in receipt of advance of grant under the transitional support arrangements for 2004-05, advance grant funding is included in the year of payment (2004-05). There will be a consequential reduction in DfES grant for these LEAs in future years (either 2006-07 and 2007-08 or 2006-07 to 2008-09, depending on the terms on which the advance was given to the LEA).<br/> 4.

Some of the grant allocations have not been finalised. If these do change, the effect on the funding figures is expected to be minimal.<br/> 7. The revenue funding per pupil figures only run to 2005-06 because we cannot provide a consistent time series beyond that year as the introduction of the dedicated schools grant (DSG) in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded. The 2004-05 and 2005-06 figures are based on education formula spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the local government finance settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. In 2006-07 funding for schools changed with the introduction of the DSG which is based largely on an authority's previous spending.<br/> 8. In addition, DSG has a different coverage to EFS: EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's local government finance settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. This means we have a break in our time series as the two sets of data are not comparable, an alternative time series is currently under development.<br/> 9. To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, we have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described above this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year.</td> </tr>

I should reiterate however that this facilitates but does not remove the statutory duty on local authorities to provide services to children and young people in need and I still expect them to act in accordance with this responsibility.</p>

Friend the Foreign Secretary has not discussed Iran'' space programme or reported intercontinental ballistic missile ambitions with her French, German and US counterparts, but Ministers and officials have discussed other issues relating to Iran's missile programme, including in the context of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1737. We are very concerned by reports that Iran is seeking to develop longer-range ballistic missile systems. UNSCR 1737 imposes sanctions against the Iranian missile programme, including a ban on the export to and import from Iran of certain relevant goods and technologies and an asset freeze against listed individuals and entities involved in missile related activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.1127W.8/1">Estimates on the extent of oil smuggling in Iraq vary and it is difficult to obtain an accurate figure. However, a report produced last year by the Iraqi Oil Ministry's Inspector, General Ali Alaak, estimated that some US$4.2 billion worth of oil related products were smuggled out of Iraq in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1127W.8/2">Oil smuggling is caused by the disparity between the price of oil and its refined products in Iraq and the price in neighbouring countries. The Government of Iraq have been working with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate fuel subsidies to increase prices gradually since 2005, which should reduce the incentive to smuggle as potential profits fall.</p>
	<p pid="a.1127W.8/3">An inadequate metering system in Iraq also inhibits the Government of Iraq's ability to tackle smuggling as it limits the ability to track how much oil is produced and exported. In January the Government of Iraq installed new meters at the Al-Basra oil terminal which exports the vast majority of oil exports from Iraq. Work to install an effective metering system through Iraq and upgrade existing meters should help improve the transparency of oil production and oil exports.</p>

	<p pid="a.1136W.3/2">The Government recognises the valuable contribution that street markets can make to local choice and diversity in shopping, and the vitality of town centres, but it is for local authorities to decide how they achieve that local choice and diversity, taking account of the national policy framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136W.3/3">To support and develop the role of street markets, national planning policy, in &quot;Planning Policy Statement 6: Planning for Town Centres&quot; (PPS6), asks local authorities to consider markets as an integral part of the vision for their town centres, and to seek to retain and enhance existing markets and, where appropriate, re-introduce or create new ones. Local authorities are encouraged to ensure that their markets remain attractive and competitive by investing in their improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136W.3/4">PPS6 asks local authorities to assess the need for retail development, as a context for planning for town centres, and to ensure that there are sites available to provide for this need. We would expect local authorities to take account of the role of street markets in carrying out this assessment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136W.3/5">Planning policy does not specifically promote street markets as part of out-of-town developments. PPS6 promotes policies which will support the vitality and viability of existing town centres. But local authorities are encourage to plan more widely for people's day-to-day needs and to seek to remedy deficiencies in local shopping and other facilities where appropriate, working with local communities and stakeholders. This could include promoting local street markets.</p>

	<p pid="a.1141W.2/1">DCMS has made no detailed estimate of the number of sports clubs falling outside of bands A and B, or the total annual cost of the licensing fees regime to sports clubs and community amateur sports clubs. However, as part of their terms of reference, the Independent Licensing Fees Review Panel was asked to identify how the fees regime could be developed to address the impact of the structure of the fee scales on community amateur sports clubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1141W.2/2">The panel's final report was placed in the Libraries of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-25">25 January</phrase>. We are currently assessing the implications of all the panel's detailed conclusions and recommendations, including those relating to sports clubs, and will provide a full response shortly. During the panel's review, we understand that the Central Council of Physical Recreation proposed to the panel that fees should be calculated by introducing a system whereby all clubs in the Community Amateur Sports Clubs (CASC) scheme could have their licence fee calculated at 20 per cent. of their rateable value. The panel was not inclined to recommend in favour of this proposal. Before reaching a final decision about implementing any changes to the fees regime and related issues, we will undertake a public consultation. Such a consultation would be informed by a regulatory impact assessment which would include estimates of any cost of any proposal to local authorities and to the sector affected.</p>

	<p pid="a.1144W.0/1">The Communications Act 2003 requires at least 90 per cent. of Channel 3 and Channel 4 programmes to be subtitled by 2010. The BBC has made a commitment to subtitle 100 per cent. of its television programmes from April 2008. The Communications Act requires other broadcasters to subtitle at least 80 per cent. of programmes within 10 years of their subtitling services commencing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144W.0/2">It falls to Ofcom to ensure that broadcasters meet the requirements contained in the regulator's Code on television access services. Ofcom undertook a review of the Code in 2006, but did not recommend any revisions to the subtitling quotas and the Government have no plans to hold discussions with broadcasters about this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144W.0/3">The Communications Act does not prevent broadcasters from scheduling repeats of subtitled programmes, though Ofcom encourages broadcasters not to fulfil their obligations in this way, as this will detract from the benefit of providing access services to users.</p>

The Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Act 2004 will commence implementation in July 2007, and further specialist domestic violence courts are being established across England and Wales. Implementation of the Children and Adoption Act 2006 will give the courts additional powers to enforce contact orders.

Local authorities are often partners in these developments, providing land and other support in return for access to the provision. A small number of additional homes are built and retained by local authorities and we are exploring opportunities to increase this where it would offer good value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.1158W.2/2">Registered social landlords make available vacancies to which local authorities may nominate people from the local authority waiting list.

	<p pid="a.1161W.5/1">The Decent Homes standard, which applies to all social housing, whether owned by local authorities or registered social landlords, contains a number of energy efficiency measures. Research by the Building Research Establishment on the implementation of the Decent Homes programme indicates that the majority of improvement works under the Decent Homes scheme include work to improve energy efficiency. The same research also indicates that most landlords, when implementing energy efficiency works, deliver much higher standards than the minimum required by the Decent Homes standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161W.5/2">Between 1997 and 2010, we expect local authorities and registered social landlords will together have spent at least &pound;40 billion on improving their homes through the Decent Homes programme.</p>

The EEC requires obligated electricity and gas suppliers to achieve targets for the improvement of energy efficiency in domestic properties in Great Britain. This involves energy suppliers working with householders and housing providers (both social and private) to implement energy efficiency measures, which are funded mostly by the energy suppliers themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161W.5/4">Social housing providers, builders and householders can access a number of grants for energy efficiency works under the DTI's &quot;Low Carbon Buildings&quot; programme, covering up to 50 per cent. of costs of installing micro generation or other energy efficiency technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161W.5/5">Since 2006, newly built social homes funded by the Housing Corporation through the approved development pot must gain an EcoHomes rating of &quot;very good&quot;, from 2008 newly build homes funded by the Housing Corporation will have to meet the Code for Sustainable Buildings level 3.</p>

Local authorities are encouraged to ensure that their markets remain attractive and competitive by investing in their improvement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1163W.6/4">Planning policy does not specifically promote street markets as part of out-of-town developments. PPS6 promotes policies which will support the vitality and viability of existing town centres. But local authorities are encourage to plan more widely for people's day-to-day needs and to seek to remedy deficiencies in local shopping and other facilities where appropriate, working with local communities and stakeholders. This could include promoting local street markets.</p>

	<p pid="a.1164W.2/1">Planning permission is not required for cutting down trees, although a felling licence may be required from the Forestry Commission, depending on the current use of the land and the number of trees involved. The penalty for cutting down trees without a felling licence where it is required is &pound;2,500 in the magistrates court or twice the value of the trees, whichever is the higher.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164W.2/2">Consent from the local planning authority is required for cutting down trees which are subject to a tree preservation order. The penalty for cutting down a tree in contravention of an order is a fine of up to &pound;20,000 in the magistrates court, or an unlimited fine in the Crown court. The same penalty applies for cutting down trees in conservation areas without giving prior notice to the local planning authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.1167W.14/1">The amount of electricity produced in general, and the location and despatch of electricity generating capacity in particular, is a matter for electricity generating companies in response to market signals. Locational differences in the Transmission Network Use of System (TNUoS) charges levied by national grid reflect the implications for investment in the transmission network given the distribution of demand and generation across the system. This means that locational variations in the balance between demand and generating capacity are included in the market signals influencing decisions over where to add new capacity.</p>

	<p pid="a.1168W.2/2">Employers and employees both have a stake in creating good workplaces and it is the Department's aim to encourage effective two-way communication which facilitates the achievement of high performance workplaces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.2/3" class="italic"> The Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.2/4">Employees in larger organisations have the right to be informed and consulted on changes in the place for which they work. The Department is committed to championing such arrangements and in 2006, it contacted 12,000 companies to highlight the benefits of ongoing, two-way communication between employers and employees. Efforts to date include regional road-show events, interviews, articles, briefing and speeches, guidance, and the creation of a dedicated website to deliver Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) training workshops and company visits to share best practice on how to draw up effective arrangements with their employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.2/5">A further awareness campaign is planned by end February 2007 to raise awareness when these rights are extended to the employees of approximately 8,000 medium-sized companies in April 2007. The Department's efforts are co-ordinated with those of the ACAS, Business Link to ensure that practical advice is available to businesses, and Direct.Gov for employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.2/6" class="italic"> Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.2/7">The Department funds the regionally-based ACAS whose aim is to improve organisations and working life through better employment relations. ACAS provides services that include information provision, advice and training, and individual and collective dispute resolution on employment issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.2/8">In 2006-07 its National helpline is expected to have dealt with about 900,000 employment-related calls, conciliated in about 1,000 collective disputes and 160,000 individual actual or potential tribunal claims, delivered about 3,000 training sessions on employment issues, and trained more than 200 delegates to operate their own mediation service. Their website is expected to have received about 2.5 million visits for information from employers and employees and HR and legal professionals among others. In addition ACAS are expected to have delivered over 200 workplace projects during the year to improve employment relations and practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.2/9" class="italic"> Partnership Fund</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.2/10">The Department has supported over 250 projects under the Partnership/Strategic Partnership Fund. The fund has supported the development of industrial relations by encouraging employers and employees to work together effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.2/11">Projects supported under the fund include workplace partnership projects within individual organisations, and strategic projects, which reach out beyond single company projects to address sectoral and regional issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168W.2/12">The Union Modernisation Fund provides financial assistance to independent trade unions and their federations in support of projects which speed unions' adaptation to a changing labour market and new ways of working. This will enhance unions' ability to make a full and effective contribution to constructive employment relations and to the economy as a whole.</p>

In addition. Business Link provides practical support and advice for employers on starting, maintaining and growing a business. Employers and employees can also access advice from the Acas website and telephone helpline.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.2/2">The right to request flexible working has been a great success since its introduction in April 2003 for parents of young children: some 5.4 million employees now work through some form of flexible working arrangement, and employers accept four out of five requests to work flexibly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169W.2/3">We are working with stakeholders to ensure high levels of awareness of new family-friendly measures being introduced under the Work and Families Act 2006, including an extension of the right to request flexible working to carers of adults.

	<p pid="a.1171W.5/1">We have seen significant interest for domestic projects over the first six months of the Low Carbon Buildings programme Phase 1. In response to representations from industry we have therefore reallocated the &pound;28.5 million budget to provide a further &pound;6.2 million to support household projects. In order to facilitate this reallocation we have closed the Communities stream in Phase 1, along with other measures. We believe that these changes should allow support for householders to continue until June 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1171W.5/2">It is important to note that going forward some community projects can continue to apply for support under stream 2 of Phase I, which is a competitive process primarily catering for larger projects and open to the private sector. However, the majority of community projects will receive support under Phase 2 of the Low Carbon Buildings programme, where we have a budget of &pound;50 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.1171W.8/1">We currently have a total pot of &pound;12.7 million, including management fees, for the Low Carbon Buildings programme Phase 1 household stream, which on projected demand levels should allow householder funding to continue until June 2008. By this time, some of the wider measures to promote micro-generation should be taking hold, and we believe the sector may have matured to a point where householder grants are no longer necessary. There are no plans to increase funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.1174W.8/1">The Government's main mechanism for encouraging renewable generation is the Renewables Obligation (RO). Renewable generators are issued with one Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) for every 1 MWh of eligible renewable electricity that is generated. Generators can then sell their ROCs to licensed electricity suppliers who can use these to meet their renewables obligation. In the compliance period to <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase> one ROC was worth &pound;42. The RO is a market mechanism and the price of a ROC is set by the market. Under current rules the RO does not differentiate between technologies. However, as part of the Energy Review the Government are considering proposals to band the RO to provide different levels of support for different technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1174W.8/2">In addition to the RO the Government have made available around &pound;500 million of spending on capital grants and research and development between 2002 and 2008.

	<p pid="a.1175W.2/1">There is a wealth of information about the ability of wind generation to deliver significant amounts of green megawatts. For example, the Renewables Innovation Review, carried out in 2004 by DTI and the Carbon Trust, concludes that wind power is able to deliver almost all the required growth in renewable energy to meet the target of 10 per cent. renewables by 2010, and is likely to continue to be the dominant renewable energy technology until 2020. It is the most economic renewable technology for which there is significant additional capacity in the UK and will remain so for some time to come. In order to support emerging low carbon technologies, other than onshore wind, reach commercial viability over the long-term, the Government are investing around &pound;500 million, between 2002 and 2008, in capital grants and research and development.</p>

	<p pid="a.1176W.2/1">In 2005, 4 per cent. of the UK's electricity supply came from sources of renewable energy eligible for the Renewables Obligation (up from 1.8 per cent. in 2002), and 4.2 per cent. from all sources of renewable energy (up from 2.9 per cent. in 2002). Figures are not yet available for 2006. It is too early to say how much renewable electricity there will be by 2010. But if we make quick progress in addressing the barriers to large scale deployment such as access to the grid and planning delays we could still perform well against the target. However, we are looking at the possible 2010 outcomes as part of the review of the Renewables Obligation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1178W.2/2">Provision of street lighting in England, on local roads, is a matter for individual highway authorities, and the Department for Transport has made no formal assessment of the potential for energy savings in street lighting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.2/3">The Department endorses &quot;Well-lit Highways&quot;, the code of practice on highway lighting management (December 2004, TSO) published by the UK Lighting Board. The Board, in conjunction with the Institution of Lighting Engineers, has also produced &quot;Invest to Save&quot;, which provides guidance to local authorities considering adopting energy saving measures such as dimming or mid-night switching-off of lights. The effects of reducing lighting levels or turning lights off will vary from case to case. Any financial or environmental savings from reduced energy use would have to be balanced against potential adverse effects, for example on accidents or crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178W.2/4">The Highways Agency is currently reviewing all its standards for the provision of road lighting on the strategic road network, which will mean less new lighting being installed in future. The agency's review work also includes the development of an energy strategy for the management of existing lighting, which could include reduced lighting levels, and switching off lighting when roads are lightly trafficked. Trials are expected to start in 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.1194W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-08">8 February 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1194W.5/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1194W.5/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many uncleared Child Support Agency applications there were in each month since May 1997 broken down by London borough; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1194W.5/5" class="indent">I am sorry that it is not possible to provide all the information you have requested as the computer system in use from 1993 does not hold data at the level of individual boroughs for uncleared cases. It is possible to provide data held on the new computer system introduced in March 2003 at the level you request and this is shown in the attached tables. However as the two computer systems continue to run in parallel, the information provided does not present a complete picture of the total number of uncleared cases by London borough, nor is it representative of trends over the period. For example, whilst the figures provided imply a significant increase in the volumes of uncleared cases by London borough, it should be remembered that the majority of cases at the beginning of the period were actually on the old scheme and the old computer system, and hence not covered in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="a.1194W.5/6" class="indent">At a national level the total volume of uncleared applications was 334,500 in May 1999, the earliest month for which data is available, and this has fallen to 238,400 in December 2006. The Agency recognises that while the number of uncleared applications has fallen significantly, it remains unacceptably high, and our challenge, as set out in our Operational Improvement Plan, is that the Agency should not have a backlog in this area by March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.1194W.5/7" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful despite my being unable to answer your question in full.</p>

	<p pid="a.1204W.2/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the Chief Executive. He will write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-08">8 February 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.2/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.2/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions:</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.2/5" class="indent">what the maximum budget available for bonus payments to employees of the Child Support Agency was in each year since 2001; and what the total amount of bonuses paid out to employees of the Agency was in each such year. (102198); and</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.2/6" class="indent">what quotas are set for the (a) number of people and (b) proportion of the pay budget in the Child Support Agency in relation to bonus payments in any one year. (102200)</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.2/7" class="indent">The Child Support Agency is part of the Department for Work and Pensions and operates Departmental schemes. Over the period from 2001 to 2006 three separate schemes for payment of bonuses have operated within the Child Support Agency. All Agency people have been eligible for a payment under these schemes. Each of the three schemes have different criteria on how a bonus can be earned and the percentage of the pay budget that can be applied to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.2/8" class="indent"><i> Special Bonus</i>&mdash;This scheme operated throughout 2001-2006. An individual may be awarded a one-off bonus outside the annual reward performance and development system exercise to recognise and reward exceptional personal achievement. This scheme operates in line with Treasury guidance and the payments in any one-year are limited to 0.25% of the staffing budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.2/9" class="indent"><i> Individual Performance Bonus</i>&mdash;Bonuses linked to annual appraisal markings were available throughout the period 2001-2006. The overall funding available, and the size of the individual bonuses, were determined through discussions with the Treasury about the DWP's pay remit, and then through negotiations with the unions. The Agency had no separate budget for these bonuses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.2/10" class="indent"><i> Makinson</i>&mdash;This scheme only operated in 2002 and 2003, was funded directly by the Treasury and lay outside of the spending review settlement. The total estimated funding available was &pound;9.8m in both 2002 and 2003. In 2002 teams across the Agency earned 93% of the bonus available. In 2003 the stretched target regime was based on new scheme performance, which was below expectations and only 35% of the available bonus was earned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.2/11" class="indent">The special bonus scheme and individual performance bonuses operated for the entire period within all parts of the Department of Work and Pensions. The guidelines policy funding and framework for theses scheme is set Departmentally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.2/12" class="indent">The Makinson bonus scheme was undertaken as part of a Treasury initiative to incentivise performance in the public sector by linking performance to reward. This scheme only ran for 2002-03 and 2003-04 and was trialed in three parts of the Department one of which was the Child Support Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1204W.2/13" class="indent">The attached table shows the sums paid as Special Bonuses, and Makinson bonuses and the available budget for each of the last five years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1213W.6/1">The information is not available in the form requested. The Department estimated the costs that might be incurred by trustees, scheme administrators and insurers in providing data as a Partial Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase> as part of the Consultation Document on the Financial Assistance Scheme Draft Regulations 2005. This was placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1213W.6/2">This estimated that the cost of providing information to determine scheme eligibility might be around &pound;250 per scheme. The costs for providing member data might vary from &pound;15 to &pound;75 per member depending on the how easy the data was to obtain. The costs for each scheme would also depend on the size of the scheme. The RIA concluded that the total cost of providing FAS with member data would be between &pound;2 million and &pound;3.4 million, which in relation to the 70,000 to 80,000 affected members we might expect to need data on to establish the full extent of losses, works out at between &pound;24 and &pound;40 per member.</p>

	<p pid="a.1214W.8/1">It is extremely difficult to produce an estimate to reasonable standards of reliability due to the lack of sufficient base data. Such estimates as we have are given in the following table. It must be emphasised that these figures are subject to high levels of uncertainty and therefore can be taken as a guide to potential costs only. The estimates assume, among other things, all those who qualify for deemed buyback will take up the option. They show a short-term increase in the funds being paid into the national insurance fund, followed by rising costs as the higher state benefit is paid out.</p>
