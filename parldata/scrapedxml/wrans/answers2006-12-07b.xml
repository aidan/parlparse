	<p pid="b.573W.3/1">The Commission did consider the proposal for a child care facility based in the House two years ago, but, after a survey of potential users, concluded that more flexibility would be provided by a child care voucher system. Many staff of the House come from outer-London boroughs or even beyond Greater London and receive greater benefit from a voucher system that enables them to use child care facilities nearer to home. The voucher system also benefits Members' staff working in constituencies. Nearly 150 people take advantage of the scheme, and the Commission felt that it offered more flexibility than something based at Westminster.</p>

	<p pid="b.577W.2/2">My Department does not collect statistics relating to individual PCs or computer systems. However, the 2006 Information Security Breaches Survey, which is the largest survey of its kind in the UK, forms a significant part of the Department's work with business to understand the nature and impact of information security breaches and to raise awareness of the value of effective information security management. This report contains a wide range of statistical information and is available from the DTI website (<a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk">www.dti.gov.uk</a>). The 2006 report found that virtually all companies now have anti-virus software and that fewer companies had suffered security incidents related to viruses than in the previous two surveys. Although viruses remain a major concern, the nature of the threat is changing; the major virus disseminations that were prevalent until a few years ago and which caused widespread damage are now less important than the more targeted theft of confidential business information. My Department produces extensive online advice and other guidance material relating to information security best practice.</p>

	<p pid="b.580W.0/4">For the periods April 2005 to March 2006 and April 2006 to date, the number of annual and in-year performance bonuses awarded was as follows:</p>
	<table>

			<tr pid="b.580W.0/7"> <td><i> Period</i></td> <td><i> Number of staff awarded bonuses</i></td> <td><i> Total amount of bonuses paid (&pound;)</i></td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.580W.0/12">The total sums paid annually in performance bonuses are a little over 1 per cent. of paybill.</p>
	<p pid="b.580W.0/13">For staff in the SCS, the data relates to bonuses awarded to those in core-DEFRA and its Executive agencies (excluding chief executives) in accordance with Cabinet Office arrangements. For staff below the SCS, the data relates to staff covered by core-DEFRA pay arrangements (core-DEFRA, State Veterinary Service, Pesticides Safety Directorate, Veterinary Medicines Directorate, Marine Fisheries Agency and Government Decontamination Service). DEFRA's other agencies and non-departmental public bodies operate separate pay and bonus arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.584W.3/1">There is no official &quot;recommended standard&quot; for insulation in existing buildings (only new builds require certain minimum standards for insulation to be met via the Building Regulations, part L). However, general advice is to install all cost-effective insulation measures, which in most cases means cavity wall insulation and loft insulation. Although it is not so cost-effective, double glazing would also normally be considered essential by modern standards (for new dwellings it is required by the Building Regulations) and it is a popular measure. The following table shows the estimated number of installations of cavity wall insulation, loft insulation and double glazing in existing homes in each of the years 2000-05 (note that in addition about 180,000 new homes are built each year and these will also automatically incorporate these measures where relevant).</p>

In some areas the standard is as high as 1 in 10,000 (that is, 0.01 per cent. chance of flooding in any one year) although this will reduce with rising tidal flood levels.</p>

	<p pid="b.590W.2/1">The Soil Guideline Values (SGVs) Task Force was set up by the Government in 2003. It was expanded in 2004 through involving representative bodies in the contaminated land field, relevant Departments and agencies. The Task Force met on 16 occasions.</p>
	<p pid="b.590W.2/2">The Task Force was established to look at issues around the production and usefulness of SGVs and related technical materials. These are non-statutory guidelines and information which can help with risk assessments of land affected by contamination, and establishing the need for any remedial action.</p>
	<p pid="b.590W.2/3">At the end of 2005, the chair of the Task Force indicated that a number of issues needed to be resolved by my Department. Further work has been taken forward with her assistance and that of the Task Force, particularly through the paper &quot;Soil Guideline Values: The Way Forward&quot;. This paper outlines a number of issues and emerging conclusions relating to the production of SGVs, although it is not a review of individual substances. It also envisages a number of updates and improvements that respond to and build on the Task Force work. The term &quot;significant possibility of significant harm&quot; is elaborated in the statutory guidance issued by the Secretary of State under section 78A(5) of the 1990 Act, and the words dealing with human health effects arising from intake or exposure to contaminants have underpinned the development work of the paper.</p>
	<p pid="b.590W.2/4">I have arranged for a copy of the paper to be placed in the Library of the House. Task Force organisations are now considering it, although the Task Force itself has now been wound up. The paper indicates that our aim is to have completed improvements to current technical guidance by the end of 2007, with some key changes being available well before then.</p>

	<p pid="b.594W.8/1">Individuals who attempt to provide a taxi or minicab service without being properly licensed normally do so by plying for hire (waiting to be approached by passengers) or by touting for business (approaching passengers and asking if they want a cab). Both of these are criminal offences. Responsibility for enforcement falls to local taxi licensing authorities and the police.</p>
	<p pid="b.594W.8/2">There are some minicab drivers who are unlicensed&mdash;lawfully so at present&mdash;because they provide a service under a contract lasting not less than seven days (&quot;the contract exemption&quot;). Section 53 of the Road Safety Act 2006 repeals the contract exemption. Those unlicensed drivers who currently rely on the contract exemption will in future have to be licensed in order to continue operating lawfully. We are currently asking stakeholders for their views on how long they need to make necessary arrangements before this provision is brought into force.</p>

	<p pid="b.595W.0/2">PFI capital values typically refer to the cost of constructing project assets. The cost information in the table is an estimate of these costs. They are estimated costs because it is a feature of PFI contracts that responsibility for construction risk is transferred to the Contractor. The final actual cost is the responsibility of the Contractor. The construction cost is an element of the unitary charge payment.</p>
	<p pid="b.595W.0/3">The total unitary charge is a projection that covers payment for both the construction cost and other costs that arise from delivering the service. These typically include the cost of maintenance, managing the service, operational activities over the duration of the contract. The estimated unitary charge may vary over the duration of a contract as it reflects changes in the indexation of payments, usage related payments, contract deductions and service changes.</p>

	<p pid="b.598W.3/2">Under EU procurement legislation Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) cannot set indicative targets for the number of Olympic contracts to be awarded to London and UK firms. However, the success of the 2012 games will depend on the involvement of thousands of UK businesses of every size and plans are being developed to ensure that the opportunities are realised by all.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.3/3">The ODA is currently developing its final procurement policy so that the procurement of all work, goods and services is transparent, fair and open to a diverse range of suppliers. It will consider arrangements so that tender requirements are appropriate to the size and scale of the contract being awarded, to facilitate the involvement of small and medium sized enterprises. The policy is expected to be published early 2007. Businesses can register now on the London 2012 website to be alerted to contract opportunities and information.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.3/4">To ensure UK businesses are best placed to secure procurement opportunities, the DTI, regional development agencies, and the devolved Administrations will tailor existing business support tools, like Business Link, to drive up competitiveness and UK success in tendering for Olympic related contracts.</p>
	<p pid="b.598W.3/5">We are also committed to exploring the potential for operating a Business Opportunities Network to link small and medium sized enterprises with relevant partners to compete successfully for London 2012 contracts.</p>

	<p pid="b.602W.11/2">The Railways Act 2005 enables the Welsh Assembly Government to give financial assistance to any organisation for the purpose of developing Welsh railways. As yet, no funding has been committed to providing a direct rail service from the Ebbw Valley into Newport.</p>
	<p pid="b.602W.11/3">There is currently insufficient capacity on Network Rail's infrastructure to provide a passenger train service to Newport&mdash;this is due to the design of the connection between the Ebbw Vale Line and the South Wales Main Line at Gaer Junction, situated on the western side of Newport Railway Tunnel and the track and signalling layout through Newport.</p>
	<p pid="b.602W.11/4">The earliest opportunity to remove this capacity constraint will be in 2009, when Network Rail completes the re-signalling of the main line at Newport. Network Rail will need to install new crossover points in order to remove the capacity constraint. Network Rail will require external funding for the new crossover points, as it is regarded as an enhancement rather than a steady state renewal.</p>
	<p pid="b.602W.11/5">The Assembly Government has recently received from Network Rail a detailed proposal with costing for that work. This is under discussion with Sewta&mdash;the south east Wales local authority regional transport consortium. In the first place, it will be for Sewta to propose the priority that should be awarded to that project in the context of its proposed overall rail improvement projects. In the meantime the Assembly Government has committed funding for a rail-link bus service between Rogerstone Station and Newport Station and Shopping Centre when the Ebbw Vale-Cardiff service starts in 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.603W.3/1">Malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Burma, but reliable statistics on geographical distribution of malaria morbidity and mortality are very limited. We believe that the disease is endemic in 284 out of 324 townships, primarily in rural areas but also in some peri-urban locations. According to the Burmese authorities' official statistics, reported malaria outbreaks have increased over the past 10 years; and most outbreaks have been reported in Shan and Rakhine states and in Mandalay, Taninthayi, Magway and Bago divisions. A recent report by the Back Pack Health Worker Teams also identified very high rates of malaria infection in conflict areas in Karen State.</p>

The Three Diseases Fund will continue its dialogue with the Burmese authorities about improving access for the UN and international NGOs in all areas of the country. It will also seek to strengthen dialogues with community-based organisations, local non-governmental organisations and ceasefire groups about how they can contribute to the Fund's efforts to deliver services in the most difficult to reach areas .</p>

At least &pound;150 million will be spent on programmes to meet the needs of orphans and other children, particularly those in Africa, made vulnerable by HIV and AIDS.

One element of this programme was HIV and AIDS education. In 2005-06 DFID provided &pound;32 million in core funding to UNICEF whose work includes programmes to help street children affected by AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="b.605W.11/3">The effectiveness of DFID's bilateral aid projects and programmes is measured using monitoring and evaluation at the project and programme level. An interim evaluation of the UK's strategy for tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world, Taking Action, is currently taking place and final reports will be published in early 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.607W.8/2">Vector is a planned programme using accelerated acquisition procedures to meet an urgent operational requirement.

	<p pid="b.609W.3/1">There are no standing European armed services, and thus no agreements for such armed services.</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.3/2">Following the 1998 UK-France summit at St. Malo, the 2001 Treaty of Nice established arrangements for the EU to undertake military crisis management operations using forces contributed by member states.

I will place a copy of the record of the meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-25">25 May</phrase> that gave rise to this work, between my predecessor, officials and representatives of the Association of British Civilian Internees&mdash;Far East Region and the All Party Group on Far East Prisoners of War in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.610W.2/2">The Department's discussions with the charity concerned, aimed at providing financial assistance to support its work for former far east prisoners of war and civilian internees who may be experiencing hardship, have been by telephone, e-mail and letter, rather than by meetings. The charity has very recently indicated that it does not consider it appropriate to accept this support.</p>

	<p pid="b.611W.10/1">Land-based specialist and rural colleges will continue to be central to delivering the specialised skills required by the wide range of employers operating in this important sector. These colleges offer pre-entry courses to higher skills development to young people from 14 years and they work closely with local employers to ensure that the curriculum, facilities and qualifications reflect industry standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.611W.10/2">Apprenticeships are the main route available to young people seeking vocational qualifications at Level 2 and Level 3. Apprenticeship frameworks are developed by employers through Sector Skills Councils (SSCs). LANTRA, the SSC for the Environmental and Land-based Sector, is developing with five partner SSCs a Land-based and Environmental Studies Diploma that will be taught from September 2009. A new statutory entitlement to study for a Diploma will be in place for all 14 to 19-year-olds from September 2013. LANTRA, through its website, offers career portals dedicated for both young people and adults which signpost routes into a wide variety of careers in the sector.</p>

We therefore do not hold information on the numbers of staff involved in chaplaincy arrangements in further education, or their associated costs. As we said in the White Paper &quot;Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances&quot;, good pastoral support is vital to improving the learner's chance of succeeding and is an important part of a college's responsibilities to its students. We have commissioned the Quality Improvement Agency to develop and issue guidance on effective pastoral support systems. This will include meeting the needs of all students including those with a particular faith or of none. Pastoral support arrangements are being piloted next year.</p>

This is comprised of a varied menu of study support activities in primary and secondary schools and high-quality child-care 8am-6pm all year round in primary schools. These services will be provided on the school site or in partnership with local private, voluntary and independent providers. They will also offer: parenting support; swift and easy referral to a wide range of specialist support services such as health and social care; and wider community access to ICT, sports and arts facilities on the school site including adult learning. What extended services provision looks like in practice will vary according to the needs of each community, based on consultation through schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.625W.0/1">The latest available information is given in the following tables. Final figures for 2006 entry will be available in January 2007. The latest provisional figures for 2006 entry show that, as at mid- October 2006, the proportion of English domiciled acceptances from the lower socio-economic groups was slightly up compared to the corresponding point for 2005 entry (31.7 per cent. of acceptances are from the bottom four socio-economic groups this year, compared to 31.4 per cent. at this point last year).</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.0/2">The figures are taken from data collected by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) which are limited to students who apply to full-time first degree courses via the UCAS application system. The figures do not therefore cover part-time students nor those full-time students who apply directly to higher education institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.625W.0/3">The socio-economic classification was introduced in 2002/03 to replace the social class categories, and so the two sets of data in these tables are not directly comparable.</p>

Ofsted have produced figures based on this classification on a quarterly basis from March 2003.

The data we have is provided by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), which collects figures from the fire and rescue service. The earliest figures we have on school fires from DCLG are for 2000, and the most recent for 2004. These cover England and Wales. The costs are rounded to the nearest million and are derived from the then ODPM publication &quot;Economic Cost of Fire, estimates for 2004&quot;.

It requires Trusts to hold a hand hygiene campaign this year and produce an annual infection reduction plan. A key message of the action plan is that infection prevention and control is everyone's responsibility. Then on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October 2006</phrase> I launched the &quot;Ward Sisters Charter&quot;.

These data act as a marker for such infections in general. Data on these two infections are only available up to the end of June 2006 and on a quarterly basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.644W.0/2">There is a variety of offences which may be committed for the purposes of terrorism and release arrangements are dependent on the sentence passed. Schedule 15 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (CJA 2003) contains a list of specified violent and sexual offences. Upon conviction for any of these offences, or conspiracy to commit them, an offender may be sentenced to either an extended sentence for public protection (EPP) or an indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP). The schedule includes offences that may be committed as terrorist acts, e.g. using explosives with intent to do bodily injury, putting people in fear of violence, hijacking, hostage taking, offences relating to the safety of aircraft and railways as well as murder and manslaughter.</p>
	<p pid="b.644W.0/3">Offenders serving an EPP or IPP are not automatically released at the halfway point of their sentence, but must have their release considered by the Parole Board, who will only direct release when they are convinced that the risk of re-offending and the risk to the public has been sufficiently reduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.644W.0/4">Specific terrorism offences not contained within the schedule of specified sexual and violent offences would be subject to a standard determinate sentence. These offences include financial offences related to terrorism, membership or support of a proscribed terrorist organisation and withholding or failing to disclose information about terrorist activities. Such prisoners would be eligible for automatic release at the halfway point of their sentence if sentenced under the provisions of the CJA 2003. If sentenced under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, those sentenced to determinate sentences of four years or less are automatically released at the halfway point of their sentence. For sentences of four years or more, prisoners are eligible for parole halfway through their sentence. If parole is not granted then release occurs at the two-thirds point of the sentence (or at a subsequent parole review if earlier).</p>

	<p pid="b.645W.2/1">The Police Standards Unit of the Home Office is formally evaluating the equipment during the period running from September 2006 to February 2007. A standard procedural manual is being prepared, and good practice identified. The final project report will be published in April 2007, and will consider the effectiveness of the equipment in terms of reduction in levels of violent crime, improved sanction detection rates, savings in officer time, and quality of evidence presented to court (which impacts on whether or not an offence is brought to justice). There already appear to be ancillary benefits in that the use of the cameras is reported to have a deterrent effect, calming the situation and bringing it to swift resolution. Footage can be replayed to offenders immediately, with the result that they are far more likely to plead guilty, or to accept on-the-spot fines or cautions rather than contest the case in court.</p>

In July last year we issued a questionnaire seeking information about the methods of support in place in other European Union countries.

	<p pid="b.646W.2/1">Specific arrangements for dealing with identity cards of deceased persons have yet to be decided. However, we intend to work closely with the General Registrar Offices to ensure that the notification of death and return of the ID card can be done in a sensitive manner, without causing undue distress to the bereaved. For example, GROs' guidance on death registration is likely to include instructions on what to do with passports, ID cards and other documents. Although the Act does not require anyone to report the death of an individual who is registered, the powers under section 9 allow data to be disclosed for the purposes of verifying the information held on the Register. This could also include data collected by the Registrars General on those who have died and thus avoid the need to report a death on two occasions.</p>
	<p pid="b.646W.2/2">While section 11(3) states that a person who is knowingly in possession of an ID card without the lawful authority of the individual to whom it was issued or the permission of the Secretary of State must surrender the card as soon as it is practicable to do so, this is intended to prevent the misuse of cards and not directed at bereaved relatives of the deceased.</p>

	<p pid="b.650W.0/1">The National Probation Service has been set a total of 14 performance targets for 2006-07. The targets cover the key objectives of protecting the public and reducing re-offending whilst reflecting the priority given to work with offenders on matters such as accommodation, education, training and employment, health, drugs and alcohol, as well as addressing the needs of victims.</p>
	<p pid="b.650W.0/2">Details of the performance of the 42 probation areas in England and Wales against the performance targets and measures set for the service are published on a quarterly basis in National Probation Service performance reports. The reports are public documents and are posted on the NPS website:</p>

	<p pid="b.650W.0/4">The latest report (22) shows that the National Probation Service had met or exceeded nine of the 13 performance targets for the first six months of 2006-07. Data on the regionally set employment targets for minority ethnic staff will not be available until the new year when the census returns are made. This target has been met in each of the previous years since monitoring began and it is envisaged that it will be met again this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.656W.12/1">The Department encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) precisely because it is able to deliver more flexible agreements than would be possible via a court hearing. Much of the Department's ADR strategy has been built around the promotion of mediation, where the terms of the settlements are agreed by the parties themselves. Since such agreements are confidential, it is not possible to conduct any detailed assessment of the terms of those agreements. However, all mediators provided through court mediation schemes are required to comply with certain quality standards, since all such providers must be accredited by the Civil Mediation Council, which prescribes standards of conduct, training and continuing professional development.</p>

It is too early to assess the effects of the Land Reform Bill, but we do not expect it to have a considerable impact on British investments. We have underlined to the Bolivian Government the need to adhere to contractual obligations with British companies and to the terms of the UK/Bolivia Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement. It is important for Bolivia's long-term development that foreign investors are able to operate in a viable and equitable framework. We are in regular touch with British companies operating in Bolivia.

That is why we led efforts to secure agreement at the recent Review Conference on the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) for experts urgently to address their humanitarian impact.

	<p pid="b.662W.5/1">The Government maintain our long-standing policy of non-recognition of the self-declared &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot; and have not received representations in this regard. However, we maintain an open and constructive dialogue with the leadership of the Turkish Cypriots on all aspects of the situation in Cyprus. We continue to support measures to lift the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community in line with the commitment made by EU Foreign Ministers in 2004. In this context, we welcome the agreement and implementation of a package of EU financial aid worth &euro;259 million. However, we recognise that more needs to be done, particularly in relation to direct trade between the Turkish Cypriots and the EU. Progress in this area will help bring the Turkish Cypriots closer to the EU and, by reducing economic disparities between Turkish and Greek Cypriots, will make a future settlement easier to achieve.</p>

Due to the large number of accompanying press, our High Commission in Islamabad hired additional vehicles and drivers from a local company to convey the party to Pattika. The High Commission had also explored the option of chartering a helicopter to transport the press party. However, the press party rejected this before arriving in Pakistan in preference for the overland route on grounds of cost; the press party reimbursed the High Commission the full cost of hiring these additional vehicles.

	<p pid="b.671W.2/1">The National Screening Committee has recommended that screening certain subgroups of the population for type 2 diabetes is feasible, but that it should be part of a broader programme to detect and manage vascular risk factors.</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.2/2">Strategic health authorities' local delivery plans include information on the development of at risk registers for coronary heart disease. These have focused up to now on those with a 30 per cent. 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease, but for 2007-08 this will be amended to the new definition of a 20 per cent. 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This is consistent with the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal of statins, published in January 2006, which found that this was a clinically and cost-effective threshold for intervening with statins for the primary prevention of CVD.</p>
	<p pid="b.671W.2/3">NICE is currently working on guidance on lipid management, due out next year. That guidance will also address the issue of risk assessment for CVD in the United Kingdom population.</p>

	<p pid="b.672W.9/1">The Government support better mental health services through our improving access to psychological therapies (IAPT) programme, which began in May. This policy was also set out in our 2005 manifesto and in the &quot;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&quot; White Paper. We are looking to develop a service model for delivering a range of evidence-based interventions, with the focus being on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) because this has the broadest evidence base.</p>
	<p pid="b.672W.9/2">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published guidelines on the treatment of depression and anxiety in December 2004. NICE gave emphatic support to making evidence-based psychological therapies, including CBT, available as an adjunct or alternative to drug treatments for the treatment of mild to moderate depression, anxiety and schizophrenia.</p>
	<p pid="b.672W.9/3">Initially, IAPT consists of two national demonstration sites in Newham and Doncaster and a national programme of local projects in each of the National Institute for Mental Health in England's eight regional development centres (RDCs). We aim to work with the RDCs in preparing other areas around England to begin a phased roll-out of service models. It is envisaged that between 10 to 20 new services will roll-out in the first wave, on a region-by-region basis, with sites chosen by the strategic health authorities in discussion with their primary care trusts (PCTs) in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.672W.9/4">We expect IAPT to provide robust evidence in favour of increasing psychological therapy capacity and this will help to clarify the numbers of staff, the skills set and the training requirements needed to do this. A business case will be submitted to Treasury as part of the comprehensive spending review in early 2007 which will make the case for investing in local psychological therapies services across England.</p>
	<p pid="b.672W.9/5">NICE issued technology appraisal TA097 on computerised cognitive behavioural therapies (CCBT) in February 2006. By <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>, NICE requires all PCTs to provide access to the packages &quot;Beating the Blues&quot; as an option for the treatment of mild and moderate depression and &quot;FearFighter&quot; as an option for the treatment of panic and phobia. We consider CCBT as an effective vehicle towards empowering people to take charge of their own treatment.</p>

NICE also published guidelines on the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in November 2005. The guidance covers which treatments may be offered as treatment for OCD, naming CBT specifically.</p>

This policy was also set out in our 2005 manifesto and in the &quot;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&quot; White Paper. We are looking to develop a service model for delivering a range of evidence-based interventions, with the focus being on cognitive behavioural therapy because this has the broadest evidence base.</p>
	<p pid="b.681W.2/3">We expect IAPT to provide robust evidence in favour of increasing psychological therapy capacity and this will help to clarify the numbers of staff, the skills set and the training requirements needed to do this. A business case will be submitted to Treasury as part of the comprehensive spending review in early 2007 which will make the case for investing in local psychological therapies services across England.</p>

	<p pid="b.686W.0/10">The provision of changing facilities is a matter for local determination.</p>
	<p pid="b.686W.0/11">Earlier this year, the Department's working group on uniforms commissioned a literature review to examine the possible risks of uniforms in respect of healthcare associated infections. The reviewers concluded that there was no evidence that uniforms posed a significant risk. The Department has also commissioned research into laundering of uniforms. This work is still ongoing. The results will inform the recommendations of the working group.</p>
	<p pid="b.686W.0/12">The available evidence suggests that although it is possible to isolate micro-organisms from uniforms, many of these will be the wearer's own skin flora, and good hygiene practice, including the appropriate use of aprons and gloves, will minimise transmission.</p>

	<p pid="b.690W.0/1">The National Assistance Act 1948 sets out the framework within which local authorities assess what people can afford to contribute to the cost of care in a care home. The charging regulations do not apply to sheltered accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="b.690W.0/2">Under sections 42 and 43 of the Act, where a person goes into residential care and receives assistance from a local authority in meeting the cost of that care, the local authority has discretionary powers to ask the person's &quot;liable relatives&quot;, in effective their spouse, to make payments towards the costs incurred by the state.</p>
	<p pid="b.690W.0/3">The responsibility for applying the charging regulations, including seeking liable relatives payments, rests with local authorities and the Department has, issued guidance to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.690W.0/4">The liable relatives rule is now widely regarded as anachronistic and we intend to repeal it at the earliest opportunity. Additional funding has been provided to meet the cost to authorities of repealing the rule. In the interim, until the rule is repealed, guidance has been issued to local authorities strongly encouraging them to exercise their discretion in favour of not applying the rule.</p>

	<p pid="b.714W.2/1">Local planning authorities are responsible in the first instance for decisions on planning applications. Where applicants are dissatisfied with the decision there is a right of appeal to the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="b.714W.2/2">In addition, each local authority must appoint a monitoring officer who is responsible for advising the authority in respect of any possible breaches of the law by the authority or any committee or office holder of the authority. Where a party considers a decision by a local authority has not been made properly then it may be challenged in the High Court.</p>
	<p pid="b.714W.2/3">Local planning authorities make annual returns on a number of Best Value Performance Indicators to the Audit Commission one of which is the proportion of refusals of consent by local planning authorities that are overturned on appeal (BV204). The Audit Commission will take these returns into account when deciding whether to undertake an inspection.</p>

	<p pid="b.714W.5/1">The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (GPDO) provides the basis for works that have planning permission without the need for express approval from the local planning authority. However, domestic wind turbines were not anticipated by the order and local planning authorities have had to take their own interpretation of what is permitted.</p>
	<p pid="b.714W.5/2">The Government believe it should be easier to install microgeneration including small scale wind turbines. We are currently reviewing the regulations on what equipment a householder can install without having to apply for planning permission. We will be consulting on new proposals in the new year.</p>
