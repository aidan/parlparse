	<p pid="a.129W.3/14">The vast majority of this relates to visits in the UK. All travel is subject to approval by senior managers but the GEO's accounting systems do not record any distinction between international and domestic travel and isolating precise figures for the number of visits overseas and their cost before 2009-10, when returns to the Cabinet Office on ministerial travel overseas became necessary, could be done only at disproportionate cost. However, the GEO estimate that a quarter of the travel and subsistence expenditure incurred since GEO was established, some &#163;68,000, was spent on visits overseas by officials and Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.129W.3/15">Details of expenditure incurred by Ministers on visits overseas in 2009-10, totalling &#163;7,879, are available on the Cabinet Office website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.129W.3/17">Ministers representing GEO would have travelled in First or Business class and would normally be accompanied by a member of their Private Office staff. We do not have information relating to the accommodation used.</p>
	<p pid="a.129W.3/18">Once the GEO have moved on to Home Office accounting systems, precise distinctions between the costs of international and domestic travel will be possible, along with more detail about the costs incurred by individuals.</p>

	<p pid="a.131W.2/2">Data relating to removals is recorded on the Case Information Database (CID), which is the main information technology system used by the UK Border Agency (UKBA). For the purposes of reporting, CID records removals cancellations under standardised categories such as Judicial Review, Injunction, Medical Representations, and Further Representations received. Cases considered under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) Article 3 and Article 8 would fall under the further representations category.</p>

We will announce our final decisions on the future shape of tier 4 in due course, following the closure of the consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-31">31 January</phrase>. Those students in tier 4 of the points based system will, as now, be able to work in the UK after graduation by switching into tier 2, provided they meet the applicable requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.133W.8/1">While the UK Border Agency records information on the convictions of those who meet the criteria for deportation, we do not record information electronically on the convictions of those who do not meet the criteria nor do we record information on convictions in other countries. To obtain this information would exceed the cost threshold.</p>
	<p pid="a.133W.8/2">However we can advise that in 2010, for an average month, approximately 635 foreign national prisoners were detained in prison and 1,135 in immigration removal centres, beyond the end of their custodial sentence while deportation was considered. These average figures are based on internal management information and are subject to change.</p>
	<p pid="a.133W.8/3">We recognise the risk posed when foreign nationals with a history of offending overseas enter the UK. The proactive transfer of information across borders that would alert border or law enforcement agencies when such individuals travel is a complex and challenging area, particularly within the EU where freedom of movement is an established right for all citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.133W.8/4">However, we are currently seeking to reduce this risk by working with our European partners and law enforcement organisations such as Europol and Interpol to encourage improved police co-operation. We are also investigating how member states within Europe approach offender management and particularly whether comparable systems to our Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) exist. Through this work we will assess whether we can seek to extend these MAPPA principles across borders to reduce the risk posed by travelling offenders.</p>

	<p pid="a.135W.9/1">Passport security is of extreme importance. The UK passport is a secure and highly respected document both nationally and internationally because of the integrity derived from the processes of dealing with applications and issuing passports. The proposed closure of a passport application processing centre and local interview offices are in response to excess capacity within the Identity and Passport Service (IPS). The closure programme will not impact on the operational practices within IPS to ensure that the passport remains secure. Research is not planned in this area. Instead, IPS will continue to look at ways in which to improve and enhance the security of the passport and minimise the potential for fraudulent use of identity.</p>

A government to government sale is usually the first option that is explored. This has the benefit of strengthening international relationships and generating income that can be re-invested in defence. It also allows other governments to contribute to international security and can also provide UK industry with opportunities to undertake some of the regeneration work.</p>

	<p pid="a.146W.11/1">In common with other areas of the UK yet to undergo digital switchover, it is the case that reliable coverage of digital terrestrial television (Freeview) signals is currently unlikely to be available in some parts of Rochester and Strood. The primary reason for this is that until digital switchover takes place, the power of the digital transmitters is necessarily restricted to relatively low levels in order to prevent interference being caused to the existing analogue signals. However, when switchover takes place, the power of the digital transmitters will be raised to, on average, 10 times their current levels which will significantly extend their coverage. By the time that the nationwide switchover process is complete, digital TV signals will reach the same number of households as the analogue signals they replace (approximately 98.5% of the UK population).</p>
	<p pid="a.146W.11/2">Viewers in Rochester and Strood can potentially receive signals from a number of TV regions. Viewers that receive Meridian and London ITV services will switch fully to digital in 2012; while any that receive Anglia ITV services will switch later this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.155W.0/1">The efforts of the UN Secretary General and his Good Offices Mission to facilitate national reconciliation and dialogue in Burma have been consistently hampered by the unwillingness of the Burmese regime to co-operate with him, and engage seriously on issues of international concern. This lack of co-operation has included a reluctance to grant visas for visits by the UN Secretary General's special adviser on Burma, and rigid control of the special adviser's programme, restricting his ability to meet key political actors in Burma, including opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. We nonetheless applaud and strongly support the leadership shown by the UN Secretary General on this issue, and urge him to continue his efforts despite the difficulties. We also call on the Burmese authorities to work more constructively with the UN in the months ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.163W.5/2">Procedures are already in place to ensure that children's homes and fostering services make a report when a young person goes missing. The National Minimum Standards for children's homes and fostering services require that all registered children's homes and fostering services should have explicit procedures to follow when children in their care may be missing or absent without permission. Where a young person is not in the care of children's services, it is the responsibility of the parents/carers to report the young person missing.</p>

Local authorities then determine the best ways to work with the police to collate the data on numbers of runaways in their area, whether from home or from care, but this data are not collected centrally.</p>

However, DEFRA, in collaboration with the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC), has undertaken a review of the potential benefits, costs and issues surrounding the addition of biochar to soil. This found that the evidence base supporting the addition of biochar to soil was not particularly developed or robust, particularly under UK conditions, and that the potential for introducing contaminants to the soil from biochar was a particular concern. No further work has been planned. The study is available on the DEFRA website:</p>
	<p pid="a.166W.9/2" class="indent"><a href="http://randd.defra.gov.uk">http://randd.defra.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.166W.9/3">Biochar originates from biomass, and its production and combustion is eligible for support under DECC's renewables obligation mechanism. The level of support available will depend on the type of technology used to generate electricity; for example, if advanced pyrolysis or gasification is used, it would be awarded two renewable obligation certificates per megawatt hour.</p>
	<p pid="a.166W.9/4">Biochar produced from virgin biomass will be subject to the sustainability criteria to be introduced in the renewables obligation from April 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.167W.5/1">The merits of reallocating under-utilised quotas is being considered as part of the work to explore options for reform of fisheries management arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.167W.5/2">There are several reasons why the in-year reallocation of underutilised quota is not currently undertaken, e.g. quota holders may be retaining their quota to fish later in the year, or to use as swap currency to acquire different quota. The prospect of such reallocation can encourage a race to fish, which could mean that a fish stock is targeted out of season, thus increasing effort and discards of other stocks. Such reallocation may also impact on prices due to a surplus of fish on the market. Furthermore, there is also a risk of 'ghost' fishing in order to secure ongoing access and prevent reallocation-something that is difficult to enforce against.</p>
	<p pid="a.167W.5/3">I recognise the difficulties currently facing the under-10m fleet. I am committed to reforming the fisheries management arrangements, in order to place the fleet on a more sustainable footing. A consultation is due to be launched in the spring, and in the meantime work continues to consider what support can be offered to the under-10m fleet in the short-term.</p>

	<p pid="a.168W.5/28">Flexibility in the evidence allocation process for 2012-13 onwards is essential so that we can adjust our investment in evidence to respond to developing challenges. For example, significant changes to the direction of DEFRA's investment in evidence could result from the outcomes of White Papers or other major assessments that impact on priorities. At the same time it is recognised that the Department has to meet a number of 'less flexible' statutory monitoring and animal health surveillance requirements, i.e. classed as 'non-discretionary' spend.</p>
	<p pid="a.168W.5/29">To allow DEFRA investment to align to top evidence priorities, an unallocated evidence reserve has been created by 'top-slicing' the discretionary element of the evidence budget. The proportion of the discretionary element contributing to the unallocated reserve will be 10% in 2012-13, 25% in 2013-14 and 50% in 2014-15. This reserve will be reallocated back to individual programmes annually, taking into account overall evidence priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.168W.5/30">Statutory monitoring and animal health surveillance budgets are not contributing to the unallocated evidence reserve. However, in order to meet the total evidence savings needed across the spending review period, these budgets are generally being reduced by 5% year on year as a minimum. It is anticipated that these savings will be achievable through seeking efficiencies. Where this will not be possible, funds from the unallocated evidence reserve will be accessible.</p>

	<p pid="a.170W.8/1">All local authorities in England receive funding support for flood and coastal erosion risk management through formula grant arrangements. From the 2011-12 financial year, lead local flood authorities (established under the Flood and Water Management Act 2010) will receive additional support as area based grant to meet the costs of their new roles and responsibilities under the Act.

Map-based data on the presence of rivers for which local authorities have responsibility is being used to help determine the funding allocations to authorities under formula grant arrangements. Local authority expenditure on levies (including local levy to the Environment Agency and special levy to Internal Drainage Boards) will continue to be supported through formula grant, with allocations informed by records of past expenditure.</p>

This ring-fenced reserve will be annually reallocated to individual programmes according to the DEFRA's Chief Scientific Adviser's advice on evidence priorities.<br/> <i> Notes</i>:<br/> 1. Flexibility in the evidence allocation process for 2012-13 onwards is essential so that we can adjust our investment in evidence to respond to developing challenges. For example, significant changes to the direction of DEFRA's investment in evidence could result from the outcomes of White Papers or other major assessments that impact on priorities. At the same time it is recognised that DEFRA has to meet a number of 'less flexible' statutory monitoring and animal health surveillance requirements, i.e. classed as 'non-discretionary' spend.<br/> 2. To allow DEFRA investment to align to top evidence priorities, an unallocated evidence reserve has been created by 'top-slicing' the discretionary element of the evidence budget. The proportion of the discretionary element contributing to the unallocated reserve will be 10% in 2012-13, 25% in 2013-14 and 50% in 2014-15. This reserve will be reallocated back to individual programmes annually, taking into account overall evidence priorities.<br/> 3. Statutory monitoring and animal health surveillance budgets are not contributing to the unallocated evidence reserve. However, in order to meet the total evidence savings needed across the spending review period, these budgets are generally being reduced by 5% year on year as a minimum. It is anticipated that these savings will be achievable through seeking efficiencies. Where this will not be possible, funds from the unallocated evidence reserve will be accessible.</td> </tr>

Scientists at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology are undertaking some detailed analysis on the trends of native ladybird species in response to the arrival of the harlequin ladybird, using Biological Records Centre data collected through volunteer recording schemes. This work could help in the consideration of any future actions. They are also studying the adaptation of native parasites to the harlequin ladybird and there is an increase in the prevalence of these attacking harlequins. As with the very successful Harlequin Ladybird Survey itself, members of the public are being asked to help by recording and reporting what they see through the UK Ladybird Parasite Survey which was launched last year:</p>

	<p pid="a.175W.5/1">Himalayan balsam is widespread in the wild in Britain and it would not be efficient use of Government resources to tackle this plant above other priorities. However, the Administrations in England, Scotland and Wales launched the Invasive Non-native Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain in 2008 as a joint policy framework. Its aim is to minimise the risk posed by invasive non-native species in Great Britain and to reduce the negative impacts which they cause. Through our work on the GB strategy we are helping local action groups who are taking action to manage this plant and others on a local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.175W.5/2">While there is no statutory requirement for landowners to remove the plant from their property, because of its potential harm to habitats and native species it is listed on schedule 9 and subject to section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which makes it an offence to plant, or cause this species to grow, in the wild.</p>

Local authorities can require landowners to clean up &quot;land adversely affecting the amenity of the neighbourhood&quot; and also have the power to undertake clean-up works and to recover costs from the landowner. If Japanese knotweed is growing on the local authority's own land, it is reasonable to expect that authority to take appropriate action.

	<p pid="a.177W.0/1">DEFRA's assessment is that there is a continual low risk of the introduction of foot and mouth disease (FMD) into the UK (and the EU) from currently affected regions around the world. Additional measures have been put in place as a result of the ongoing situation in Bulgaria, including alerting industry to the situation. More generally, preliminary outbreak assessments are published regularly on the DEFRA website for FMD and other disease incidents around the world.</p>

	<p pid="a.177W.6/1">Policy on invasive non-native species is a devolved issue. The administrations in England, Scotland and Wales launched the Invasive Non-native Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain in 2008 as a joint policy framework. It is built on a key principle agreed under the Convention on Biological Diversity which ranks prevention, early detection and rapid action, and longer term management in that order of priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.177W.6/2">Under the Strategy, the &quot;Be Plantwise&quot; campaign, in partnership with industry and user organisations, aims to raise awareness of the issues and advises users of non-native plants on key behaviours to reduce the risks of introducing invasive plants to the wild. In addition we are considering whether to use legislative powers to prohibit the sale of specified invasive species, and as an example of cost-effective action taken, all known occurrences of the South American creeping water primrose, which is a significant problem on the continent are being eradicated since it was caught early enough.</p>

	<p pid="a.180W.2/1">DECC is committed to being an open and transparent Government Department. Staff understand the need to minimise the use of jargon and promote plain English in departmental communications. DECC's communications strategy underlines DECC's commitment to increase transparency and openness in departmental communications.</p>
	<p pid="a.180W.2/2">It is an aim of the Department to ensure that content on the DECC website and e-communication channels is straightforward, engaging and delivered in plain English. A recent review of the Department's website:</p>

	<p pid="a.180W.2/5">The Department is currently working on a project to improve the navigation and structure of the DECC site to make content easier to find. On consultations, DECC is committed to ensuring that consultation documents are self-contained and as clear as possible-in particular, aiming to make all information published clear in terms of the language used, avoiding jargon, abbreviations and acronyms where possible (where they are unavoidable, including them in a glossary of terms).</p>
	<p pid="a.180W.2/6">Finally, written correspondence to Members of Parliament and members of the public is drafted with the help of a Formatting Guide, one clear requirement of which is for all acronyms to be spelled out in full the first time they are used.</p>

This is because the time limit for accounting periods ending in March 2010 is not until March 2011, so some returns for that year are not yet due.

	<p pid="a.189W.5/18">There is a significant balance of notices for each year which have not resulted in the delivery of a return. Where HMRC believes that a return is indeed outstanding, they make a determination of tax and pursue payment. The determination can be displaced only by delivery of a return. But in many more cases, information received since the issue of the notice has shown that no return is in fact required. Typically that will be the case where more accurate information about the true accounting periods of the company is received, or where HMRC learns that the company had gone into insolvent liquidation or ceased to trade.</p>

Some of the spend during this period was on furniture for the new HQ building, where some of the furniture from older buildings couldn't be reused due to wear and tear. The estates rationalisation programme is reducing the London estate from 18 buildings to four. This is anticipated to save &#163;41 million by 2015.</p>

	<p pid="a.201W.2/1">The initial cumulative equalities impact assessment (EIA) that was published alongside the consultation 'Proposals for the Reform of Legal Aid in England and Wales' identifies the potential for some of the civil legal aid proposals to disproportionately affect women, disabled people and Black, Asian, and minority ethnic people. This appears to be primarily a reflection of the composition of the client base of civil legal aid recipients. People from these groups are overrepresented among recipients of civil legal aid services-because of this any changes to the system have the potential to affect them more.</p>
	<p pid="a.201W.2/2">The EIA also explains the Government's initial view that any such disadvantage would be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim and therefore justified for reasons which are set out for each of the proposals. Legal aid must make a substantial contribution to necessary reductions in the budget of the Ministry of Justice. Our proposals seek to deliver these savings in a fair, balanced and sustainable way, targeting legal aid on those who need it most, for the most serious cases in which legal advice or representation is justified.</p>
	<p pid="a.201W.2/3">One of the purposes of publishing the initial EIA is to allow respondents to the consultation to comment on our assessment of the potential impact of the proposals. We will take this feedback into account in finalising our proposals and making decisions on the final proposals for implementation. We will also complete a final EIA, updating the analysis we have already published and incorporating evidence on the impact on different groups submitted during the consultation. This will be published alongside the Government's response to the consultation.</p>

The responsible authorities for any area are the chief officer of police, the probation trust and the Minister of the Crown exercising functions in relation to prisons, acting jointly. Responsible authorities and agencies with a duty to co-operate with the responsible authorities are required to draw up a memorandum of understanding, setting out the ways in which they are to co-operate in the management of relevant offenders.

	<p pid="a.217W.2/1">The Education Sector Support Programme in Nigeria (ESSPIN) is subject to regular scrutiny, and the last major review took place in May 2010. This provided strong evidence that the programme is increasing the accountability of the Nigerian Government to its citizens. ESSPIN works closely with another programme which is funded by the Department for International Development (DFID)-the State Accountability and Voice Programme (SAVI)-to identify, train and support civil society organisations to mobilise communities and encourage greater government accountability. ESSPIN works with local government officials to establish school based management committees, which make schools, teachers and local officials more accountable to the local community.</p>

	<p pid="a.222W.2/1">It is not possible to make meaningful comparisons between the level of compensation made to individuals in the Republic of Ireland and the level of ex-gratia payments made to individuals here in the United Kingdom, because the two systems are completely different. In the Republic of Ireland, lump sum payments are made, the size of which varies according to the circumstances of the individual claimant. Here in the UK, there is a system of lump sum, annual, and discretionary ex-gratia payments. The recurrent annual payments will be made over the lifetime of the infected individual, so it is impossible to ascertain how much individual patients might receive in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.222W.2/2">As I explained to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-10">10 January 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2011-01-10.33"><i> Official Report,</i> columns 33-42</phrase>, the circumstances in the Republic of Ireland are unique to them, in that the Irish Government chose to establish an independent Compensation Tribunal to determine the quantum of payments by reference to Irish principles of law governing the calculation of damages. In consequence, the basic awards made in Ireland (leaving aside exemplary or aggravated damages) are compensatory in nature but are paid without proof of negligence in any given case. The article in <i> The Irish Times</i> on <phrase class="date" code="1997-08-05">5 August 1997</phrase>, has already been placed in the Library on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-14">14 October 2010</phrase>, demonstrates that there is a clear indication of an acceptance by the Irish Government that in many, if not all cases, the claimants were likely to have a good cause of action because the Irish Attorney General advised that the Irish Blood Transfusion Service Board (for which the Irish Government are responsible) would be found guilty of negligence.</p>
	<p pid="a.222W.2/3">In my remarks to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-10">10 January 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2011-01-10.33"><i> Official Report</i>, columns 33-42</phrase>, I referred to the question of liability in relation to the Republic of Ireland. For the avoidance of doubt, I am aware that no liability was formally accepted by the Government of the Republic of Ireland, nor was such a determination made by a court. My response to questions highlighted that, in view of the acknowledgement of mistakes made by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service Board, the nature of the payments in Ireland were consistent with a finding of liability leading to compensation as was set out in that article. The approach we have taken in the UK is therefore distinct and different, and is ex gratia in nature. Our payments are not equivalent to those that would be made on the basis of legal liability.</p>

	<p pid="a.225W.5/2">The Department works closely with national health service and charitable organisations such as Cardiac Risk in the Young and British Heart Foundation in developing services aimed at identifying people who are at risk and assessing them and their families to reduce their chances of dying from an arrhythmic condition. It has also worked with these organisations to ensure that systems are in place for those diagnosed with a potentially life threatening condition, and their families, to produce appropriate counselling, advice information and psychological support.</p>
	<p pid="a.225W.5/3">The Department supported formation of the UK Cardiac Pathology Network (UKCPN) in order to provide local coroners with an expert cardiac pathology service and to promote best pathological practice in sudden death cases. A national database on sudden arrhythmic death was launched in November 2008 funded by the Department allowing UKCPN pathologists to record information on cases referred to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.236W.2/1">Apprenticeships is a demand-led programme for young people and adults. Government funds apprenticeship training, in full for 16 to 19-year-olds and in part for adults; but relies on employers and providers to work together to offer sufficient opportunities, in the context of the greater freedoms and flexibilities that we have created in the further education system. Therefore, Government does not plan apprenticeship places but provides funding and forecasts the number of places that may be afforded as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.236W.2/2">We have recently set out indicative forecasts of apprenticeships in documents published by the Young People's Learning Agency and BIS.</p>
	<p pid="a.236W.2/3">For 16 to 19-year-olds, the YPLA document &quot;16 to 19 Funding Statement&quot;, published in December, states that we plan to have 131,200 apprentice starts in 2010/11 and 133,500 in 2011/12.</p>
	<p pid="a.236W.2/4">The BIS documents &quot;Skills for Sustainable Growth and Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth&quot; set out the abolition of central targets and increased freedom and flexibility for further education colleges and training organisations to respond effectively to the needs of employers, learners and their communities. It will be for individual colleges and training organisations, working directly with their local partners, to determine the offer that best meets the needs of their communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.236W.2/5">From the 2011/12 academic year, there will be a single Adult Skills Budget, with earmarked delivery for apprenticeships. As part of its allocations process later this year, the Skills Funding Agency will set out a minimum expectation of apprenticeships delivery. Further education colleges and training organisations will be able to use their single Adult Skills Budget allocation to expand apprenticeships. Meanwhile, any diversion of funding away from apprenticeships will be agreed with the agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.236W.2/6">In this context, &quot;Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth&quot; offers an indicative forecast for apprenticeship learner numbers, including apprentices expected to continue learning from the previous year. It does not provide a direct comparison in starts for adult (19+) apprentices and does not differentiate by age band. Officials have converted the learner numbers to starts for comparison, so the indicative forecast is for 220,900 adult (19+) starts in 2010/11 and 227,100 in 2011/12.</p>
	<p pid="a.236W.2/7">We have not published forecast starts figures beyond 2011/12.</p>

	<p pid="a.239W.2/3">However, the ALG programme does not support the learning that is required to obtain registration on the Approved Driving Instructor Register. There are no specific NVQ or other qualifications which lead to registration on the Approved Driving Instructor Register.

	<p pid="a.244W.8/2">This analysis shows that the UK has specialised in high technology industries such as aerospace, pharmaceuticals and medical instruments. These industries are characterised by high levels of innovation including R&amp;D, knowledge, skills and investment in capital and intangible assets such as branding and design. OECD figures show that in 2008, around 65% of UK manufacturing exports were higher technology exports.</p>

	<p pid="a.245W.0/1">The Government are establishing a new framework, with increased responsibility on universities to widen participation; and greater investment in improving attainment and access for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Universities wanting to charge more than a &#163;6,000 annual graduate contribution will have to demonstrate what more they will do to attract more students from disadvantaged backgrounds through outreach activities, targeted scholarships and other financial support. This will include a requirement to participate in the new &#163;150 million National Scholarship Programme. This forms part of a package of measures to support disadvantaged young people through their education, including the introduction of the &#163;2.5 billion pupil premium which will support them to achieve at school and turn that into success at university.</p>
	<p pid="a.245W.0/2">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) is working with the Gateways to the Professions Collaborative Forum to support and encourage actions by the professions themselves to remove the barriers to professional careers, such as Medicine, especially for people from disadvantaged groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.245W.0/3">Responsibility for education and healthcare issues in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, including workforce planning, lies with the devolved Administrations. The planned number of medical school places in England was last increased by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), in collaboration with DH and DFES, in early 2006, to 6,194 places from autumn 2006 and there are currently no plans to change this number. The number of entrants to medical school is fairly stable, but numbers in individual institutions may vary from year to year. Universities are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own admissions policies and decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.254W.2/1">The Department puts customer needs at the heart of all its activity. To that end, we try to ensure that the content of all our communications does not contain jargon and meets plain English requirements. Some of the content can be complex due to the subject matter and, where this is the case, it is written as simply as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.2/2">Our online information, available to customers on Directgov, is published by an accredited editor. The accreditation process includes demonstrating the ability to write content using plain English conventions. Feedback about the online information can be left by customers using a comment function, available throughout the Directgov site.</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.2/3">DWP leaflets are produced by teams that have had plain English training. All new public information leaflets are tested, prior to their launch, with customers and receive accreditation by an external plain English supplier. Feedback on the leaflets is also encouraged and can be provided in a range of ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.2/4">The main benefit claim forms are produced by people that are trained specifically in the use of plain English and forms design. Additionally a proportion of our forms are independently accredited for plain English. Complex terms, where used, are explained in the form.</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.2/5">The Department is in the process of improving the 130 to 140 million letters sent annually to customers. These are generated by our computer systems and research has shown that some of our customers find the content difficult to understand. We have recently improved approximately 20 million of these letters and customers should start receiving these in the first half of 2011. We will then review and rewrite the remaining letters.</p>

	<p pid="a.256W.5/5" class="indent">Since January 2010, staffing levels across Jobcentre Plus have been on a reducing trend. This is due to a reduction in workloads in Jobcentre Plus; staff leaving through natural turnover; staff on fixed term appointments reaching the end of their contracts; and the impact of the wider recruitment freeze which applies across all Government departments.</p>

	<p pid="a.259W.6/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your Parliamentary Question about what guidance Jobcentre Plus provides to jobseekers who do not have an internet connection at home on how to access information on job vacancies. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.6/4" class="indent">We recognise the upward trend of employers using online applications as their preferred method of recruitment, so we know it is becoming increasingly important for our customers to be able to search for and apply for jobs online.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.6/5" class="indent">In response and in recognition that not everyone has internet access at home, we have put in place measures to help people gain access to online vacancies through other means.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.6/6" class="indent">This includes signposting people in England to the UK online free-phone telephone number 0800 771234 (or other similar services in Scotland and Wales) to find their nearest UK online centre; and signposting directly to known local sources of access such as the local library.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.6/7" class="indent">Advisers will also highlight other means of access such as using smart phones to access the internet to look for jobs. We have developed a specific smart phone job search application available for I Phone and Google Android systems so customers with these handsets can have ready access to vacancies at the touch of a button.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.6/8" class="indent">To help further raise the profile of our own online services, we are also committed to the &quot;Race on Line&quot; initiative, part of which has seen the deployment of a Digital Champion in every local Jobcentre Plus office. Their role is to promote digital take up and to find what support is available locally for customers to get online through partner organisations and share this information with colleagues to help and encourage customers to get online.</p>
	<p pid="a.259W.6/9" class="indent">Over and above helping people access vacancies online, we also signpost people to the Direct Gov job bank through Jobseeker Direct (our telephony based jobsearch and matching service) on 0845 606 0234 and Job Points in every Jobcentre Plus local office, both of which provide people with fast and easy access to thousands of jobs.</p>
