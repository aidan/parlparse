	<p pid="a.1W.3/1">My official spokesman announces my forthcoming official engagements each day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-06">6 March</phrase>, I visited Helmand where I was briefed by our military and civilian leaders, and by Afghan Commanders, on the latest developments on the ground, in particular on Operation Moshtarak, and on the challenges faced by our forces throughout Helmand, especially in Sangin.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.3/3">I was updated on ISAF plans to reorganise responsibilities and command and control in Southern Afghanistan, as the operational situation evolves after Operation Moshtarak and the deployment of additional US forces. Key to this will be building on the increasingly successful partnering of the Afghan security forces, and achieving the right ratios of security forces (international and Afghan) to the civilian population to enable General McChrystal's counter-insurgency approach. And although final decisions have yet to be taken it is likely UK forces will increasingly concentrate in central Helmand.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.3/4">I was updated on ongoing stabilisation efforts: provision of jobs on projects, efforts to strengthen the local economy, and helping farmers cultivate a range of legal crops rather than poppy. 1,000 Afghan civil order police are now being deployed into the areas cleared in Operation Moshtarak. Over time they will be replaced by 1,000 regular Afghan police. To support this the UK are deploying an additional eight police mentoring teams, additional police advisers for the NATO training mission and the EU police mission, and additional support for the police training centre, a total of over 150 extra personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.3/5">I was updated on progress with recruiting in the Afghan army, which has increased sevenfold since the end of 2009, with 500 more Afghan army in Helmand since December. Embedded partnering between British forces and the Afghan army is already generating positive results: for example, UK battlegroups report a 30 per cent. improvement in intelligence collection, including on the location of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), after the introduction of joint patrolling with Afghan forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.3/6">I was updated on progress in equipment including faster delivery of Vallon IED detectors towards our target of deploying over 6,500 by July, together with additional sets of ground penetrating radar. Specialised Talisman route-clearance vehicles and equipment will deploy in the next two months. The Ministry of Defence is also committing a further &#163;18 million over the next two years to strengthen pre-deployment training on counter-IED techniques, in addition to the significant investment announced in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.3/7">I was updated on the increased number of hours our Chinook and Apache helicopters can fly each month; the successful introduction of Merlin helicopters; the deployment of Czech helicopters made possible by the British helicopter fund initiative; and the recent increases of Hermes 450 unmanned aerial vehicles and options for accelerating the planned increase of Predator/Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.3/8">Finally, I visited engineers responsible for sustaining the fleet of protected mobility vehicles including Mastiff and Ridgeback vehicles-offering world-leading protection against IED strikes. Over 100 more of those vehicles have been deployed since last summer. I also inspected the newly introduced Husky utility vehicle, 100 of which are in transit to Afghanistan. I was able to update our forces on the Ministry of Defence's plans for a new light protected patrol vehicle, with Treasury approval of the first 200 vehicles as an urgent operational requirement. The Ministry of Defence judge that this meets the requirement in Afghanistan and will make announcements on further tranches in due course, as is standard practice with major equipment procurements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1W.3/9">I look forward in the coming weeks to discussing the position in Afghanistan with the King of Jordan and Prime Minister Erdogan when they visit London. I also plan to attend the European Council meeting in Brussels on 25 to <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-26">26 March</phrase>.</p>

Nor is it possible to say how much of the former set-aside land is now cropped.

	<p pid="a.13W.6/1">Sporting venues in Leeds and Yorkshire are well placed to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the London 2012 Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.13W.6/2">Sport England has recently made a significant investment in the Aquatics Centre at the John Charles Sports Centre in Leeds. These facilities will play a significant part in developing young swimmers and divers and in hosting visiting Olympic squads. The &#163;5 million investment has helped deliver an international standard 50 metre competition and training pool with moveable boom and floor that meets the needs of both performance swimmers and the local community. It also includes one of the best equipped diving competition and training pools in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.13W.6/3">Leeds has also benefited from the Free Swimming capital programme with awards totalling almost &#163;2.5 million. This investment will help modernise several key community swimming pools including those at Aireborough and Kirkstall.</p>
	<p pid="a.13W.6/4">There are 49 pre-games training camps in Yorkshire that are available to Olympics teams and the Serbian and Dutch swimming teams have already committed to holding their pre-games training camps in Leeds.</p>
	<p pid="a.13W.6/5">Sheffield also hosts the GB squads for boxing, volleyball and table tennis, and one of the GB centres for diving. These four sports have received their funding allocation from UK sport based on their plans for London 2012 and have used some of their Cabinet Office programme's funding to enhance squad facilities. For example, boxing has invested in improving and expanding training areas in the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield into one of the best amateur boxing centres in the world.</p>

	<p pid="a.17W.2/1">This Department has provided sustained levels of funding to local authorities to assist them to invest in their roads. Since the introduction of the Local Transport Plan (LTP) settlement in 2001-02 this Department has more than doubled annual capital funding to local authorities across England (outside London) for maintaining local roads. LTP capital funding for highway maintenance in 2009-10 is &#163;736 million, up from &#163;265 million in 2000-01. Funding in London is a matter for the Mayor.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.2/2">Local authorities are also able to use revenue funding, allocated by the Department of Communities and Local Government (CLG) through the Formula Grant, for maintaining their local highways. Neither of these funding sources are ring fenced. It is for local authorities to decide upon their spending priorities across the whole range of services that they provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.2/3">In addition the Department has provided PFI funding to assist authorities to develop highway maintenance PFI schemes. Currently &#163;2 billion PFI credits have been allocated for highways maintenance schemes. One project with allocated PFI credits of &#163;121 million has been signed. In addition there are three projects in procurement with approved PFI credits of &#163;1.5 billion. A further highway maintenance PFI project with approved funding of &#163;365 million PFI credits is shortly to enter into procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.2/4">The Department has also provided emergency funding to local authorities to assist them to carry out repairs to their highways arising from extreme weather events.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.2/5">We have also encouraged local authorities to adopt transport asset management plans. These will include inventories of highways assets, their existing condition, and the target condition based upon desired service levels. Knowledge of the condition of highways assets and the desired service level that an authority intends those assets to deliver, are key components in the process of deciding what expenditure is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.17W.2/6">A Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy report in July 2008 concluded that &#163;15 million would be necessary to assist local authorities in Great Britain to develop transport asset management. Last year this Department allocated &#163;32 million to assist English local authorities take forward highway asset management.</p>

	<p pid="a.18W.2/1">The Highways Agency through its service providers implements area-specific winter maintenance plans across the Strategic Road Network throughout the winter period. Snow ploughs are fitted as soon as snow is forecast. Salt is spread both in advance of and during snow fall, supplemented by ploughing as required to ensure that the network remains as safe as reasonably practicable. The agency also provides information and advice to road users using variable message signs, the internet and via the media.</p>
	<p pid="a.18W.2/2">Winter service on other roads is the responsibility of each local highway authority. The Department for Transport endorses the winter service guidance provided by the UK Roads Liaison Group in its highways maintenance code of practice, &quot;Well-maintained Highways&quot;. This makes clear that safety is a prime consideration for winter service. My Department wrote to each local authority last year with a leaflet &quot;Are you ready for winter?&quot;, when the winter service guidance was updated, encouraging authorities to review their winter service strategies.</p>

	<p pid="a.20W.8/1">Following the Blake Report and the Government's response in June 2006, the Army has striven further to ensure that the best welfare provision is in place for soldiers under training. We have made improvements in the level of welfare support available to new recruits, as well as in the way in which we monitor and report incidents. For example, the implementation of the Army's Suicide Vulnerability Risk Management Policy represents a major stride, since the tragic events at Deepcut, in our drive to reduce the incidence of suicide in the Army. We have also improved the military complaints process and increased supervisory levels in establishments with new recruits.</p>

According to the results of the 2009 tri-service Recruit Trainee Survey over 90 per cent. of recruits and trainees consider that they are well looked after and fully understand the support that is there should they require it. An Ofsted report in June 2009 found that the support and care provided to recruits and trainees was comprehensive and wide ranging.</p>

	<p pid="a.24W.3/21">The Refit and Maintenance costs take account of the costs of delivering the ongoing Vanguard Class Long Overhaul Period (Refuel) (LOP (R)) programme, the costs of LOP(R) planning, and the procurement of long lead materials. The Refit and Maintenance costs do not include the D154 contract for the Submarine Refitting Facilities Upgrade at Devonport.</p>
	<p pid="a.24W.3/22">For 2002-03 onwards, the costs for Refit and Maintenance include external contractor costs, known as Contracted Out Operational Support (COOPS) under the Warship Support Modernisation Initiative (WSMI), where these can be attributed to the Vanguard Class. The COOPS costs relate to the provision of specialist subcontractor support for propulsion systems, masts and sensors, and weapons systems. It is not possible to provide equivalent costs prior to 2002 as these are not held in the format requested. The COOPS figure for 2002-03 only covers the six months for which data is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.24W.3/23">The figures given for the labour costs at Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Clyde are estimated because, under WSMI, these costs are collected for HMNB Clyde as a whole, and are not attributed to specific classes of ships or submarines. The figures quoted are derived from the total WSMI costs using a standard methodology. Costs are not available prior to 2002 because the contract for WSMI did not commence until September 2002, and information prior to this is not held in the format requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.24W.3/24">Alterations and Additions costs have been supplied only for 2008-09, which is the only year for which figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.24W.3/25">Nuclear propulsion costs are not held in the format requested because they cannot be broken down by submarine class. These costs would include the supply of spares and maintenance of Nuclear Steam Raising Plant components, the costs of Technical Authority support for maintenance of the design intent and safety case, the independent nuclear safety advice for the plant, and the provision of new reactor cores at refits. They would also cover the provision of cores, spares and other materiel maintenance by the equipment suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="a.24W.3/26">Operating costs prior to 2006-07 are not held centrally. The operating costs include manpower, stock (such as tools and hardware) and other costs such as travel and subsistence, and accommodation stores.</p>

As Consular staff took immediate action to follow up concerns raised by the family about the behaviour of the local undertaker. We have since removed him from the embassy's list of approved undertakers in Greece. Consular staff are unable to accept personal belongings of British nationals. We tried on several occasions to make contact with Mr. Oliver's friends and the local undertaker in order to arrange for his personal belongings to be returned to the UK. Consular staff further assisted by arranging (for Mrs. Oliver during her visit to Corfu) meetings with the Coroner's office and the local undertaker.</p>

	<p pid="a.30W.0/1">It is clear that the people of Iran are leading the charge for human rights and democracy, however they need to know that their calls for basic rights and freedoms are supported by the international community. The Iranian Government have a duty to ensure that their actions live up to the human rights standards to which it has committed. The United Kingdom was one of many UN member states to draw attention to the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran during its Universal Periodic Review (UPR) at the Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-15">15 February</phrase>. The HRC is currently in session in Geneva, and we are seeking every opportunity to draw attention to the situation in Iran, both nationally and as the EU. My noble Friend Baroness Kinnock raised our concerns when addressing the Council on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-02">2 March</phrase> and we did so again in our response to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-04">4 March</phrase>.</p>

We will continue to work hard alongside partners, international Non-governmental organisations and civil society to ensure that the Iranian regime is held to account over its appalling human rights record.</p>

	<p pid="a.37W.9/1">We published &quot;Investing in Potential&quot; in December 2009 setting out the decisive steps we are taking to reduce the proportion of young people who are not in education, employment or training. Through our September and January Guarantees, we are offering 16 and 17-year-olds a place in learning. The Young Person's Guarantee will ensure that 18 to 24-year-olds still unemployed after six months will be guaranteed access to a job, training or work experience.</p>

	<p pid="a.42W.0/1">The majority of schools have been teaching Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education (PSHEE)-which includes Sex and Relationships Education (SRE)-as a non-statutory subject for many years, through a mix of specialist PSHEE teachers, as well as form tutors.</p>
	<p pid="a.42W.0/2">In general, budgets for teachers' continuing professional development (CPD) are devolved to individual schools and no central records are kept on how much of this money is spent on CPD for individual subjects. However, in recognition of the sensitive and varied topics covered in PSHEE, additional central funding for a national CPD programme has been available to schools for a number of years. This has resulted in around 8,000 teachers having been trained and a further 1,800 are currently in training this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.42W.0/3">When PSHEE becomes compulsory in the national curriculum from September 2011, we would expect most of the teaching to continue to come from existing teachers who will receive supplementary training, either through the national programme identified above, or from locally sourced training paid for from school's local budgets</p>
	<p pid="a.42W.0/4">However, in recognition that PSHEE will be compulsory from September 2011, we are working with the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA), to develop a route through initial teacher training (ITT) to become a specialist PSHEE teacher. From September 2010, we anticipate that 200 trainee teachers a year will be trained to deliver PSHEE as an enhancement to their main subject area.</p>
	<p pid="a.42W.0/5">To enhance PSHEE coverage in all ITT, we are changing the guidance so that providers of ITT will need to ensure that all of their trainees are familiar with the National Curriculum guidance on PSHEE that is relevant to the age ranges they will teach.</p>

	<p pid="a.50W.0/21" class="indent">Within the time available, it has not been possible to produce a straightforward correlation between exact posts and expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.0/22" class="indent">In 2008/09, we undertook a number of major recruitment campaigns. These were related to filling posts resulting from decisions to strengthen our compliance function and to make strategic changes in our organisational structure as a result of the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review. Many of the posts had specialist requirements and consultants were engaged to help us source the candidates with the right skills and experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.0/23" class="indent">The majority of expenditure with TMP (UK) Limited and Bernard Hodes Group relates to advertising space in the media: the agencies contract directly with the press for placing job advertisements and then the Commission reimburses the agencies for the costs they incurred. Only a small proportion of the expenditure, therefore, will be the agencies' fee. A complete analysis of the split between agency fees and the cost of job advertisements is not readily available.</p>
	<p pid="a.50W.0/24" class="indent">A further aspect of the expenditure with the Bernard Hodes Group was investment in a dedicated careers website, which has enabled the Commission to reduce its recruitment budget for 2009/10 to &#163;200,000. The Commission forecast for the current financial year shows that it expects expenditure on recruitment to remain within that budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.50W.6/5" class="indent">Local authorities are required to conduct their own annual counts if they have more than ten rough sleepers, and so we have been in touch with local authorities to learn how they carry out their counts to see whether any successful procedures used by them could be used or modified for the 2011 Census. We are also planning to liaise directly with local authorities for information about particular sites where rough sleepers might be found, as well as to obtain information on any local homeless charities. We have had a useful meeting with Homeless Link which represents and supports a number of organisations working with the homeless and are planning to meet them again.</p>

	<p pid="a.60W.2/2">Progress is being sustained through the Long Term Conditions programme which includes work to support and accelerate implementation of care planning; elements of which are a Primary Care Service Specification to support commissioners and to incentivise delivery in primary care, and a leaflet for families explaining the benefits of care planning. Assessing the demand and providing for individual care plans for children with complex conditions is for local decision based on local assessment of need.</p>

	<p pid="a.61W.9/19">As total NHS planned resources for 2010-11 are &#163;105.8 billion, PFI payments will represent approximately 1.2 per cent. of the total, LIFT approximately 0.2 per cent. and ISTCs 0.4 per cent. As payments rise with the rate of inflation, as demonstrated by the tables, we expect that NHS PPP/PFI contributions will remain at the level of less than 2 per cent. of the total budget for the life of the contracts. The phase 1 ISTC schemes have reached, or are reaching the end of their contracted periods and are being renegotiated.</p>

At the point of contract award or renewal it is intended that all commercial employment programmes will adopt the PRaP IT solution both for referring individual customers and to make the associated payments to providers.</p>

This is why the Chancellor announced in the December 2009 pre-Budget report that attendance allowance would be increased by 1.5 per cent.-bringing forward help when it is most needed. Without this commitment, the recent negative growth in the retail prices index would have meant that this benefit would not have increased in 2010.</p>

This is why the Chancellor announced in the December 2009 pre-Budget report that attendance allowance would be increased by 1.5 per cent., bringing forward help when it is most needed.

	<p pid="a.88W.5/1">We are currently in the process of establishing the Office for Legal Complaints, which is on course to meet the timetable set by Parliament of becoming fully operational by late 2010. As part of this process, the OLC has been ensuring that it understands the landscape of the legal services market, including any possible areas which may generate significant amounts of complaints. The OLC has had discussions with the Law Society, Ministry of Justice and Department of Energy and Climate Change to make sure the lessons learnt from handling complaints such as coal health compensation claims benefit the new system of complaints handling, so that the new service is responsive to any demands that might be made of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.5/2">Under current proposals, the OLC will not be handling any complaints raised in the old system. As such, it will remain the responsibility of the LCS to ensure agreements made with solicitors in respect of miners' compensation fees are met. The LCS has received a total of 6,454 complaints relating to deductions. As a result of action taken by the LCS, including the project to work with firms to contact former clients, a total of &#163;5,078,652.47 has been paid to former miners. This work is ongoing and the figure will therefore increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.5/3">During the period in which the LCS is closing down, the Legal Services Board, as part of its responsibilities as the new oversight regulator of the legal sector, will be seeking to ensure that there is no detriment to consumers and the profession. The Ministry of Justice will seek regular updates from the LCS and LSB. The Government continue to support the work of the Law Society in their work to recover deductions not yet paid.</p>

	<p pid="a.89W.5/1">The Ministry of Justice keeps under regular review the arrangements for carrying out research on offender management. Our priority is to ensure that the research we commission provides good value for money and answers key questions about the most effective practice. We have received a number of proposals seeking funding for setting up an Offender Management Institute. We have assessed these and, while we believe they have some merit, we are not convinced that the time is right to change existing arrangements. Currently, a wide range of research on offender management is being carried out in different parts of the Department.</p>

The MoJ is also overseeing the Unit Cost in Criminal Justice (UCCJ) project which is generating information on the costs of interventions targeted at adult and young offenders.

	<p pid="a.93W.2/11">In addition, under the New Prisons Programme it is intended to build up to five new prisons with a total of 7,500 places and, as part of this programme it is currently planned to close up to 5,500 worn out, inefficient places in the current estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.93W.2/12">The Ministry of Justice does not hold official estimates for future useable operational capacity. Operational capacity figures will also be affected by the impact of maintenance programmes, which will vary over time. The precise numbers and delivery timings of new prison places will also depend on construction schedules and prioritisation within the prison estate.</p>

	<p pid="a.94W.5/1">The Ministry of Justice produces annual projections of the prison population in England and Wales, most recently in August 2009. These project the prison population under three different scenarios, based on different assumptions about future sentencing trends.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.5/2">Other impacts included in the projections, such as those of legislation and processes, are applied equally to all scenarios. These cover the anticipated impacts of policy and process initiatives that have agreed implementation timetables. These assumptions and anticipated impacts have remained unchanged since 2008 projections.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.5/3">End of Custody Licence (ECL) was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-29">29 June 2007</phrase>. Under this scheme a prisoner who was given a determinate custodial sentence between four weeks and four years can be released on licence up to 18 days before the end of their sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.5/4">Because there was no agreed timetable for its conclusion, its effect was included throughout the projection period. In the second half of 2009, the caseload of prisoners on ECL has been between 1,000 and 1,200:</p>

	<p pid="a.94W.5/6">The scheme ends on <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-12">12 March</phrase> this year as it was recently announced. As result of this, it is expected that by the end of March 2010, the prison population will be 1,000 to 1,200 higher than was anticipated in the current published prison population projections.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.5/7">This effect will carry on from March 2010 estimates onwards. Here are last year's projections plus 1,200:</p>

This includes advice to the Home Office on the distribution of Counter-Terrorism Specific Grant funding across the police counter-terrorism network. In addition, ACPO (TAM) has developed a programme management structure to coordinate the delivery of a major national up-lift in the police's counter-terrorism capability.

	<p pid="a.116W.14/1">Published management information indicates that 830 children entered detention solely under Immigration Act powers between April and December 2009 and 860 children left detention held solely under Immigration Act powers during the same period.

However, published National Statistics indicate that a total of 415 children were removed from the UK upon leaving detention solely under Immigration Act powers in the same period. As usual, figures are provisional and are rounded to the nearest five. Children are those individuals recorded as being under 18 years of age at the start and the end of their period of detention respectively and may have been detained more than once during that time.</p>

However the Government do not believe that guardians for trafficked children would enhance the protection and support available to trafficked children over and above the existing safeguarding and support arrangements that are in place at a local level. The Government believe that this responsibility should remain with the local authorities who have a statutory duty to ensure that they safeguard and promote the welfare of all children under Section 11 of the Children Act 2004, regardless of their immigration status or nationality. This conclusion was recognised and accepted by the Home Affairs Select Committee in its report in May 2009.</p>

The council also previously wrote to Home Office Ministers on three occasions since <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-20">20 December 2007</phrase> about the regulation of vehicle immobilisation business, including a response to our public consultation published in April 2009 on how best to regulate vehicle immobilisation (VI) businesses operating on private land.</p>
	<p pid="a.124W.8/2">Our proposals for the regulation of vehicle immobilisation business as set out in the Crime and Security Bill will make it mandatory for all wheel clamping businesses working on private land, as well as their employees, to be licensed by the SIA under the terms of a code of practice. The conditions of the code will include a cap on fines, time limits on towing cars unreasonably quickly after being clamped and clear instructions for putting up signs warning drivers that clamping takes place. In addition, the proposals include the setting up of an independent appeals process to enable motorists to appeal where they consider that the terms of the code have been breached.</p>
	<p pid="a.124W.8/3">The conditions of the code will have statutory force, and will be set out in regulations before the code is published. Failure to comply with the code, or operating without a business licence, will be a criminal offence and could result in prosecution.</p>

	<p pid="a.132W.5/1">The Home Office does not collect individual crime reports. However, the Home Office is committed to increasing the reporting and conviction rates for rape and sexual violence, and works closely with the police and other stakeholders to ensure that women who have been victims of sexual violence come forward and, when they do, these crimes are investigated fully. As part of our drive to tackle sexual violence and ensure that victims are well supported we have been increasing the number of Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) and continuing to support Independent Sexual Violence Advisors (ISVAs) to aid police investigations and to provide good quality support to victims. In 2010-11 the Home Office will be spending approximately &#163;2 million to supplement local funding for SARCs and ISVAs, bringing the total investment over the past six years to &#163;14 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.132W.5/2">The Home Office also recently funded the launch of the Female Voice in Violence report by Race on the Agenda (ROTA), which examined the involvement of girls and young women in gangs. While the vast majority of victims and perpetrators of gang violence are men, there is a distinct and serious issue of young women's involvement with gangs as the ROTA report highlights. In recognition of the importance of this issue, the Home Office has already provided funding for a number of intelligence gathering and good practice events and are now looking at how the experience, knowledge and resources highlighted can be shared and developed.</p>

	<p pid="a.136W.2/1">The theft of livestock is a crime and is covered under the Theft Act 1968. The thrust of the Government's Crime Strategy makes local agencies accountable and responsive to the needs and priorities of the local community. Where livestock theft emerges as a pressing local issue there is a local framework in place for local police forces and community safety partnerships to allocate and devote appropriate resources to tackling this crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.2/2">The Government also supports schemes such as Farm Watch and Countryside Watch, which are now operating across England and Wales, allowing farmers and those living in rural communities to share practical advice on crime prevention in order to look after their vehicles, property, families and animals.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.2/3">A practical guide has also been produced by the National Policing Improvement Agency specifically for those facing the challenges of policing rural areas, titled Neighbourhood Policing in Rural Communities (2008). This offers advice on a range of issues specific to rural areas. The introduction of neighbourhood policing is transforming policing at a local level, so as to build a more responsive, locally accountable and citizen-focused police service to make communities safer and make them feel safer.</p>

	<p pid="a.136W.15/1">Government recognise that significant numbers of consumers are struggling with their finances. We believe that it is crucial that when people are in difficulty with debt they seek help as soon as possible. That is why Government have invested significantly in making expert financial advice freely available. We have supported a number of measures such as the FSA's Money Made Clear website and BIS's face to face debt advice project to help consumers keep control of their finances and manage their debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.15/2">While we want to see fewer people taking on unsustainable amounts of debt, we recognise that even for people on low incomes access to credit can be vital, allowing them to respond to unexpected events or crisis. We are concerned that many consumers are unable to obtain credit from mainstream sources, leaving them with few options other than to seek credit from high cost lenders. Government are committed to providing a safety net for people in need who are struggling to find affordable credit. We have provided increased funds to community-based lenders such as credit unions to provide affordable loans and increased funding for the Social Fund which provides interest free loans to consumers at times of pressure or crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.136W.15/3">We are keen to expand on our evidence base in this area and welcome the review that the Office of Fair Trading is currently conducting into the high cost credit sector. Their report is due out shortly and we will not hesitate to act if the review finds that further action is necessary to protect consumers.</p>

	<p pid="a.137W.2/1">Government acknowledge that there are concerns regarding the home credit market. The Competition Commission investigated the home credit market in 2006 and as a result required providers in the sector to adopt remedies to address the problems it identified, such as lenders being required to share data on customers payment records, being required to publish their prices on a website where customers can compare the prices of loans and lenders giving a fair rebate to customers who repay their loans early. We are also putting in place a number of further measures to give consumers a more informed choice and to encourage responsible lending, including bringing in new requirements this year for lenders to provide adequate explanations to borrowers and to assess their creditworthiness. Any further changes in this area will need careful consideration and we are seeking to expand on our evidence base before determining whether existing remedies are working or if further action is needed. The OFT is reviewing the high cost credit market and is due to publish its findings and recommendations shortly. Government have pledged to respond quickly to the review.</p>

	<p pid="a.140W.2/1">We have been taking a joined-up approach across Government to ensure that all young adults have the skills they need to obtain a meaningful job with prospects.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.2/2">In July 2009 we launched Backing Young Britain, a national campaign bringing together businesses, the public sector and third sector organisations to provide a package of support for young people aged 18-24 through and leading out of the recession. The campaign asks organisations to commit to one of three overall aims:</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.2/3" class="indent">Offering an Apprenticeship</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.2/4" class="indent">Taking up DWP help to employ a young person</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.2/5" class="indent">Providing a young person with experience of work</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.2/6">To date, the campaign has been endorsed by 465 organisations from across the private, public and third sectors. Through these opportunities young people can access thousands of work-focused training places, such as internships or Apprenticeships, as well as additional access to advice through mentoring links and Jobcentre Plus adviser time, and jobs through Routes into Work and the Future Jobs Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.2/7">We are creating at least 120,000 new jobs for young people through the Future Jobs Fund - the first six rounds of bidding will create up to 104,000 jobs. We have brought forward the Young Person's Guarantee so that all 18-24 year-olds still unemployed after six months will be guaranteed access to a job, work-focussed training in FE, work experience or a place on a Community Task Force.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.2/8">We have created the Graduate Talent Pool which has offered over 12,000 vacancies for graduate internships since the launch at the end of July. By March 2010, 20,000 graduate internships overall will have been created in the private, public and third sectors to help young people develop the skills they need to build their employability. For those new graduates who can't find work the Graduate Guarantee ensures that those still unemployed at six months will have access to an internship, training or help to become self employed.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.2/9">Through the September Guarantee, we offer every 16 and 17 year-old a suitable place in learning. We are building on this with a January Guarantee in 2010, which will offer all 16 and 17 year-olds who are not in education, employment or training this month a place in Entry to Employment provision. We will invest a total of &#163;8.2 billion in 2010-11 to fund learning for 1.6 million young people, and we will increase 16-19 funding by 0.9 per cent. in real terms in 2011-12 and 2012-13 to continue our commitment to the September Guarantee.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.2/10">We have rescued and expanded Apprenticeships over the last 10 years. We are committing &#163;140 million to provide 35,000 extra Apprenticeship places in 2009-10 and are providing employer subsidies to create 5,000 new Apprenticeships for 16 and 17 year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.2/11">In 2010-11 we will switch significant resources from Train to Gain to create a further 35,000 Advanced Apprenticeship places for 19 to 30 year-olds. Boosting the number of Advanced Apprenticeships is critical to our plans for building the skills of young adults and promoting the overall economic health of the nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.2/12">We are also widening participation in higher education, to ensure that all those with the potential and merit to benefit from HE are able and willing to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.140W.2/13">In December 2009 DCSF, DWP and BIS published Investing in Potential, which sets out current support and our long-term strategy to increase the proportion of 16-24 year-olds in education, employment or training:</p>

	<p pid="a.148W.0/1">Baseline changes are tightly managed at the centre of government and are permitted for two reasons:</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.0/2" class="indent">1. A baseline adjustment-relating to changes to the estate. A baseline adjustment is permitted in instances when an organisation takes on or relinquishes specific functions or responsibilities (for example takes responsibility for an additional Executive agency).</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.0/3" class="indent">2. A baseline correction-relating to changes to the data. A baseline correction can be made where baseline data previously supplied is incorrect or incomplete. In Instances where additional or more accurate data for the baseline year comes to light the original baseline data can be revised.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.0/4">The Home Office (HO) Carbon from Offices baseline was amended in 2008-09 to account for machinery of government changes. These involved the transfer of the Southport building from the Office for National Statistics, and the export of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) non-custodial buildings to the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). The NOMS transfer was deferred from 2007-08 to enable the proper separation of baseline data. In reviewing the baseline to facilitate the separation, Home Office identified better quality data for its own core department. This improvement also formed part of the amendment in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.0/5">The Ministry of Justice Carbon from Offices baseline was amended in 2008-09 to account for the transfer of the NOMS non-custodial buildings from Home Office, and in response to reviews of energy consumption data held by HM Courts Service and the National Archives, which resulted in the availability of better quality baseline data for both organisations. Subsequently, the MOJ baseline was corrected to exclude the NOMS non-custodial element, as during the 2008-09 reporting phase it became clear that NOMS could not report a full consumption data across the Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate target areas. MOJ aims to ensure NOMS reports fully in 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="a.156W.2/1">The annual rate of CPI inflation rose in January, partly due to the pre-announced reversal of the cut in the VAT rate back to 17.5 per cent. The 2009 pre-Budget report forecast assumes that businesses will smooth the pass-through of the reversal of the VAT rate cut, with inflation peaking in early 2010. It is assumed that households will have brought forward some consumption from 2010 to 2009 as a result of the lower relative prices associated with the reversion of the temporary cut in the standard rate of VAT. Consumer spending is forecast to grow over 2010 as a whole. The Government will set out their latest assessment of economic prospects at Budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.156W.2/2">The Government receive a wide range of representations on tax and other issues: which they seek to take account of in formulating economic policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.156W.2/3">As was the case with previous Administrations, it is not the Government's practice to provide details of such representations.</p>
