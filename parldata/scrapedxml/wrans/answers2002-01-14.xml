	<p pid=".1W.8/53"><sup>(2)</sup> The non-UK members of the tribunal are paid daily allowances of &pound;50 (net) while in Londonderry and &pound;75 (net) while in London. In addition these members are paid an allowance of &pound;500 (net) for every month in which they spend at least a fortnight in the UK. Lord Saville is paid the daily Londonderry allowance, but neither of the other allowances. As at <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-04">4 December 2001</phrase> he had been paid a total of &pound;7,400 in respect of this allowance. In addition the reasonable expenses incurred by members on tribunal business, and for travel to and from their home countries for the non-UK members, are met by the inquiry: the sums are included at item 11 in the table.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.8/54"><sup>(3)</sup> Eversheds are the solicitors contracted by the inquiry to take witness statements. They have also provided professional support to inquiry counsel and solicitors.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.8/55"><sup>(4)</sup> The experts concerned are in the fields of pathology, ballistics and explosives, sound, and history. The expenditure shown also includes that on the Peer Review Panel which has overseen the work of the pathology, ballistics, and sound experts.</p>

	<p pid=".1W.8/58">1. The table displays the expenditure position as at <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-04">4 December 2001</phrase>. The late submission of some bills means that the figures shown for certain expenditure components, notably four, do not fully reflect the scale on which expenditure had been incurred by December 2001. In addition, a prospective Judicial Review could affect the position at four, and a prospective judgment of the Senior Costs Judge the position at six.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.8/59">2. The expenditure figures include VAT where that is paid.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.8/60">3. The Ministry of Defence meets nearly all the costs of the four legal teams which between them represent most of the soldiers.</p>

	<p pid=".4W.9/1">We fully support the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent (PIC), and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) which create a framework and promote political will to tackle the problems that poor management and hazardous use of pesticides pose to health, the environment and livelihoods in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.9/2">DFID also supports the revised Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO)'s International Code of Conduct on the Distribution of Use of Pesticides, which provides a widely accepted framework of good practice relating to pesticide management. DFID complies with the OECD Development Assistance Committee (OECD DAC)'s Guidelines for Aid Agencies on Pest and Pesticide Management.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.9/3">DFID does not supply pesticides to developing countries through its programmes (except in emergency conditions such as locust plagues) or support pesticide subsidies. DFID promotes the use of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which was recognised in UNCED Agenda 21 as the preferred approach to crop protection for development programmes. IPM provides a means to promote crop protection strategies with minimal external inputs, and maximum consideration for the sustainability and better understanding of production systems, integrity of the environment, and safety of the producer and consumer. By reducing the need for pesticide applications through the use of pest-resistant crop varieties, natural enemies and cultivation techniques, IPM has increased the sustainability of farming and ecological systems at minimal cost and reduced health risks to farmers.</p>
	<p pid=".4W.9/4">More information is available in a key-sheet for sustainable livelihoods on IPM (co-funded by DFID) from DFID or at the website address: <a href="http://www.odi.org.uk/keysheets/ipm/pdf">http://www.odi.org.uk/ keysheets/ipm/pdf</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".5W.8/2">A mechanism for international disaster response exists under the coordination of the United Nations. My Department's priority is to improve and strengthen this mechanism, which involves the affected nations, the United Nations and Red Cross systems, non-governmental organisations and donor Governments.</p>
	<p pid=".5W.8/3">While our ultimate aim is to build a better international humanitarian system, there is a role for donor Governments such as the UK to fill gaps in rapid direct response. The UK already has a capacity to respond to humanitarian emergencies around the clock which is as respected as the Danish and Norwegian services mentioned, under arrangements existing within my Department.</p>
	<p pid=".5W.8/4">We are able to field well-equipped teams of experts with a broad range of skills and also maintain stockpiles of relief items. As and when we need to complement our own existing specialist staff for emergencies we can call upon other organisations under existing arrangements, such as RedR (Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief) and International Health Exchange. With DFID support, these agencies maintain databases of suitably qualified disaster specialists including engineers, logisticians, and qualified medical staff who have been selected and trained beforehand for work in this area. My Department also manages the UK contribution to the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination Team (UNDAC) system under which qualified British experts are made available for overseas service.</p>
	<p pid=".5W.8/5">In addition, DFID has established arrangements with other Government Departments to facilitate rapid disaster response. This includes the Foreign and Commonwealth Office who assist in global surveillance of disasters; the Home Office, with whom we have an arrangement for the deployment of UK Fire Service Search and Rescue personnel; and the Ministry of Defence from whom we can request the deployment of military assets, in support of emergency humanitarian operations.</p>

	<p pid=".6W.2/1">There has been considerable discussion between DFID and the World bank about the proposed export of a BAE air traffic control system to Tanzania.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/2">The World bank is concerned about the system's technical applicability and its value for money. These concerns were discussed with donors and undertakings given by the Government of Tanzania prior to the International Monetary Fund and World bank board meetings in November 2001. The Government of Tanzania undertook to work with the International Civil Aviation Organisation in identifying Tanzania's civil aviation requirements and to explore the modification of the contract with BAE to meet these requirements. On this base the bank and fund boards agreed that Tanzania would reach Completion Point under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries initiative at their November meetings.</p>

	<p pid=".10W.11/1">There is no evidence to suggest that providing access for disabled people has any impact on the overall capacity of trains. There may be some effect on the number of fixed seats but this will depend on the type of rolling stock, on its interior design and on other factors not related to access. However, it is possible to mitigate seat loss, for example, by the use of tip up seats in wheelchair spaces.</p>

In addition, there are provisions in the Homelessness Bill to ensure that each local authority formulates and publishes a homelessness strategy.

Most of these homes have already been provided with the remainder becoming available by late 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".13W.8/1">Separate sets of regulations to control vehicle emissions exist for new vehicles and for vehicles after sale.</p>
	<p pid=".13W.8/2">Statutory regulations specify the standard to which new model types must be constructed before vehicles can enter service. These regulations apply European directives which specify emissions limits and detailed test procedures. The relevant regulations are the Motor Vehicles (EC Type Approval) Regulations 1998, the Motor Vehicles (Type Approval) (Great Britain) Regulations 1984, the Motor Vehicles (Type Approval for Goods Vehicles) Regulations 1982, and the Motor Cycles Etc (EC Type Approval) Regulations 1999, as amended. These are enforced by the Vehicle Certification Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".13W.8/3">The Motor Vehicles (Approval) Regulations 2001 apply similar standards to those of type approval mainly for small numbers of imported cars and light goods vehicles (new or used) that are not type-approved at the manufacturing stage and these are enforced by the Vehicle Inspectorate Executive Agency (V.I.). Other vehicles not subject to type, or single vehicle, approval are regulated under the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 (C&amp;U).</p>
	<p pid=".13W.8/4">When in use vehicles must comply with emissions standards specified in the C&amp;U Regulations. Compliance with C&amp;U is assessed during a vehicle's annual roadworthiness inspection. In the case of heavy vehicles this is carried out by the V.I. and for passenger cars and light vans by privately operated (M.O.T) test centres under the supervision of the V.I. Roadside spot checks are also carried out by the V.I. and by local authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".18W.6/1">In addition to existing programmes, a total of five new programmes were launched by Government in 2001, providing enhanced opportunities for pre-school organisations and focused on increasing funding for the early years and child care sector and raising quality and standards for parents and children. A list is provided for information.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.6/2">The expansion and development of existing early years programmes such as the universal nursery provision for all three and four-year-olds, has also provided a welcome boost to the sector.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.6/3">Also introduced in September 2001 were the National Standards for Under 8s Day Care and Childminding, and the transfer of Regulation of Day Care to Ofsted.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.6/4" class="italic">Initiatives launched 2001:</p>
	<p pid=".18W.6/5">1. The Local Network Fund:</p>
	<p pid=".18W.6/6">This was launched in May 2001 to enable local voluntary and community groups to provide local solutions to child poverty. The fund provides grants up to &pound;7,000 for work with children and young people aged 0&ndash;19. Projects run by voluntary organisations for pre-school children are already benefiting from the fund.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.6/7">2. Universal Nursery Provision for three and four year olds:</p>
	<p pid=".18W.6/8">Funding of &pound;200 million has been made available in 2001&ndash;02 to provide up to 170,000 free part-time early education places for three-year-olds. The majority of these new free places are expected to be in the private, voluntary and independent sectors including pre-schools. To obtain this funding pre-schools must apply to their local education authority.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.6/9">3. Day Care Expansion programme:</p>
	<p pid=".18W.6/10">Supported with &pound;4 million of ESF was introduced in March 2001. The grant is aimed at encouraging and assisting providers in all sectors to make the move to provision of longer care, ideally full day care but certainly not less than four hours. Application for funding would be through EYDCPs.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.6/11">4. Playgroups provide day care/wraparound:</p>
	<p pid=".18W.6/12">An initiative was introduced to aid the conversion, by 2004, of at least 21,000 playgroups places to move to day care/wraparound care provision. The aim of this initiative is to enable playgroup places to be converted from sessional provision to day care, or wraparound care, combining early years education and care. This assists parents by allowing them sufficient time to take up employment, training or educational opportunities. Capital funding of &pound;6 million is being made available from 2002&ndash;03 to aid this conversion programme. This initiative contributes to the Government's strategic aim of creating 1.6 million new child care places by March 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.6/13">5. Neighbourhood Nurseries Initiative (NNI):</p>
	<p pid=".18W.6/14">This is part of the Government's wider Neighbourhood Childcare strategy. The NNI aims to create new child care places in day nurseries, in the most disadvantaged areas of the country. It aims to help reduce child poverty by helping parents take up work and training that will help them into work. It should also improve the life chances of children through access to quality care, early education and support.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.6/15" class="italic">National Standards for Under 8s Day Care and Childminding, and the transfer of Regulation of Day Care to Ofsted:</p>
	<p pid=".18W.6/16">Regulation under OFSTED provides for a single, national policy on the regulation of day care providers and child minders, which will help to ensure consistency of policy and procedures across the whole of England.</p>

	<p pid=".20W.5/1">The Government are committed to creating a learning society in which everyone, of every age and in all circumstances enjoys learning throughout life. Research shows that learning has many benefits for older people in particular, including increased self- confidence, self-esteem and better health and well being, all helping to contribute to an independent and fulfilling lifestyle. We want to encourage more older people to take advantage of the benefits of learning, particularly older people who have not previously engaged in learning or who have been &quot;hard to reach&quot;. So we are working to raise awareness of the value of later life learning via our Learning in Later Life Campaign; encouraging practitioners to share good practice; working with libraries, museums and galleries to help unlock their potential as places of learning; and undertaking research into the learning needs of older people.</p>
	<p pid=".20W.5/2">Accordingly, in his remit letter to the Learning and Skills Council in November 2000, the then Secretary of State emphasised that learning can help to strengthen families; build stronger neighbourhoods; help older people to stay healthy and active, and encourage independence for all by opening up new opportunities. He also highlighted that many adults, including large numbers of older and retired learners, would want to pursue high quality and rigorous study for its own sake, and that he expected provision to be made available to meet their needs. To support this, we have increased funding for adult and community learning&mdash;provision which many older people access&mdash;to &pound;165 million in 2002&ndash;03.</p>

	<p pid=".21W.2/2">The principles and recommendations of the report from the social exclusion unit's policy action team (12) on young people continue to form the agenda of the children and young people's unit and the great majority of my meetings in my role as Minister responsible for young people are concerned with work taking forward its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.2/3">Two recent initiatives are of particular importance: the publication of the Core Principles for the Involvement of Children and Young People, launched on <phrase class="date" code="">2 November</phrase>, and the consultation on the Government's proposed Strategy for Children and Young People, which began on <phrase class="date" code="">21 November</phrase>. The core principles provide a framework that Government Departments have agreed to work to in order to increase the effective involvement of children and young people in the design and provision of policies and services. The strategy sets out a framework for measuring and monitoring real-life outcomes in children and young people's lives&mdash;the consultation will help shape priorities for spending over &pound;40 billion each year on services for children and young people. I have, of course, met Ministers with an interest in children and young people's issues to discuss and agree both documents which are key elements in the implementation of the report's recommendations.</p>

	<p pid=".21W.5/1">Our key aim in legislating through the Education Bill is to remove barriers to innovation and free providers to adopt new approaches to the delivery of education. An important part of this is the creation of a legislative framework that can be adapted more easily to changing circumstances so that we can be more responsive to schools and LEAs delivering services. The Bill does not signal any change in our view of the role of local government. We know that LEAs have an important role to play in school improvement and are committed to working with them.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.5/2">All the measures in the Bill are consistent with our principle of intervention in inverse proportion to success. Where schools and LEAs are delivering good quality services, we will support them to do so. If services should fail the children and young people involved, then intervention will be swift and decisive, so that they receive the quality of education which is their right.</p>
	<p pid=".21W.5/3">It is not, therefore, our intention to change the balance of powers between central and local government through the Education Bill.</p>

The CLS Fund provides for advice and assistance in all areas of employment law as well as representation before the Employment Appeal Tribunal, subject to the standard means and merits tests. It does not however provide for representation before Employment Tribunals. The Lord Chancellor will not make any decisions on extending CLS funding to representation at employment tribunal proceedings until the responses to the consultation on Sir Andrew Leggatt's review of tribunals have been fully analysed.</p>

	<p pid=".43W.2/1">The rules for the adjustment of benefit for periods in hospital prevent double provision from public funds as the NHS provides free board and lodgings as well as free treatment. So the downrating rules are based on the principle that Social Security maintenance benefits, also paid out of state funds, should not be paid in full indefinitely where a person is in a NHS hospital and having their day to day living expenses met through the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.2/2">These rules, which are laid down in law, have been applied with only minor modifications since the introduction of the national insurance scheme over 50 years ago.</p>

	<p pid=".45W.6/2">Over time, the Pension Service will provide customers and staff with a wide range of contact channels through improved, modern technology including telephony, digital television and the adoption of internet technology. Call and contact centres will be open longer than current office hours allowing customers to contact the Pension Service when it is convenient for them. For example we expect our pension centres to be open Monday to Friday from 8 am to 8 pm.</p>
	<p pid=".45W.6/3">The Pension Service will provide a better environment for our face to face services. This will mean Pension Service staff will meet customers in places they frequent such as the local library, age concern or health centres.</p>

	<p pid=".48W.5/1">The primary responsibility for the clearance of land mines in Kosovo is that of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Within Kosovo, UNMIK works with non-governmental organisations, national military contingents and the indigenous Kosovo protection corps. British forces are not employed directly in land mine clearance, although KFOR troops continue to provide assistance to the UN when requested, to make areas safe for the return of displaced persons. The Government contribute through the provision of grants, specialist staff and equipment to the UN Mine Action Co-ordination Centre. The UN task is now regarded as largely complete, although there are still two areas west of Prizren, towards the border with Albania, that contain known minefields, where work will continue through 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".50W.5/1">The armed forces have done much in recent years to promote racial equality and create an environment free from harassment and unlawful discrimination. This includes establishing confidential advice and support help lines; a network of equal opportunities advisers; equality training, focus groups and surveys; monitoring and evaluating ethnic minority recruitment, progression and retention; and a vigorous recruiting and outreach programme to encourage more ethnic minorities to join the armed forces.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Defence informed the House on <phrase class="date" code="">4 October</phrase> that the Ministry of Defence would be conducting work designed to ensure that we have the right concepts, forces and capabilities to deal with the kind of asymmetric threat that we saw on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".50W.8/2">This work is on-going and is addressing, among a wide range of issues, the balance between the contributions that the armed forces make to home defence and countering threats abroad. A key part of this work is exploring the role that the armed forces, including the reserves, have in defending and protecting the United Kingdom. But it should be recognised that the lead for domestic security lies with the civil authorities, and with the police in particular. The armed forces, of course, already provide assistance to the civil authorities in a range of ways.</p>
	<p pid=".50W.8/3">We will need to examine fully the overall priorities for tackling terrorism through military and other means including intelligence, diplomacy, humanitarian and aid policies and domestic responses to the threat. Funding issues will be addressed during the spending review, which will conclude in the summer.</p>

	<p pid=".52W.11/1">The service families taskforce was set up in 1999 by the Government to deal with service family issues that were outside the control of the Ministry of Defence. It is headed by a ministerial group which last met on <phrase class="date" code="">15 November</phrase> last year. I also meet with representatives of service families twice a year to discuss areas of concern. The service families taskforce has been involved in a wide range of issues since its conception. The main areas of progress over the last year are:</p>
	<p pid=".52W.11/2" class="indent">(a) The MOD is being consulted by the Department of Health in the drafting of new adoption legislation to ensure that service families will not be disadvantaged.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.11/3" class="indent">(b) We have resolved the problems that some service families had encountered, as a result of the payment of local overseas allowance, in claiming working families tax credit on return to the UK from an overseas posting.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.11/4" class="indent">(c) We have resolved the problems that some service spouses had encountered, due to the interpretation of residency status, in claiming Child Support Agency payments when on an overseas posting.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.11/5" class="indent">(d) Discussions are taking place with the Department for Education and Skills, and with local education authorities, to see what measures can be taken to improve the schools admissions process for service families.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.11/6" class="indent">(e) Discussions are taking place with the NHS waiting and booking team on the problems service families face when transferring between NHS trust areas.</p>
	<p pid=".52W.11/7" class="indent">(f) Discussions are taking place with the Department for Work and Pensions to identify any problems service families have faced in the claiming of benefits while on overseas postings.</p>

Reservists have been supporting the operation on other forms of service. We are immensely grateful to all of them. As a further measure to support the current level of operations, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has authorised the compulsory call-out of up to 140 specialist Territorial Army personnel to provide intelligence support to headquarters organisations in the UK and to the UK forces deployed in Afghanistan. This action is fully in accordance with our stated intention as part of the Strategic Defence Review to make our reserve forces more usable, integrated and relevant. We believe that the compulsory call-out will be welcomed by the personnel involved and their employers.</p>

	<p pid=".54W.0/1">Aircrews deployed to the region on Operation Veritas are accommodated in two types of air-conditioned tent. On exercises, the normal occupancy of the first type of tent is up to 24 aircrew, on Operation Veritas the number is under 20. The second type of tent, which is slightly smaller, can accommodate up to 14 aircrew on exercises but on Operation Veritas the occupancy is 10 or lower. During unit handovers numbers have been exceeded for short periods.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.0/2">Non-aircrew are mainly accommodated in the smaller tents without air conditioning. Where possible non- aircrew on night duty, who need to sleep in the heat of the day, are accommodated in the large air-conditioned tents.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.0/3">The length of aircrews' shifts varies according to the type of aircraft and sortie flown. The length of time between shifts can also vary but is not usually less than 10 hours. Aircrew on different shifts may be accommodated in the same tent but silence is enforced around tents when personnel are asleep. Deployed personnel are not accommodated in hotels except for those who have been in theatre for over four months and are entitled to a period of publicly funded rest and recuperation.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.0/4">It is recognised that the living conditions for many of our personnel deployed to the middle east on Operation Veritas are challenging but they are in accordance with operational standards for accommodation. UK forces have successfully risen to this challenge and made a major contribution to the Coalition effort over Afghanistan. However, plans are in place to upgrade the living conditions of all RAF personnel on Operation Veritas by March.</p>

	<p pid=".58W.2/1">The F680 process is an informal process under which companies can obtain advice on the prospects for approval of exports at the marketing stage. The F680 also gives formal clearance for release of classified information, where required, for marketing purposes. The number of clearances for each of the years for which data are held, is as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".58W.2/4"> <th><i>Year</i></th> <th><i>F680s cleared</i></th> </tr>

	<p pid=".58W.2/12">It is not possible to correlate data about F680 clearances with data relating to the export licensing process since the processes are quite separate. For example, F680s may be seeking advice in general terms about marketing prospects which may relate partially to the export that is eventually licensed. It is routinely made clear to exporters that advice in response to F680 applications does not prejudge a decision on the eventual consideration of an export licence application.</p>

	<p pid=".59W.2/1">In the event of various circumstances of insolvency or bankruptcy such as the appointment of an administrative receiver, or a receiver, or a company being wound up, the Ministry of Defence has the right to terminate the contract without recompense to the contractor. This is achieved by the terms of DEFCON 515 (Bankruptcy and Insolvency) which is included in all MOD headquarters contracts. The most effective means of dealing with this issue is to have a system that reduces the risk of placing contracts with suppliers of limited financial capability. The MOD employs such a system, but that risk cannot be entirely eliminated.</p>

	<p pid=".64W.3/1">Lou Gehrig's disease is classified as motor neurone disease (MND) in this country and there are between 5,000 and 6,000 sufferers of MND in the United Kingdom. Worldwide, the annual incidence of MND is estimated to be 1.5 new cases per 100,000 people. To date, the Ministry of Defence is aware of five veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict who have been diagnosed with motor neurone disease, one of whom died in 1992. The table shows the hospital admission figures for motor neurone disease in 2000&ndash;01.</p>

	<p pid=".69W.2/1">The Food Safety (General Food Hygiene) (Butchers' Shops) Amendment Regulations 2000 (SI 2000 No. 930) were introduced in England in response to the recommendation in the Pennington report for the licensing of retail butchers' shops. These regulations, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-01">1 May 2000</phrase>, require retail butchers and other retail outlets selling both unwrapped raw meat and ready to eat food to obtain an annual licence from their local food authority. Businesses must satisfy certain hygiene conditions before a licence can be issued, including compliance with existing food hygiene legislation, the operation of effective food safety management controls based on the principles of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system (HACCP) and appropriate food hygiene training for food handling and supervisory staff. Similarly oriented legislation has also been put in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".69W.2/2">We have also made &pound;4.5 million available to fund a free training and support initiative to help retail butchers in England introduce effective HACCP food safety management controls in their shops prior to the introduction of the licensing regulations. Approximately 7,500 butchers in England received help through this initiative which ran from 1998 to 2000. Funding was also made available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to assist butchers in implementing the new requirements over a similar time period.</p>

He decided that the previous format which included detailed accounts of the Government's policies in relation to health and health care were now well covered in other publications and Government websites. With this is mind he decided to focus the report on a number of specific topics of importance to the public health. He began working personally on this new report in the spring of 2001 and it was published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-10">10 December 2001</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".71W.2/3">In the NHS Plan, we made a commitment to reduce under-nutrition by developing a hospital nutrition policy to improve the outcome of care of patients by 2004. A number of strategies are in place to manage, monitor and screen patients for under-nutrition in hospitals, residential care and the wider community. Nutritional screening is recommended for the care of specific groups, such as those outlined in the &quot;National Service Framework for Older People&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".76W.8/2">Patient surveys identify ready access to primary care as a key issue and the NHS Plan sets targets that by 2004 all patients will be able to see a primary care professional within 24 hours and a general practitioner within 48 hours. Health authorities and primary care trusts have been working with GPs and others to secure delivery of these targets. In doing so they are supported by the work of the National Primary Care Development Team and by resources from the PCT primary care access fund. In-year monitoring indicates that the interim milestone for April 2002 of 60 per cent. compliance will be achieved. Further progress towards these targets will be supported in 2002&ndash;03 by an earmarked increase of &pound;83.5 million in the PCT primary care access fund to &pound;168 million.</p>

	<p pid=".88W.10/1">I represented the United Kingdom at the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Brussels on 6 and <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-07">7 December 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/2" class="italic">A points:</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/3">The A points were approved as in document 14899/01 (a copy of which has been placed in the Library).</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/4" class="italic">Framework Decision on a European Arrest Warrant:</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/5">Fourteen member states and the Commission could agree to a revised Presidency compromise package, the principal elements of which were a three-year penalty threshold for the offences on the existing list of crimes for which dual criminality would be abolished, a time- limited opt out for one member state in relation to extradition of own nationals and a territoriality clause allowing a member state to refuse extradition where the offence was committed on its own territory. A council statement would broadly define the offences of racism and xenophobia, swindling, sabotage, racketeering and extortion. One member state was unable to accept the final compromise package and argued that the warrant should apply only to cases of terrorism and the most serious crimes on the list. <i>Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism:</i></p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/6">Agreement was reached subject to parliamentary scrutiny reserves from three member states.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/7" class="italic">Council Decision Establishing Eurojust:</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/8">The Council decision establishing Eurojust was agreed subject to parliamentary scrutiny reserves from four member states. National members were to be appointed within two months of the publication of the Council decision in the Official Journal.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/9" class="italic">Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornography:</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/10">Fourteen member states could agree to the definitions of offences of children and child pornography contained in the framework decision; one member state disagreed, arguing that the exemptions from criminal liability for offences in relation in return to virtual pornography should be deleted. With the support of several other member states, I said the United Kingdom would wish to make a declaration stating that the United Kingdom would continue to take tough action against both real and virtual pornographic images of children.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/11" class="italic">Harmonisation of Penalties:</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/12">There was general agreement to pursue the Presidency's proposal for the future approximation of criminal law penalties. This would comprise a range of penalties defined by the periods of maximum imprisonment for each category of offence. Level one would require penalties which would permit extradition, level two would require a penalty attracting not less than a maximum period of one to five years' imprisonment, level three would attract five to 10 years' and level four would be 10 years' imprisonment and above.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/13" class="italic">Parental Responsibility:</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/14">Discussion of this item was postponed.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/15" class="italic">The Fight Against Terrorism:</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/16">The Director of Europol reported on increased counter-terrorist activity at Europol since <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase>. He noted member states' increased willingness to share information with Europol.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/17" class="italic">Terrorism Roadmap:</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/18">The Presidency reported that important progress had been made in the follow-up to the action agreed at the JHA Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-20">20 September</phrase>. One member state proposed a number of additional measures for inclusion in the roadmap; these would be discussed further in the appropriate working group.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/19" class="italic">Asylum Procedures Directive: Draft Council Conclusions:</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/20">The council held a debate on the Presidency text, which focused on appeal rights. I argued for swift agreement on the package of asylum directives currently under negotiation and added that asylum procedures should be rapid and fair but should not allow multiple opportunities for appeal. The Presidency noted a broad consensus on the way forward, and agreed to amend its text in the light of member states' comments.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/21" class="italic">European Management Concept on Border control:</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/22">There was broad support for a Presidency proposal to strengthen the EU's external frontier and for an ongoing feasibility study for a European Border Guard. Several delegations saw no need for a supranational force but there was consensus on improved training and co-operation. The Commission said that it would be issuing a communication on external frontiers early in 2002. <i>Provisions for Applying Eurodac:</i></p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/23">One member state still had difficulties with the technical specifications in the draft implementing rules. The Presidency urged a swift resolution to this problem.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/24" class="italic">Common Visa List (CVL)&mdash;Romania:</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/25">The council regulation placing Romania on the CVL exempt list from <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-01">1 January 2002</phrase> was agreed, with a declaration on continued monitoring of all the candidate countries.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/26" class="italic">Address by United States (US) Secretary of State:</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/27">The council was addressed by Colin Powell, US Secretary of State. He praised the EU's solidarity with the US since <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase> and welcomed the progress made on law enforcement co-operation. He urged a swift resolution to the issue of exchange of data for law enforcement purposes. The US/Europol agreement was signed. The Presidency and the Commission summarised EU achievements on counter-terrorism since <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase> and welcomed the enhanced co-operation with the US.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/28" class="italic">Mixed Committee with Iceland and Norway</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/29" class="italic">SIS 11&mdash;new functions:</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/30">Iceland, chairing the Mixed Committee session at Ministerial level, introduced the Presidency's paper on future Schengen Information System (SIS) requirements and noted that the council's discussion would serve as political guidance for the development of SIS 11. The Commission emphasised the importance of early agreement, as any new features would need to be included in its feasibility study, to be launched in February 2002. There was general agreement to the principle of using SIS data for a wider range of purposes and to a study on the possibility of exchanging information on persons precluded from leaving the Schengen area.</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/31" class="italic">Other Visa and Consular Issues:</p>
	<p pid=".88W.10/32">There was agreement in principle to the draft regulations on a uniform visa format and form for affixing vias, subject to necessary procedures being completed in the European and national Parliaments. The council decision on Schengen visa fees also received general endorsement. The Presidency introduced its report on improving local consular co-operation, through measures such as a shared database of visa applications and joint visa offices.</p>

	<p pid=".93W.5/2">Staff turnover at Ashfield prison and young offender institution has been similar to that experienced at Premier Custodial Group's other contracts at the same stage of development and is broadly in line with their expectations. The contractor has found that as contracts move out of the start-up and initial development phase, turnover reduces. It is expected Ashfield will follow a similar pattern.</p>
	<p pid=".93W.5/3">As at <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-10">10 January 2002</phrase>, there were 31 vacancies at Ashfield, of which 17 were for prisoner custody officers (PCOs). On <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-18">18 January 2002</phrase>, 20 PCOs will have completed their training and take up post. Interviews are in hand to recruit the remainder.</p>

	<p pid=".96W.2/1">By the end of January immigration detainees held in local prisons will, if their detention is to continue, be transferred to immigration removal centres. This has been made possible by the opening of three new removal centres at Harmondsworth, near Heathrow, Dungavel in Lanarkshire, and at Yarlswood in Bedfordshire.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.2/2">Additionally immigration detainees are held in two dedicated prison establishments: a unit in Her Majesty's Prison Lindholme, near Doncaster; and Her Majesty's Prison Haslar. I am taking steps to establish these as immigration removal centres under the control of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate of the Home Office as from February. Detainees in these establishments will be subject to Detention Centre Rules, rather than the Prison Rules as at present. It may take some time before the facilities in the new centres match those of other removal centres, but that is our intention.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.2/3">Asylum seekers are also detained in two wings of Her Majesty's Prison Rochester. These detainees will be transferred to other immigration removal centres by the end of January. A new removal centre will be established at Her Majesty's Prison Dover in the spring.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.2/4">It will always remain necessary to hold small numbers of immigration detainees including asylum seekers in prisons for reasons of security, or who are awaiting deportation on conclusion of a prison sentence. Any asylum seeker who is held on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence, or is serving a custodial sentence will also be held in prison.</p>

Civil servants are encouraged, in the first instance, to raise complaints made under paragraph 11 of the Civil Service Code with their line manager. If for any reason this is not felt to be possible, perhaps because the line manager is part of the complaint, individuals may take their complaint to a nominated official (or officials). It is not possible to provide a comprehensive figure for the number of complaints made within this Department under paragraph 11 of the Code as there is no requirement for managers to report to the centre details of complaints made under the Civil Service Code which are resolved within the management lint.</p>

Proposals covered a wide range of ideas including for example: a virtual law centre; projects to work with health care professionals to bring legal advice to hard to reach groups such as people with mental health difficulties, young and older people, the vulnerable and those less mobile; and a scheme for increasing the availability of trained lawyers in shortage categories of social welfare law.</p>

	<p pid=".105W.3/2">The Eaga Partnership Ltd. and TXU Warm Front Ltd. manage the home energy efficiency scheme, marketed as the warm front team, under contract. The table shows the modal, median and mean cost for HEES and HEES Plus in the period from June 2000 to November 2001. The data are shown in terms of grouped regions as it is not possible to provide individual region areas without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.3/3">The difference between the average grant paid under HEES and the grant maximum is due to the nature of the scheme. The package of measures provided is tailored to the requirements of each property. For example if a home already has a central heating system then a package of insulation measures is provided. This approach ensures that the scheme provides the greatest assistance to those householders most in need, and less to those whose homes are already energy efficient.</p>

	<p pid=".106W.5/2">Work in private sector landlords' properties is undertaken only once a no rent rise agreement is in place. This requirement was introduced following consultation on the proposed scheme in 1999.

Agreements are time-limited to either one year for insulation measures only or two years where heating measures are installed.</p>

	<p pid=".106W.5/4">In the same period, 8,300 tenants had their applications turned down by the landlord. The precise reasons in each case are not known, but we are now investigating these.</p>

The Department has recently announced a payment of &pound;6 million to local authorities to cover their costs until March 2002. We are also urgently considering what action needs to be taken to encourage the reinstatement of take-back schemes previously operating, which would reduce the burden on local authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".112W.2/2">Waste disposal sites operate under the terms of waste management licences and are subject to the controls set out in Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. The purpose of licences is to ensure that waste is disposed of in ways which protect the environment and human health. Failure to comply with a licence condition, or the disposal of waste in a manner likely to cause environmental pollution or harm to human health is a criminal offence.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.2/3">I understand that the original licence for the South Ockendon landfill site, issued by Essex county council in 1984 allowed consignments of mixed fly ash and bottom ash from the Edmonton municipal waste incinerator to be consigned to the South Ockendon site. The county council deemed the ash to be suitable for such disposal. These licences were completed in 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.2/4">The Environment Agency, which assumed responsibility for waste management licensing in 1996, advises that the deposit of this mixed ash at the site, in compliance with the licence at that time, ceased in December 1997 as a result of the new licence. The area of the site where ash was deposited takes no further waste and is now capped, and the agency considers that the mixed ash does not represent a significant risk to the environment.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.2/5">The Environment Agency has a legal duty to inspect all licensed sites and section 42 of the 1990 Act requires the agency to take the steps needed to ensure that (a) the activities authorised by a licence do not cause environmental pollution, harm to human health or serious detriment to local amenities; and (b) the conditions of a licence are complied with. With these requirements in mind, I have now asked the Environment Agency to apply these requirements to deposits of mixed ash deposited at Ockendon prior to 1996.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.2/6">The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has examined its records relating to the South Ockendon site for the last 20 years. These do not show any relevant information relating to the impact and likelihood of ash deposited at the site escaping airborne.</p>

	<p pid=".113W.5/2">The Access to the Countryside (Maps in Draft Form) (England) Regulations 2001 require the Countryside Agency to send reduced scale maps (derived from the draft map) to prescribed consultees (including land manager and user representative organisations, as well as local and National Park authorities and parish councils), and to deposit maps with local authorities and certain libraries for public inspection. Maps must also be displayed on the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.5/3">The regulations do not require notification of individual land managers: much land in rural areas remains unregistered, and there is no complete list of people with an interest in the land. In particular, while the owners of most farm holdings are known to DEFRA, the ownership of&mdash;let alone other interests in&mdash;uncultivated open country and common land is often doubtful or unknown. However, the agency has written to those on the agricultural holdings database in the affected areas with information about the consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.5/4">The agency's extensive programme of publicity for draft maps, underwritten by the requirements in the regulations for public notices, internet mapping, and consultation with representative organisations, will ensure that the overwhelming majority of land managers will be made aware of their opportunity to comment on the maps, while addressing all those interested in the maps impartially.</p>

	<p pid=".116W.2/1">The Tees Barrage, which became operational in 1996, protects the river Tees from pollution discharged to the estuary and the river upstream of the barrage is now generally of good or very good quality. In 2001, 1,260 salmon and sea trout were counted in the fish trap at the Tees Barrage compared with 241 sea trout and salmon five years earlier. However, numbers of fish trapped in the barrage fish trap represent only a fraction of those running through the estuary and it is estimated that up to 20,000 salmon and sea trout migrated through the Tees during 2001. There is now also a healthy colony of breeding seals at Teesmouth.</p>
	<p pid=".116W.2/2">The Environment Agency, working with industry, Northumbrian Water, local authorities and English Nature has also overseen dramatic improvements in water quality in the Tees estuary. In 2000, Northumbrian Water completed and commissioned the Bran Sands Treatment Complex at a cost of &pound;270 million. Domestic sewage and industrial effluents are now biologically treated to a very high standard before being discharged to the estuary.</p>
	<p pid=".116W.2/3">Whereas 10 years ago there was no oxygen present in the estuary during the warm summer months, the main estuary is now classed as good or fair quality.</p>
	<p pid=".116W.2/4">Biological oxygen demand (BOD) which measures the amount of oxygen consumed in water, usually by organic pollution, has been reduced from a daily load of 150 tonnes in 1990 to 35 tonnes in 2000. The daily load of ammonia, which is toxic to fish, has been reduced from 59 tonnes in 1990 to 14 tonnes in 2000. Inputs of other toxins such as organic chemicals and metals have also been reduced as a result of improved processes and treatment systems, better environmental management, recycling and reuse. Two major ammonia reduction investments in 2001 should bring environmental benefits in 2002. Programmes to further reduce ammonia and biological oxygen demand are programmed for 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".117W.5/2">Export refunds for dairy products may be set to compensate for the difference between world and EU prices. When this gap narrows, as was the case earlier last year, the refunds are reduced. When it widens, as is the case at present, the refunds may be increased. But in setting export refunds for dairy products the Commission and the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products are required to consider a number of factors. These include the objectives of the Common Organisation of the Market, the supply of dairy products on EU markets (required, for example, for food manufacture), as well as the difference between world and EU prices. In the last quarter of 2001 weak world markets made it difficult for EU traders to export, including the Northern Irish dairy sector which relies particularly heavily on exports of milk powders. The UK therefore supported proposals for higher export refunds for these products which were agreed in November and December 2001. The market situation is being kept under review.</p>

	<p pid=".119W.2/1">Operational responsibility for flood management measures rests with the local operating authorities, normally the Environment Agency (EA) and local councils, who decide which projects to promote and their timing.</p>
	<p pid=".119W.2/2">I understand that the EA's model for the Tidal River Severn downstream of Gloucester has been completed recently. It will be used to develop the Tidal Severn Strategy which the EA plan to publish in summer 2003. The Fluvial River Severn model is being used to develop the Fluvial Severn Strategy which the EA plan to publish in spring 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".120W.2/1">In respect of biosecurity precautions necessary to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease, factsheets have been sent to all livestock farmers and advice was also placed on the DEFRA website <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/">http://www.defra.gov.uk/</a>. The importance of good biosecurity was emphasised by the production of a video on biosecurity in July. This was also sent to all livestock farmers and could also be seen on the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.2/2">Similar guidance was issued to livestock farmers in Scotland by the Scottish Executive. Parallel arrangements consistent with the epidemiology were also made in Northern Ireland by the local executive.</p>
