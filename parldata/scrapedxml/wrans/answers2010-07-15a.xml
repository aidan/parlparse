	<p pid="a.818W.3/1">Counselling, advice and support services are an important area, and such support can be valuable to bereaved families. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has been working with the national bereavement charity CRUSE and the Department of Health to provide bespoke counselling services for armed forces families, but we recognise that such counselling is not necessarily best provided by the MOD. We aim to signpost the most appropriate counselling services for armed forces families which are often provided by non-military bereavement specialists. The three services have funding mechanisms in place to allow families to access the most appropriate counselling services once a need has been identified.</p>

	<p pid="a.819W.2/1">The Defence Medical Services manage an extensive armed forces rehabilitation network which meets a wide range of requirements, including treatment for operational casualties. The network includes primary care rehabilitation facilities and 13 Regional Rehabilitation Units (RRUs) across the UK (plus two in Germany). There is one RRU in Northern Ireland (Aldergrove) and one in Scotland (Edinburgh); the other 11 are at locations convenient for centres of major military population across England. In addition, we have the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court in Surrey, where seriously wounded servicemen and women are normally treated following the completion of their secondary care.</p>
	<p pid="a.819W.2/2">Funding for the treatment of wounded personnel has been, and will continue to be, made available to match clinical requirements, including surges in casualty numbers. Our future budgetary plans assume a continuing need for additional investment in facilities and staff at Headley Court, whose annual running costs in 2009-10 were some &#163;20 million. Responsibility for the individual management of the primary care facilities is shared between the single Service Commands, with oversight from the Joint Medical Command. Owing to the number of different internal budgets to which costs would be attributable, any detailed analysis of local rehabilitation expenditure would therefore incur disproportionate costs. Likewise, the RRUs operate as lodger units within different military facilities, with a range of funding arrangements, and comprehensive financial data is not readily available.</p>
	<p pid="a.819W.2/3">Where an individual requires specialist rehabilitation services or equipment that can best be provided by a non-MOD organisation (such as some aspects of neurological rehabilitation and specialised prosthetics) this will be arranged at additional cost. In the financial year 2009-10, about &#163;3.4 million was spent on such services by the Joint Medical Command.</p>

His detention in hospital under the Mental Health Act 1983 does not change the position that, as a mandatory life sentence prisoner, his re-release on licence is a matter for the Parole Board. The board will not consider his case while his detention in hospital for treatment remains necessary. He can be remitted to prison at any time if his responsible clinician advises that his detention in hospital is no longer necessary. Alternatively, he has the right to have his case reviewed once a year by the independent First-tier Tribunal (Mental Health). A finding by the tribunal that his detention in hospital for treatment was no longer necessary would establish his right to review by the Parole Board.</p>

	<p pid="a.824W.3/1">No estimate has been made of the effect on average case completion times of the court estate proposals. Following the public consultation, should a decision be taken to close a court, the work that would have been heard at that court will be transferred to a nearby court with sufficient capacity to hear that work. I do not, therefore, anticipate there being any significant impact on average case completion times. However, my Department will monitor this as part of any post-implementation assessment of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.824W.3/2">Courtroom utilisation, which is the time a courtroom is used against the hours that a courtroom is available for use, currently averages 64% across the magistrates courts. The Government's aim is to increase utilisation of courtroom time to at least 80%. It is estimated that the proposals we are consulting on would result in a national utilisation rate in the magistrates courts of around 80%.</p>

	<p pid="a.847W.2/2">The number of drilling rig operations being conducted on an annual basis is dependent on the level and scope of exploration and production activity by operators, currently there are 22 mobile drilling rigs operating in UK waters. The number of offshore inspections by regulatory authorities may, therefore, change on an annual basis in line with activity and the regulators inspection and investigation strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.847W.2/3">HSE have confirmed that their health and safety intervention plans propose at least one annual visit to every mobile drilling rig working in UK waters. DECC's Offshore Inspectorate undertake a series of prioritised environmental inspections to fixed installations and drilling rigs, subject to a risk based approach which takes into account operations being conducted. Over the past three years an annual average of nine drilling rig inspections have been undertaken and, subject to the above factors, it is DECC's intention to double this to a minimum of 18 drilling inspections annually, depending on the level of drilling activity taking place.</p>

A number of these relate specifically to the potential impact of pesticides on honeybees, both from the wide scale professional use and home-garden use of insecticides. These projects were completed last year and final reports have been published.

	<p pid="a.856W.0/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.856W.0/2"><i> (a)</i> The largest single piece of research on badgers and bovine TB is the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), carried out by the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB. The ISG's final report, published in 2007, explicitly states that badgers contribute significantly to the disease in cattle.</p>
	<p pid="a.856W.0/3"><i> (b)</i> The RBCT examined the impact of two different badger culling strategies on TB incidence in cattle. Results showed that annual proactive culling was associated with a 23% reduction in TB incidence in cattle herds in culled areas, but a 25% increase in TB incidence in herds in the surrounding 2 km un-culled ring. The increase in surrounding areas is thought to be due to changes in badger behaviour following social disturbance brought about by culling-the &quot;perturbation effect&quot;. Since the end of the RBCT, regular monitoring of TB incidence has shown continued benefits of culling on TB incidence in proactively culled areas for at least 3.5 years after culling. A beneficial effect was also observed in the 2 km ring surrounding culled areas for 2.5 years immediately after culling stopped. Reactive, localised culling was stopped by Ministers in November 2003 as early interim results from the reactively culled areas showed an increase of 18.9% new confirmed TB cattle herd incidents when compared with survey-only areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.856W.0/4">DEFRA has been funding research into badger vaccines since 1998. An injectable badger vaccine has been shown to be both safe and effective in experimental studies and is now licensed for use. Research continues into an oral badger vaccine. Modelling work to help us understand the effect of vaccination, in isolation and in combination with culling, is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="a.856W.0/5">In 2005, DEFRA commissioned a project to examine the effectiveness of biosecurity measures to prevent badger visits to farm buildings. This project finished in October 2009. It found that badger exclusion measures could, if properly employed and maintained, prevent 100% of badger visits to farm buildings, but that compliance varied widely among farmers.</p>
	<p pid="a.856W.0/6">Research into immunocontraception as a method of controlling badger numbers is being funded through programmes elsewhere in DEFRA. As the results will be relevant to TB control, DEFRA's TB Programme will review the findings of this study when they become available.</p>

	<p pid="a.858W.2/1">DEFRA part-funded the 'GM Nation' public debate that was planned and run by an independent steering board in 2002 and 2003. The board appointed the Central Office of Information as the prime contractor for the debate. The total cost was &#163;562,000 of which DEFRA contributed &#163;282,000. Other funding contributions were made by the former Department of Trade and Industry and the devolved Administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This was not a research project as such and therefore did not have a project code.</p>

	<p pid="a.861W.0/1">Since the first detection of <i> Phytophthora ramorum</i> in Sussex in May 2002, a systematic programme of surveys has been carried out by the Food and Environment Research Agency and the Forestry Commission covering nurseries, garden centres, woodland and other sites in the wider environment, with action being taken to destroy infected plants that posed a risk of further spread, especially Rhododendrons.</p>
	<p pid="a.861W.0/2">While the disease caused by the pathogen has spread, and is now found in much of the south-west of England and Wales, occasionally in other parts of the south of England, and to a much lesser extent in Scotland, the rate of spread and the intensity of infection has been slowed by the action taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.861W.0/3">In August 2009, the pathogen was found for the first time in Japanese larch, a commercial forestry tree species, at sites in Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, and surveys have found a number of further sites where trees have been infected. These surveys have intensified and are ongoing, supported by aerial surveillance by helicopter. Infected sites totalling around 1,850 hectares have been found in Devon, Cornwall, Somerset and in South Wales. The evidence suggests that all of the woodlands that have been found with dead and dying larch could have become infected as a result of a weather event causing aerial spread, possibly in 2008. The extent of subsequent spread is still being investigated.</p>

	<p pid="a.861W.3/1">The Government have no immediate plans to set up an advisory group to promote sustainable food procurement. The Government are however examining ways of promoting local procurement including the further development of local food hubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.861W.3/2">The procurement of food in the public sector is an area where the coalition Government is looking for progress both in terms of efficiencies and sustainability. The public sector must lead by example on this and DEFRA, with input from other Government Departments and external organisations, is already looking into how this can be achieved. For example, we are in the process of considering criteria for Government Buying Standards (GBS) to ensure the public sector procures sustainable food and catering services. GBS are mandatory for central Government Departments and their executive agencies and these standards will be promoted to the wider public sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.867W.11/2">This is a case I am following closely and I again urge the Iranian Government to cease its harassment of the Baha'i minority, and to respect the rights of the many members of minority groups who continue to face arrest and lengthy prison sentences, often on vaguely worded charges of acting against national security.</p>

	<p pid="a.873W.6/1">An independent review conducted by PwC in 2006/07 found that RDAs on average generated a return of &#163;4.50 for every &#163;1 spent. The average return for AWM is just under &#163;4 to &#163;1. This ranges from &#163;1:&#163;1 for the 'People and skills' programme to &#163;16:&#163;1 for their individual enterprise support scheme. But, as the PwC analysis also revealed, much of RDAs' spending was of poor value. More than half the RDAs' economic benefits came from just 20% of their spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.873W.6/2">In these constrained times, we need to ensure that all spending is valuable and worthwhile. That is why this Government are creating local enterprise partnerships (LEPs), accountable to the people affected by the LEPs actions, so that money is spent on programmes that will make a difference, not to meet Whitehall targets.</p>

	<p pid="a.875W.2/1">We are seeking to drive up the skills levels of the work force by directing public funding where it will bring the clearest benefits. Apprenticeships will play a vital role in this. Our decision to redeploy &#163;150 million of Train to Gain funding to create 50,000 high-quality, employer-led apprenticeship places is just the beginning. My ambition is no less than to build a system that facilitates more apprenticeships in England than we have ever seen before.</p>
	<p pid="a.875W.2/2">To build an advanced economy we need advanced skills in manufacturing and engineering and apprenticeships are a major contributor to the nation's engineering and manufacturing skills base. Last year 37,000 people started an apprenticeship in engineering and manufacturing technologies in England and I want to see this number rise. That is why this Government are committed to increasing the number of apprenticeships, in particular, advanced and higher apprenticeships. We are also committed to driving up the quality of apprenticeships and ensuring, through Sector Skills Councils, that all apprenticeship frameworks meet the needs of the real economy. Sector Skills Councils also have a key role in driving up demand from employers within their sectors and encouraging more businesses to offer apprenticeship places.</p>
	<p pid="a.875W.2/3">We fund apprenticeships on a national basis through the Skills Funding Agency (SFA)-there are no regional or sectoral allocations. We expect the SFA to work with the National Apprenticeships Service, employers, colleges and training organisations in Dudley and the West Midlands to make additional apprenticeship places available where there is local demand.</p>

	<p pid="a.881W.2/1">The information requested is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.2/2">Under the current economic development structures in England, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills allocates budgets to regional development agencies. The agencies determine what assistance to provide to business, subject to the terms of the accountability and financial framework and their delegated financial authorities. RDAs' investments have been guided by the regional economic strategy and their corporate plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.2/3"><i> North West</i><sup>(<i> 1</i>)</sup></p>
	<p pid="a.881W.2/4">UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) is the Government Department that leads on work to attract high quality foreign direct investment (FDI) into the UK in partnership with economic development agencies, and other Government Departments, across the country. This delivers a high standard of service throughout the investment process. Full use is made of the UK's global network of embassies, high commissions and consulates. Significantly assisted by that work, over the last few years, the Northwest has been the most successful UK region, outside of the South East, for attracting FDI projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.881W.2/5">The total number of FDI projects for the financial years 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 was 511 (see table). In 2009-10, despite the current economic climate, there were 179 FDI projects in the North West, estimated to involve nearly 13,500 jobs-over 7,000 of those being new, the remainder safeguarded. The public sector were involved in nearly 70% of these projects.</p>

Sector Skills Councils have a crucial role in all aspects of our skills policy, including apprenticeships. We will continue to empower them as the voice of employers in the skills system-and to challenge them to perform with maximum effectiveness. In June I met with representatives from the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils (SSCs), including SSC Chief Executives. I also met with Charlie Mayfield, the lead UK Commissioner for employer engagement, and a group of SSC chairs. Over the coming months I plan to meet with all the SSCs as part of a full and active dialogue to identify how best we can realise our ambitions for skills.</p>

A majority of travel is booked via the Department's central contract for travel, which covers air, rail and ferry travel. The following figures do not cover all travel spend for the Department, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies which may be purchased in exceptional cases via another route; for example a member of staff paying for rail ticket at short notice and claiming back the money spent as an expense. There are no central records held for these types of purchases and to provide this information would be at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.888W.2/2">Data before 2002 is not available. It is not possible to provide a breakdown of spend between the Department and its non-departmental public bodies for the period from January 2003 to December 2003.</p>

	<p pid="a.897W.11/1">The Government are providing &#163;94 million nationally for targeted parenting and family interventions in 2010-11 aimed at families who are struggling to manage their children's behaviour. Local areas have discretion over how they organise their family and parenting support services as local people are better able to decide what will work best in their local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.897W.11/2">The Department is working with the Children's Workforce Development Council and the National Academy for Parenting Research at King's College to ensure that evidence based parenting programmes and effective parenting interventions are available. This is through a number of research trials that gather evidence on the overall effectiveness, value for money and long-term cost effectiveness of family interventions against the high costs of a child being taken into care or being placed in a Young Offenders Institution. There is also ongoing work with the Centre for Excellence and Outcomes on sharing good and effective practice in parenting and family support.</p>
	<p pid="a.897W.11/3">We are also working to improve the skills of the parenting work force and to look at what effectively addresses the needs of those working on the front-line. Around 1000 more practitioners across all local authorities will have the opportunity to access training in effective parenting programmes in 2010-11.</p>

The Department collects information in the School Census about Year 12 students attending sixth forms in schools only, we do not collect information about year 12 students in other sixth form provision eg sixth form colleges. Therefore the figures that the Department could supply from the School Census would only provide partial coverage, would not be representative of all sixth form activity and some local authority data and comparisons would be invalid because of differences in sixth form provision between local authorities.</p>

We expect them to consider the need for savings across all areas of expenditure, regardless of whether the initial source of funding is formula or area based, taking account of their statutory responsibilities and of the Government's commitment to protecting front line services wherever possible. The reduction in ABG does not imply a direct cut to those services funded by the grant, which include careers advice and support for young people not in employment, education or training.</p>

	<p pid="a.904W.2/1">IPSA has advised me that the merits of introducing a paper-based system for claiming expenses were considered during the start-up phase of IPSA. It was concluded that in line with current expectations of IT-led delivery within the public sector, it would be inappropriate to design a new expenses process which was not based at least in part on an IT-led solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.904W.2/2">IPSA remains of the view that an IT-led, rather than paper-based, system is most appropriate. Using an IT-led solution allows IPSA to achieve a high level of transparency more easily and cheaply than an equivalent manual approach. It will also allow any future changes to processes to be more easily implemented.</p>

Future funding for the Decent Homes programme will be decided in the context of the Government's spending review.</p>

We have adopted a fair approach to the reductions in grants and funding streams and have limited the amount councils lose. The impact on the area of reductions in grants this year will be for the local authority to decide. We have ensured that councils, including Sunderland, are able to deliver essential frontline services by making no changes to the &#163;29 billion they receive through formula grant and by increasing flexibility for local spending decisions through removing restrictions on how they spend their money.</p>

	<p pid="a.915W.6/12">The majority of HMRC's premises in Northern Ireland, along with the rest of its estate, were included in the 2001 Strategic Transfer of the Estate to the Private Sector (STEPS) outsourcing deal with Mapeley. Under the terms of the contract with Mapeley, HMRC receives the benefit of fully serviced and maintained accommodation in exchange for an inclusive, property specific unitary charge. As HMRC do not make separate rent or maintenance payments the estimated annual unitary charge expenditure has been provided for these premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.915W.6/13">HMRC occupies four premises in Northern Ireland by way of sharing arrangements with other Government Departments. For three of these properties-Crown Buildings, Antrim; Windsor House, Belfast; and Crown Buildings, Omagh-the accommodation charge incurred is fully inclusive and the rent and maintenance costs cannot be separately identified. These costs are included in the estimate of rent expenditure, in line with how they are reported in HMRC's accounts.</p>
