CCIS is an in-depth study that involves specialist teams examining over 1,300 cars per year after they have been involved in police reported injury crashes and correlating the injuries suffered by the vehicle occupants to their causes. The vehicle investigation involves a thorough evaluation of all the cars' safety features, including seat belts and airbag systems. The effectiveness of the airbags once they have deployed is evaluated through this work. CCIS is a representative sample of all the car occupant injury crashes that occur in Great Britain and can be used to predict the number of airbags that are inflated or deployed per year in such accidents. Non-injury crashes where airbags deploy are not routinely investigated.</p>

Where operators of foreign registered aircraft are required to seek permission to land from the Secretary of State in order to comply with Article 138 of the Air Navigation Order 2005, it is apparent from their applications whether the purpose of the flight is to carry passengers or cargo. Flights carrying dangerous goods or munitions of war are required to seek specific authorisation from the Civil Aviation Authority.</p>

	<p pid="c.2294W.8/1">At present, it is too early to provide a reliable estimate of the impact emissions trading will have on forecasts of emissions from aviation. This will depend on a number of factors including the overall number of allowances and the detailed design for the inclusion of aviation into the EU ETS. These factors have yet to be specified and will be subject to discussion with other member states' governments.</p>

	<p pid="c.2299W.5/1">Capacity on the core routes of the DLR network will be increased by 50 per cent. with the introduction of longer trains from 2009. Frequencies on the DLR will also be increased to serve the Olympics in 2012, including services on the planned Stratford International Extension which will link a number of Olympics venues. It is anticipated that with committed capacity enhancements and extensions which are planned to be in place by 2010 that approximately 90,000 passengers could be carried per hour on the entire DLR network during the Olympics.</p>

The number of fatalities in accidents where a driver or rider had an illegal alcohol level is estimated from coroners' and procurators' fiscal data which becomes available a year later than the main road accident data. As a result, the estimates for 2004 are provisional. The provisional estimate of deaths in drink drive accidents in Great Britain in 2004 is 590.

	<p pid="c.2308W.6/1">The operation and development of the Docklands light Railway is the responsibility of Transport for London (TfL).</p>
	<p pid="c.2308W.6/2">Subject to the approval of applications which are currently before the Secretary of State, the planned frequency of the Docklands Light Railway extension between Stratford International and Canning Town prior to the Olympics is some 10 trains per hour, per direction in the peak and six trains off peak. This would mean a passenger capacity of 5,000 per hour, per direction in the peak and 3,000 per hour, per direction off peak. During the Olympics however the frequency of services on this part of the DLR will be increased substantially to accommodate anticipated spectator demand. The converted part of the North London Line to DLR operation will have the capability of up to 30 trains per hour.</p>
	<p pid="c.2308W.6/3">It is anticipated that the cost of operation will be met by revenue.</p>
	<p pid="c.2308W.6/4">TfL have indicated that they would expect the new extension to be operated within the existing franchise arrangements which currently govern the operation of the Docklands Light Railway.</p>

We made the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations (RVAR) in 1998 and many of the trains calling at Stroud station comply with these.</p>
	<p pid="c.2316W.5/4">More generally, disabled people in Stroud as elsewhere in the country will also benefit from the provisions in the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (DDA 2005). We have already laid regulations which will, from <phrase class="date" code="">4 December 2006</phrase>, lift the transport exemption in Part 3 of the DDA 1995 for land-based public transport, vehicle hire, breakdown services and vehicles used on leisure and tourism transport services. We will also be consulting shortly on draft regulations to set an &quot;end date&quot; of no later than <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2020</phrase> for when all trains will have to meet RVAR and to apply those regulations to older trains when they are refurbished.</p>

The regions' advice is expected in January 2006. However, the Highways Agency is currently working to indicative budget allocations of &pound;262 million in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;328 million in 2007&ndash;08 for major trunk road schemes on motorways and trunk roads categorised as of regional importance. In 2006&ndash;07 through to 2007&ndash;08 the Highways Agency expects to complete 17 regional schemes, which collectively will deliver approximately 58 miles of road improvements to the network, and to have started works on nine others.</p>

	<p pid="c.2325W.8/1">There is no statistical information available which can accurately record the total number of business start-ups as such. New VAT registrations can be used as a proxy for business start-ups, and these show that in 2004 there were 225 new registrations in the Tamworth district council area and 14,855 in the West Midlands. The Tamworth constituency covers a greater area than that of Tamworth district council but it has not been possible to quantify the number of start-up or VAT registrations at a constituency level as records are not maintained by constituency area.</p>
	<p pid="c.2325W.8/2">The Department of Trade and Industry sponsors the regional development agencies (RDAs) which are charged with the responsibility for the economic development of their regions and to work with partners to increase the sustainability of businesses and foster business start-ups. Advantage West Midlands supports a range of regional-level schemes and programmes that support start-ups including Mustard which exists to give new and young business start-ups the right kind of help when they need it the most. It is an initiative offering practical, hands-on expertise to high growth-potential new and young business start-ups in the West Midlands. Mustard is a unique private/public sector collaboration managed by Birmingham Chamber of Commerce and Industry and delivered by the region's Business Links and leading private sector consultancies.</p>
	<p pid="c.2325W.8/3">Advantage West Midlands has also established a suite of regional funds available to start-ups including the Early Growth Fund, the Growth Fund and Advantage Business Angels and created a searchable database of all public and private sector sources of finance in the region&mdash;<a href="http://www.westmidlandsfinance.com">www.westmidlandsfinance.com</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.2325W.8/4">The region's three high technology corridors are sites providing more incubation space for high value start-ups. For example, the Wolverhampton to Telford corridor has just completed work on the &pound;5.5 million e-Innovation Centre in Telford, providing start-up premises and grow-on space for companies involved in high-technology businesses such as e-commerce and e-engineering.</p>
	<p pid="c.2325W.8/5">To create an enterprise culture in Tamworth and the West Midlands region in general, Advantage West Midlands has established the West Midlands Enterprise Board. One of the targets the Enterprise Board has set itself is increasing the number of self employed people in the region by 35,000 by 2010. To help achieve this, it has recommended reforming the business support network. The new reformed network will include in-depth, specialist support to a wide range of start-ups across the region and ensure that the various initiatives which are already in place to stimulate entrepreneurship and start up activity are effectively brought together to provide cohesive packages of support. Under the current business support regime Business Link Staffordshire has assisted 1,816 start-ups in the county during the period <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-15">15 December 2005</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.2329W.6/1">Section 89 of the Postal Services Act 2000 enables universal service providers (currently only Royal Mail) to make schemes setting out the terms and conditions for their provision of universal postal services. These schemes include provision for compensation payments for loss etc. Postcomm, the independent regulator, is responsible for enforcing such schemes (including on compensation) through the licensing regime also created by the Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.2329W.6/2">The powers required for Royal Mail to make such schemes were already in place under previous postal services legislation before the creation of the 2000 Act. Rather than introduce new arrangements, when adequate mechanisms already existed, the Postal Services Act 2000 merely mirrored previous arrangements updating them only to take into account the new framework and references for postal services envisaged by the 2000 Act (i.e. the potential for more universal service providers in addition to Royal Mail and the licensing regime).</p>

	<p pid="c.2330W.8/1">The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS) has put in place a prior permission scheme for Premium Rate diallers. This makes it possible to assess the dialler software to be used for proposed services, and if appropriate to prohibit their release. The independent regulator for electronic communications, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), is currently consulting on extending this scheme to enable ICSTIS to take action against any rogue dialler irrespective of the telephone number or call charge used. Implementing a recommendation from Ofcom's Report into the Regulation of Premium Rate Services, this Department has just increased the maximum fine for breaches of the ICSTIS Code, and ICSTIS intends to review its sanctions policy early in 2006. ICSTIS has also put in place a key recommendation from the report to slow the money-flow to those that abuse the premium rate services charging mechanism. This obliges telecoms companies not to make payments to premium rate service providers for at least 30 days after calls have been made. This gives ICSTIS more time to identify breaches of its Code and enables ICSTIS to direct telecoms companies to withhold funds pending the outcome of investigations.</p>
	<p pid="c.2330W.8/2">As ICSTIS has not had any complaints since May, Premium Media Communications may have withdrawn from the UK dialler market. However ICSTIS plans to write to this company shortly to give it notice of the withdrawal of its licence to operate diallers. This means that no phone company can give Premium Media Communications premium rate numbers for dialler services.</p>
	<p pid="c.2330W.8/3">The Office of the Telecommunications Ombudsman (Otelo) is the appropriate body to make representations to BT on consumer disputes about telephone charges due to rogue dialling, and regularly contacts BT about specific cases.</p>

	<p pid="c.2338W.8/3">The DTIs role is limited to the issue of export licences where these are required, e.g. for the re-export of goods on display after the exhibition, or the promotion of trade in controlled or restricted goods between third countries. On that basis, we are not aware that any of the goods specified were exhibited at DSEI2005. Beyond that, export licences are not required for the exhibition of such goods in the UK. Firearms licences may however be required from the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="c.2338W.8/4">The Government's 1997 ban on the export and transhipment through the UK of torture goods relates to portable devices designed or modified for riot control purposes or self-protection to administer an electric shock, including electric-shock batons, electric-shock shields, stun guns, and tasers, and specially designed components for such devices, and leg-irons, gang-chains, shackles (excluding normal handcuffs). Since 1998, the import, export, transfer and manufacture of all forms of anti-personnel landmines has also been banned.</p>

	<p pid="c.2341W.8/2">Since June 2003, the Intrepid/Anheusar Busch Fallen Heroes Fund (Intrepid Foundation) has, very generously, been supporting the widows and children of US and UK Service personnel killed while serving on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Support ceased in June 2005 when the Intrepid Foundation decided to concentrate its activities in support of limbless US Service personnel. This decision was taken in light of the recent US Congress decision to significantly enhance the support given to families of personnel killed while on operations.</p>
	<p pid="c.2341W.8/3">The Ministry of Defence has a liaison officer in place who regularly communicates with the Intrepid Foundation in New York and facilitates payments through the appropriate single Service casualty organisation. The Intrepid Foundation has paid $10,000 to each widow and $5,000 to each child of a Service person who has died. Where an unmarried partner is involved, the Foundation has paid $5,000 to each child. Forty-eight families have so far benefited from the Intrepid Foundation with payments ranging from $5,000 to $25,000. There are four outstanding cases that the Fund and the Ministry of Defence continue to work on.</p>
	<p pid="c.2341W.8/4">When the scheme ceased in June this year the Chief of the Defence Staff wrote to the Chairman of the Intrepid Foundation thanking him personally for his support. I would like to take this opportunity to add my own personal thanks for their very generous and unstinting support.</p>

	<p pid="c.2342W.8/1">The Married Quarters estate in Great Britain comprises some 49,000 properties of which approximately 7,900 can be empty at any one time. The figure of 7,900 fluctuates throughout the year and the cost cannot readily be identified. However, the nominal rental cost of that number of properties would be around &pound;22 million. In practice, the vast majority of properties remain empty for considerably less than a year.</p>
	<p pid="c.2342W.8/2">The number of vacant properties is kept under constant review and they are managed either for continued use, or for disposal where it can be demonstrated that there is no identified longer-term need. The level of empty properties has historically been higher than social housing norms largely because the Ministry of Defence queues houses for families, not families for houses. A number of studies into future basing requirements is currently under way and some of the empty homes are being held against future decisions or are earmarked for work to improve their condition.</p>

	<p pid="c.2343W.5/13">Properties in the married quarters estate that are leased from Annington Homes are prepared for disposal in sufficient numbers to meet the minimum number criteria laid down in the 1996 Sale Agreement. Typically this means either 10 per cent. of a site or 20 properties (whichever is the lesser) have to be available for disposal at any time. Consequently, empty properties are retained until sufficient numbers at a site become available. Married quarters which are owned by the Ministry of Defence can be disposed of more easily upon vacant possession.</p>

	<p pid="c.2346W.0/1">The Falkland Islands provide an excellent training environment. Joint armed forces training exercises of varying size and duration are conducted throughout the year, including flying training, live fire exercises, command post exercises and ground defence training. The training conducted on the Falkland Islands makes a valuable contribution to the operational capability of our armed forces and, because it is a visible sign of the UK's commitment to their security, attracts wide support from the local population.</p>

	<p pid="c.2348W.11/1">The focus of the United Kingdom Government's space policy is on civil and scientific uses. However, we also derive important security benefits from its military use. Like many countries, the UK uses satellites for a wide range of military functions such as secure communications, meteorological predictions and in the effective monitoring of various arms control treaties. This military use of space is distinct from the deployment of weapons in space. The UK Government has no plans to deploy weapons in space.</p>
	<p pid="c.2348W.11/2">As one of the Depository States (along with the US and Russia), the UK Government continues to fully support the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which places important constraints on the use of space, including prohibiting the deployment of weapons of mass destruction in space and military activity on the moon and other celestial bodies.</p>
	<p pid="c.2348W.11/3">The main forum for discussing the military use of space is the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. We have taken part in informal discussions on the possibility of a further treaty banning weapons in space, although no international consensus has been reached on the need for such a treaty. Notwithstanding this, we continue to support the annual resolution on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) at the UN.</p>

	<p pid="c.2357W.6/2">The six privately run removal centres are operated under separate contracts. The operators are: Global Solutions Ltd. at Campsfield, Oakington, Tinsley House and Yarl's Wood; Serco at Colnbrook; and UKDS Ltd. at Harmondsworth.</p>

It is for the individual contractors to decide how to deliver their contractual obligations for the provision of primary health care services, whether through &quot;in-house&quot; delivery, via a health care sub-contractor, or a mix of both approaches.</p>

	<p pid="c.2358W.0/1">Yes. Section 64 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984, as amended, enables the police to retain DNA samples (and profiles) taken from individuals arrested for, informed they will be reported for or charged with a recordable offence and detained in a police station. The police may retain the sample even when the individual has not been convicted of the offence for which the sample was taken. The decision whether to retain or remove a sample is an operational one for the chief constable of the police force which took it. There is no distinction in PACE between samples taken from an adult or a minor.</p>

Call rates are no longer linked to public payphone rates, they are agreed under the terms of the contract with BT which allows the Prison Service to set appropriate charges, taking account of the pattern of calls, as well as maintenance costs. The minimum charge, which is lower than that for public phones, reflects the fact that prisoners' calls tend to be of short duration.</p>

	<p pid="c.2366W.5/1">The primary function of CCTV systems at secure training centres is to allow the operators to maintain the security of the premises, prevent crime and, if a crime were committed, to assist with the investigation of the crime . The systems are also designed to give confidence to trainees, staff and visitors that they are in a secure environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.2366W.5/2">The systems are not intended as a means of assisting the Youth Justice Board's performance monitors to monitor the contractors' performance. However, the monitors do, on occasion, make use of the systems for that purpose. For example, if a monitor has concerns that an incident report is unclear, or if the report raises doubts whether the incident has been handled correctly, he or she may decide to view the footage of the incident. Or if a young person makes a complaint about an incident at the centre, the monitor may choose to view the relevant footage to enable him or her to consider the complaint.</p>

	<p pid="c.2367W.2/1">The Home Office routinely monitors the effectiveness of sentencing in reducing re-offending through examining reconviction data. Records from the Police National Computer are used to ascertain whether sampled cohorts of offenders have been convicted of further offences during the two year period (one year for juvenile offenders) either following the imposition of sentence (in the case of community sentences or fines) or following release from prison (in the case of custodial sentences).</p>
	<p pid="c.2367W.2/2">For the purposes of measuring performance against Public Service Agreement (PSA) targets to reduce re-offending of adults and juveniles by 5 per cent. by 2006 from a 2000 baseline, the Home Office publishes annual statistics on reconviction rates (for adults and juveniles separately&mdash;see <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/onlinepubs1.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/onlinepubs1.html</a>) showing rates for a variety of sentences.

	<p pid="c.2367W.5/1">The Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) have been in place since 2001 and have already made a significant contribution to public protection. Under the MAPPA, the police, probation and prison services, supported by additional agencies including housing, health and social services, combine forces to manage the risk to the public posed by sexual and violent offenders. Those &quot;critical few&quot; offenders that pose the highest risk are referred to a Multi-Agency Public Protection Panel (MAPPP), where their cases are regularly scrutinised by senior representatives of local agencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.2367W.5/2">From next year police and probation areas have been asked to produce business plans which will aid the monitoring and development of the MAPPA locally. Each area is already obliged to produce an annual report to highlight the work undertaken within the MAPPA to protect local communities. The annual reports published in October showed that only a very small proportion of offenders managed at the highest levels in the community were charged with a serious further offences (SFO), indicating a robust level of management.</p>
	<p pid="c.2367W.5/3">The Association of Chief Police Officers are currently developing a public protection manual to provide central guidance to police forces in managing not only sex offenders in the community but covering all areas of public protection. This is due in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.2371W.9/1">The issue of sensitive products is a key aspect of the negotiations on agricultural market access. The principle that WTO Members may designate &quot;an appropriate number&quot; of sensitive products was established under the July 2004 Framework Agreement. However, the number and treatment of sensitive products have yet to be agreed under the negotiations. When these issues are agreed, it will be for the EU as a whole, rather than for individual EU member states, to designate the sensitive products. The UK's position in these EU discussions will be guided both by our firm support for the Doha Development Agenda mandate to secure substantial improvements in agricultural market access, and by the position of key UK stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="c.2373W.0/1">Bovine TB does affect both cats and ferrets. The incidence seems low, but TB in these species is not notifiable. So far this year in Great Britain, the Veterinary Laboratory Agency has diagnosed nine cases of bovine TB in cats, and one case in a ferret. Of these, spoligotype 13 has been isolated from one cat, and the ferret. Both of these animals came from the East Sussex area.</p>

	<p pid="c.2377W.5/1">In July 2003 the Government signed a voluntary producer responsibility agreement with the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), a trade body representing 890 corporate members of the direct mail industry, to increase the recycling of direct mail to 70 per cent. by 2013 (the level of direct mail recycling was about 13 per cent. in 2002). The first target of 30 per cent. is due to be met by the end of 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.2377W.5/2">As part of the agreement, the DMA have also agreed to reduce waste by improving the targeting of direct mail and by publicising the use of suppression files such as the Mailing Preference Service which allows people to opt out of receiving addressed direct mail.</p>
	<p pid="c.2377W.5/3">The signing of the agreement in July 2003 was the last meeting between my officials and the DMA. However, we have had ongoing correspondence with the DMA who have produced an interim report on their progress in relation to the objectives set out in the agreement. We are currently awaiting the publication of the first formal report which will detail whether they have achieved the 2005 recycling target of 30 per cent. I would expect my officials to hold a progress meeting shortly after the publication of this report in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="c.2377W.5/4">I do not intend to conduct a quantitative analysis of the environmental benefits of reducing direct mail at this time. However a 5 per cent. and 10 per cent. reduction in direct mail will equate to a saving of 271 million and 542 million items of direct mail per year respectively, (based on the current estimate of 5.4 billion items of direct mail being distributed annually). The Government takes the view that direct mail is a legitimate method of marketing goods and services and has no plans to introduce legislation prohibiting or restricting the distribution of such mail, although it will continue to encourage and support the use of a voluntary opt out service.</p>

	<p pid="c.2378W.2/3">The payment rate for Entry Level Stewardship was determined using a combination of agronomic assumptions based on various farming systems which covers income forgone and costs incurred calculations, along with an incentive element where it was deemed appropriate.

	<p pid="c.2383W.0/1">Glass and plastic bottles are already subject to recycling obligations under the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended), which require businesses that handle more than 50 tonnes of packaging a year and have a turnover greater than &pound;2 million to recover and recycle specified tonnages of packaging waste.</p>
	<p pid="c.2383W.0/2">In 2004, 344,000 tonnes of plastic packaging waste was recycled, of which we estimate that about 10 per cent. or 34,500 tonnes was plastic bottles, some of which would have held water. I understand that the plastic industry expect to recycle 50,000 tonnes of plastic bottles this year. Likewise, in 2004, 1,050,000 tonnes of glass packaging waste was recycled, of which approximately 75 per cent. was glass bottles and again some would have held water. It is worth noting, however, that in 2004 only 32,000 tonnes of glass was used to bottle water. It is much more sustainable for people to drink tap water.</p>

	<p pid="c.2383W.6/1">In 2004, there were in excess of 200 generating stations utilising landfill methane in the UK. The Government does not hold statistics determining whether these landfill gas utilisation plants are located on closed landfill sites or operational ones. There are about 900 of the latter. According to DTI statistics, the total installed generating capacity at landfill sites in 2004 was 722 MW. Research for Defra by Colder Associates indicates that the volume of methane captured for electricity generation was about 1,070 thousand tonnes (kT) in 2004. An estimated additional 1,307 kt methane was captured and flared at landfill sites. This means that electricity generation and flaring saved greenhouse gas emissions of about 6 million tonnes carbon equivalent (MtC equiv), and about 7.5 MtC equiv, respectively. The total saving from capture was therefore about 13.5 MtC equiv. The generating plant produced about 4 TWh of electricity, equivalent to saving a further 0.5 million MtC equiv due to reduced emissions at power stations.</p>

	<p pid="c.2390W.2/2">The Government aim to have reduced the amount of commercial and industrial waste going to landfill to 85 per cent. of the 1998 level by 2005. The recent Environment Agency report, published this month, showed waste recovery rates were at record levels in 2004, with 53 per cent. of all business waste recycled or re-used.</p>
	<p pid="c.2390W.2/3">The main incentive for businesses to recycle more is economic. The landfill tax is increasing the cost of waste disposal and thus providing the waste management industry with a strong incentive to offer separate collection facilities for businesses.</p>
	<p pid="c.2390W.2/4">&pound;43 million from the landfill tax escalator was fed back into business via the Business Resource Efficiency and Waste (BREW) programme to fund a variety of initiatives such as Envirowise, which advises and supports businesses who want to improve their recycling performance.</p>
	<p pid="c.2390W.2/5">The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 have set targets to obligated businesses for recycling paper packaging waste, peaking at 70 per cent. in 2008. To create stable and efficient markets for recycled materials such as paper, Government have established the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP). Clean source separation of paper and other recyclates is a well recognised factor in obtaining best prices.</p>
	<p pid="c.2390W.2/6">WRAP is currently undertaking a study aimed at finding ways to overcome the barriers currently inhibiting adequate provision of recycling services for SMEs, and to improve their capacity to recycle more waste. The study is funded by BREW. WRAP intend to deliver a series of trials to collect materials for recycling from SMEs that presently receive no recycling services. Trials are expected to continue until summer 2006 after which WRAP will produce a final feasibility study report based on their findings.</p>

	<p pid="c.2392W.2/2">Local authorities have a duty to Review and Assess air quality in their areas.

While DEFRA is a statutory consultee for local authority reports on air quality, monitoring results are made available to the public by local authorities. DEFRA does not log the monitoring information from these assessments. A partial survey of monitoring sites in the UK was carried out in November 2003. This estimated the total number of monitoring sites in the UK at around 6&ndash;700. A large proportion of these are likely to be roadside sites.</p>

	<p pid="c.2394W.0/1">In November 2004 the Government commissioned its Central Point of Expertise on Timber (CPET) to examine five forest certification schemes to determine whether they provide credible assurance of legal and sustainable timber sources as defined in the model contract condition and specification used by central Government Departments. One of the schemes assessed was the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) which sets forest management and certification requirements for national bodies, endorsed by PEFC, to adopt and apply to suit local conditions. PEFC has endorsed the Australian Forestry Standard (AFS) which means that forests and products that derive from the trees harvested in those forests that are certified as operating to the AFS can be marketed under the PEFC label.</p>
	<p pid="c.2394W.0/2">CPET's initial assessment of the PEFC scheme was that on paper it provided credible assurance of legal harvesting but did not provide credible assurance of sustainable timber production. PEFC was judged not to have sufficient requirements for involving all relevant interest groups in the forest standard setting and forest management auditing process. This was judged to be a system failure at the international scheme level and was not influenced by actual situations at a national level. No national body was examined and there was no assessment of actual performance on the ground. PEFC has since changed its scheme requirements and been reassessed as providing a credible system, on paper, for assuring sustainable timber production as defined in Government contracts. However, the UK Government, aware that scheme changes at the international level are meaningless if not adopted nationally, gave notice that it would check to see that national PEFC bodies had implemented changes to their published requirements. CPET plans to make such checks in January 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.2400W.16/1">The independent five-year evaluation of the Academies Programme undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers shows that academies are overwhelmingly popular with both parents and pupils, and that academies have made a significant difference to the teaching and learning culture since the predecessor schools. The evaluation has also found clear evidence that sponsors are having a positive impact on academies by both establishing a positive vision and ethos for the new academies, and also by providing their expertise.</p>
	<p pid="c.2400W.16/2">Improvements in GCSE results are already in evidence, despite many pupils only having attended their academy for a few terms. Of the 14 academies open at the time of the last round of GCSE examinations, all but two showed an increase in the proportion of students achieving five grades A* to C relative to their predecessor schools, and the average annual increase in the number of students gaining five grades A* to C across all academies is 6 per cent. a year. Several academies have shown remarkable improvements in their GCSE results since opening. The City Academy in Bristol, for example, has shown an increase of 25 per cent. in the number of pupils achieving five grades A* to C in just two years. Four other academies have shown increases of greater than 20 per cent. since opening.</p>
	<p pid="c.2400W.16/3">The Government's proposals to establish trust schools represent an extension of the freedom to innovate to schools outside those areas currently being targeted by the academies programme. The creation of trust schools will assist in offering more and better choice and diversity in the schools system for parents and pupils. Trust schools will build on the long tradition of voluntary schools which are backed by trusts, and also on the successful experience of specialist schools and academies in working with sponsors from the voluntary, not-for-profit and private sectors. The success of specialist schools in their value-added performance is attested by research by Professor David Jesson, most recently his study: 'Educational outcomes and value added by specialist schools, 2004'.</p>

	<p pid="c.2401W.2/1">Academies are situated in areas of deprivation and/or educational need. The main criteria for consideration of an Academy is for it to be sited in an area of historically weak educational performance and that the local authority area concerned is listed in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister statistics on deprivation. Other factors such as poor ratings by OFSTED and low admission numbers for predecessor schools are sometimes considered, but it is the academic under-achievement and deprivation that are of primary importance. Some Academies are being established in areas not considered as deprived overall but with particular enclaves of deprivation or low attainment.</p>

It will be for individual local authorities, in discussion with all schools in their area, to take a strategic approach to developing access to after school care through schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.2402W.5/2">The Extended Schools prospectus issued in June 2005 makes it clear that children with disabilities or special educational needs must be able to access all new services, and schools have a responsibility to ensure this happens. The needs of children in particular schools will vary. Schools will need to work closely with parents to ensure that services are shaped around the needs of children and the wider community.</p>

	<p pid="c.2403W.2/1">The purpose of the annual parents' meeting was to provide an opportunity for a discussion of the manner in which the school had been conducted, and of any other matters relating to the school raised by the parents. Many meetings were very poorly attended and, despite adopting various innovative strategies to improve turnout, it still proved difficult, in many schools, to generate enthusiasm for attending the meetings. The new school profile will give parents a broader and deeper understanding of what a school is doing. The removal of the requirement to hold an annual parents' meeting allows governors to manage their own relationship and communications with parents, to better reflect local circumstances, this may include choosing to hold a meeting.</p>
	<p pid="c.2403W.2/2">Removing the requirement to hold an annual parents' meeting also reduced the burden of legislative requirements on school governing bodies, granting greater freedom for school leadership to concentrate on continued improvements in performance.</p>

	<p pid="c.2410W.5/1">Early intervention is central to our policies on services for families with disabled children including the Childcare Strategy, the National Service Framework and Every Child Matters. These documents are already in the public domain.</p>
	<p pid="c.2410W.5/2">Through the implementation of the 10-year childcare strategy, we have prioritised services to disabled children and their families. In particular, the early support programme sets out to improve the delivery of services for disabled children aged 0&ndash;3 years and their families. The early support programme was developed with the full involvement of parents and professionals and has produced resource materials demonstrating multi-agency work and effective practice. The work has been piloted with 45 pathfinder authorities and the approach and principles can be adopted by every local authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.2410W.5/3">The National Service Framework (NSF) for Children, Young People and Maternity Services sets national standards for the first time for children's health and social care (and their interface with education) which promote high quality, child-centred services and personalised care that meets the needs of children, young people and their families. Standard one of the framework is about promoting health and well-being, identifying needs and intervening early. It is being delivered by a range of practitioners including GPs, midwives, health visitors, dentists, early years workers, school nurses and teachers working together. It addresses the needs of children from pre-conception to adulthood and integrates pre-school and school aged health promotion and assessment.</p>
	<p pid="c.2410W.5/4">Within the Every Child Matters agenda, a key driver for early intervention at local level is effective multi-agency work through children's trust arrangements. This includes better information sharing, enhanced coordination at the front line around the needs of the users, and the more flexible use of budgets. Supporting this transition to earlier intervention will be an important theme in the forthcoming comprehensive spending review.</p>

	<p pid="c.2414W.5/1">My Department allocates funds for further education (FE) colleges to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) which is the planning and funding body for post-16 education and training in England. For FE the LSC distributes funds regionally and local offices allocate funds to providers based on locally agreed development plans. I can confirm that the LSC will fund these plans. This guarantee that college plans will be funded has been widely welcomed by the sector as ensuring stability and provides confidence that colleges can make commitments for the year based on assured funding levels. This guarantee means that those colleges recruiting above their agreed plans cannot expect to receive additional funding in the current year over and above the levels they have agreed with the LSC.</p>

	<p pid="c.2420W.5/4" class="indent">In sum, you asked how many individuals have been removed by Ofsted from the list of team inspectors in each of the last five years; and how many were reinstated.</p>
	<p pid="c.2420W.5/5" class="indent">In connection with inspections under Section 10 of the School Inspections Act 1996, team inspectors remained in the roll as long as they satisfied the conditions of their involvement: that they were fit and proper, competent and effective, to discharge the functions of the team inspector.</p>
	<p pid="c.2420W.5/6" class="indent">Team inspectors were also required to undertake mandatory training, as required by HMCI. Failure to complete such training resulted in team inspectors no longer being regarded as competent and effective and their removal from the roll. This explains the high 'removal' figures in 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 (non-completion of the mandatory training in evaluation of educational inclusion) and 2003&ndash;04 (non-completion of the mandatory training in the new framework for inspection).</p>
	<p pid="c.2420W.5/7" class="indent">Former team inspectors who were removed from the role for non-completion of the mandatory training were not excluded from re-applying to become a team inspector at a later stage. To do this, re-application through Ofsted's normal recruitment programme for training and assessment in inspection skills applied.</p>

	<p pid="c.2422W.0/1">There are no plans to make Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) statutory. The Government's focus is on improving the quality of PSHE teaching. Over the last three years we have funded the PSHE certificate, a continuing professional development programme which sets standards for the teaching of PSHE. Over 2,000 teachers have already gained certification and a further 1,800 teachers are undertaking the programme this year. We have also worked with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to produce new teaching and learning materials and assessment guidance for PSHE. We have also produced a DVD resource for teachers, &quot;PSHE into Practice&quot;, which will support teachers' professional development in PSHE.</p>
	<p pid="c.2422W.0/2">The Government normally responds to the annual report of the Independent Advisory Group on Teenage Pregnancy, which comments on and makes recommendations for the further development of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy. The yet unpublished report 'Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) in schools: Time for Action' is a separate, ad-hoc report. When it is published the Government will consider its recommendations, but does not intend to publish a formal response.</p>
	<p pid="c.2422W.0/3">All maintained schools, including those with a religious designation, are required to deliver the statutory elements of sex education, as set out in the National Curriculum Science Order, at primary and secondary levels. The DfES further recommends that all maintained schools use the PSHE framework to expand their provision and deliver a planned programme of SRE appropriate to the age, maturity and needs of pupils. This should be developed in consultation with the Governing Body and parents.</p>

	<p pid="c.2422W.3/1">The Secretary of State has had no recent discussions with Gloucestershire LEA on its reorganisation of primary education. Changes to school provision in an area are essentially matters for local decision. All local authorities have a statutory duty to ensure that there are sufficient places and that high quality education is provided in a cost effective way.</p>
	<p pid="c.2422W.3/2">The Secretary of State has provided statutory guidance on the process that must be adhered to when considering any reorganisation of school provision. We recognise the importance of rural schools to their local area which is why we introduced the presumption against their closure in 1998. Although this does not mean that no rural school will ever close, the case for closure needs to be strong and clearly in the best interests of education in the local area.</p>

We are taking this forward by improving teaching and learning across all school phases by:</p>
	<p pid="c.2426W.12/2" class="indent">introducing a newly structured A level, for first teaching from September 2004, making AS/A level mathematics more flexible and manageable;</p>

The new programme maintains the breadth, depth and challenge of the current curriculum, while catering for a wide range of young people's interests and aptitudes which will ensure that the science taught in schools inspires young people to pursue further study;</p>
	<p pid="c.2426W.12/4" class="indent">developing a new two tier mathematics GCSE so that all young people have the opportunity to achieve a grade C;</p>
	<p pid="c.2426W.12/5" class="indent">asking QCA to develop and test a new curriculum and assessment model for mathematics from entry level to level 3 which will incorporate changes resulting from work that QCA has been doing in response to recommendations in the Smith report;</p>
	<p pid="c.2426W.12/6" class="indent">renewing and updating the Primary National Strategy framework for the teaching of mathematics, to ensure that it supports schools and settings to raise attainment still further;</p>
	<p pid="c.2426W.12/7" class="indent">reviewing science and mathematics at key stage 3, especially in relation to the new science programme at key stage 4 and the review of the Primary National Strategy;</p>
	<p pid="c.2426W.12/8" class="indent">providing innovative and exciting continuing professional development for teachers and technicians through the national network of science learning centres;</p>
	<p pid="c.2426W.12/9" class="indent">establishing a National Centre for Excellence in the teaching of mathematics, that will develop a continuing professional development framework for mathematics teachers and quality assure mathematics continuing professional development programmes;</p>
	<p pid="c.2426W.12/10" class="indent">introducing, from September 2004, a framework for the teaching and learning of mathematics in post-16 education;</p>

	<p pid="c.2427W.2/1">The Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are jointly implementing the national school sport strategy in England. In the five years to 2008 over &pound;1.5 billion is being invested (including &pound;686 million lottery funding) to implement the strategy. Spearheading action is the creation of a national network of sports colleges and school sport partnerships across England. To date, 80 per cent. of schools in England are already part of one of the 411 live partnerships and all schools will be within one by 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.2427W.2/2">The strategy is delivering an ambitious public service agreement target to increase the percentage of 5 to 16-year-olds who spend a minimum of two hours a week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent. by 2006 and then 85 per cent. by 2008. The long-term ambition, by 2010, is to offer all children at least four hours of sport every week.</p>
	<p pid="c.2427W.2/3">Good progress is being made and we are on track to deliver the target. The 2004/05 school sport survey results found that overall, 69 per cent. of pupils in the 11,498 schools involved, were participating in at least two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week. In 2003/04 this figure was 62 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.2427W.2/4">Of course my hon. Friend would know that the issue of PE and sport in schools in Wales is a devolved matter.</p>

We have funded the voluntary sector to embed effective practice and offer training and support to schools, young people and their parents.

We have added that to our estimate of the universal, average cost pressures on schools in 2006&ndash;07 to give nursery and primary schools a guaranteed minimum increase in their core budgets of 4 per cent. per pupil next year. And we have earmarked &pound;70 million within the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) to enable local authorities to meet the cost of the higher guarantee for nursery and primary schools.

	<p pid="c.2434W.2/1">The Youth Green Paper &quot;Youth Matters&quot; sets out a number of broad areas of activity designed to encourage young people to volunteer and contribute to their community. It aims to test out more varied approaches to volunteering, in line with the Russell Commission's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="c.2434W.2/2">This includes, for example, expanding peer mentoring. The Chancellor has recently announced in his pre-Budget report a new investment aimed at introducing and evaluating more structured and formalised approaches to peer mentoring in schools. We will also be promoting more active citizenship approaches in schools, further and higher education and more volunteering in public services. We are building on the experience of Millennium Volunteers and the Young Volunteer Challenge to develop more flexible approaches to volunteering and to expand longer term volunteering opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="c.2445W.2/1">Specific information regarding low income for Great Britain is available in &quot;Households Below Average Income 1994/95&ndash;2003/04&quot;. The threshold of below 60 per cent. contemporary median income is the most commonly used in reporting trends in low income. Figures are provided for children based on distributions sourced from the Family Resources Survey using two definitions of net disposable income. One uses a concept before, and one after, housing costs have been deducted from household income. Housing costs include rent, mortgage interest payments, water rates or water charges, structural insurance, ground rent and service charges.</p>
	<p pid="c.2445W.2/2">However, poverty is about more than low income. It is also about health, education, housing and the quality of the environment. The seventh annual Opportunity for all report, published recently, sets out the Government's strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and presents information on the indicators used to measure progress against this.</p>
	<p pid="c.2445W.2/3">Housing is an important part of the Government's strategy on poverty and social exclusion. Opportunity for All monitors the proportion of children in non-decent homes, and also includes an indicator monitoring the proportion of families with children in temporary accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.2445W.2/4">The document 'Measuring child poverty' published in December 2003 outlines the Government's measure of UK child poverty for the long-term. This includes a material deprivation measure which will capture children in families with high unavoidable costs, such as housing costs or childcare, which can adversely impact on living standards and leave people with low disposable incomes. Because it incorporates a new&mdash;higher&mdash;relative income line it will count some children as in poverty for the first time. The quality of housing will be directly measured as part of the material deprivation indicators, and will include housing that is poorly repaired, overcrowded or cold.</p>

	<p pid="c.2446W.2/1">The Government's target, set in the 2002 Spending Review, is to reduce the number of children in low-income households by at least a quarter by 2004&ndash;05, as a contribution towards the broader target of halving child poverty by 2010 and eradicating it by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="c.2446W.2/2">As set out in Household Below Average Income (HBAI), between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04 (the latest data available) the number of children living in relative low-income households fell by 500,000 on a before housing costs basis and by 600,000 on an after housing costs basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.2446W.5/2">In addition, the Department provides support to individuals who suffer medical conditions, which may be affected by their working environment. Our Occupational Health Provider carries out full workplace assessments and adaptations (for example a special chair) are put in place as a result of recommendations they make. In order for this process to be streamlined, a pilot is currently under way involving all parties; Occupational Health, facilities managers, procurement and equipment suppliers, to put in place adaptations in the shortest possible time. The Department does not take a legalistic approach to the Disability Discrimination Act, in that, anyone identified as needing a workplace adaptation will be accommodated where it is reasonable to do so.</p>

	<p pid="c.2451W.9/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning what recent assessment has been undertaken of the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the advice given by jobcentres on the effect of household incomes of coming off the unemployment register and engaging in part time work. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.2451W.9/4" class="indent">I am not aware of any such assessment within the past year.</p>
	<p pid="c.2451W.9/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus advisors use a networked version of the Departmental Integrated Benefits Information System (IBIS) computer system to help them provide 'Better-off in work advice to customers. This IT tool provides a comprehensive calculation across the full range of income-based benefits and tax credits. The user either enters the amount of benefit known to be in payment, or lets the system calculate current entitlements based on the information provided by the customer. The system then allows a 'what if scenario to be entered to compare to the current position, and this will most typically involve a customer's prospective job details. Such events often involve a number of consequential changes such as the addition of travelling expenses and childcare and the IBIS system prompts for all of these to be considered and captured where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.2451W.9/6" class="indent">Once all of the additional information has been entered for the prospective change, the system performs another series of calculations to show estimated entitlements. It also performs a financial comparison between the current actual position and the (typically) in work estimate. This is known as the Better Off calculation and shows a customer exactly how much per week they will gain or loose by taking a particular job.</p>
	<p pid="c.2451W.9/7" class="indent">With regard to accuracy, we take this very seriously and regularly update the IBIS system in line with, for example, changes to benefit rates. When we have investigated cases where the advice may have appeared incorrect, we have generally found this to have been caused either by incorrect or incomplete information being supplied by the customer, or when circumstances have changed between the advice being given and, for example, the take up of a job.</p>

Jobcentre Plus has set up a new externally administered accreditation service which will capture comprehensive information on all contractors and their sub contractors, broken down by programme and by type of organisation e.g. private company, voluntary body etc. This new system should be largely complete by April 2006.</p>

It will not be possible to break down expenditure by category of provider until the new database is available from April 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.2455W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning how many claimants live more than 5 miles away from an integrated Jobcentre Plus customer facing office. This falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.2455W.2/4" class="indent">We do not hold information on the distance our customers have to travel to their nearest Jobcentre Plus office.</p>
	<p pid="c.2455W.2/5" class="indent">In planning the new network of Jobcentre Plus offices, local managers take into account many factors including population spread, availability and cost of public transport, and the distance between offices. We aim to locate our new offices where there are good transport links.</p>
	<p pid="c.2455W.2/6" class="indent">Inevitably as the office network changes, there will be some customers who will find they will have to travel further. Jobcentre Plus is actively working with local partners to ensure that these hard to reach communities have access to services. In many locations, particularly rural locations, we are often able to provide outreach facilities, ensuring access to job vacancies, advice and information through third party premises.</p>
	<p pid="c.2455W.2/7" class="indent">In practice this means that with our new network, very few of our customers would have to travel more than 5 miles to access Jobcentre Plus services, other than in the most remote rural areas. Customers are now using our offices differently. More of our face-to-face customer contact is on an appointment basis and information on job vacancies is readily available by telephone and Internet. This enables staff in our offices to focus on those customers in greatest need of support.</p>

These offices had not previously been assessed under the Mystery Shopper component of the target. There were training initiatives underway at the time to up skill the staff. This was against a background of reducing headcount and the continued rollout. The expected progress on rollout was not achieved in 2004/05, and therefore the target achievement level was not upgraded in 2005/06.</p>

	<p pid="c.2456W.8/1">The information is not available in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.2456W.8/2">Home responsibilities protection (HRP) reduces the number of qualifying years needed for a full basic state pension by up to half, so the precise number of years an individual requires will vary according to the number of years of HRP awarded. However, departmental administrative data indicates that if a full basic state pension were paid to those who have the equivalent of at least 10 qualifying years, approximately 85 per cent. of newly retired women in March 2005 might receive the full basic pension. This may overestimate the reduction in qualifying years needed for a particular proportion of newly retired women to receive a full BSP in their own right, due to the way in which HRP interacts with qualifying years.</p>
	<p pid="c.2456W.8/3">Women's basic state pension records are continuing to improve with the combined effect of increased labour market participation and HRP, so in the future a much more modest reduction in qualifying years might be needed to achieve the same outcome. We estimate on the basis of the current system that by 2025 men and women reaching age 65 will have similar basic state pension entitlements.</p>
	<p pid="c.2456W.8/4" class="indentitalic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="c.2456W.8/5">1. The answer is based on 2004&ndash;05 departmental administrative data which provides information about the amount of basic state pension (BSP) in payment. 2. The answer includes an approximation of the proportion of women at state pension age in March 2005 who made a late claim or deferred their state pension entitlement. 3. Currently women normally need 39 qualifying years for a full BSP and 10 qualifying years to get the minimum BSP, at least one year must derive from paid NICs. In 2020, when SPA for women is raised to age 65, the number of qualifying years for women will equalise with men, increasing to 44 for the full BSP and 11 qualifying years for the minimum BSP (which is 25 per cent. of the required qualifying years for a full BSP over a person's working life). The administrative data does not hold information on the entitlements of those who fail to qualify for the minimum BSP. 4. The figure is based on those women with the equivalent of 10 or more qualifying years. This includes women who have at least 10 qualifying years from paid Nl contributions, or a combination of contributions and Nl credits as well as women who have some home responsibilities protection HRP on their record. For example, a women with 19 years of HRP and 5 years of paid contributions is entitled to the same amount of BSP as a person with 10 years of paid contributions only. 5. The data set does not break down how the BSP is accrued (for example the number of years of paid contributions, credits or HRP). For this reason, the answer should be treated as approximate only. 6. The answer is based on women aged 60 in March 2005 resident in Great Britain.</p>

	<p pid="c.2468W.8/1">The incidental mortality of albatrosses and petrels in the waters of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI) is now virtually zero, following a very successful campaign to employ effective mitigating measures on fishing vessels.</p>
	<p pid="c.2468W.8/2">Penalties do exist under the SGSSI Fisheries (Conservation and Management) Ordinance 2000, as amended, and the Falkland Islands Dependencies Conservation Ordinance 1975. These include a maximum fine of &pound;250,000 for fishing vessels which breach fishing licence conditions, and a fine of &pound;150 for those who kill, wound, capture, molest or export any native bird (including albatrosses or petrels). The latter penalty will be increased as part of the current revision of South Georgia legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.2468W.8/3">Within the British Antarctic Territory, whose territorial sea lies within the Antarctic treaty area, penalties could only be imposed on UK nationals or those operating British-registered vessels. However, longlining vessels, which pose the greatest risk to albatrosses and petrels, are not permitted to fish in British Antarctic Territory waters. Penalties exist under the British Antarctic Territory Fauna and Flora (Conservation) Ordinance 1990. The maximum statutory penalty is &pound;5,000. There are no plans to change this figure.</p>

	<p pid="c.2469W.2/1">Albatrosses are protected under the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands Fisheries (Conservation and Management) Ordinance 2000 and the Falkland Islands Dependencies Conservation Ordinance 1975; various Conservation Measures of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and the Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP).</p>
	<p pid="c.2469W.2/2">The British Antarctic Survey are continuing with a long-term study of the breeding success of albatrosses at South Georgia. The birds are tracked by satellite to discover how they disperse at sea away from the Islands, and where they are at most risk of being killed by Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing outside South Georgia waters.</p>
	<p pid="c.2469W.2/3">The Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI) ensures long-term monitoring of populations around the Island, manages tourism in such a way as to protect the breeding birds, and works with CCAMLR and the fishing industry to protect albatross species at sea.</p>
	<p pid="c.2469W.2/4">Scientific observers are placed on all longline fishing vessels and most trawlers to develop mitigation methods and monitor their success. This has cost the GSGSSI an average of over &pound;500,000 per annum over the last three years. In addition, specific projects ashore that contribute to albatross protection have cost GSGSSI &pound;10,400 in 1999; &pound;42,167 in 2000; &pound;55,000 in 2001; &pound;39,946 in 2002; &pound;55,513 in 2003; &pound;83,575 in 2004, and are estimated to be &pound;100,000 in 2005. It is accepted by CCAMLR, Birdlife International and the IUCN (World Conservation Union) that incidental seabird deaths in the South Georgia fisheries are now negligible.</p>
	<p pid="c.2469W.2/5">There are no breeding albatrosses on any of the South Sandwich Islands. Their protection at sea is included in the work of GSGSSI as described.</p>
	<p pid="c.2469W.2/6">All Antarctic fauna are protected under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. This is enacted into UK legislation through the Antarctic Act 1994, which prohibits any interference with Antarctic fauna without a specific permit.</p>
	<p pid="c.2469W.2/7">The Government of the British Antarctic Territory has undertaken a number of environmental projects to reinforce the protection of vulnerable species in Antarctica. These have included the development of Antarctic Specially Managed and Protected Areas, under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. These projects were not, however, specific to albatross and petrel species.</p>

International co-operation is currently directed by existing legislation. However, these procedures have proved to be a barrier to providing effective assistance and as such there is no record of return of assets. The power of British authorities to seize assets will be strengthened when an Order in Council comes into force under the Proceeds of Crime Act (2002) in January 2006. The 2002 Act also provides for domestic action to be taken by way of civil recovery proceedings. I cannot comment on ongoing live cases and to date no assets have been returned.</p>

	<p pid="c.2472W.8/1">The Government of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI) encourages visits by tourist cruise vessels to South Georgia by attending the annual meeting of the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), by providing services to shipping, by supporting the South Georgia Museum Trust and by preserving the wildlife and environment that attracts tourists. There are no facilities for tourists in the South Sandwich Islands.</p>
	<p pid="c.2472W.8/2">The Antarctic Treaty, to which the UK is a Consultative Party, designates Antarctica as a continent for peace and science. While the Government considers sustainable tourism a legitimate activity in Antarctica, they do not promote tourism to the British Antarctic Territory.</p>
	<p pid="c.2472W.8/3">The GSGSSI takes very seriously its responsibilities in restricting the impact of tourism on wildlife in South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI). A strict permitting process is in place, and visits to the Islands require the permission of the Commissioner for SGSSI. No cruise ship may land passengers other than at Grytviken/King Edward Point without being a member of IAATO. All IAATO vessels follow the Antarctic Treaty Environmental Protocol guidelines while at GSSI. Expeditions to SGSSI are vetted by an independent panel of experts, which considers the potential impact on wildlife and the environment. The GSGSSI has banned the use of helicopters for the purpose of tourism, and any other flying is strictly regulated. The GSGSSI has closed many areas of South Georgia to tourists in order that wildlife should remain undisturbed.</p>
	<p pid="c.2472W.8/4">The UK has actively promoted measures to restrict the impact of tourism on Antarctic flora and fauna through the Antarctic Treaty System. These have included, for example, the development of Site Guidelines for visitors to key Antarctic tourism sites, and new requirements to ensure adequate insurance and search and rescue provision for Antarctic expeditions.</p>

	<p pid="c.2482W.5/1">The Government consider the promotion of Human Rights, Democracy and Good Governance as interdependent and mutually reinforcing. The Foreign and Commonwealth Offices's approach to this task has been to mainstream this work throughout relevant Global Opportunities Fund (GOF) programmes. This includes the Sustainable Development programme (formerly Human Rights, Democracy and Good Governance), which incorporates the grant in aid to the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, as well as the Reuniting Europe, Engaging with the Islamic World and Economic Governance (formerly Emerging Markets) programmes. The criteria for supporting projects for the promotion of democracy under GOF programmes are to strengthen political parties, parliaments, civil society and other institutions of democracy; support increased participation by the disenfranchised, especially women, ethnic minorities and the disabled, in accordance with principles of equality, diversity and non-discrimination; and to promote freedom of expression that underpins the exercise of democracy. On human rights, the GOF programmes seek to support projects that combat torture, the death penalty and promote child rights. We seek to promote good governance by supporting projects that enhance the rule of law, e.g. to enhance separation of powers, independent and professional judiciaries and legal services, access to justice and independent complaint mechanisms, such as ombudsmen.</p>

Some &pound;35 million was spent on UK Global Partnership nuclear projects in 2004&ndash;05 and forecast spend for 2005&ndash;06 is around &pound;37 million. Many of the projects we support under the UK Global Partnership Programme contribute to the enhanced security of nuclear materials, including through the retraining of former weapons scientists and engineers and the associated creation of sustainable employment in the closed nuclear cities. Projects include work to ensure the safe and secure storage of around 20,000 Spent Nuclear Fuel Assemblies from nuclear submarines at Andreeva Bay, work to enhance the physical protection of civilian nuclear institutes and the training of guard commanders at key Russian nuclear establishments. We are working closely with other donor countries to co-ordinate work on improving material security at a number of sites across Russia, to determine priorities and ensure sustainable improvements are made from our grant-aid. We believe that our growing portfolio of nuclear security projects will substantially enhance the security of materials stored at facilities in Russia. Project specifications are agreed with Government experts in the UK's Office of Civil and Nuclear Security and implementation of projects closely monitored by private sector project managers.</p>

	<p pid="c.2488W.2/1">Work has recently been completed on the clean-up of the former whaling station at Grytviken, which now presents no hazard to wildlife or to those who visit or work in this area of South Georgia. However, the South Georgia Government are aware that the derelict whaling stations at Stromness, Husvik and Leith Harbour present similar hazards to those previously present at Grytviken, largely in the form of asbestos, heavy fuel oil and collapsing buildings. There are no whaling stations in the South Sandwich Islands.</p>
	<p pid="c.2488W.2/2">No funds are currently available to the South Georgia Government to carry out the clean-up of these other whaling stations, although it is hoped that it will be possible to undertake some of this work (mostly on the clean-up of heavy fuel oils) in the event of an increase in income from the licensing of fishing around South Georgia. Meanwhile, signs have been erected around the former whaling stations at Stromness, Husvik and Leith Harbour warning visitors not to approach within 200 metres of them due to the hazards presented by the asbestos and dangerous structures.</p>
	<p pid="c.2488W.2/3">The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) undertook clean-up work at the site of a former UK base (and former Norwegian whaling station) at Deception Island, South Shetland Islands in 1992. This work included the removal of 500 drums of waste fuel and debris. A further 45 m <sup>3</sup> of waste, including asbestos and other hazards, was removed by BAS in April 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.2488W.2/4">The site has now been designated as Historic Site and Monument (HSM) No. 71 under the Antarctic treaty, and forms part of the Deception Island Antarctic specially managed area. A conservation strategy for HSM 71 allows for the ongoing clean-up of debris resulting from the gradual deterioration of the buildings and other structures.</p>

A draft law was under discussion in the previous Polish Parliament, prior to elections on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-25">25 September 2005</phrase>. The new Government will probably look at the issue anew, so it is unlikely that a new property restitution law will be agreed soon. It is possible to pursue claims through the Polish courts, but the British embassy in Warsaw does not have sufficient resources to assist individual cases. A list of English-speaking lawyers is, however, provided on request. We have lobbied the previous Polish Government to improve the law in the area of property restitution on behalf of all British citizens with claims, and we will do the same with the new Government.</p>

	<p pid="c.2491W.8/1">The overall security situation in Sierra Leone is generally calm, but fragile. We agree with the United Nations (UN) assessment that the situation is sufficiently improved to allow the full departure of the UN Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) by the end of 2005. There has been progress on improving the training, leadership and professionalism of the Sierra Leone army and police forces. A UK-led International Military Assistance and Training Team (IMATT) has aided much of this reform by close co-operation with the army, and will remain in Sierra Leone until at least 2010. They currently have approximately 100 personnel in country. We have also provided support to the police in a training and reform programme, which has left them better able to deal with internal security. Following the arrest of opposition leader Mr. Charles Margai, the police have so far dealt in a competent and low-key way with resulting public disturbances.</p>
	<p pid="c.2491W.8/2">Sierra Leonean institutions remain generally weak and lacking in capacity. Much has been achieved since the end of hostilities in 2002, but much work remains. An Anti-Corruption Commission is functioning well. A civil service reform programme is under way. Local councils exist, but lack capacity and resources. The judiciary is overstretched and under-resourced. Parliament lacks the necessary resources to allow it to exercise full powers of oversight. The UK is assisting in the development of democratic institutions, including assistance to the judiciary and police through a &pound;25 million project, assistance to the civil service reform programme and wide-ranging governance and anti-corruption support. But the 11 years of civil war have left enormous deficits in institutional capacity, which is slow to recover.</p>

	<p pid="c.2494W.0/1">We recognise the consequences that the reforms to the EU Sugar Regime agreed at the <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase> Agriculture Council may have on some African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) sugar producers with preferential access to the EU market. However, we welcome the overall agreement in the broader context of reforming the EU's Common Agricultural Policy and the benefits this will bring to many developing countries. Furthermore, the sugar reforms will see a smaller price cut and a longer adjustment period than originally proposed. This will give the ACP a better opportunity to adapt to the reforms.</p>
	<p pid="c.2494W.0/2">The EU will provide transitional assistance to help ACP producers improve their efficiency in the sugar sector where feasible or diversify into more profitable sectors. Ensuring that credible and timely transitional assistance is in place remains a priority for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.2494W.0/3">In September 2003, the Department for International Development (DfID) commissioned consultants (LMC International Ltd) to produce an independent report into the impact that EU sugar reform would have by 2015 on the ACP countries that are party to the Sugar Protocol. This work was updated in June 2005, after the Commission put forward its proposals but before agreement was reached on the shape of the reforms. It therefore assumes a 39 per cent. price cut rather than the actual 36 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.2494W.0/4">More recent assessments have been carried out by European Commission funded consultants, who again assumed a 39 per cent. price cut. For example, in Jamaica the consultants concluded that this would reduce the value of sugar export revenues from 6.9 per cent. of total exports to 4.9 per cent. and reduce GDP by 0.8 per cent. over four years.</p>
	<p pid="c.2494W.0/5">My noble Friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Parliamentary Under-secretary of State, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, discussed the impact of reform of the EU sugar regime on the Caribbean at a meeting in London in October with members of the Caribbean British Business Council, which represents British businesses with interests in the Caribbean. The subject was also discussed at the UK Caribbean Business Forum in London in June, which brought together Ministers and leading businessmen from the UK and the Caribbean.</p>
	<p pid="c.2494W.0/6">Currently, DFID is working with Caribbean countries affected by the reforms to help them draw up the country plans through which the EU's transitional assistance will be delivered.</p>

	<p pid="c.2494W.3/1">There have been some preliminary discussions about how to allocate transitional assistance for Africa Caribbean and Pacific countries to adjust to sugar reforms. The Commission have said that allocations will be based on the needs of each country, in particular on the impact of the reform on the sugar sector in the country concerned and on the relative importance of the sugar sector in the economy. The Caribbean countries involved are working to develop their country plans to determine how assistance could best be used. Given the impact that sugar reform will have on some of the Caribbean countries involved, they should be well placed to qualify for their fair share of assistance under the criteria the Commission are developing.</p>

Officials have, for example, recently been in touch with their counterparts in Argentina to explore their latest plans to ratify the Protocol. The Government's view is that we need to encourage more countries to ratify the Protocol, especially major agricultural exporters, such as the United States, Canada and Argentina. If agricultural exporters fail to sign up to the Protocol, the global status of GM products approved in those countries that have not signed the Protocol will be uncertain, and confidence in the safety of the products of new biotechnology will suffer.</p>

	<p pid="c.2503W.5/1">DFID has funded a range of charities and UN agencies supporting the rehabilitation of child soldiers in Africa over the last five years. In Sierra Leone all child combatants were disarmed as part of the extensive Disarmament Demobilisation and Re-integration (DDR) process undertaken at the end of the war. DFID provided &pound;12.4 million in support of this programme. DFID recognises the problems faced by former child combatants in re-integrating back into their communities and we have previously provided funding to support skills training and other activities for child ex-combatants. DFID has in the past, provided core funding to the Office of the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict (OSRSG/CAAC) whose programme has included advocacy work using ex-child combatants. More broadly across Africa as a whole we have funded the following organisations:</p>

	<p pid="c.2504W.2/1">The Commission for Africa (CfA) was established in February 2004 and provided an opportunity to take a fresh look at Africa's past and present and the international community's role, and agree recommendations on the future. When the Prime Minister launched the CfA report on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase>, he committed to reflecting its recommendations in policy, and since then many of the recommendations have been reflected in commitments made by the G8 at Gleneagles and by the UN at the Millennium Review summit.</p>
	<p pid="c.2504W.2/2">The G8 recognised the importance of a successful outcome to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Doha Development Agenda (DDA) to generate growth and create the conditions for development. The WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong represents an important opportunity to deliver real gains for developing countries. The UK Government are working to ensure that there is appropriate flexibility in the DDA negotiations to allow poor countries to decide, plan and sequence their economic reforms in line with their national programmes and priorities for development.</p>
	<p pid="c.2504W.2/3">Developing countries should not be forced to open up their markets, either through trade negotiations, whether bilateral, multilateral or otherwise, or through aid conditionality, but should be allowed to choose the best policies for poor people and the environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.2504W.2/4">Trade justice also requires a stronger link between trade and development. Many developing countries cannot take advantage of new trade opportunities resulting from more open markets because of significant human, institutional and infrastructural constraints. The UK is supporting a number of initiatives recommended by the CfA report which will help countries to overcome these constraints. The Department for International Development has committed to increase Aid For Trade to &pound;100 million by 2010; has pledged $20 million to the Africa Infrastructure Consortium, to facilitate more effective infrastructure investments to promote economic growth and trade; and has committed $30 million over three years to the Investment Climate Facility, of which one area of focus will be to improve the efficiency of customs administrations across Africa.</p>
	<p pid="c.2504W.2/5">The G8 endorsed commitments to increase funding for trade related capacity building. The UK continues to support this, providing assistance to African Governments and sub-regional institutions to develop and negotiate trade policy, for example with regards to WTO or EU Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA).</p>

If DFID remains dissatisfied, payment of received invoices is withheld and if necessary the contract would be terminated. Over the last three years, approximately five payments have been withheld. DFID has sole rights of termination which we have exercised on two occasions due to poor performance since 2000. DFID may also require the replacement, at no extra cost, of non-performing team members. If problems occur remedial action is usually satisfactory.</p>

	<p pid="c.2506W.2/1">I remain very concerned about the situation in Darfur,, When I visited Sudan in June 2005 I held detailed discussions with members of the Sudanese Government, including Vice President Taha and the then Minister for Humanitarian Affairs as well as representatives from the African Union and NGOs. Most recently, I discussed Darfur with the presidential adviser, Bona Malwal, in London on <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.2506W.2/2">In his latest report, the UN Secretary General notes that while there have been fewer attacks between the parties, the security situation remains very poor. Banditry and lawlessness are rife, and continue to hamper the delivery of humanitarian supplies, particularly in South and West Darfur. We have made clear that this violence, and particularly attacks on humanitarian workers, are entirely unacceptable. We are encouraging anyone with information on the perpetrators to pass it to the relevant bodies for consideration under United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1591 and 1593.</p>
	<p pid="c.2506W.2/3">We continue to press the parties to rein in their fighters and to reach a political agreement. The seventh round of Darfur peace talks began in Abuja on <phrase class="date" code="">29 November</phrase>.

	<p pid="c.2506W.5/1">The World Bank's financial support to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is provided in accordance with the Bank's fiduciary standards. Funds given to the Government of the DRC as budget support are clearly registered as such in the budget and will have a specific budget line if they are for a particular programme or activity. Tracking and monitoring of the funds is done through the DRC's Public Expenditure Management Reform programme, which includes the requirement to publish monthly execution reports. There is specific reporting on the use of external contributions to the budget (e.g. World Bank budget support and Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) funds) and on areas such as health and education components to particularly track expenditures in these priority sectors.</p>
	<p pid="c.2506W.5/2">The World Bank is working with the Government of the DRC to improve overall public financial management, for example through promoting the implementation of a fully computerised public accounting system complying with international standards, strengthening the role and capacity of government financial control institutions and reforming the public financial management education programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.2506W.5/3">The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are also working with the Government to improve the composition and efficiency of spending, in particular on health, education and rural development services that benefit the poor, to ensure that the authorities are able to spend increased resources (including from debt relief) efficiently and effectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.2506W.5/4">DFID's office in Kinshasa works closely with the World Bank in promoting development and poverty reduction in the DRC. We monitor the reports from the World Bank on expenditure tracking and we also monitor progress on improvements in public expenditure management through discussions with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). We also use the UK's seat on the World Bank board in Washington to stay actively involved with the composition and performance of the World Bank's portfolio in the DRC.</p>

	<p pid="c.2507W.2/1">The exploitation of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)'s forests has the potential to generate significant benefits for the country's people. But forestry resources need to be managed in a transparent and environmentally sustainable way, which both generates revenues and promotes the rights and livelihoods of forest dwellers. The UK is advocating this balanced approach to forest management in its engagement with all partners working on the issue in the DRC.</p>
	<p pid="c.2507W.2/2">The World Bank provided support for development of the new DRC forestry code. The code is based on a forest classification system, which will delineate areas for commercial exploitation and community forestry. The code also provides for rights of access for traditional users, the transparent auctioning of forest concessions and the decentralised allocation of revenues.</p>
	<p pid="c.2507W.2/3">Donors (led by the World Bank and the EC) are now discussing how best to support the implementation of the code. A multi-donor trust fund is planned. At the same time, and in recognition of the lack of implementation capacity on the ground, the World Bank is stressing the need to curb illegal and unsustainable exploitation. Two conditions; the continuation of the moratorium on the granting of new forestry concessions and a legal review of existing concessions, were attached to the most recent tranche of World Bank budget support. DFID supports this approach.</p>
	<p pid="c.2507W.2/4">Progress in the forest sector has also been discussed with our EU partners under the UK's presidency of the EU in the DRC.</p>

	<p pid="c.2508W.0/1">Salaries for soldiers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC's) armed forces come from the DRC's national budget, not from donor funds. The UK has been active, however, in urging the Government of the DRC to ensure that its soldiers receive their salaries. A properly integrated, paid and trained national army is essential for consolidating peace and security in the DRC and the whole Great Lakes region. At present, soldiers rarely receive their salaries, creating insecurity for all as they prey on civilians to make ends meet.</p>
	<p pid="c.2508W.0/2">While in the in DRC in November, I advised President Kabila that the UK (through the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool) would support the basic needs (sanitation and accommodation) of soldiers in newly integrated brigades. However, this support is conditional on the DRC Government ensuring that soldiers are properly paid, including through implementing the recommendations of the EU's advisory mission on Security Sector Reform (SSR). One of the key strands of this work is a project to reform the army pay system. It will see advisers seconded to each integrated brigade to oversee payment of the soldiers' salaries and to help ensure that the DRC's own money reaches the people it was destined for and is not diverted by corrupt senior officers. We expect the Government of the DRC to approve the report's recommendations shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.2508W.3/1">The UK is concerned by the limited progress made by the demobilisation process in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Progress is slow because too few soldiers associated with the different &quot;composants&quot; of the transitional government are being encouraged and facilitated to enter the process. The UK, with the rest of the International Community, continues to press the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo to accelerate its efforts in the implementation of the demobilisation and re-integration process. I personally urged President Kabila and other members of the transitional government to step up army integration and demobilisation of soldiers during my recent visit to Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
	<p pid="c.2508W.3/2">The International Committee Accompanying the Transition process in the DRC (CIAT)&mdash;in which the UK is a very active member) has repeatedly pushed the Congolese transitional government for more progress in this area. The CIAT released a very strong statement in early December urging the Government of the DRC to speed up both the integration of the army and demobilisation of ex-combatants. The international community, including the UK, are providing substantial direct support to the demobilisation process. The UK is putting $25 million over 5 years into the World Bank's Multi-Country Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme (MDRP), covering nine countries including the DRC.</p>

	<p pid="c.2513W.11/1">In 2005, AIDS has been a centrepiece of the UK's Presidencies of the G8 and EU. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-09">9 March 2005</phrase>, with the Joint United Nations Programme for HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS), France and the United States of America, the UK, through DFID, co-hosted the &quot;Making the Money Work&quot; event in London to translate the Three Ones harmonisation principles into action. The Global Task Team established at this meeting has made significant time bound recommendations for improving the coordination and quality of international support for national-led responses to the epidemic. DFID is working in country and through the relevant UN boards to ensure the recommendations of the Global Task Team are put into practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.2513W.11/2">Following the commitments made at the G8 Summit in July and Millennium Review Summit in September to scale up towards universal access, DFID will co-chair the Global Steering Committee with UNAIDS, established to take forward the commitments made at the summits to support countries in establishing more ambitious comprehensive country-led responses to AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="c.2513W.11/3">At the UK-hosted Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria Replenishment Conference in September, the UK doubled its funding to the Global Fund from &pound;51 million for 2006 and &pound;51 million in 2007, to &pound;100 million for 2006 and &pound;100 million for 2007. Our contribution amounted to some 10 per cent. of the total US$3.7 billion pledged. Overall, the UK has pledged &pound;359 million (US$640 million) to the Global Fund over 7 years (2002&ndash;08). We have also doubled our contribution to UNAIDS from &pound;8 million to &pound;16 million for this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.2513W.11/4">To take forward the HIV and AIDS situation in developing countries, DFID Ministers hold regular discussions with heads of the relevant United Nations Agencies (in particular, UNAIDS). I have recently met with Anne Veneman, the head of the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), Peter Piot, head of UNAIDS, and Thoraya Obaid, head of United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), where we discussed current HIV and AIDS issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.2513W.11/5">At the United Nations General Assembly Special Session in June 2006, to review the global progress against the Declaration of Commitment which member states signed up to in 2001, DFID will be actively be involved in preparation for this session through dialogue with our EU partners and UN agencies.</p>

	<p pid="c.2514W.2/1">DFID is the second largest bilateral donor to Kenya. In 2004&ndash;05, DFID spent &pound;39 million. This year we will spend &pound;50 million. Our primary aim is to support the implementation of the Government of Kenya's Economic Recovery Strategy. Our focus is on supporting accountable service delivery, stimulating pro-poor growth, tackling HIV/AIDS and working to improve donor effectiveness. Around 75 per cent. of our spending supports the health and education sectors. Kenya is making excellent progress towards the education Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</p>
	<p pid="c.2514W.2/2">DFID's support, with others will assist with the construction of 11,880 new or refurbished classrooms by 2010, plus more education materials to each one of the 18,500 primary schools in Kenya. In health, it is estimated that the doubling of DFID's support to &pound;47 million will deliver 11 million insecticide treated bed nets, saving 167,000 children's lives, and reducing under-five mortality in Kenya by at least 15 per cent. We are also supporting the Government of Kenya to develop a wider strategy for health care and to tackle HIV/AIDS, another area where Kenya is making significant progress where prevalence has fallen from around 11 per cent. to 6 per cent. in five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.2514W.2/3">DFID supports other areas of work including land and agricultural reform, private sector development, public financial management, improved statistics, and support to governance, justice and law and order. DFID worked with the Government of Kenya to help produce a credible anti-corruption action plan. Against this, they have already passed Procurement and Privatisation Bills, fully staffed the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission, and have developed a code of ethics for Ministers. While the fight against corruption will be hard, these measures should begin to reduce the opportunities for grand corruption; but leadership in this fight remains equivocal and no senior Ministers have yet been asked to take responsibility for corrupt deals. DFID will continue to work with the key anti-corruption institutions, civil society, and the private sector, to continue the pressure in the fight against corruption while, at the same time, helping to deliver benefits to poor people.</p>

	<p pid="c.2520W.0/1">The UK Government deplores the use of child soldiers. Child abduction is the rebel Lord's Resistance Army's (LRA) principle recruitment method. Although a recent World Health Organisation Survey in parts of northern Uganda indicated a significant decline in LRA abduction rates in 2005, the problem remains serious. Large numbers of children are forced to commute into town centres at night to avoid abduction by the LRA. We are helping UNICEF provide safe shelters in which these children can sleep. We are also helping UNICEF re-integrate child soldiers that escape or are rescued from the LRA through counselling, help with tracing families and specific initiatives to deal with the social challenges of re-integration.</p>
	<p pid="c.2520W.0/2">We remain concerned about continued reports of a small number of under age recruits in the Ugandan army. Uganda has ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which prohibits recruitment into the armed forces under the age of 18. The Government of Uganda works with agencies such as UNICEF to ensure underage recruits are identified and demobilised. UK officials in Kampala continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

	<p pid="c.2524W.0/1">The Office of Communications (Ofcom) advised DCMS officials that the regulator had on <phrase class="date" code="">25 October</phrase> received a report from Arquiva, the network operator responsible for transmission of Channel 5 television services in the UK, regarding interference to the Telstar 12 satellite service.</p>
	<p pid="c.2524W.0/2">The Telstar 12 satellite provides programme feeder links for Channel 5 television broadcasts. Interference to the satellite, which is understood to have originated from a transmitter based in Libya, caused intermittent disruption to Channel 5 services within the UK over a period of approximately two weeks during October. DCMS officials advised FCO officials of the problem. The matter was taken up by FCO officials through the appropriate channels in Libya.</p>
	<p pid="c.2524W.0/3">Interference has now ceased and there have been no further reports of interruption to Channel 5 or other UK television broadcast stations. DCMS officials nevertheless remain in touch with Ofcom and FCO officials to monitor the situation and will take appropriate steps should there be a re-occurrence of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="c.2524W.0/4">Neither Ofcom nor DCMS officials have received reports of interference to the Hotbird satellite.</p>

Similarly, there is nothing to stop a councillor speaking at a hearing on behalf of other interested parties who have made relevant representations, provided that they have asked him to do so and have notified the licensing authority, as required by the Licensing Act 2003 (Hearings) Regulations 2005.</p>

	<p pid="c.2533W.0/4">Of course, it would be expected that any councillor who is also a member of the licensing committee and who is making a representation as an interested party, or on behalf of another interested party, would disqualify themselves from any involvement in the decision-making process affecting the premises in question.</p>

	<p pid="c.2533W.3/1">Feedback from licensing authorities indicates that around 190,000 applications have been made for premises licences or club premises certificates under the Licensing Act 2003. Of these, we estimate that about 75 per cent. (142,500) were applications made before <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-06">6 August 2005</phrase> to convert and/or vary licences under the old regime and would have been automatically deemed granted or refused if not processed after two months.</p>
	<p pid="c.2533W.3/2">Applications that have subsequently been made will usually be processed in about a month if there are no representations, or about two months if there are representations and hearings, although the precise position will vary between local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.2533W.3/3">We believe the vast majority of applications have been processed and, while not all licences have actually been issued, we are confident that licensing authorities have made it clear to licensees the terms under which they can trade. We intend to conduct a formal data gathering exercise in the new year in order to publish comprehensive information about the number of licences granted.</p>
	<p pid="c.2533W.3/4">We have no information on the number of premises that are found to be trading without a licence, but we estimate that 98 per cent. of premises that would require a licence had applied before the new regime came into effect. Enforcement of the licensing regime is a matter for licensing authorities and authorised persons, such as the police.</p>
	<p pid="c.2533W.3/5">We do not hold specific information for the Wellingborough and East Northamptonshire areas.</p>

The Government is committed to ensuring that juries reflect the full diversity of the communities they serve. The Electoral Administration Bill currently before Parliament includes provisions aimed at improving both the quality and the coverage of the electoral register.

	<p pid="c.2551W.12/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.2551W.12/2">It is not the role of Government to issue guidelines on sentencing. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 set up the Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC), an independent body chaired by the Lord Chief Justice, which is tasked with framing guidelines on sentencing. One of the factors to which the council must have regard when framing its guidelines is the need to promote a consistency of approach in sentencing. When sentencing an offender, courts must have regard to any guidelines which are relevant to the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.2551W.12/3">The SGC has to date issued guidelines on Reduction in Sentence for a Guilty Plea, Overarching Principles: Seriousness, New Sentences: Criminal Justice Act 2003 and, most recently, Manslaughter by Reason of Provocation.</p>

In particular, the outturn data for 1996&ndash;97 to 2002&ndash;03 have been calculated on a non-FRS (Financial Reporting Standard) 17 basis whilst the outturn data for 2003&ndash;04 have been calculated on an FRS 17 basis. The budget data for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 are a mix of FRS 17 and non-FRS 17. This is because for their 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 budget forms local authorities, after consultation, were given the option to complete their forms either on a non-FRS 17 basis or on an FRS 17 basis. Hence, figures for different years may not be directly comparable.</p>

	<p pid="c.2561W.2/3">Local government funding allocations for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 are currently being consulted upon. This years assessment takes account of population projections as this allows the 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 settlements to be more forward looking. Previously settlements have been based on the latest available mid-year estimates as the dominant drivers. This change should provide more support for areas experiencing rapid population growth. The population projections are prepared by the Office for National Statistics using a trend-based methodology which projects forward the population (using 2003 mid-year population estimates as the starting point) into the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.2561W.2/4">ODPM spending decisions for 2008&ndash;09 onwards are subject to future Spending Reviews. In its December 2005 response to Kate Barker's Review of Housing Supply, the Government announced that as part of the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review it would undertake a cross-cutting review to:</p>
	<p pid="c.2561W.2/5" class="indent">&quot;determine the social, transport and environmental infrastructure implications of housing growth in different spatial forms and locations;</p>
	<p pid="c.2561W.2/6" class="indent">establish a framework for sustainable and cost-effective patterns of growth, including by examining the use of targeted investment through the Community Infrastructure Fund and Growth Areas funding to support the fastest-growing areas; and</p>
	<p pid="c.2561W.2/7" class="indent">ensure that departmental resources across government are targeted appropriately for providing the national, regional and local infrastructure necessary to support future housing and population growth.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.2561W.2/8">The cross-cutting review provides an opportunity for evidence of the funding needs experienced by Growth Areas as a result of rapid housing growth to be taken into account in future spending decisions of ODPM and other Departments.</p>

	<p pid="c.2571W.2/2">Hampshire exhibits high levels of housing demand for a wide range of housing including, shared equity and social housing. Average house prices in Hampshire have risen by 249 per cent. over the period 1997&ndash;2005, and projected household growth across the South East is substantially higher than the current building rates. Individual local authorities have undertaken local housing needs assessments covering households unable to buy or rent in the open market, which demonstrates high levels of need for affordable housing.</p>

	<p pid="c.2577W.2/2">Local authorities are required to have strategies in place for ensuring that accommodation and support are available for people who become homeless or are at risk of homelessness. In areas with significant rough sleeping problems there are more detailed plans and arrangements for additional provision in severe weather. Usual practice is that such additional provision should be triggered by a Met Office forecast of zero degrees Celsius or lower for three consecutive nights.</p>

	<p pid="c.2577W.5/1">Government policy is to seek to reduce the reliance on the private car by promoting alternative forms of transport, such as public transport, walking and cycling. Planning guidance is given in Planning Policy Guidance Note (PPG) 13 &quot;Transport&quot;. This says &quot;walking is the most important mode of travel at the local level and offers the greatest potential to replace short car trips&quot;. Local authorities should consider walking within their local transport plans, which in turn inform local development frameworks (LDF). With reference to town centres, &quot;Planning for Town Centres, Guidance on Design and Implementation tools&quot;, which accompanies Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 6 &quot;Planning for town centres&quot;, states that local authorities should seek to improve the quality, convenience and safety of access on foot, by bicycle and public transport. It advises that further guidance is given in &quot;Walking and Cycling Action Plan&quot; (DfT, TINF391).</p>
	<p pid="c.2577W.5/2">There is no national assessment of the planning implications of the promotion of walking but PPS1 &quot;Delivering Sustainable Development&quot; makes it clear that planning authorities should ensure their plans and policies are properly based on analysis and evidence.</p>

	<p pid="c.2578W.3/4" class="indent">Current work on the A26 at Ballynaloob between Ballymena and Ballymoney involves the construction of a &quot;2+1&quot; carriageway to create a safe overtaking opportunity for Ballymoney bound traffic, starting at Dunloy crossroads and continuing for some 1.6 kilometres towards Ballymoney. This is part of our programme to improve overtaking opportunities on single carriageways by widening of stretches to provide two lanes of traffic in one direction and one lane in the other.</p>
	<p pid="c.2578W.3/5" class="indent">An adjacent scheme to improve the Dunloy crossroads is being constructed at the same time. This is being undertaken in light of the poor safety record at the existing junction.</p>
	<p pid="c.2578W.3/6" class="indent">It is proposed to open the A26 at Ballynaloob to two-way traffic by <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-23">23 December 2005</phrase>. However, finishing-off works including hedge and tree planting will continue for a few months after Christmas but most of this will be undertaken without the need for a diversion. The total cost for both schemes is expected to be &pound;3.3 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.2616W.5/2">The Department has taken a range of steps to promote the benefits of the new contracts to dentists. The acting chief dental officer and other professional dental officers have attended a large number of local meetings with dentists to discuss the reforms. The reforms are designed to make the NHS a more attractive place for dentists to work by removing the 'treadmill' effect caused by the current fee-per-item system of remuneration, providing a guaranteed annual NHS income with earnings guaranteed for three years at the level of dentists' current NHS commitment, reducing the number of courses of treatment expected over a 12-month period by 5 per cent. for general dental services dentists, and freeing up time to allow a more preventative approach to dental care. Dentists will also continue to benefit from access to the NHS pension scheme.</p>

The pilots are being comprehensively evaluated by a consortium of academic research teams in order to provide Ministers with evidence to inform national roll out.</p>
	<p pid="c.2620W.8/10">At least three of the 13 pilots will include a focus on young people undergoing transition into adulthood.

	<p pid="c.2625W.0/2">With the introduction of the new primary medical services arrangements in 2004, primary care trusts now have a range of flexibilities over what services they commission and from whom in order to better meet the needs of patients locally. Common requirements and safeguards apply to all providers of primary care to ensure minimum standards are met and encourage high quality care.</p>

	<p pid="c.2625W.3/1">It is the responsibility of primary care trusts (PCTs) to assess and make provision for the healthcare needs of their local communities. PCTs have the resources to commission services and identify the number of professional staff that they need to deliver those services.</p>
	<p pid="c.2625W.3/2">A range of recruitment and retention initiatives are in place to help expand the national health service workforce across England. These include improving pay and conditions, encouraging the NHS to become a better, more flexible and diverse employer, help with accessing child care, increasing training, attracting back returners and running national and international recruitment campaigns. More recently, the new primary care development scheme will allow local employers to use funding for innovative approaches to boost recruitment to local primary care services.</p>
	<p pid="c.2625W.3/3">As a result of these measures, the primary care workforce has expanded. Between September 1997 and June 2005, the number of general practitioners, excluding retainers and registrars, employed by the NHS has increased by 4,372 (15.6 per cent.) and between September 1997 and September 2004 the primary care nursing workforce has increased by 25,115 (32.5 per cent.).</p>

	<p pid="c.2631W.2/1">The independently managed mobile telecommunications and health research (MTHR) programme, jointly funded by Government and industry, has supported about 30 individual studies to investigate the potential health effects of radiofrequency (RF) exposures from mobile phone technology. The programme has commissioned a study of cancer incidence in pre-school children living near mobile phone base stations compared with those living further away. Infants and young children are more likely to be home-based and this is the reason why the MTHR childhood cancer study has, to date, been the only scientifically viable option for epidemiology around base stations. Studies of older children and adults have not been recommended because proximity to base stations has been shown to be a poor representation of exposure to RF fields. The MTHR studies concentrate largely on the exposures from the mobile phone handsets because these exposures are considerably higher than those from base stations. A description of the programme and the individual studies can be found on its web site <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.2631W.2/2">The report entitled Mobile Phones and Health 2004 published by the National Radiological Protection Board (now the Radiation Protection Division of the Health Protection Agency, HPA) noted that there are continuing concerns about the impact of base stations on health and well-being</p>

	<p pid="c.2631W.2/4">This report is published as Documents of the NRPB, Vol 15, No 5 and can be found on the HPA's website at: <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation</a>. The report recommended</p>

	<p pid="c.2633W.8/1">Ministers have given the go-ahead for all 28 strategic health authorities (SHAs) to begin local consultations on boundary changes to SHAs and primary care trusts. Consultations will start on <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase> for a period of 14 weeks (until <phrase class="date" code="">22 March</phrase>). No decisions on boundary changes will be taken until these local consultations have been completed and their outcomes considered by Secretary of State.

	<p pid="c.2634W.5/1">A major public information campaign will be launched in 2006. Its purpose will be to advise patients and the wider public about the implications of the NHS Care Records Service (NHS CRS) for the way in which information about them is held and used. The campaign will provide the information people need to make choices about sharing and accessing their health information. This will cover controls on access by health professionals; how access will be monitored and policed; options people have to further limit access; access in an emergency; and what happens when someone is not able to make decisions for themselves.</p>
	<p pid="c.2634W.5/2">We intend to provide front-line national health service staff, including the Patient Advice and Liaison Service and NHS Direct, and also key voluntary sector organisations, with briefing materials and web resources to enable them to answer questions. In addition, a simple explanatory leaflet will be sent to every household in England, available in a range of formats and languages, with an easy-read version for people with learning disabilities and limited literacy.</p>
	<p pid="c.2634W.5/3">Other planned initiatives include a series of roadshows to give information face to face and to act as a focus for local publicity, and a short video/DVD to be played in waiting rooms at NHS sites, backed by posters and leaflets.</p>
	<p pid="c.2634W.5/4">Preparatory work to inform front-line NHS staff about the NHS CRS has already begun. Some one million leaflets have been distributed, along with posters and DVDs.</p>
	<p pid="c.2634W.5/5">Final details of timing and phasing of the campaign have yet to be determined, but the main period of activity is expected to be in mid 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.2640W.0/1">Information on the cost of missed general practice appointments is not collected or held centrally. However, there is evidence from the work of the National Primary Care Development Team that better management of patient access arrangements, including the use of telephone technology can reduce the incidence. More than 5,000 practices, some 60 per cent. of the total, have taken part in the team's Advanced Access programme. Information on savings made by hospitals using text messaging reminder systems is similarly not collected or held centrally. However, the Department is currently undertaking a strategic review of assistive technology, including text messaging reminder and remote monitoring systems, which will inform the forthcoming White Paper.</p>

In addition, NHS employers have extended the NHS jobs service from December, which will enable physiotherapy graduates to register their details and be automatically alerted to NHS vacancies.</p>

	<p pid="c.2645W.5/2">Under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970, the Secretary of State may issue guidance to local authorities on how they carry out their social services functions and LAs are required to act in accordance with such guidance, unless they have good reason for departing from it but without freedom to take a substantially different course. The latest guidance is contained in local authority circular LAC(2004)20, which is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.2645W.5/3">Under that guidance, LAs should set the amount they would usually expect to pay for accommodation having regard to assessed care needs-the 'usual cost'. This cost should be set by LAs at the start of a financial or other planning period, or in response to significant changes in the cost of providing care, to be sufficient to meet the assessed care needs of supported residents in residential accommodation. LAs should set more than one usual cost where the cost of providing residential accommodation to specific groups is different. When placing people in residential care, councils are not required to pay more than they would usually pay, having regard to the usual cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.2649W.0/6">Funding for licensed treatments should not be withheld because guidance from NICE is unavailable. In these circumstances, we expect primary care trusts to take full account of available evidence when reaching funding decisions.

Hence there is no RNI for people aged between four and 64-years-old, other than for pregnant and lactating women; it is considered that most people will get the vitamin D they need from exposure to sunlight, which aids synthesis of vitamin D in the skin.</p>
