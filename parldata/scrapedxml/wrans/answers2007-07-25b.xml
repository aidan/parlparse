	<p pid="b.1067W.6/2">Network Rail is a private sector company whose activities are governed by the regulatory regime and general law. The independent Office of Rail Regulation regulates and monitors the disposal of Network Rail's land.</p>

As at June 2007 there were over 700 sites on the register.

	<p pid="b.1068W.5/2">In financial year 2006-07, we allocated &pound;1.6 million to raise awareness of the dangers and changes in penalties for using a mobile phone while driving.

There was also an enforcement element to the campaign which was supported by the work of the police.</p>

	<p pid="b.1069W.8/1">The effect on the structural and surface conditions of a road as a result of an increase in heavy goods traffic is dependent on the prior condition of the road. A detailed survey of a particular road would be necessary to establish the prior structural and surface conditions in order to assess the impact of future traffic. However, motorways in England are well built and typically a busy motorway carries 20,000 heavy goods vehicles per day. A doubling of this flow is likely to have a significant effect on the structural and surface conditions. On the A class roads, the type of construction and the structural and surface conditions are extremely variable. It is not possible to produce a similar estimate.</p>

The priority following operations is to clear unexploded ordnance in order to provide freedom of movement for our forces and conduct the highest priority clearance operations that threaten civilian lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1078W.3/3">We recognise that Explosive Remnants of War, caused by unexploded ordnance, including cluster munitions, are a humanitarian problem. That is why the UK has played an active role at the UN in creating a new legally binding protocol containing a number of new legally binding provisions that will provide significant humanitarian benefit to those civilians in areas affected by Explosive Remnants of War. We are urging all states to sign and ratify this protocol as soon as possible. We are in the process of ratifying this and the MOD is in the process of implementing its provisions. The universal implementation of this will drive a significant reduction in the post-conflict effects of Explosive Remnants of War.</p>

	<p pid="b.1080W.5/1">Data from the Energy Saving Trust indicates that sales of domestic air conditioners increased from 32,800 in 2005-06 to 72,300 in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1080W.5/2">In 2005-06, about 73 per cent. of the units sold were &quot;B&quot; rated under the EU Council directive 92/75/EEC, and only 0.85 per cent. were &quot;A&quot; rated. In 2006-07, the share of &quot;A&quot; rated air conditioning appliances had increased to 15 per cent., and the share of &quot;B&quot; rated appliances dropped to 50 per cent. However, a small number of new air conditioners, which also act as heaters, have appeared on the market. These are less efficient.</p>
	<p pid="b.1080W.5/3">A domestic &quot;A&quot; rated air conditioner is expected to use around 320 kWh/year of electricity. For comparison, a three bed-roomed semi-detached house built to 2005 Building Regulations and without electric heating, is expected to use around 4,250 kWh/year of electricity. The purchase of an &quot;A&quot; rated air conditioner, and its associated energy consumption would therefore result in additional carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of around 138 kgCO2 /year. The 72,300 domestic air conditioners purchased in 2006-07 would therefore be expected to increase CO2 emissions by at least 9,900 tonnes CO2 per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1080W.5/4">Domestic air-conditioning equipment is also likely to use fluorinated greenhouse gases as the refrigerant. If this is emitted it will contribute towards global warming. Under the EC Regulation No 842/2006 on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases, users of air-conditioning equipment must ensure that any detected leakage is repaired as soon as possible. More complex domestic equipment will need to be installed by a qualified person once further European Commission proposals currently under discussion are agreed and implemented.</p>
	<p pid="b.1080W.5/5">Under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations (2006), consumers are able to return their residential air conditioning units to a designated collection facility free of charge at end of life, and producers are responsible for financing their subsequent treatment and recycling.</p>

It is also important to note that failure to confirm the disease by post-mortem examination at the slaughterhouse or by culturing the causative bacterium in the laboratory does not mean that an animal was not infected with bTB. In the early stages of this infectious disease, it is not always possible to see lesions with the naked eye, and due to the fastidious nature of the organism, it is not possible to culture it from tissue samples in every case.</p>

When testing resumed in 2002, resources were concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds tested immediately after the FMD outbreak was greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the number of confirmed TB incidents in 2001 and 2002 are not comparable with other years.  <i> Note:</i>  South West England comprises Avon, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Somerset and Wiltshire</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1083W.5/20">When interpreting these statistics it is important to bear in mind that a proportion of bTB incidents remain unclassified, awaiting the results of culture tests which can take several months. Therefore the number of confirmed incidents will currently be under-recorded. For instance, 21.6 per cent. of new bTB incidents in January to April 2007 were unclassified when the data were extracted.</p>

The review will assist the police to determine whether there should be a further investigation of the death and ill-treatment. During their review, the police, quite properly, are obtaining legal advice from the Army Prosecuting Authority (APA). It would be inappropriate to review the decision to prosecute Corporal Payne and Others at a time when the APA continues to advise the police on their review.

	<p pid="b.1100W.2/2">Members' IT equipment was provided centrally for the first time in 2001 and became due for disposal only from mid-2005. A total of 4,053 items of desktop equipment used by Members and staff of the House of Commons were disposed of between May 2005 and December 2006 as part of the periodic refresh programme. A further 812 items were disposed of between January and June 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.2/3">The disposal of all these items was managed by a third-party contractor, responsible for secure data removal and onward recycling or sale as appropriate. The House received the residual value of sales, after the deduction of costs. Information from the supplier is presented to the House in order to meet its asset management responsibilities, but this does not provide detail on whether individual items were still in working order. The contractor does not make charitable donations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.2/4">Telephone handsets are re-used within the House if possible and otherwise assigned for safe disposal. Since June 2004 redundant mobile telephones have been sent for recycling and the proceeds are donated to charity. Detailed records have been kept since May 2006 and these show that 221 items have been sent for recycling since that date.</p>

	<p pid="b.1100W.6/1">Employers invest very substantial time and resources in the skills of their employees. In 2005 employers reported that they spent around &pound;33 billion on training (including the wage costs of trainees). However, Lord Leitch's review of skills last year set out the major challenge ahead if the UK is truly to be a world leader in skills by 2020. The Government have recently published 'World Class Skills', setting out how we will implement the Leitch review in England. This says that achieving the change in culture that the Leitch ambitions demands, will require a major new investment of time, effort and money by employers and individuals. But it also says that Government have a responsibility to support them, and 'World Class Skills' sets out how we will meet that responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.6/2">Government have a range of support in place designed to motivate employers to invest in the skills of their employees. This includes Train to Gain, Apprenticeships and Foundation Degrees. Train to Gain is a major new service that will raise skills levels and the quality of training across England.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.6/3">Train to Gain offers a holistic service to employers. Independent and impartial skills brokers work with the employers to identify how skills might help them meet their business goals, including increased productivity. The Skills Brokers help the employer identify possible sources of public funding available, as well set out the employer investment, in both cash and in paid time off for employees to study for the relevant qualification. Training when appropriate is often held on the employers premises.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.6/4">In its first year of operation it has already engaged more than 40,000 employers with some 70 per cent. of those defined as hard to reach (i.e. not recognised as an Investor in People and no recorded investment in training).</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.6/5">From 2008-09, employers will be able to access matched funding for level 3 programmes as part of the package they put together with skills brokers, and we will continue to develop the higher level skills offer in the light of the current Higher Level Skills Pathfinders. We will also support discrete Skills for Life programmes as well as those embedded within level 2 programmes for those who do not already have a level 2 qualification.</p>

	<p pid="b.1101W.2/1">Sector Skills Councils are on target to complete Sector Skills Agreements by March 2008 in England. These agreements identify the priority skill needs of industry sectors and how training provision can become more responsive to employer and learner needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1101W.2/2">There are a range of measures to support individuals to improve their skills including Apprenticeships, Train to Gain, National Skills Academies, Foundation Degrees and Union Learning. In addition, there are targeted programmes to address skill shortages. For example the Women and Work programme helps women enter occupations where they are under-represented and where specific skills shortages exist.</p>

This is to ensure that all recruitment is dealt with in a fair and open manner. Recruitment processes for senior appointments are clearly set out by the Commissioners and these processes are followed at all times.</p>
	<p pid="b.1101W.5/2">Selection boards for senior positions are chaired by a Civil Service Commissioner, and for the most senior posts such as the Government Chief Scientific Adviser the panel is always chaired by the First Civil Service Commissioner.

However, ecotourism has not yet reached its potential for contributing to poverty reduction. Ecotourism destinations need to be developed in the south, and the capacity of southern tourism operators needs to be strengthened. Ecotourism can better contribute to poverty reduction by bringing tourism to local communities, as in experiential holidays, which include opportunities to interact with the community; it should also help protect the local environment which often attracts visitors in the first place.</p>

DFID has pledged &pound;359 million to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria over the 2002-08 period. Evidence shows that anti-retroviral treatments are effective, with an estimated 250,000 to 350,000 premature deaths averted in the developing world in 2005 alone. Overall, in low- and middle-income countries the trends are upwards, from 400,000 in 2003 to more than 2 million people on treatment today.</p>

	<p pid="b.1132W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1132W.6/2">The Lottery provided &pound;16 million towards the original pilots of the National School Fruit Scheme (NSFS) between 2000 and 2002. Lottery funding also provided &pound;42 million to support scaling up of the original pilots across five government regions between 2002 and 2004. The Department spent &pound;0.75 million in 2001-02 and &pound;0.3 million in 2002-03 on administering and evaluating the NSFS pilots. The national rollout to all local education authority infant, primary and special schools across England of the scheme was completed at the end of 2004 and in the year 2004-05, the Department spent &pound;28.5 million on the Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1132W.6/3">From April 2005, the Department has fully funded the School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme (SFVS). The cost of the Scheme in 2005-06 was &pound;37.83 and &pound;36.77 million in 2006-07. As the Scheme has developed, we have been able to achieve efficiencies in its overall administration and the supply and distribution of the fruit and vegetables which has resulted in spending on the scheme reducing over the last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1132W.6/4">An initial evaluation of the SFVS was carried out in November 2004. At that stage, the children who participated in the evaluation had only been receiving free fruit and vegetables since June 2004. The results provided a useful insight into the initial impact of the Scheme but it was recognised that further work would need to be undertaken to measure the impact of the Scheme over a longer period. In 2006, we commissioned a further evaluation of the Scheme and the report will be published shortly.</p>

The Audit Commission is on target to meet this reduction as a result of a more targeted and proportionate approach to inspection and a reduction in the volume of inspections needed for CPA. In its commission to the local services inspectorates, the Government made it clear that they expected the new assessment and inspection regime as a whole to reduce the burdens on the inspected and fit with the Government's commitment to a one-third reduction in the cost of public service inspection by 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1134W.6/1">The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, which is currently before Parliament, will abolish Best Value Performance Indicators (except for Welsh Best Value authorities and the police). In line with our commitment in the local government White Paper &quot;Strong and Prosperous Communities&quot; we are developing a single set of national indicators for local government, working alone or in partnership, which will replace existing sets, including BVPIs. This set of indicators will underpin the new performance framework, including Local Area Agreements and the Comprehensive Area Assessment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1138W.5/15">The high spend at Temple Quay was caused by a combination of problems including local power supply issues (frequent outages), high summer temperatures and a fault developed by our HV transformer switchgear which made it run at temperatures likely to cause a very expensive failure and potentially long term disruption to power supplies to the buildings occupiers. This problem has now been resolved.</p>

	<p pid="b.1140W.2/1">The Department uses its communications channels to ensure its policies are properly based in and communicated to target audiences and stakeholders. This is achieved in policy development through consultation and discussion with business, agencies and the public. During implementation, this is achieved by full and open communication to citizens affected by the policy, which can include advertising as a communications medium.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/2">During the past 12 months we have commissioned a number of advertising campaigns, which have been assessed as a matter of course to gauge their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/3" class="indent">The ongoing fire safety campaign delivered a rise in recognition of the new fire prevention advertising from 27 per cent. in July/August 2006 to 45 per cent. in October/November 2006. Fire deaths are at their lowest since 1959 and this campaign is one part of the strategy that has achieved this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/4" class="indent">Research into the local e-gov advertising campaign showed that 51 per cent. of those who recognised the campaign intended to visit their local council website in the next 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/5" class="indent">The campaign to encourage women to apply for posts in the fire and rescue service delivered a 20 per cent. increase in the number of applications from women when the campaign was running.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/6" class="indent">The campaign to inform business of their new responsibilities under the Fire Order Reform delivered a rise in recognition from 14 per cent. in April to 61 per cent. in September 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/7">The Department is committed to developing a work force that reflects the diversity of the communities we serve, enjoying genuine equality of opportunity, and ensuring the Department is rigorously fair in its recruitment and development policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/8">During the past 12 months all vacant posts within the Department were advertised to existing staff in the Department; 33 per cent. of vacancies were also advertised through the civil service. Just 5 per cent. of posts were advertised nationally. In addition, an assessment centre was run for senior civil service (SCS) recruitment at deputy director level, which attracted 20 applicants through this process from which seven appointments were made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140W.2/9">The success of the Department's recruitment advertising is assessed by the quality, appropriateness and number of applicants applying for publicly advertised posts. In the past 12 months this has resulted in 142 permanent and 17 fixed term appointments to the Department.</p>

	<p pid="b.1142W.3/1">A table has been placed in the Library which shows the ratio between the number of social housing lettings and the number of households accepted as homeless in each local housing authority area in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/2">Local authorities in England report the number of lettings in their annual Housing Strategy Statistical Appendix returns. Registered social landlords record the number of lettings on their Continuous Recording of Social Lettings (CORE) lettings logs. These two data sources have been combined to give the total number of new social lettings in each local authority area, made between <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> (figures include transfers of existing tenants where new lettings are made).</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/3">Local authorities report the number of households accepted as homeless in their area on quarterly PI (E) housing returns. Information reported each quarter by local authorities about their activities under homelessness legislation includes the number of households accepted by local authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty. The duty owed to an accepted household is to secure suitable accommodation. If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority may secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/4">The ratio has been calculated by dividing the number of households accepted as homeless by the number of new social housing lettings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.3/5">It is important to note that not all households accepted as homeless go into social housing. For example, some may go into temporary accommodation for a period of time immediately after acceptance, and others move to accommodation in the private sector or have the homelessness duty otherwise ended.</p>

As set out in the Budget, the time limited stamp duty land tax relief should help to generate interest in the market for zero carbon new homes. The Government have set a target that from 2016, all new homes will be zero carbon. Furthermore, a recent survey found that 92 per cent. of respondents want to see sustainability features offered as options on new homes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1146W.2/2">Whether market housing is affordable depends on a number of factors relevant to individuals looking to purchase a home. It is not possible to specify a single price for what would be affordable in Cornwall. However, the lower quartile price for new dwellings sold in Cornwall was around &pound;135,250 in 2006 (i.e. 25 per cent. of new dwellings sold were at or below this price).</p>

	<p pid="b.1149W.6/1">Local authorities' borrowing powers are laid down in the Local Government Act 2003. Authorities are free to borrow without Government consent, provided that they can afford to service the debt from their own resources. Authorities would require the Government's consent to borrow other than in sterling, but apart from that may obtain their loans from any source. That includes borrowing from the Public Works Loan Board or seeking &quot;lender's option borrower's option&quot; loans from private sector banks. Authorities may also raise finance by issuing bonds, again without Government consent. Information on authorities' issues of bonds is not held centrally. We have no plans to give authorities a power to securitise, since they can obtain the same level of finance more simply by borrowing on the strength of their revenue streams.</p>

	<p pid="b.1151W.9/1">Paragraph 3.117 of the 2006 pre-Budget report (CM 6984) indicated that the Government have considered alternative measures to capture land value uplift and that they have looked closely at these models. The predecessor Department to Communities and Local Government consulted on the introduction of a mandatory tariff in December 2001 and on an optional planning charge in November 2003. The Government continue to believe that a workable and effective planning-gain supplement (PGS) represents a fairer and more effective means of capturing land value to help finance infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1151W.9/2">In his statement on the third session draft legislative programme on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-11">11 July 2007</phrase>, the Prime Minister said that the Planning-gain Supplement Bill is provisional within that programme because if, prior to the pre-Budget report, a better way is identified of ensuring that local communities receive significantly more of the benefit from planning gain, including to invest in necessary infrastructure and transport, and it is demonstrated that it is a better alternative, the Government will be prepared to defer next Session's legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1151W.9/3">The Housing Green Paper published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-23">23 July 2007</phrase> says that PGS remains the Government's preferred option but lists the main alternative approaches, including those which have been raised by stakeholders. These approaches set out in the Green Paper will form the basis for discussions with key stakeholders prior to the pre-Budget report.</p>

	<p pid="b.1152W.5/1">In the period 2000 to 2006, new build dwelling completions that were flats increased from 20 per cent. to 47 per cent. nationally. It is not possible to say whether this was a direct result of PPG3, as other policies, commercial considerations and market factors will also have played a part.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.5/2">The Government want to see local planning authorities providing the right types of housing to meet need and demand in areas, based on a robust evidence-based approach. This is why PPS3 asks local authorities to carry out strategic housing market assessments, which should then inform the planning process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152W.5/3">If assessments show that a greater number of larger homes are needed, then we would expect these to be planned for and delivered. But equally there will be areas where smaller homes, including flats, will be needed.</p>

We therefore felt it essential to wait for the SGC, who are responsible for publishing definitive sentencing guidelines for all criminal offences for England and Wales, to produce guidelines to ensure consistency in sentencing. Although the guidelines will not apply to Scotland, it seemed sensible to implement the offence at the same time in all the areas concerned.</p>

	<p pid="b.1171W.5/1">The purpose of the National DNA Database (NDNAD) is to hold a record of a person's DNA which can be matched against DNA taken from crime scenes. The NDNAD only reports matches between DNA profile records based on DNA profile compatibility, and sends them to police forces for the use in an investigation. It does not hold data on arrests, charges and convictions. Such information is held on the Police National Computer (PNC).</p>
	<p pid="b.1171W.5/2">The NDNAD does not hold data on reported matches and their outcomes (sanction detections). Obtaining this information would require cross-searching of records held on the PNC against the NDNAD, and then contacting each police force that received the DNA match to ascertain the outcome. This information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1171W.5/3">It is not possible to provide details of the number of searches made of the National DNA Database (NDNAD) in each of the last five years. Each time a subject or crime stain profile is loaded onto the NDNAD it is searched against all the retained profiles. No record has been kept of the number of searches but thousands of these searches are made of the NDNAD every day.</p>

	<p pid="b.1173W.2/1">In addition to mainstream funding, the Government have committed &pound;55 million of ringfenced funding in 2007-08 to support work on reducing young people's drug use through the Young People's Substance Misuse Partnership Grant. This grant is pooled centrally across Departments, administered by the Home Office and paid to local areas. The change in the grant allocation in 2007-08 is primarily due to a reduction of &pound;4 million in the Department of Health's Targeted Prevention Funding. The Department of Health had made a time-limited commitment to this funding, which was not renewed after the transfer of responsibility for drug education and prevention to the Department for Education and Skills. A further &pound;2.6 million reduction was because the Home Office had increased its contribution, by way of a one-off subsidy in 2006-07, to help mitigate a similar reduction of &pound;4 million by the Department of Health in that year.</p>

The statistics available show only the breakdown between those applications which failed on nationality grounds and those rejected for other reasons. Breakdown by ethnicity is not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1174W.11/2">The passport examination process is designed to confirm the nationality and identity of the intended passport holder and, where required, that consent has been provided. If the Identity and Passport Service does not receive the necessary supporting documentation to confirm the aforementioned, or is unable to verify the application details through examining procedures, it is unable to issue a passport. The 'other reasons' category covers these circumstances and also where the customer requests the application to be withdrawn.</p>

Appraisers should assess whether proposals are likely to have a different impact in rural areas from elsewhere.&quot;). HM Treasury has 10 public service agreement (PSA) targets set under the 2004 spending review. The relevant policies underlying these targets have been rural proofed.</p>

Proportions also appeared to be larger in patients with lymphoma, myeloma and gynaecological cancers than in patients with other types of cancer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1200W.8/6">The Department has not made an assessment of the potential effect on costs to the national health service of using erythropoietin.

	<p pid="b.1202W.5/1">Regulations are in place that require the manufacturers of household goods to make risk assessments on the impact of the chemicals found in those household goods, and this would include any impacts on human health. Responsibility for these regulations lies with other Departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/2">Manufacturers and suppliers of chemicals and chemical products are required under the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2002 to classify their products in line with an European Union-wide classification system and to label them accordingly. When appropriate, the product must carry a warning symbol and risk phrases that indicate the category of hazard. When supplied for workplace use, the products must additionally have a safety data sheet that sets out the particular risks associated with the use of the product.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/3">Since 1993, over one hundred hazardous substances have been assessed for their risk to human health and the environment under the European Union's Existing Substances Regulation (EC/793/93). Where appropriate, control measures have been put in place including, in some cases, restrictions on the marketing and use of these substances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/4">Other regulations for protecting the consumer are the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform's General Product Safety Regulations 2005 (GPSR) which implement the European Commission (EC) General Product Safety Directive (2001/95/EC) and apply to all consumer products that are not covered (and to the same extent) by specific European safety legislation. The GPSR requires manufacturers to ensure that products present no risk or only the minimum risk compatible with the product's use, and that they are accompanied by appropriate warnings and instructions for use.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/5">The EC has adopted the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, and amending Directive 67/548/EEC and Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 (COM(2007) 355 final). This proposed act will align the EU system of classification, labelling and packaging substances and mixtures to the United Nations Globally Harmonised System (GHS). It will complement the new EU Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation Chemicals (REACH).</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/6" class="italic"> Perfluorinated compounds</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/7">The Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) provided advice on the toxicity and tolerable daily intake of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate. The statement was published in November 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/8" class="italic"> Phthalates</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/9">Phthalates are a family of chemical substances, with a range of properties. Extensive research into the effects of certain phthalates on both the environment and human health has been carried out at a European level, under the auspices of the EU's Existing Substances Regulation (793/93/EC). Details of the programme can be found on the European Chemicals Bureau website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/10" class="indent">ecb.jrc.it/existing-chemicals/.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/11">The United Kingdom takes the view that phthalates must be considered on a case-by-case basis and that risk assessments should be based on evidence. Where the database is insufficient to complete a risk assessment, it is normally expected that the industry will carry out the required additional research. However, Government have asked its expert committee, COT, to keep the area of environmental chemicals and reproductive health under review and will consider their advice on the need for additional research in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/12" class="italic"> Phenolic compounds</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/13">The term used may apply to phenolic disinfectants, phenolic resins or to the vast range of chemicals which include a phenol ring, some of which will have had assessments carried out.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/14" class="italic"> Brominated flame retardants</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/15">COT reviewed the toxicology of the brominated flame retardant, tetrabromobisphenol A, in relation to potential environmental contamination and their statement was published in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/16">The UK has carried out the EC risk assessment for three (octa-, deca-, and penta-bromodiphenyl ether) of the commercially available brominated flame retardants. There was concern about the long-term effects of brominated flame retardants, which are necessarily stable in conditions of extreme heat, and in some cases are persistent. Strategies to reduce exposure are developed if an unacceptable risk is identified. For example, the brominated flame retardant Pentabromodiphenyl ether has been banned in the EU since <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-15">15 August 2004</phrase> under the EU's Marketing and Use Directive for all uses, except for a temporary derogation until March 2006 for it use in aircraft emergency evacuation slides. This ban is implemented in Great Britain by Statutory Instrument 2004/3278 and in Northern Ireland by SI 2004/509.</p>

	<p pid="b.1204W.5/1">The publication in September 2004 of the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) standard of the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services gives guidance on what is envisaged in a comprehensive CAMHS service. It stresses that services must also ensure support for parents or carers and other family members.</p>
	<p pid="b.1204W.5/2">There are inpatient units for under 18s with severe mental health problems resulting in behavioural disorders run by the national health service and privately. These are commissioned as part of CAMHS commissioning. These are located all around the country. In some instances young people end up on adult wards. However, the most important change that has been made to the Mental Health Bill is that it will now require hospital managers to ensure that patients under 18 who are admitted to hospital for assessment or treatment, either under the Act or as voluntary patients, are placed in an environment that is suitable for their age.</p>
	<p pid="b.1204W.5/3">For severe behavioural disorders that are not due to mental health disorders there are also local authority secure children's homes and secure forensic units for young offenders with mental health problems.

	<p pid="b.1206W.5/1">An abscond occurs when a mental health patient detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 goes missing outside the secure perimeter of a unit, e.g. when on a scheduled visit. Absconds do not occur from within secure units. If a patient managed to get out from within the secure perimeter of a unit, this would be termed an escape.</p>

In relation to mental health patients detained under the Mental Health Act 1983, an abscond is treated as an SUI where a significant risk is posed to the patient or to others. An abscond would not necessarily be treated as an SUI where the abscond is unintentional, due for example to a patient missing a bus or train when returning from leave.</p>
	<p pid="b.1206W.5/4">The reporting of SUI absconds is stringent. Individual national health service organisations are responsible for identifying SUIs and there must be clear local procedures at each NHS organisation to identify, report and investigate SUIs.

	<p pid="b.1209W.9/1">The national health service is required to undertake a wide range of pre and post employment checks, as set out in guidance issued by NHS Employers in May 2005 on safer recruitment. The guidance covers all procedures for the full range of checks to be made, before appointment of anyone in the NHS. It applies to all NHS settings. The Healthcare Commission monitor NHS trusts on their compliance with the guide. A copy of this guidance, entitled &quot;Safer Recruitment, A Guide for NHS Employers&quot;, has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.9/2">In February 2005 Ministers decided that Criminal Record Bureau (CRB) checks should be mandatory for all staff with access to patients in the normal course of their duties. However, CRB checks are limited to the United Kingdom and will not reveal anything on staff who have just entered the UK for the first time. NHS Employers guidance states that employers who recruit staff from abroad should carry out the necessary police checks in line with that country's justice system and UK requirements.</p>

A number of patient and public involvement groups attended the conference and we also intend that future meetings of the National Advisory Group will include a wide regional representation. Proposals for the membership and terms of reference of the national working groups were presented and views and expressions of interest sought.

The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected, in the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Ungrossed Data</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1228W.11/1">In line with standard 5 of the National Service Framework for Mental Health, we continue to seek ways of promoting improvements to mental health wards that enhance the safety of patients and staff and the quality of care provided. Specific steps taken recently include the investment of an extra &pound;130 million capital in 2006-07 to update the mental health estate and to ensure that each mental health trust has access to an appropriate place of safety. Out of this sum, &pound;100 million is being allocated to psychiatric intensive care units and places of safety between 2006-07 and 2007-08. Last November, we announced that the remaining &pound;30 million should focus on capital schemes in 2007-08, promoting safety in acute wards, particularly for women service users.</p>
	<p pid="b.1228W.11/2">The Healthcare Commission (HC) and the National Institute of Mental Health in England (NIMHE), with support from the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Mental Health Act Commission, have developed the assessment framework which underpins the HC's 2006-07 national acute in-patient service review. The review was launched in June and will assess whether admissions to acute in-patient mental health services are appropriate, purposeful, therapeutic and safe. The results will be published in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.1228W.11/3">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published guidelines on the management of violence in health care settings in 2004 and NIMHE is now finalising specific guidance for mental health service providers in the light of NICE's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1228W.11/4">NIMHE are currently developing joint positive practice guidance with the Association of Chief Police Officers on health and police liaison. This will include key areas around absence without leave, places of safety, patient safety and ward violence and drugs, public safety and learning the lessons from homicides. This is due for publication at the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1230W.2/1">In December 2005, the Department announced that &pound;88.2 million would be allocated to local authorities in 2007-08 via the child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) grant. This grant is to be used by local authorities to improve CAMHS, in accordance with local needs and priorities, as set out in local CAMHS development strategies. In 2007-08, &pound;50 million has been made available to strategic health authorities for CAMHS as part of a larger bundle of revenue funding for the national health service. In 2007-08, we have also made available to the NHS &pound;31 million of capital funds for investment by providers of CAMHS. Bids for these funds have been invited and priority will be given to projects which will help to eliminate the inappropriate use of adult psychiatric wards for children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/2">The annual CAMHS mapping exercise shows that overall expenditure on specialist CAMHS increased from &pound;431 million in 2004-05 to a projected &pound;513 million in 2005-06, an increase of 19 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230W.2/3">Funding for CAMHS beyond 2007-08 is being considered as part of the comprehensive spending review (CSR). It is anticipated that details of the CSR settlement will be announced in autumn 2007.</p>
