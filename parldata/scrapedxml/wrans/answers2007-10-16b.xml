	<p pid="b.936W.5/1">MOD has excellent medical rehabilitation services. If military patients require further rehabilitation care following initial hospital treatment, they may be referred to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court in Surrey, which is the principal medical rehabilitation centre run by the armed forces and widely praised for its work. DMRC provides both physiotherapy and group rehabilitation for complex musculo-skeletal injuries, plus neuro-rehabilitation for brain-injured patients, after they have completed their hospital care.</p>
	<p pid="b.936W.5/2">In exceptional circumstances, where specialist care is required that cannot be provided at Headley Court, such as cases of severe brain trauma, patients may be referred to specialist facilities in either NHS or private facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.936W.5/3">The Complex Rehabilitation and Amputee Unit, based within DMRC, provides high quality prosthetics and adaptations, manufactured on site and individually tailored as necessary to the specific patient. Priority is given to the provision of prosthetics to enable service personnel to resume service duties. In July 2007, I opened officially a new 30-bed annex at Headley Court, providing accommodation for low-dependency patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.936W.5/4">Personnel with less serious musculo-skeletal injuries may also be referred to one of MOD's 15 Regional Rehabilitation Units in the UK and Germany, which provide accessible, regionally-based assessment and treatment, including physiotherapy and group rehabilitation facilities. They are staffed by specially trained doctors, physiotherapists and rehabilitation instructors, and enable patients to be assessed and treated in a timely fashion, with the aim of returning them to operational fitness when this is clinically possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.940W.3/14">The formation of 1 Lancashire Regiment and 2 Lancashire Regiment involved the amalgamation of 1 King's Own Royal Border Regiment, 1 King's Regiment and the Queen's Lancashire Regiment, with both of the new regiments containing personnel from each of the three original regiments. It is not possible therefore to calculate meaningful historic average tour intervals for 1 Lancashire Regiment but, for information, 1 King's Own Royal Border Regiment returned from its previous deployment in April 2006 (equivalent to an 18 months interval) and 1 King's Regiment and the Queen's Lancashire Regiment returned from their previous deployments in October 2003 (equivalent to a 50 month tour interval).</p>
	<p pid="b.940W.3/15">Royal Air Force ground units operate differently to those of the Army. While a unit might be deployed for four months, RAF personnel can rotate through the unit rather than remain deployed with it throughout. Therefore unit and personnel tour intervals are not necessarily the same.</p>

	<p pid="b.947W.8/1">Escalators of this type would be expected to have a life expectancy of about 10 years&mdash;those in Portcullis House were installed in 1999 and replaced after eight years in 2007. The tender cost was &pound;327,000 and the project was completed on budget. The motion sensitivity feature is not currently operational as a precautionary measure due to a component in similar escalator being found to be faulty. It is anticipated that the motion facility will be re-instated for <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-12">Monday 12 November 2007</phrase>.</p>

Specific allergy awareness training was delivered to approximately 40 staff in November to December 2006.

	<p pid="b.949W.0/1">The refurbishment of the Press Gallery has been a project to modernise accommodation used by the journalists and political correspondents based in the Palace of Westminster for the purposes of reporting on the business of Parliament. The press have had a recognised presence in the House of Commons since 1803, when Speaker Abbott ruled that they should have privileged access to the Gallery.</p>
	<p pid="b.949W.0/2">The Press Gallery is one of the last areas of the Palace to be modernised. Over the 2006 summer recess, the House of Commons began the first phase of the project to bring the offices in line with workplace health and safety and disability discrimination regulations. The second and final phase of works was completed over the 2007 summer recess, during which the entire Press Gallery was decanted. The project also involved refitting and updating the catering facilities in that area of the Palace in order to make more efficient use of the space. The final handover of office accommodation and the new catering facilities took place on <phrase class="date" code="">15 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.949W.0/3">The project was completed at a total cost of &pound;7.71 million to the House. As well as modern office accommodation, the improved facilities include a new kitchen and a multi-purpose restaurant and cafe/bar, to be called &quot;Moncrieff's&quot;. The refurbished Press Gallery will be launched by Mr. Speaker on <phrase class="date" code="">20 November</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.953W.12/1">Prison population projections are calculated using a range of mathematical models. The evidential basis for these calculations is a mixture of observed prison population data, sentencing data (wherever this is possible) and stakeholder assumptions. The stakeholders are experts drawn from the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office and across the Criminal Justice System. The latest projections were published in the Ministry of Justice Statistical Bulletin &quot;Prison population projections 2007-2014, England and Wales&quot; (August 2007).</p>

However, as a result of internal concerns about a statistical disparity showing that black and minority ethnic solicitors were over-represented in regulatory decisions, the SRA commissioned an external analysis of this issue, resulting in the publication in July 2006 of the report &quot;The impact of regulatory decisions of the Investigations and Enforcement Unit on black and minority ethnic solicitors&quot;.

	<p pid="b.968W.2/1">The average time for clearing incapacity benefit claims nationally is 13.9 days against a Jobcentre Plus target of 18 days from receipt of a claim. The performance of Jobcentre Plus offices against this target is kept under review. Jobcentre Plus continues to look for improvements in the processing of claims and recent examples include the introduction of a rapid reclaim process for people who return to incapacity benefit and the implementation of a single 0800 number for customers to use when making a claim.</p>
	<p pid="b.968W.2/2">The Government's Welfare Reform Act 2007 makes provision for a new benefit, the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), to replace the current incapacity benefits system for new and repeat claimants from autumn 2008. ESA aims to provide a modernised and simpler benefit which is designed to help people with health conditions and disabilities to focus on their aspirations to return to work and to provide support where an immediate return to work is not possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.972W.5/1">The Truckstop Guide was a trial publication produced by the Highways Agency during 2006. Research indicates that the guide has been effective in raising awareness of designated freight parking facilities and promoting driver safety and journey planning information to both UK and continental drivers. Options for its future development are currently being considered.</p>
	<p pid="b.972W.5/2">Since 1992, it has been Government policy that the responsibility for identifying and acquiring appropriate motorway and trunk road service area sites lies with the private sector. The most recent assessment of truckstop availability and services was conducted early in 2007 as part of an update to the information originally gathered to inform the Truckstop Guide.</p>

	<p pid="b.975W.9/1">Whenever a road needs to be resurfaced, for safety and maintenance reasons, quieter surfacing is used as a matter of course. In 2004, a 1 km stretch of the A27 Lewes bypass was repaired using low noise material.</p>
	<p pid="b.975W.9/2">In financial year 2006-07, the Highways Agency completed a further technical survey for this location, which identified that only a short section of the bypass, lane 1 of both the eastbound approach and westbound exit from Southerham roundabout, requires resurfacing. The works are planned to be carried out in 2008-09 financial year, subject to funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.975W.9/3">The Agency currently has no plans to erect noise barriers at this location as the site does not meet the necessary criteria.</p>

Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-09">9 July 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1291W, I stated that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) had not employed consultancy firms to work on the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games in the current financial year (2007-08) and that two consultancy firms were employed in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.977W.2/3">However, it has since come to light that during 2006-07 a total of six consultancy firms were employed by DCMS on Olympic-related business. One of these firms continued to work on Olympic-related business in 2007-08 and a further four consultancy contracts had also, as of <phrase class="date" code="">9 July</phrase>, been entered into during 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="b.977W.2/5">Since my answer of <phrase class="date" code="">9 July</phrase>, the Department has entered into five further Olympic-related consultancy contracts. Their costs are not included in the aforementioned figure.</p>
	<p pid="b.977W.2/6">The cost of consultancy firms employed by the Olympic Delivery Authority in 2006-07 was &pound;50,494,000 and in 2007-08 (as of <phrase class="date" code="">9 July</phrase>) was &pound;10,753,000. A significant percentage of these costs is attributed to five major contracts in 2006-07 (Atkins, EDAW Limited, Ernst and Young LLP, Ove Arup and Partners Limited, and Rockpools) and three major contracts in 2007-08 (Atkins, EDAW Limited, and Ove Arup and Partners Limited).</p>

	<p pid="b.978W.2/3">In 2004, the overall test purchase failure rate was 50 per cent. In 2006, it had dropped to 20 per cent. In this latest and more targeted campaign it now stands at 15 per cent overall.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.2/4">Nearly 9,000 test purchase operations were carried out on 2,683 premises in the recent national tackling underage sales enforcement campaign. Children were only able to obtain alcohol in 14.7 per cent of cases. Only 22 actual premises (0.8 per cent of premises targeted) sold alcohol to children on three separate occasions. These figures again signal further improvements in the reduction of the test purchase failures since the national enforcement campaigns began three years ago, Through 'Safe. Sensible. Social. The next steps in the National Alcohol Strategy', the Government are committed to carrying out an independent review of the relationship between alcohol price, promotion and harm, and following public consultation, will consider the need for regulatory change in the future, if necessary. This review is being led by the Department of Health and has gone out to tender. We anticipate publishing the review's findings in the summer of 2008. In addition, the Government are also committed to carrying out a review and consultation on the effectiveness of the alcohol industry's Social Responsibility Standards document in contributing to a reduction in alcohol harm, and following public consultation, will consider the need for regulatory change in the future, if necessary. We anticipate launching the public consultation in November 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.982W.2/3">We have made clear on numerous occasions our view of the importance of roads policing, including by references in National Policing Plans and the National Community Safety Plan. In January 2005, the Home Office, Department for Transport and ACPO issued a jointly agreed national Roads Policing Strategy to set roads policing in the context of over-all police work, establish continuing priorities and identify under- pinning principles for operational practice and the development of policy. Ministers wrote earlier this year to all chief officers stressing the importance of roads policing and of treating offences on the roads as seriously as other offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.982W.2/4">We do not believe it helpful to focus exclusively on numbers. More effective roads policing is in general delivered chiefly by better use of intelligence, more targeting and more efficient use of resources. The Government have, moreover, increased the number of police over-all by more than 14, 000. This means more officers available for all aspects of police work, including roads policing. All police officers can enforce road traffic legislation as appropriate, whether or not they are dedicated to roads policing.</p>

	<p pid="b.984W.3/1">DFID has not had any recent discussions with the Chinese Government specifically focused on the one child policy. However, DFID works closely with China on reproductive health and rights more generally, especially in the context of our support for HIV and AIDS prevention and for health policy. In these contexts the Chinese Government are regularly made aware of our strong endorsement of the principles of the International Conference on Population and Development. Although the one child policy remains in place, China has made good progress in ensuring reproductive health rights more generally, especially through its implementation of the 2002 Law of Population and Family Planning. The law spells out rights and responsibilities for clients, service providers and family planning officials. Most provinces have now enacted their own regulations in accordance with the national law.</p>

	<p pid="b.985W.0/1">The poorest countries are eligible for 100 per cent. debt cancellation on their bilateral debts under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, as well as 100 per cent. debt cancellation on their debts to the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and African Development Bank under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The UK is at the forefront of debt cancellation for poor countries and international poverty reduction. We exceed our commitments under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives (MDRI), providing the poorest countries with 100 per cent. cancellation on their bilateral and multilateral debts. The HIPS and MDRI systems have cancelled billions of pounds worth of debt and we continue to believe that they are the most appropriate way to tackle sovereign debt problems. Unpayable debts should not hinder the poorest countries from making progress towards the millennium development goals.</p>
	<p pid="b.985W.0/2">All of our loans are made to internationally recognised governments, are bound by legal contracts and are recognised in international law, we do not therefore consider them to be &quot;illegitimate&quot;. We believe that debt relief should be provided on the basis of a country's economic situation rather than their history of poor or corrupt governance. Many countries that have a history of poor governance are now middle-income countries. If we cancelled so-called &quot;illegitimate&quot; debts for such countries, the full cost would have to be met from DFID's aid budget, diverting vital resources away from poorer countries. It is also likely that creditors and investors would take a negative view of the credit worthiness of developing countries in case the loans were later repudiated. This would be damaging for developing countries trying to strengthen their economies and reduce poverty through access to international investment and financing.</p>

	<p pid="b.986W.5/1">DFID has not received any specific representation on the issue of wages paid to workers of UK high street fashion suppliers based in developing countries in the last six months. However we are engaged on these issues through a number of organisations and initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.986W.5/2">These include the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), which DFID helped set up, and funds. We have provided over &pound;2 million to support the ETI, which is an alliance of companies, trades unions and non-governmental organisations committed to improving working conditions in global supply chains. A recent independent assessment of the ETI showed improvements in health and safety, working hours, wages and child labour in the supply chains of companies taking part. DFID also works at the country level, on labour rights and terms and conditions. For instance, in Bangladesh and Lesotho DFID has supported the work of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement Forum, which supports responsible business practices while improving productivity and competitiveness. DFID is also providing up to &pound;20 million in support to the International Labour Organisation to implement decent work country programmes.</p>

	<p pid="b.990W.0/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October 2007</phrase> the Attorney General announced that funding had been approved for the proposals arising from the Government's Fraud Review. This includes the development of a National Fraud Strategic Authority, together with a National Fraud Reporting Centre, the establishment of the City of London Police as the Lead Force on fraud, and proposals for measurement of fraud. These measures will help to tackle fraud and increase our understanding of the nature and extent of the problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.990W.3/1">We recognise, and are addressing, the need to help fuel poor households both off and on the gas network. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) is responsible for gas regulation, including transportation and distribution. As part of the post-2008 Gas Distribution Price Control, Ofgem is currently consulting on measures that would encourage gas distribution network companies to provide connections to deprived communities currently off the gas network. Such communities are likely to contain a higher than average proportion of fuel poor households.</p>
	<p pid="b.990W.3/2">The Design and Demonstration Unit within my Department has successfully developed a model for the provision of gas connections to deprived communities by independent gas transporters. A number of connections have been made using this model. The unit has also developed models to provide lower-cost household energy from renewable and other new technologies for those deprived communities where gas connections are not economically viable. We expect demonstration projects in North-East England and Yorkshire and Humberside that use these models to begin shortly. Assistance for fuel poor and vulnerable households within such communities is also available under other Government programmes, including DEFRA's Warm Front programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.991W.2/1">Government believe that independently regulated competitive markets are the most cost-effective and efficient way to deliver our energy policy goals. It is for energy suppliers to determine their pricing structure, taking into account the different cost to serve for different customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.991W.2/2">Prepayment meter rates are often higher because of the higher costs of the meters and the payment infrastructure that supports them. Some companies have equalised their prepayment and standard credit tariffs, but others have not. It is true that the differences between the rates paid by direct debit customers and those paid by others (both standard credit and prepayment meter customers) have widened. I am concerned about these increases, and am working with Ofgem to consider ways to encourage further protection of the most vulnerable consumers from the large differences in bills because of the payment method they use and to spread best practice across suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="b.992W.0/2">This exercise has concluded that typical issues raised by complainants to the HAC would be covered adequately by existing and upcoming consumer protection legislation. Indeed, consumer protection is likely to be increased upon transposition of the EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.992W.0/3">For instance, sales visits in the home, high pressure sales practices, misleading advice or sales information would be covered by the doorstep selling regulations and the forthcoming Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations, which implement the EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.992W.0/4">The new regulations will strengthen consumer protection by introducing a general prohibition on unfair commercial (mainly marketing and selling) practices. The regulations, which will come into force in April 2008, are intended to ensure that consumers have the information necessary to make free and informed choices, and are not treated aggressively, including by means of high pressure selling techniques. They include rules prohibiting conduct which misleads the average consumer by what is said or omitted to be said, and thereby causes or is likely to cause him to take a decision he would not have taken otherwise. The regulations also prohibit aggressive practice which impairs the average consumer's freedom of choice with regard to the product and thereby causes, or is likely to cause him to take a different decision.</p>

	<p pid="b.1000W.3/39">The aforementioned data is HM Treasury re-classifications and so will be on a different basis year on year. Detailed notes on reclassifications have been provided in the FCO Annual Reports for the years in question.</p>
	<p pid="b.1000W.3/40">Data taken from Supply Estimates or resource accounts are not necessarily readily compatible with a near-cash/non-cash split, which is used only within the DEL budgetary controls applied by HM Treasury. The ability of Departments to provide such a split will depend partly on the extent of reconciliations between voted provision and budgetary limits.</p>

	<p pid="b.1006W.5/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office closely monitors the human rights situation in Russia and remains concerned about the ongoing reports of human rights violations, which we receive from our embassy in Moscow, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and Russia media sources.</p>
	<p pid="b.1006W.5/2">Our main concern is that these reports indicate a further shrinking of the democratic space in Russia, primarily through the recent NGO and anti-extremist laws and the restrictions imposed on opposition parties. There are concerns that this shrinking could worsen in the lead up to the parliamentary elections in December and the 2008 presidential elections. Other human rights concerns include: the restrictions on media freedom and increased risk to journalists safety; the rise in attacks on ethnic, racial and religious minorities; the increasing use of forced psychiatric treatment and detention; and the ongoing reports of extra-judicial killings, torture, abduction and arbitrary detention in Chechnya and elsewhere in the North Caucasus.</p>

Our 14-19 reforms, that include an entitlement for every young person to access a Diploma programme from 2013, will ensure that all young people have the opportunity to choose a learning pathway which suits them and which can be the basis for progression to further learning, higher education and employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1013W.2/2">Government-funded apprenticeships offer the opportunity for young people to earn as they learn. There over 200 apprenticeships, designed by employers, available to 16 to 19-year-olds in 80 different sectors with 130,000 employers taking part. These apprenticeships give employees the opportunity to learn on the job and also through off the job training.</p>
	<p pid="b.1013W.2/3">16 and 17-year-olds who are in employment, and who have not yet attained NVQ level 2 or equivalent, are entitled to reasonable paid time off during normal working hours to study or train for a qualification which will improve their future employment prospects. The Department is also piloting Learning Agreements to help 16 and 17-year-olds in employment get back into education and training. Young people will agree personal contracts to return to education or vocational training in return for financial support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1013W.2/4">However, we are not complacent and know that there is a lot more to do. Numbers of 16 and 17-year-olds in full-time education have increased in Warrington from 63 per cent. in 1998 to 68 per cent. in 2005, but we need to do more to increase the number of work-based learning opportunities for young people. By 2013 we will introduce an entitlement to an apprenticeship place for all school-leavers who meet the entry criteria. It will mean that every young person leaving school who wants to continue their learning in a work-based environment can do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1013W.2/5">Once the Diploma and apprenticeship entitlements are in place, all young people will be required to continue in education or training post-16. The bill will include provisions to raise to 18 the minimum age at which young people can leave education or training.</p>

	<p pid="b.1014W.2/1">The EU institution, European Schools, was established by an intergovernmental agreement in 1957. Its purpose is to provide an education based on mother tongue teaching for the children of officials of the EU institutions and its agencies. There are 14 schools in various countries across Europe. The Government are committed to the future of the European Schools and fulfils their obligations under the 1994 Convention Defining the Statute of the European Schools through its membership of the governing body. The United Kingdom has one school in Culham in Oxfordshire. It was established in the late 1970s to support the employees of the EFDA-JET project based at Culham Laboratories.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014W.2/2">At its meeting in April 2007 in Lisbon, the European Schools' Board of Governors took a decision to allow Culham School to leave the European Schools system because it no longer has enough pupils entitled to an education under the provisions of the intergovernmental agreement. The decision allows Culham to stay in the system until at least 2010, but its transition into either the state or private sector must be completed by 2017. The EFDA decision to phase out its project at Culham and move the remaining work to its other base in France has contributed to this decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014W.2/3">It is too early to say exactly what the future holds for Culham School, but my officials are working in support of the parents and management of the school to ensure a smooth transition.</p>

	<p pid="b.1018W.0/16">The Department is currently collecting and validating local authorities' outturn data for the financial year 2006-07 and we will publish this later in the autumn. But early indications are that the total of balances has increased again.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/17">It is right that schools should be able to accrue revenue balances from one year to the next in support of strategic, long term, financial planning. However, I am clear that it is not acceptable for Government to allow balances to continue to accumulate. At the end of 2005-06, total net revenue balances were 5.3 per cent. of schools' total income. For schools with a positive balance, the figure is 6.7 per cent. of total income. Moreover, around 17 per cent. of schools had held an excess surplus for each of the last five years. This is taxpayers' money voted by Parliament for the education of the pupils in schools in the year in question and it should not be steadily accumulating in schools' bank accounts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/18">We are therefore taking action on two fronts to bring the total down. We have introduced a requirement that, from 2007-08, all local authorities must, where they do not already, operate a balance control mechanism enabling them to claw back excess surplus balances. These are defined in the guidance as uncommitted revenue balances above 8 per cent. of total income for primary and special schools and 5 per cent. for secondary schools. The guidance is available in the Library of the House and can be viewed at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/19" class="indent"><a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/schemesforfinancingschools/">www.teachernet.gov.uk/schemesforfinancingschools/</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/20">To be effective, claw-back requires local authorities to scrutinise schools' plans for using their excess surplus balances and reach a judgement on whether the balance is genuinely committed to be spent for a specific purpose within a specified timescale. Claw-back is only as effective, therefore, as the local authority's scrutiny is rigorous.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/21">In 2005-06, local authorities reported that &pound;988 million or 62.9 per cent. of balances was committed for specific purposes. However what is defined as a committed revenue balance varies from one local authority to another and the split of total revenue balances into committed and uncommitted balances is not reliable. For example, in 2005-06, 37 local authorities reported less than 25 per cent. of their total revenue balances as committed whereas 62 LAs reported more than 75 per cent. of their total revenue balance as committed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/22">The Government expect claw-back to have some impact but we believe it is right to take further action on all balances to ensure that their overall level reduces so that some of this money is used to support the education of today's pupils. We proposed in the consultation on the school, early years and 14 to 16 funding arrangements in spring this year to require all local authorities to redistribute locally 5 per cent. of all positive revenue balances from 2008-09. Local authorities will decide with their Schools Forum how the money is to be redistributed locally to support local needs and priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/23">I announced in my statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-25">25 June 2007</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 2WS, our decision to proceed with this proposal, and in September my Department published an Explanatory Note for local authorities and Schools Forums on the school funding arrangements for the next three years, including further detail on how the balance redistribution would work in practice. The Explanatory Note is available in the Library and on TeacherNet at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/24" class="indent"><a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/schoolfunding2008to11">www.teachernet.gov.uk/schoolfunding2008to11</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/25">The Department is now consulting on the draft school finance regulations for 2008 which would bring the balance redistribution into effect. The proposition is that local authorities should calculate 5 per cent. of the most recent positive revenue balance for all schools, and add this sum to the total Schools Budget for the coming year. For 2008-09, it is proposed that this should be final balances at the end of 2006-07 since final balances for 2007-08 will not be known before authorities notify schools of their budgets by the end of March. Consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="">26 October</phrase> and I will announce our final decisions on the redistribution in the light of the comments received. Details of the consultation can be viewed at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/26" class="indent"><a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/schoolfundingframework/">www.teachernet.gov.uk/schoolfundingframework/</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/27">and copies are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/28">It is clear from early responses that schools are particularly concerned about the use of 2006-07 balances. We will want to look very carefully at this aspect of the proposals in particular in reaching final decisions in the light of the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/29">Local authority claw-back mechanisms and the proposed balance redistribution apply to all local authority maintained schools including foundation and trust schools. Academies and city technology colleges (CTCs) are not subject to the same rules on the carry-forward of balances as maintained schools. Instead, the requirements are set out in their individual funding agreements. The normal provision is that the academy or CTC may carry forward at the end of any year a sum which at maximum is 12 per cent. of the General Annual Grant (GAG) for the year just ended; and within that overall limit only 2 per cent., at most, of the preceding year's GAG can be carried forward for revenue spend; the rest must be for capital purposes. This calculation is not cumulative&mdash;that is, the total sum carried forward should never grow larger than 12 per cent. of the preceding year's GAG. Adherence to these limits is monitored by the Department and GAG may be clawed back if they are exceeded, although the Secretary of State is empowered under the funding agreements to approve a higher limit in individual cases. There are no plans to change these provisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/30">Standards Fund grants are paid under sections 14-18 of the Education Act 2002. Section 16 allows the Secretary of State to set the terms of those payments, including the circumstances in which grant is to be repaid, and how grant should be distributed to schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/31">In my written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="">15 March</phrase>, <i> Official R</i><i> eport</i>, column 18WS I announced the publication by my Department of a summary of the data on school balances for the financial years for which information is available&mdash;1999-2000 to 2005-06. This includes data on balances for all local authority maintained schools, together with regional and local authority level summaries. It shows the proportions declared to be committed and uncommitted and the amount of balances meeting the definition of &quot;excess balances&quot;. Copies have been placed in the Library and the information is also available on the Department's website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/32" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/localauthorities/section52/subPage.cfm?action=section52">www.dfes.gov.uk/localauthorities/section52/subPage.cfm?action=section52</a>.default&amp;ID=84.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/33">Information on closing balances is collected after the end of the financial year so data for 2007-08 onwards are not yet available. As already noted, my Department will publish data for 2006-07 later this autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.1018W.0/34">In 2005-06 positive balances totalled just over &pound;1.7 billion. A redistribution of 5 per cent. of all positive balances in all authorities would deliver in the region of &pound;85 million in 2008-09 to support locally agreed priorities. As total balances reduce over the spending review period it is anticipated that the income generated through the redistribution will be marginally reduced, however it is not currently possible to predict the total surplus balances over this period.</p>

	<p pid="b.1024W.9/1">The Government's policy is to increase the provision of sites for Gypsy and Travellers, linked to firm but fair use of enforcement powers. In March 2007 Communities and Local Government consulted on an amendment to the temporary stop notice regulations, which would give further powers to local authorities to prohibit the stationing of a caravan already on an unauthorised site, if there was an alternative, authorised site for the residents to move onto. Consultees from various sectors stated use of the proposed new powers would be extremely limited while the need for authorised site provision is so high. We are prepared to revisit the proposed amendment at an appropriate time when authorised provision has been increased to an extent that the powers may be of practical benefit to local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1030W.3/1">In England, there is no statutory requirement for local councils to provide public documents in languages other than English. Communities and Local Government has not issued any statutory or non statutory guidance to local authorities on the provision of public documents in languages other than English. The independent Commission on Integration and Cohesion recommended that there should be guidance and set out what this might look like as part of its final report. As recently announced, based on the Commission's advice, we will be publishing new non-statutory guidance on translation for local authorities and public bodies in the coming weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1030W.3/2">However, we do believe knowledge of English is a vital part of integration into British society, as well as a personal advancement.</p>

	<p pid="b.1033W.8/1">Our &pound;90 million Hostels Capital Improvement Programme (HCIP) is making hostels places of change. The key outcome will be to increase the number of people who move on positively from a hostel to a job or training and a settled home. The HCIP offers opportunities to access training, education and job opportunities, which will help counter the negative views often held about hostels.</p>
	<p pid="b.1033W.8/2">In addition, we are providing &pound;1.6 million funding to the voluntary sector to develop training and employment services for the homeless, which will help those in hostels move into employment and on to independent living.</p>

Since the publication of the Green Paper a further 200 sites have been identified that are potentially surplus and which may be suitable for housing. The spread is now 40 per cent. in London and the South, 34 per cent. in the Midlands and East of England and 26 per cent. in the North.</p>
	<p pid="b.1036W.6/6">English Partnerships are actively working with the Government Departments concerned to assess the potential for all these sites for housing development. In due course details of specific sites that are surplus will appear on the Register in the normal way, but for reasons of commercial or operational sensitivity site details are not being released in advance.</p>

	<p pid="b.1044W.7/1">The research on page 3 of &quot;Reforming Emergency Care&quot; refers to bed occupancy. Our understanding is that there were two particular pieces of work on bed occupancy, which helped to inform policy development at that time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1044W.7/2">Firstly, research into the relationship between bed occupancy and the management of elective and emergency pressures was set out in a report of the Emergency Services Action Team in 1997 &quot;Report to the Chief Executive on winter pressures&quot;. The report was published under the cover of an Executive Letter (MISC 97/62), which followed the guidance on Access to Secondary Care Services set out in Executive Letter (EL 97/42). A copy of the report has been placed in the Library and both executive letters have also been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1044W.7/3">Secondly, work was commissioned on bed occupancy modelling. The work by Bagust, A et al &quot;Dynamics of bed use in accommodating emergency admissions: stochastic simulation model&quot; (1999) refers to similar bed occupancy rates as those cited in &quot;Reforming Emergency Care&quot;. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.1048W.5/1">Providers of national health service dental services have contracts with primary care trusts (PCTs) that set out the agreed annual contract sum and the corresponding level of services to be provided over the course of the year. These annual service levels are expressed mainly in terms of units of dental activity, which measure courses of treatment according to their relative complexity. Dental providers who under-deliver by up to 4 per cent. may carry this forward and make up the activity in the following year. Where a provider has delivered less than 96 per cent. of the agreed annual service level, it is at the PCT's discretion whether the undelivered activity is carried forward to the following year or an appropriate proportion of the annual contract sum is refunded to the PCT. This is a matter for PCTs to decide locally in the light of individual circumstances, and their decisions are not collected or held centrally.</p>

In addition, counterfeit medicines have been discovered at wholesale-dealer level on five separate occasions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1050W.2/2">Although this represents a very small percentage of medicines supplied nationally, MHRA is developing a strategy which will address the risks to patient safety posed by counterfeit medicines and introduce measures to minimise the risk of counterfeit products reaching patients through both the regulated and unregulated supply chains.

	<p pid="b.1051W.6/1">No guidelines have been issued by the Department in relation to the independence and objectivity of General Medical Council (GMC) fitness to practise hearings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1051W.6/2">In 2004, the GMC introduced a package of reforms to its fitness to practise procedures that included changes to the adjudication process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1051W.6/3">Key aspects of the changes included:</p>
	<p pid="b.1051W.6/4" class="indent">the separation of functions between investigation and adjudication;</p>
	<p pid="b.1051W.6/5" class="indent">GMC Council members no longer have any role in fitness to practise casework and decision-making; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1051W.6/6" class="indent">fitness to practise panels are populated by a pool of medical and lay panellists. All panellists are appointed against competencies and the recruitment and appointment process is overseen by independent assessors from the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1051W.6/7">All panellists must receive training on the GMC's fitness to practice procedures before they are eligible to sit on a panel. The GMC introduced Indicative Sanctions Guidance in 2001. This provides guidance to panellists on the factors that they should consider in determining the appropriate sanction in each case. The medical and lay panellists appointed to sit on the panels exercise their own judgments in making decisions, but must take into consideration the standards of good practice the GMC has established which have been drawn up after wide consultation and which reflect what society expects of doctors.</p>

We are aware that most PCTs are providing at least one cycle of IVF and we are working with the patient support organisation Infertility Network UK to help PCTs share best practice in the provision of fertility services and move to the NICE recommendations.

	<p pid="b.1054W.17/1">The Government consider that high standards of cleanliness should be provided by the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1054W.17/2">A higher score on the annual Patient Environment Action Team assessments is significantly correlated with lower rates of Methicillin-resistant <i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) and <i> Clostridium difficile</i>, although this is unlikely to be a direct relationship. Links between infection and cleanliness vary according to the specific micro-organism involved, and high standards of hygiene are likely to have a greater effect on <i> Clostridium difficile</i> rates, for instance, than on MRSA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1054W.17/3">Even for those micro-organisms where the environment has less impact, it is still important that hospitals are kept clean. Patients consistently rate cleanliness as one of their highest priorities for the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1054W.17/4">The figure of &pound;50 million is an indicative amount. The final amount will depend on the needs of each hospital, which will inevitably vary. Strategic health authorities (SHAs) will work with their primary care trusts to commission deep cleaning at a locally-agreed cost, and to monitor total spend in their areas. Performance management and evaluation will also be carried out locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1054W.17/5">The deep cleaning programme is an important part of our work in relation to health care associated infections, and will therefore be targeted towards acute trusts. However, all hospitals should be clean, and SHAs have the discretion to include other hospitals, including mental health and learning disability units.</p>
	<p pid="b.1054W.17/6">Deep cleaning is time consuming and can be disruptive. Dependent on the approach taken, it may be necessary to close wards or bays. For most trusts, this will take months, rather than weeks. We expect that the majority of activity will be complete by year-end.</p>

Strategic health authorities and the Department offer support with WTD planning. The Department is sponsoring NHS National Workforce Projects (NWPs) to support local implementation of WTD 2009. NHS NWPs has commissioned a range of pilots including cooperative solutions, team working, handover and escalation and 24:7 working (which include accident and emergency and maternity units).

	<p pid="b.1058W.2/1">We have no current plans to do so. The Gateway review reports are intended to help and inform the management of the programme and the Department's own decisions. They are not intended for publication.</p>
	<p pid="b.1058W.2/2">More generally, the Government believe that the prospect of disclosure of any Gateway review would restrain the frankness and candour with which participants engage in the Gateway process, and that this in turn would undermine its effectiveness and the quality of recommendations arising. Gateway reviews perform an important role in ensuring that public authorities are using their resources in an efficient and effective way and there is therefore a strong and vital public interest in maintaining their efficacy.</p>
