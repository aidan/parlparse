	<p pid=".651W.3/1">Funding for the training of military and security personnel (including police forces, customs and border guards) from overseas comes from a variety of FCO departmental budgets. It supports FCO objectives such as promoting international peace and stability, and improved quality of life world-wide through good governance and crime reduction. A breakdown of approximate expenditure as requested by financial year (f/y) is:</p>
	<table>
		<caption>&pound; </caption>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".651W.3/5"> <th><i></i></th> <th><i>F/y 2000&ndash;01</i></th> <th><i>F/y 2001&ndash;02</i></th> <th><i>F/y 2002&ndash;03</i></th> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".651W.3/12">Future estimates are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid=".651W.3/13">The reduction of FCO expenditure in f/ys 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 does not reflect a reduction in activity. It is because the FCO contributed a large part of its military and security training funding to the two cross- departmental Conflict Prevention Pools (involving FCO, MOD, DfID and HMT) established in April 2001 for Africa and the rest of the world. Each of the four Government Departments made a contribution to the pools. Many of the training activities continue to be supported by the pools because they achieve HMG's conflict prevention objectives overseas. In f/y 2001&ndash;02, the Africa Pool had a budget of &pound;50 million and this will remain the same through to f/y 2003&ndash;04. The Global Pool was allocated &pound;60 million for f/y 2001&ndash;02, &pound;66 million for this financial year and will have &pound;76 million to spend in f/y 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".651W.3/14">Information on the FCO's ASSIST training budget f/y 2000&ndash;01, which was the principle contribution to the pools is available from an earlier answer given by the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary, my hon.

	<p pid=".652W.6/1">In recent years there have been far reaching changes in the defence industry in the United Kingdom, the rest of Europe and the United States. Against the background of the end of the Cold War and the resulting reduction in defence budgets world wide, the defence industry has been subject to massive rationalisation. One consequence of this change is that increasingly defence goods are manufactured from components sourced in several different countries.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.6/2">This restructuring of the defence industry presents new challenges for the Government's approach to export licensing. Many export licence applications are for goods which are to be incorporated in defence equipment in a second country, which thereafter may be exported to a third country.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.6/3">The Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria set out in a statement by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/931" name="Peter Hain">the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain)</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/.199"><i>Official Report</i>, column 199&ndash;203W</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-26">26 October 2000</phrase>, make clear that they &quot;will not be applied mechanistically&quot; to decisions on export licence applications, but rather &quot;on a case-by-case basis, using judgment and common sense&quot;. The criteria do not provide specific guidance on what approach should be adopted in these &quot;incorporation&quot; cases.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.6/4">Other EU and NATO member states face the same rapidly changing environment for their defence industries as the UK. Enquiries by Her Majesty's Government suggest, however, that while as yet there is no common policy in such cases, many of our European partners recognise the need to adopt a special approach towards cases involving incorporation for onward export.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.6/5">After very careful consideration, Her Majesty's Government have, therefore, decided that it is necessary to set out how it will in future approach licence applications for goods where it is understood that the goods are to be incorporated into products for onward export. The Government will continue to assess such applications on a case by case basis against the Consolidated Criteria, while at the same time having regard to, inter alia, the following factors:</p>
	<p pid=".652W.6/6" class="indent">(a) the export control policies and effectiveness of the export control system of the incorporating country;</p>
	<p pid=".652W.6/7" class="indent">(b) the importance of the UK's defence and security relationship with the incorporating country;</p>
	<p pid=".652W.6/8" class="indent">(c) the materiality and significance of the UK-origin goods in relation to the goods into which they are to be incorporated, and in relation to any end-use of the finished products which might give rise to concern;</p>
	<p pid=".652W.6/9" class="indent">(d) the ease with which the UK-origin goods, or significant parts of them, could be removed from the goods into which they are to be incorporated; and</p>
	<p pid=".652W.6/10" class="indent">(e) the standing of the entity to which the goods are to be exported.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.6/11">Against this background the Government have considered its response to a number of applications for the export of parts, subsystems and components to the USA for incorporation into equipment eventually destined for other countries. These include Head Up Display units (HUDs) for incorporation in F-16 aircraft scheduled for delivery to Israel in 2003. The UK content in F-16s is less than 1 per cent. in value, but the supply of HUDs is part of a long-standing collaboration in this US programme. Any interruption to the supply of these components would have serious implications for the UK's defence relations with the United States.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.6/12">The Government continue to be seriously concerned about the situation in Israel and the Occupied Territories. There has to be a break to the cycle of violence, which has brought so much misery to both peoples, and a resumption of the peace process. We are working closely with partners including the US to reduce the level of tension and to bring about a sustainable and peaceful settlement through negotiation.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.6/13">The United States Government maintains a strong and effective export licensing system. The Quadripartite Committee has noted that the United States' conventional arms transfer policy</p>
	<p pid=".652W.6/14" class="indent">&quot;does not appear to differ in any important way from the EU Code or the UK national criteria. In some respects . . . it is an improvement&quot; (HC 467 xxix 73 (<phrase class="date" code="2000-07-25">25 July 2000</phrase>)). Appropriate use of arms exported to Israel by the US is the subject of regular dialogue between the two countries, and when the US have concerns they make these known to the Israelis (as required by Congressional legislation). The State Department has been monitoring Israeli actions carefully and will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.6/15">At the same time the Government carefully take into account the importance of maintaining a strong and dynamic defence relationship with the US. This relationship is fundamental to the UK's national security as well as to our ability to play a strong and effective role in the world. The importance of this role has been demonstrated repeatedly in recent months. There are also wider benefits to the UK's national security of maintaining a strong indigenous defence industrial capability.</p>
	<p pid=".652W.6/16">Taking account of all these considerations, the Government considered that the applications should be approved, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has today granted licences for the export of the HUDs, and other equipment to the USA. The Government will apply similar considerations to similar applications in future.</p>

	<p pid=".654W.5/2">No such decision was taken. An updated information leaflet on Gibraltar was prepared specially for the event, and was inserted into all the packs prepared before the event. These packs ran out on the day, due to high demand. Additional packs were prepared but, due to an oversight, these were given out for a short period without Gibraltar leaflets. This situation was quickly corrected.</p>

	<p pid=".663W.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-27">27 May</phrase> the Independent Television Commission (ITC) published the Charter for Broadcasting in the Nations and Regions, an agreement with the ITV companies to secure a sustainable future for regional programming. The charter includes commitments to guarantee out of London investment, improve scheduling of regional programming and strengthen local accountability. It also involves a greater standardisation of regional programme hours, and therefore some reduction in output that is less well funded and shown at the least accessible times. The ITC considers that the emphasis should be on quality rather than quantity and that the public interest is best served by better funded, more accessible programming. The Department has no plans to intervene.</p>

	<p pid=".663W.6/2">The Government only intervene in the sports broadcasting market to ensure that all television licence holders have free-to-air access (on the BBC, the ITV Network or Channel 4) to those sporting occasions which are considered to have true national resonance. These events are listed under Part IV of the Broadcasting Act 1996. The list was revised and extended in 1998 and is kept under review.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.6/3">Cricket test matches played in England and the final, semi-finals and matches involving Home Nations teams in the Cricket World cup are listed. Test matches played overseas are not listed because, while of great interest to cricket fans, they do not strike a chord with the general viewer in the same way as events which are listed.</p>

	<p pid=".669W.8/2">Our minimum requirement for concessionary fares schemes has, since June 2001, guaranteed at least half-fares for pensioners and disabled people on local buses to the benefit of seven million people overall, some of whom will be travelling in rural areas. This is an improvement on the previous position where 16 mostly rural areas had no concessionary travel scheme at all. From April 2003 the Travel Concessions (Eligibility) Act 2002 will ensure that men aged 60&ndash;65 will also receive the benefit of concessionary travel. Further, our Rural Bus Subsidy Grant has provided an additional 1,800 services upon which concessionary travel is possible. Many of the innovative schemes supported by our Rural Bus Challenge competition also provide further scope for take-up of concessionary travel.</p>

	<p pid=".673W.6/1">Up to June 2002 the DTI used a variety of waste contractors, who operated their own waste minimisation techniques, including minimisation at source, re-use, recycling and energy recovery. An accurate figure for the proportion of waste recycled, composted, reused and segregated from 1997 to date could be obtained only at disproportionate expense. However, I attach a high importance to monitoring and improving on current waste outputs, and a total waste management tender has been developed and has taken effect from July 1 2002. The successful contractor will be required to report on the percentage of waste streams that are recovered, while ensuring that the following targets are achieved:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".673W.6/4"> <th><i></i></th> <th><i> Recovery target (As a percentage of waste handled)</i></th> <th><i>Recycling/ composting target (As a percentage of waste recovered)</i></th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>

			<tr pid=".673W.6/8"> <td>2003&ndash;04</td> <td>70</td> <td>55</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".673W.6/9"> <td>2004&ndash;05</td> <td>80</td> <td>65</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".673W.6/12">Initially the targets will be achieved through paper and card recycling but the tender specification requires the contractor to investigate innovative techniques for recovering other waste streams, including metals, plastics and glass.</p>

	<p pid=".674W.0/1">In line with the end-June benchmark date set in the WTO Doha ministerial declaration for the exchange of initial requests between WTO members for liberalisation under the current General Agreement on Trade in Services negotiations, the European Community's requests were finalised on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-28">28 June</phrase> following consultation between the Commission and member states. They are being transmitted this week to individual WTO members to whom they are addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".674W.0/2">In the case of the EC's major trading partners, both developed and developing countries, requests are made in most services sectors. The main exceptions are health, education (with the exception of the US, to whom requests are made in the area of privately funded higher education services) and audio-visual services.</p>
	<p pid=".674W.0/3">As regards developing countries, requests are made in line with their levels of development. In the case of the least developed countries, requests are in the main limited to three to five sectors, with the sectors identified being those where liberalisation is most likely to contribute to development&mdash;primarily business, financial, telecommunications and transport services.</p>
	<p pid=".674W.0/4">Throughout the requests, the EC emphasises that it is not seeking the dismantling of public services or the privatisation of state owned companies. The requests also make clear that the EC recognises the importance of liberalisation being underpinned by domestic regulatory frameworks designed to ensure the achievement of public policy objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".674W.0/5">The requests are not demands. They are an opening basis for negotiations. Nor, as WTO Director-General Mike Moore has confirmed last week, do requests constitute agreements by WTO members to include such sectors as part of their commitments.</p>

Any discharges relating to the storage of waste are similarly regulated by the Environment Agency. Wastes in liquid form may be high, intermediate or low level. Low level liquid wastes are discharged from a number of sites throughout the country under authorisations granted by the Environment Agency under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993.</p>

Carrying out effective risk assessment on end-users before making the export licensing decision is the surest way of preventing arms from falling into the wrong hands. Nevertheless, the Government remain committed to carrying out end-use monitoring in those circumstances where this will genuinely add value to our efforts to minimise the risk of misuse and diversion and where such monitoring is practicable. Our overseas posts have standing instructions to report on allegations of misuse of any UK-origin defence equipment.</p>

	<p pid=".678W.6/2">The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HSWA) applies to residential homes, boarding schools and university halls of residence. HSWA sets out general health and safety duties which employers, the self-employed and people in control of premises have towards their employees, and others who could be affected by the work activities. It is the 'umbrella' legislation under which other, more specific, health and safety regulations are made. The Health and Safety (Enforcing Authority) Regulations 1998 allocate inspection responsibility for different types of undertakings to either the Health and Safety Executive or to the Local Authority. Inspectors are appointed under Section 19 of HSWA to carry out inspection and enforcement in relation to health and safety.</p>

Such assessments will be used to determine, in consultation with individual councils, the timing and content of subsequent audit and inspection activity. In the case of good performing authorities, we anticipate reduced levels of inspection from next year.

	<p pid=".682W.5/1">I am pleased to announce that we are today issuing a consultation document covering reform of the system we use to distribute grant to English local authorities. The consultation will run for 12 weeks over the summer. I have placed copies of the document in the Library of the House. It is being sent to all local authorities, as well as other stakeholders, and is available via the internet.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.5/2">The system covers key services including education, personal social services, police, fire and a wider range of other responsibilities. It accounts for distribution of over 85 per cent. of the resources government provides for those services, currently about &pound;36 billion per year. Its importance to local government, other stakeholders and public service delivery across the country means that we want a full and open public consultation on the new system.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.5/3">The consultation document sets out the Government's broad objectives for the reform. Responses to the 2000 Local Government Finance Green Paper showed that a big majority of the local government respondents wanted the new system to continue to be based on formulae. The Government announced in the 2001 Local Government White Paper &quot;Strong Local Leadership&mdash;Quality Public Services&quot; that we agreed. We want new formulae that are fairer, simpler; more intelligible and more stable.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.5/4">We are concerned to make sure that the new system is more easily understood that the old one. It is important to improve transparency and accountability. Clearly, it will never be possible to achieve a very simple system; the complexity of the issues it seeks to address see to that. The extremely technical nature of the issues means that there is frequently no clear-cut optimum solution. But we believe it is possible to make improvements.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.5/5">In considering how to reflect local authorities' relative needs and circumstances, a range of factors have to be taken into account. Three elements seem fundamental:</p>
	<p pid=".682W.5/6" class="indent">1. a basic amount per head of population (or other relevant unit cost);</p>
	<p pid=".682W.5/7" class="indent">2. an appropriate emphasis on the need to tackle deprivation; and</p>
	<p pid=".682W.5/8" class="indent">3. the variation in pay costs between different areas of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.5/9">Because deprivation and pay components are core drivers of the costs authorities face in most areas and the problems the system will need to address, we are particularly keen to see them separately identified in formulae. However, that is not to say that other components (for example sparsity) are unimportant. Indeed, they may be a key consideration in particular instances. They will be clearly identified where they form part of a formula.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.5/10">The document sets out options for the various components. These options are detailed to the level of showing the effects on each relevant local authority, comparing against the baseline of 2002&ndash;03. This will enable authorities and other interested parties to form views about the desirability of each option.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.5/11">However, these figures are not those that will appear in the 2003&ndash;04 local government finance settlement later this year. They will differ both because of changes in the overall funding totals (as a result of the spending review) and as a result of changes to data such as population that will not be available until the autumn. Waiting until that information is available would severely restrict the time available for consultation and in any case would not improve the consultation because we want responses to be about the system and the formulae, rather than on the basis of yearly variations in data. So the options are presented in terms of changes from the 2002&ndash;03 local government finance settlement.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.5/12">We will not necessarily limit ourselves to building the new system from the choices specifically consulted upon here. It is likely that other options will be put forward in response to this consultation, and we will not exclude those before taking decisions. Our conclusions arising from the consultation and further consideration of options will be incorporated in the provisional settlement for 2003&ndash;04 that will be published at the usual time, towards the end of the year. Following a further period of consultation, final decisions will be announced in early 2003 in time to take effect in the 2003&ndash;04 financial year.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.5/13">This is a difficult and important issue. The Government recognise that pragmatic decisions will be needed to produce a workable system, and the complexity and variety of the pressures that are put upon the system from all sides means that it will not be possible for all authorities to get what they want from this process. So no authority should feel that it is guaranteed to get a bigger share of the fixed amount of resources the system can distribute. But the Government are seeking a fairer distribution of resources which takes account of today's pressures on local government and the particular needs of areas of deprivation. We will consider all of the views that are put forward, and weigh them up carefully before decisions are taken.</p>

	<p pid=".685W.6/1">The Department worked with the task force of the Advisory Committee on Packaging (ACP) in the production of a report, published in November 2001, which looked at packaging material flows from raw material manufacturer to seller, and at packaging waste flows from point of discard to ultimate disposal or recovery. This report, which is publicly available, also looked at the likely level of packaging waste arising in the household stream and which would increasingly have to be recovered if likely higher targets are to be met.</p>
	<p pid=".685W.6/2">New packaging waste recovery targets have not yet been finalised but for the purposes of the estimates in the task force report an overall recycling target of 60 per cent. is assumed to have to be met in 2006. The tonnage needed to meet such a target would be in the region of 5.7 million tonnes and the task force report concludes that as much as 65 per cent. of the additional tonnage required may need to be recovered from the household waste stream.</p>

To date, some &pound;1,515,014 of UK public expenditure has been made. The Department routinely assessed all applications for funding under the Objective 5b programme. Such assessment included consideration of the business plan, the environmental impact and the profitability of the project. At the time of assessment and approval of the Holsworthy Biogas project, it was not recognised that restrictions on disposal of waste food would prevent the plant being licensed. However, following the recent risk assessment commissioned by the Government we are reviewing the Animal By-Products legislation with a view to permitting the treatment of catering waste in composting and biogas processes.</p>

	<p pid=".686W.5/1">The Government are committed to the principle that developed countries, as the biggest emitters, should take the lead in reducing emissions. We are therefore working to secure ratification and early entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, under which developed countries take on legally binding emission reduction targets for the period 2008&ndash;12. Developing countries are covered by the Kyoto Protocol. Under its terms, they do not have legally binding greenhouse gas emission targets but must take steps to limit their emissions and to report on their efforts. A number of developing countries have already ratified the Protocol and we hope that as many developing countries as possible will follow that lead. The Government hope that the entry into force of the Protocol will provide the basis on which we can enter into an international dialogue with developed and developing countries (or &quot;all countries&quot;) on future action to tackle climate change. In due course, all countries that emit significant quantities of greenhouse gases will need to take action if we are to meet the UN Climate Change Convention's objective of stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a safe level.</p>

	<p pid=".691W.2/1">Last year I launched three litter initiatives: the &pound;1 million Pathfinder Programme, which calls upon local authorities to come up with innovative ways of tackling litter; the development of a voluntary code of best environmental practice for the fast food industry; and a review of the litter legislation to see what is, and what is not working. The results of Pathfinder will be available this time next year; the fast food code of practice is currently being drafted; and the litter legislative review has been subsumed into the Government's public space cross-cutting review, which will report this autumn.</p>
	<p pid=".691W.2/2">The responsibility for enforcing the legislation on fly tipping rests with the Environment Agency and local authorities. The Department fully supports the work and actions taken by these bodies in order to tackle the problem, including prosecutions where appropriate. The Department is currently looking at the legislative framework on fly tipping to see if any changes can be made to help local authorities and the Environment Agency in their role. The Environment Agency are also working to establish an environmental crime unit that will bear down on problems such as fly tipping through, among other things, improved intelligence and surveillance systems.</p>
	<p pid=".691W.2/3">In October 2001 we published a joint consultation document with DTLR on measures to remove abandoned and untaxed vehicles from the streets more quickly and, for the longer term, bring forward changes to vehicle registration and licensing procedures to ensure greater accuracy of DVLA's vehicle record. Regulations to reduce the statutory notice periods after which local authorities can remove abandoned vehicles were laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-19">19 March</phrase> and came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-09">9 April</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".692W.2/1">DEFRA undertakes and commissions a large volume of research every year, some of which deals with issues of human behaviour and the environment. At any one time the Department is funding around 1500 research projects supporting around forty individual policy subject areas. Details of all ongoing DEFRA research projects and research results can now be found on the Department's searchable website at: http:// <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/research/default.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/research/default.htm</a>. For example, the Domestic Noise Complaints Study published in 1999 can be found on the site. The results of the recent Noise Attitudes Survey (which was published by DEFRA on May 20 2002) will also be available on the site shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".692W.2/2">In addition, the Department sponsors the Sustainable Development Research Network (website: <a href="http://www.sd-research.org.uk/">http://www.sd-research.org.uk/</a> ), which aims to identify and promote research which integrates environmental, social and economic objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".692W.2/3">The Environment Agency has completed numerous research projects on various aspects of human behaviour and the environment. A main focus of research to date has been to understand values and perceptions of the environmental business of the Agency, for example in relation to industry, nuclear waste management and water management. The specific themes covered by the research are:</p>
	<p pid=".692W.2/4" class="indent">public participation and involvement: a major project on Evaluating Methods for Public Participation has recently been completed; the Agency is also participating in a European research project on Enhancing Transparency and Public Participation in Nuclear Waste Management. A number of smaller projects have looked at issues such as information provision and public participation in specific decision-making contexts.</p>
	<p pid=".692W.2/5" class="indent">policy advocacy processes: a three-year project is being developed which looks at policy advocacy in different areas, such as waste.</p>
	<p pid=".692W.2/6" class="indent">partnership: as well as a number of local projects, a national project is being developed to equip staff to work better in partnerships with other stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".692W.2/7" class="indent">risk communication: research has explored public perceptions of environmental risks and approaches to risk communication, particularly in relation to risks related to industrial pollution and flooding; the Agency also participated in a major project with other government departments and agencies looking at the Social Amplification of Risk.</p>
	<p pid=".692W.2/8" class="indent">social impacts: a number of projects focusing on the impacts of flooding, including health impacts and impacts on vulnerable groups, are due to be completed this year;</p>
	<p pid=".692W.2/9" class="indent">understanding social perspectives on the environmental issues that concern the Agency: the perspectives of different stakeholders were explored in a recent project on Industrial Pollution Communication;</p>
	<p pid=".692W.2/10" class="indent">social aspects of sustainable development: two projects on integrated appraisal (one on Appraisal Methods and one looking at integrated appraisal in the context of the Water Framework Directive) have contributed to knowledge in this sphere.</p>
	<p pid=".692W.2/11">More information on some of these findings are available at &quot;<a href="http://www.webookshop.com/ea/rdreport">www.webookshop.com/ea/rdreport</a>&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".692W.2/12">Additionally, the Agency has recently carried out a research study into people's behaviours and attitudes to household waste. This research showed that people would recycle more of their rubbish if it were made easier to do so by local councils. [Almost 9 out of 10 people claim that they would be likely to separate rubbish for recycling if the council provided appropriate containers]. Results were published in May this year and are available at &quot;<a href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/subect/waste/232021/239537/296229">www.environment-agency.gov.uk/subect/waste/232021/ 239537/296229</a>&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".692W.2/13">DEFRA does not collect or hold data on research undertaken or commissioned by other Government Departments on this issue.</p>

The group noted progress on the Krebs field trial, including recent proactive culling operations in Cornwall and Gloucestershire, and discussed future work programmes. There was discussion of arrangements to increase collections in the Road Traffic Accident survey of badger carcases for TB and for clearing the backlog of epidemiological questionnaires (TB99) following delays arising from the foot and mouth disease emergency. Consideration was given to additional measures to combat the spread of bovine TB and action outside trial areas. The group reviewed its programme for analysing and interpreting data from cattle TB 'hotspots' outside trial areas, data on inconclusive reactors and data on the gamma interferon test, and confirmed its intention to finalise a report by the autumn.</p>
	<p pid=".694W.14/3">Various research activities were discussed including a report on post genomic research on M.bovis at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) and recently published research by VLA on the pathology in cattle following M.bovis BCG vaccination against experimental bovine TB.</p>

	<p pid=".696W.2/41">A proportion of TB incidents remain unclassified, awaiting the results of culture tests which can take several months. Therefore the number of confirmed incidents, for 2002 in particular, will currently be under-recorded. For instance, 9 per cent. of new TB incidents in January to May 2002 were unclassified when the data were extracted.</p>
	<p pid=".696W.2/42">The number of TB incidents depends on the number of tests carried out and on the nature of the testing regime at the time (as well as on the underlying prevalence of the disease). In 2002, testing resources are being concentrated on herds which are overdue their tests (because of the backlog following the foot and mouth disease outbreak) and which have therefore had a longer period than usual in which to contract the disease. Those currently being tested also contain a higher than usual proportion of high risk herds. During the FMD outbreak, TB testing was significantly reduced and necessarily targeted to higher risk herds e.g. those tested following routine inspection of animals at slaughterhouses. At any time, the more herds are tested, the more likely you are to find TB.</p>
	<p pid=".696W.2/43">It is therefore very difficult to assess the underlying trends at this time.</p>
	<p pid=".696W.2/44">Any reactors, inconclusive reactors and direct contacts still awaiting removal and slaughter on the date of the data download were not included in the tables. These only show the number of reactors, inconclusive reactors and direct contacts that had been slaughtered as at <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-11">11 June</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".700W.0/1">The Department supports several programmes to change individual behaviours in relation to the environment. They develop work undertaken before the General Election by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. These include work by the Energy Saving Trust, Environmental Campaigns Limited (incorporating the former Tidy Britain Group and Going for Green organisations), and the recipients of Environmental Action Fund grant. The &quot;Are you doing your bit?&quot; campaign was launched by the former Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in 1998 and covers both environmental and transport topics. We have also consistently taken advantage of opportunities to promote individual action in other projects and public engagements, notably in the build-up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development.</p>

The Director General also has powers to make enforcement orders to secure companies' compliance with their conditions of appointment or with other requirements.</p>

	<p pid=".700W.6/4">Any mergers between existing water and sewerage companies would result in the loss of a comparator and are automatically referred to the Competition Commission. In considering the effects of the proposed merger on the public interest, the Commission is required by the Water Industry Act 1991 to have regard to the principle of avoiding prejudice to Ofwat's ability to make comparisons between different water enterprises.</p>

	<p pid=".703W.2/2">Assessment of the condition of these habitat types, or of specific features within them, is carried out in a number of contexts.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.2/3">Countryside Survey 2000 has provided a national assessment of long-term changes in the extent and condition of habitats. The Department is funding further research to improve understanding of the underlying reasons for this and the results are expected in Spring 2003. The report and related material can be found at <a href="http://www.cs2000.org.uk">www.cs2000.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.2/4">As part of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UKBAP) individual action plans have been published for upland and lowland calcareous grassland, upland heathland and bogs. Each plan contains an assessment of the factors affecting the habitat, targets for maintenance or improvement of the habitat condition and actions aimed at achieving these targets. Implementation of the action plans is being led by the statutory conservation agencies in partnership with the relevant Government and voluntary sector bodies. Further information on the plans can be found at <a href="http://www.ukbap.org.uk">www.ukbap.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.2/5">English Nature also assess the condition of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). Where SSSIs are not in a favourable condition, a number of factors may contribute to this. Agriculture is a major factor, particularly grazing intensity. Overgrazing or undergrazing can adversely affect the condition of sites. We are addressing these problems on a number of fronts. For example, we continue to expand agri-environment schemes, which can assist many of these habitats. In addition, the sheep quota purchase scheme announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-26">26 June</phrase> is an example of the development of more direct and innovative measures to help alleviate grazing pressure.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.2/6">Grazing regimes also affect these habitats on common land. We shall shortly announce our plans for improving the legislation to enable better management of common land.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.2/7">In relation to SSSIs, English Nature are also able to enter into management agreements with land managers to prevent activities which can be damaging to these sites. Currently 201,000 hectares are subject to such agreements.</p>

	<p pid=".704W.4/1">The security situation has deteriorated sharply since the Maoists abandoned peace negotiations in November last year. Since then an estimated 3,000 people have died as a result of the conflict.</p>
	<p pid=".704W.4/2">The Government holds all the district towns, but large parts of the countryside are under effective control of the Maoists. The intensity of the conflict varies, with the Maoist &quot;heartland&quot; areas of the mid-west and far-west most affected.</p>
	<p pid=".704W.4/3">The war is generally regarded to be unwinnable by military means alone, as the country is ideally suited to guerrilla warfare. There are growing concerns about human rights violations on both sides. In recent weeks, there has been a noticeable decline in confrontations between the Security Forces and the Maoists, but this lull in the fighting is believed to be temporary.</p>
	<p pid=".704W.4/4">While there is no direct threat against development workers, there are indirect risks of being caught in crossfire. Restrictions on movement, especially of people and supplies, and the withdrawal of Government counterparts in rural areas, means that Government development programmes in some remote areas has effectively stopped. None the less, Maoists are allowing continuation of development projects in some areas under their control, particularly where work is strongly supported by local communities.</p>
	<p pid=".704W.4/5">UK funded development assistance is continuing, albeit more slowly. In addition to existing work on rural livelihoods, rural infrastructure, health and governance, my Department is implementing a programme of short- term support for people in conflict affected areas, and are working to re-orientate the entire DFID programme towards conflict resolution.</p>

	<p pid=".707W.5/1">Property rights are an important element in poor people's range of livelihood assets and can assist directly in processes that eliminate poverty. My Department has made a series of assessments of property rights, mainly concerning land ownership and housing, in both rural and urban contexts.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.5/2">Research has been undertaken, for example, to establish the range of tenure arrangements available to poor people in developing countries that allow people degrees of security and freedom in where they live, from which they can build their livelihoods for the future. The results are published by Intermediate Technology Development Group Publishing under the title &quot;Land, Rights and Innovation&quot;. This tenure framework is currently being used to observe how poor people manage to establish their property rights in 15 developing countries. The work is being shared with the UN and World bank.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.5/3">My Department is promoting better awareness of the role of property rights in poverty reduction through core funding support to UN-Habitat who are running their Global Campaign for Secure Tenure in 11 developing countries, and core funding support to the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions which is based in Geneva. Support is also provided to the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.5/4">Secure land and property rights for the poor are essential if they are to contribute to and benefit from economic development, and to unlock access to essential services and to finance for small-scale investment opportunities of all kinds. Many poor people have no or insecure property rights and can fall victim to forced evictions by landlords governments and commercial land development in both town and country.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.5/5">Secure rights can be provided through various forms of tenure, and DFID is working actively throughout the world, especially in Africa and with global institutions to help developing countries establish effective policies and institutions to deliver secure property rights to the poor and prevent evictions. In those cases where we have a direct role to play, DFID projects have helped governments to deliver secure rights and land titles to the poor; I would highlight:</p>
	<p pid=".707W.5/6" class="indent">South Africa were we spent &pound;5.9 million up to 2000&mdash;a further phase is now being prepared in addition to a project earmarked at &pound;5 million to help the SADC countries strengthen property rights for the poor throughout the Southern African Region</p>
	<p pid=".707W.5/7" class="indent">Guyana where a &pound;4.39 million project is due to end in 2003</p>
	<p pid=".707W.5/8" class="indent">Support to Kenya Land Reform &pound;0.47 million</p>
	<p pid=".707W.5/9" class="indent">Uganda Land Laws (Tenure) &pound;1.35 million</p>
	<p pid=".707W.5/10" class="indent">Asian Coalition for Housing Rights &pound;2.19 million</p>
	<p pid=".707W.5/11" class="indent">Property Rights in Croatia &pound;0.59 million</p>
	<p pid=".707W.5/12" class="indent">10 projects in the former Soviet Union totalling &pound;3.53 million, and</p>
	<p pid=".707W.5/13" class="indent">&pound;295,000 through NGO partners in Bangladesh, directly assisting the poor access land and secure their rights.</p>
	<p pid=".707W.5/14">41 projects both small and large with a total value of &pound;34.34 million have been contributing to our overall efforts over the last five years. In addition DFID supports research projects into how best to enable access to land and secure property rights for the poor in different contexts in various countries; in the same period there have been 19 research projects with a total value of &pound;2.5 million.</p>

Any additional costs for this support are reimbursed by the agency concerned.</p>

	<p pid=".718W.12/1">The Department has carried out no specific assessment of links between staffing levels and the quality of teaching and research in universities. However, the recently completed QAA eight-year cycle of subject reviews in higher education, which included an assessment of teaching quality, has identified only 1 per cent. of unsatisfactory provision. In addition, the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise showed that 55 per cent. of research staff now work in departments which contain work of international excellence (rated five or five-star) compared with 31 per cent. in the previous exercise in 1996. Staffing levels in higher education have increased by 10 per cent. over the last five years and so have student numbers.</p>

	<p pid=".721W.2/1">Information is not available exactly as requested. The available information relates to the social class breakdown of the Age Participation Index (API) from 1990 to 2000, and is shown in the table. The API is defined as the number of UK domiciled under 21 initial entrants to full-time and sandwich courses expressed as a proportion of the averaged 18 to 19-year-old population. The sharp rise in participation rates in the early 1990s reflects the expansion of the higher education sector during these years. There was an increase in entrant numbers in 1997 related partly to the funding arrangements for higher education, with students choosing to enter HE rather than wait until 1998. There was a corresponding reduction in 1998 before the entry rates started to increase again in 1999.</p>
	<p pid=".721W.2/2">The Government are committed to raising the participation rates for people from less affluent family backgrounds, and has introduced Excellence Challenge, including the AimHigher campaign, which is targeted at raising attainment and aspirations among young people who traditionally would not consider going to university.</p>

	<p pid=".722W.2/1">We have acknowledged the historic gap between funding in schools and further education (FE) colleges and we have pledged to bring up the levels of support for FE to ensure upward convergence of funding between the two sectors. We will do this over time and as resources allow. However, as independent corporations, it is for each FE college to agree annual pay rises and conditions of employment with its staff in the context of the overall resources available to it.</p>
	<p pid=".722W.2/2">We are investing significant funding in the FE sector. An additional &pound;314 million is available for FE this year compared with 2001&ndash;02 and by 2003&ndash;04, total funding for FE will be up by 26 per cent. in real terms since 1997, with total funding per full-time equivalent student up by 16 per cent. over the same period. Separate to any general pay rise a FE lecturer may receive, the Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI) provides &pound;311 million over the period 2001&ndash;04 to reward excellent teaching. The substantial additional investment we are making in the sector should help the FE sector support the pay aspirations of their staff.</p>

UCAS do not routinely identify students from areas such as Jarrow, which lie within local authorities. The information is based on the social class of the applicants, which will not necessarily equate directly to levels of family income.</p>

	<p pid=".724W.3/1">One of the principles of the Connexions strategy is to take account of the views of young people both individually and collectively. This includes young people from faith communities and the organisations that represent them. Nationally, the Connexions Service National Unit has discussed and agreed with the Catholic Education Service the basis on which Connexions personal advisers work in Catholic schools and colleges. Locally, Connexions partnerships work with many different voluntary and community groups which support young people, including faith-based organisations. There are examples across the country of faith based organisations being involved in local Connexions management or advisory groups. Some local faith based organisations receive grants from Connexions Partnerships. Organisations with a faith basis also feature prominently among the National Voluntary Youth Organisations (NVYOs) who receive funds from the Department's NVYO Grant Scheme. This is administered by the Connexions Service National Unit to support personal development programmes for young people.</p>

	<p pid=".725W.0/1">In the last financial year (2001&ndash;02) the Connexions Service spent approximately &pound;320 million. Of that, &pound;107 million was incurred by Connexions Partnerships&mdash;i.e. those fifteen that were operating during 2001&ndash;02; twelve of which were in place for the full 12 months and three for the last seven months. The remainder was used to support careers services in those areas where Connexions was not operational and to fund central costs such as the training of personal advisers.</p>
	<p pid=".725W.0/2">We do not collect information centrally on the exact amount of funding transferred to other bodies, mainly because the variety of different ways in which Partnerships operate makes it impractical to do so. It is for each Connexions Partnership to determine, within broad guidelines, how best to use its funding to meet identified local needs. In some cases this involves sub-contracting work to other organisations such as voluntary and community bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".725W.0/3">According to the latest available information (relating to the situation at the end of March 2002), the 15 Connexions Partnerships operational at that time employed 3,933 staff&mdash;this includes all staff involved in the delivery of Connexions i.e. delivery staff (mainly personal advisers), managerial and administrative staff, etc.</p>

	<p pid=".725W.3/1">In the current financial year (2002&ndash;03), Connexions has been allocated &pound;446 million from central Government funds. The majority of that funding (ie &pound;359 million) is devolved to Connexions Partnerships through the main Connexions grant&mdash;this relates to the 27 partnerships operational at the start of 2002&ndash;03 and the remaining 20 due to become operational during the financial year. The remainder of the overall Connexions budget is used to support careers services in those areas where Connexions is not yet fully operational and to fund central costs such as the training of personal advisers.</p>
	<p pid=".725W.3/2">We do not have an exhaustive list of other sources of income but they include the European Social Fund, the National Lottery, the private sector, the Learning and Skills Council and local partners such as local authorities, etc. The strength of Connexions is its ability to pull together the contributions of a range of local partners to eliminate any gaps and duplication in the provision of support for young people. Much of the contribution of local partners is, therefore, of an &quot;in-kind&quot; nature rather than simply financial.</p>
	<p pid=".725W.3/3">We are not yet able to quantify how much funding Connexions partnerships expect to receive in 2002&ndash;03 from sources other than the main Connexions grant. However, in the last financial year (2001&ndash;02), operational Connexions Partnerships received approximately &pound;1.4 million in cash plus an estimated &pound;8 million in contributions &quot;in-kind&quot; from sources other than the main Connexions grant. Early data from partnerships' business plans show that those figures are expected to be substantially greater this year.</p>
	<p pid=".725W.3/4">We do not collect information centrally on the exact amount of funding disbursed to other organisations, mainly because the variety of different ways in which partnerships operate makes it impractical to do so. Once their funding has been allocated to them by DfES, Connexions Partnerships have the flexibility to use it in whatever manner they judge to be the most effective in relation to their local circumstances. In some cases this involves delegating work to partner organisations such as voluntary and community bodies. In those cases, the Connexions Partnership raises a grant or sub-contract with the organisation concerned in order to control the flow of funding.</p>

	<p pid=".732W.5/1">From 1996 to 2001 the number of offending behaviour programmes successfully completed by prisoners has risen almost fivefold despite a 19 per cent. growth in the prison population over the same period. Last year 16,000 prisoners achieved basic skills certificates, there are no firm indications yet that the number of prisoners is significantly affecting the provision of rehabilitation programmes in prisons. However, it is inevitable that at times of high population pressure such provision may be disrupted. The Prison Service will continue to do everything possible to minimise this.</p>

	<p pid=".734W.11/1">The Government are committed to making race equality and community cohesion central to their aims.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/2">We are committed to outlaw discrimination in employment by December 2003 as required by European Employment Directives.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/3">The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-02">2 April</phrase>. It places a general duty on specified public authorities to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination&mdash;and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/4">Public bodies were required to have in place by <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-31">31 May</phrase> this year, realistic and timely plans to show how they intend to comply with the general duty.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/5">The Government are working right across Departments on a number of measures to promote community cohesion. Our aim is to build communities where:</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/6" class="indent">there is a common vision and a sense of belonging for all people;</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/7" class="indent">there is an appreciation of people's different backgrounds and circumstances;</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/8" class="indent">where those from different backgrounds have similar life opportunities; and</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/9" class="indent">strong and positive relationships are being developed between people from different backgrounds in the work place, in schools and within neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/10">Following the disturbances, we rapidly set up a programme of summer activities. This summer, we are running an enhanced programme of activities&mdash;both on community cohesion and to address issues of street crime. For example, a &pound;16 million summer activities programme run by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) also includes community cohesion criteria alongside other aims.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/11">We are also engaging young people through other measures. For example, &quot;Beyond Labels&quot;&mdash;an international conference for young people, supported by the Home Office, will take place in Leicester in July.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/12">We commissioned the Community Cohesion Review Team&mdash;chaired by Ted Cantle&mdash;to explore the causes of last summer's disturbances and the independent report made several, wide-ranging recommendations. The Government published its initial response to the Cantle Report in December last year.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/13">The recommendations are being taken forward by the Ministerial Group on Community Cohesion, which I chair. The group is advised by a Community Cohesion Panel, chaired by Ted Cantle. The panel comprises people with expertise in relevant areas&mdash;including young people and the community. The Government announced membership of the panel on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-22">22 May 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/14">A new Community Cohesion Unit has been established to support the Ministerial Group and Panel&mdash;and to work across Government to deliver community cohesion.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/15">Community Facilitators are now in place in 34 towns across the country to bring together local people, foster dialogue and encourage the search for positive solutions to local problems. Community Support teams are also being provided to Bradford, Burnley and Oldham, to address community cohesion issues and each town has also produced an outline community cohesion action plan.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/16">To assist local government address community cohesion issues. The Home Office has published&mdash;jointly with the Commission for Racial Equality, Local Government Association and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;draft guidance for local authorities. This sets out a series of practical steps that they (and other local agencies) can take to address community cohesion issues. A copy of this has been placed in the Library. We are seeking views on it by <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-14">14 August</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.11/17">The Government believe that community cohesion is an issue that all local authorities need to urgently consider. Some local areas will conclude that their existing policies and community planning systems are satisfactory. But the Government believe that the majority will need to amend some of their policies in order to build effective community cohesion. A small number of areas may identify a wide range of issues which are best addressed by a specific and focused action plan. A number of areas other than Bradford, Oldham and Burnley have already indicated their commitment to developing such plans.</p>

	<p pid=".737W.8/3">Under the PNB Agreement, all officers in the federated ranks will get an increase in basic salary of &pound;402 from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, on top of the annual police pay award made in September each year.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.8/4">In addition, from the same date federated ranks' officers who have spent a year at the top of their pay scales will be eligible for a competence-related payment of &pound;1,002 a year. We expect at least 75 per cent. of those eligible to get the payment. There will also be a new special priority payment scheme, under which officers in qualifying posts will get a payment of between &pound;500 and &pound;3,000 normally, up to &pound;5,000 exceptionally.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.8/5">The PNB Agreement also delivers a number of significant improvements in the management and deployment of police officers, including more flexible rostering and use of part-time working as well as better management of ill health and poor attendance.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.8/6">The Secretary of State has also received representations from a number of police officers, including the Chief Constable of Thames Valley about the pay and allowances which officers receive.</p>

	<p pid=".738W.2/1">Special constables are a key element of our police reform agenda, and we are already working, with stakeholders, to increase the recruitment and retention of special constables as part of that process. Indeed, we announced a package of measures on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-18">18 June</phrase> that are designed to improve the way specials are recruited, managed, deployed and how their welfare is considered within forces.</p>
	<p pid=".738W.2/2">We are particularly keen to improve liaison with employers and encourage them to support employees who are specials. Specials bring skills and experience back to their workplace which makes them of real value as an employee. Later this year the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Home Secretary will publish a joint discussion paper on fiscal and other changes we can make to promote community service, including service as a special constable. A new headline role has also been published, focusing on intelligence-led patrolling and crime reduction initiatives. And a new national foundation training package for specials was issued last month. Revised Conditions of Service Regulations and new Conduct Regulations are in preparation.</p>
	<p pid=".738W.2/3">Central to this whole process will be Home Office/Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) good practice guidance covering all aspects of the recruitment, management and deployment of specials, which will be issued by the end of the year. And we will be identifying a number of &quot;Specials champions&quot; to support this work and to take forward initiatives to help reverse the decline in specials numbers. We have set aside &pound;300,000 to support these champions and we are working very closely with ACPO in this area.</p>

	<p pid=".742W.3/1">Alongside effective enforcement in the United Kingdom (UK), we have recognised that there is the need to develop intelligence and undertake joint operations against trafficking networks in transit countries in the Balkans region. We have provided a total of &pound;200,000 to fund various local anti-trafficking projects in the Western Balkans region implemented under the auspices of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe's democratisation arm, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.3/2">In 2000 we set up Reflex, our multi-agency task force on organised immigration crime, which co-operates with overseas law enforcement partners on the disruption of organised criminal groups intent on trafficking. Led by the National Crime Squad (NCS), Reflex brings together all the key agencies, including the Immigration Service, the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), the security and intelligence agencies and key police forces including the Metropolitan police, Kent and the British Transport police.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.3/3">The UK has posted nine Immigration Liaison Officers to disrupt trafficking and organised immigration crime in and around the Balkans region. European Union (EU) partners have made similar deployments. We co-operate directly or through Europol with EU law enforcement agencies and those in EU accession states. Since April 2001 this has resulted in the disruption of 14 trafficking organisations and 67 arrests. 323 individual facilitators have been arrested.</p>
	<p pid=".742W.3/4">Project Immpact, a UK led EU immigration initiative to assist the Bosnia State Border Service, has reduced the flow of illegal migrants through Sarejevo airport by 90 per cent. UK and EU experts assist the anti-trafficking EU STOP teams in Bosnia which have identified 185 victims of trafficking involved in prostitution over the past year.</p>

	<p pid=".753W.2/1">The UK is leading the co-ordination of international anti-narcotics assistance to Afghanistan (which is the source of 90 per cent. of the heroin consumed in the UK). This involves working with international partners and organisations to build law enforcement capacity in Afghanistan to interdict opiates and undermine those criminal organisations engaged in drug trafficking. The international effort is also directed towards eradicating opium poppy and creating alternative livelihoods for Afghan opium farmers.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.2/2">The UK has also sought to assist drug interdiction efforts of Afghanistan's neighbours. The FCO's Drugs and Crime Fund provided anti-narcotics assistance of around &pound;1.5 million in 2000&ndash;01 to Iran, Pakistan and the Central Asian Republics. We have also provided assistance to Balkan countries through which heroin is trafficked from Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.2/3">Colombia, Peru and Bolivia together produce virtually all of the world's cocaine. The UK is working closely with the Governments of each of these states to tackle the problem by supporting projects to build local law enforcement capability. Current projects include the provision of training and equipment in all three countries.</p>

If the doubt is resolved in a person's favour, payments are restored and arrears paid. Decisions on suspending payment of benefit are discretionary. There is no formal procedure for revising such decisions, but they can be changed in the light of any relevant new evidence or information submitted to the Department.</p>

	<p pid=".758W.2/1">It is a long-standing principle that people claiming jobseeker's allowance have a responsibility to confirm their continuing entitlement to benefit by attending the Jobcentre fortnightly and also by keeping other appointments arranged to help with their job search. Where a person may have failed to meet those obligations, it is right that payment of benefit should be suspended.</p>
	<p pid=".758W.2/2">When making a decision about suspending benefit, staff in Jobcentres have access to the &quot;Suspension and Termination Guide for Decision Makers&quot; and the &quot;Labour Market Conditions Guide&quot; which gives advice on procedures. This advises that where someone has failed to attend an appointment, benefit should be suspended at the end of that day. The person may then contact the office within five days to show good cause for failing to attend. Examples of good cause include domestic emergencies, attending a job interview or illness. If good cause is demonstrated, then the suspension is lifted and payment made. If not, then the claim is terminated from the day of non-attendance.</p>
	<p pid=".758W.2/3">No departmental research has been undertaken on suspensions of benefit and no information is collected centrally on the number of people who have had their benefit suspended.</p>
	<p pid=".758W.2/4">We keep all our policies under review. However, we have no plans to change the current arrangements under which benefit can be suspended.</p>

	<p pid=".762W.8/1">The Ambition initiatives are demand-led, and are aimed at training disadvantaged people for good quality jobs. The availability of jobs is key to their success. In the latter part of 2001 there was a reduction in the global workforce in the IT sector as a number of key companies scaled down their operations. At the same time, a number of American companies which employ people in the UK froze recruitment as a result of the events of <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-11">11 September</phrase>. The Ambition:IT initiative was consequently put on hold in December 2001 so that the Department could conduct a review of the skills requirements of the IT sector in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".762W.8/2">The review has concluded that the demand for people with IT skills is now most acute in the public sector. The programme has therefore been refocused on this sector and we now expect to start new deal participants in training from this autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".765W.0/2">The Government believe that work is the best route out of poverty and research has shown that nine out of ten lone parents want to work, either now or in the future. Lone parents face problems on moving into work due to balancing their work life with their caring responsibilities. That is why we are providing extra help to reduce these inequalities and offer lone parents a range of choices to gain more independence by moving into work.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.0/3">We have introduced measures to make work pay, including the working families' tax credit and the national minimum wage. From 2003 a lone parent working 16 hours a week will have a guaranteed minimum income of &pound;179 a week. We have also provided help to make work possible for lone parents through the child care tax credit and the national child care strategy, which since 1997 has created new places for the benefit of more than 900,000 children.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.0/4">The New Deal for Lone Parents is available to all lone parents and offers a personalised service of advice and guidance. Personal advisers help with identifying child care, give advice on work and training opportunities and continue to offer in-work support once the lone parent is in work. Nearly 300,000 lone parents so far have participated in the programme and over half have found work. The programme now offers greater training flexibility by funding work-focused courses in skills that will be of benefit in the labour market, such as basic IT skills. In addition, everyone who joins any of the New Deal programmes is now assessed for literacy and numeracy needs and offered high quality learning opportunities.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.0/5">We are continuing to roll out compulsory personal adviser meetings for lone parents claiming income support to ensure that they are aware of the range of help and support we have introduced to enable them to move into work. Our new Jobcentre Plus offices are providing an integrated service to ensure that lone parents receive the benefits they are entitled to and the help they need to move into work.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.0/6">The Government are encouraging everyone with the necessary qualifications, including lone parents, to enter further and higher education. For further education institutions in England <sup>1</sup> we have increased the ring-fenced budget for child care funds by 20 per cent. to &pound;36 million in 2002&ndash;03. In higher education in England <sup>1</sup> , lone parents have access to a range of support including child care grants, a grant for school meals and a grant towards travel, books and equipment.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.0/7" class="indent"><sup>1</sup> Further and higher education arrangements in Scotland and Wales may differ from those in England.</p>

The sub-regions Merseyside; South Yorkshire; Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly; and West Wales and the Valleys are the four UK areas that currently have full Objective 1 status. Northern Ireland and the Highlands and Islands did not qualify for Objective 1 funding in the current round but are in receipt of transitional funding and are included for completeness.</p>

However, they are not collected at Parliamentary Constituency level for a number of reasons. In particular, most of the statistics collected at a local level are based on administrative areas such as local authorities, and these do not always share boundaries with Parliamentary Constituencies.</p>

	<p pid=".773W.2/6" class="indent">The House of Commons Library provides a tailored service for MP's. Statistics that can often be provided at Parliamentary Constituency level include economic status (employment, unemployment and inactivity), claimant count, employee jobs, average earnings and Census data. Also, many statistics that are available at a lower level can generally be aggregated to Parliamentary Constituency level. This includes the increasing range of statistics at ward level becoming available through ONS's Neighbourhood Statistics Service (<a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/">www.statistics.gov.uk/</a> neighbourhood).</p>

	<p pid=".773W.11/1">The working tax credit, which includes support for the costs of eligible child care, is designed to encourage people to take up work and to make work pay for low-income households. So entitlement to it will depend on working the required number of hours. It will be based on the hours normally worked by the claimant and will be able, as a result, to continue providing support for short periods when the claimant is unable to work their usual hours. It will also be able to cover short gaps between jobs.</p>
	<p pid=".773W.11/2">For longer breaks in employment, we will continue to provide help through other channels, especially for lone parents who need to use child care. Lone parents can receive financial assistance through the Adviser Discretion Fund, where up-front child care costs represent a barrier to moving into work. From April 2003 there will also be a dedicated child care co-ordinator in every Jobcentre Plus district to help jobseekers with children to access information on child care provision in their area.</p>

	<p pid=".785W.15/1">The Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 required the police and probation services (the 'responsible authorities') in each of the 42 areas of England and Wales to establish arrangements for assessing and managing the risks posed by sexual and violent offenders. These arrangements include those who have been detained in respect of a conviction by a hospital or guardian ship order within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983. These arrangements were introduced in April 2001. Scope to disclose information to the responsible authorities only exists within current legislation, where there is a high risk of harm to self or others, consistent with the Human Rights Act. Responsibility for the arrangements rests with those in charge of care and treatment, bearing in mind the facts of each individual case. The Department will be issuing guidance to ensure that all mental health trusts are appropriately represented in the arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".787W.8/1">Increasing participation in sport has a role to play in raising the rates of physical activity. Low rates of physical activity together with an unhealthy diet contribute to increased rates of obesity. Major cross- Government work has been put in place to raise the level of physical activity, and participation in sport. This includes: &pound;581 million from the new opportunities fund for a physical education and sports programme; the national active sports programme and the Department's recently announced &pound;2.5 million programme of community physical activity pilots, which will test out different community approaches to increasing physical activity. All pilots will involve sport action zones.</p>
