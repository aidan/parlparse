	<p pid="b.25W.2/1">Ofcom published a consultation on the 872/917 MHz band in August 2009 which set out two general approaches to authorisation of these bands:</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.2/2" class="indent">A full licensing approach: under which a single or limited number of licences are awarded, e.g. a national licence that would support a wide area network applications such as mobile communications, potentially awarded via an auction;</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.2/3" class="indent">A light regulatory approach: in which individual transmitters are authorised without limitation on their numbers, either under a licence exempt regime, or under a light licensing regime. Both machine to machine and smart grid would be potential technologies under this approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.2/4">In the responses to the consultation, stakeholders were split between the uses of this band and it was unclear which approach should be taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.2/5">Ofcom's future work on this band will include further analysis into the potential to allocate spectrum in the 872/917 MHz band on an unlicensed or lightly-licensed basis for machine to machine and smart grid applications.</p>

	<p pid="b.25W.5/1">I have noted that the European Commission's Radio Spectrum Policy Programme, currently under discussion with member states, has raised the possibility of considering the release of spectrum immediately below 790 MHz, known as the second digital dividend, in the longer term. This spectrum is used in the UK, as in other countries in the EU, for digital terrestrial television services. Any proposal to change must take into account the full economic and social impact of both the future use of the spectrum, and of making the change.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.5/2">The timing of any formal discussion on the so-called 700 MHz band is unclear, and is not the immediate focus of the proposed Commission Radio Spectrum Programme or any other initiative we know about. I would expect the Commission to produce a thorough impact assessment, including the potential costs and benefits, as the basis for any future discussions of potential alternative uses of this spectrum.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.5/3">There is much else in the Radio Spectrum Policy Programme that needs to be agreed and delivered in the short term and I expect that to be the focus in the immediate future.</p>
	<p pid="b.25W.5/4">I have yet to have any discussions with interested parties in the UK specifically on the second digital dividend, but will continue to engage with current spectrum users and those interested in future use of the spectrum so as to make sure that the UK can derive the most economic and social benefit from its use.</p>

	<p pid="b.30W.6/1">Spending plans announced in the Government's 2010 spending review require a robust framework of spending control. The end-year flexibility (EYF) system which allows departments and the devolved Administrations to carry forward unspent budget provisions into future years to discourage wasteful end-year spending has in practice, led to accumulated stocks that would further increase the deficit if they were spent. Therefore the Government plan to replace the existing EYF system from 2011-12. Further details of the new system will be set out later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.43W.3/1">In England, the farming industry has made a commitment to lead the way to drive down agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the Greenhouse Gas Action Plan. A framework for action was published in February 2010, and this outlines how reductions could be made through more resource-efficient practices, i.e. measures that involve simple changes at minimal or no extra cost to farmers. As well as enabling a reduction in emissions, these practices would also improve farmers' competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="b.43W.3/2">The industry partnership is now working towards the publication of a Delivery Plan, which will set out how they intend to put the action plan into practice. DEFRA has advised and encouraged the partnership to produce a robust plan, and have supported its development by loaning a policy official to coordinate and facilitate its preparation.</p>
	<p pid="b.43W.3/3">As outlined in the business plan, DEFRA is committed to supporting and developing British farming, and this includes providing the necessary advice and knowledge to enable the sector to reduce on-farm emissions through measures that make good business sense. Additional financial support that DEFRA provides includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.43W.3/4" class="indent">investing &#163;12.6 million over a five-year period, in partnership with the devolved Administrations, to improve the agriculture Greenhouse Gas Inventory, that aims to strengthen our understanding of on-farm emissions, thus enabling better targeting of actions and fully capturing the positive actions that farmers are already taking;</p>

	<p pid="b.49W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-17">17 February 2011</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.49W.2/2"><i> </i>Before a non-European Union (EU) country is approved to export to the EU, the exporting country must have acceptable disease status, the recognised standard for relevant control authorities and guarantees from the country with regard to compliance with EU import rules and results of EU missions to these countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.49W.2/3">All meat imported from non-EU countries must be accompanied by veterinary certification. Imports of products of animal origin (POAO) and live animals are checked at approved facilities at border inspection posts (BIPS).</p>
	<p pid="b.49W.2/4">All consignments of imported meat have a documentary check on the veterinary certification, and an identity check, to match the goods to the certification. A minimum of 20% of consignments of meat imported from non-EU countries undergoes a physical check by an official veterinary surgeon, and this rises to 50% for poultry and game. All consignments of live animals are physically checked. A random, non-discriminatory proportion (3%) of animals entering via a BIP are tested as part of compliance checks.</p>
	<p pid="b.49W.2/5">DEFRA's International Disease Monitoring (IDM) monitors outbreaks of high impact diseases around the world. Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is among those diseases of major concern. When DEFRA becomes aware of a new animal disease outbreak in another country, we carry out an initial rapid risk assessment of the risk of introduction of that disease into the United Kingdom (UK) and may produce a preliminary outbreak assessment. If this preliminary assessment concludes that a full qualitative risk assessment is not justified, then we will publish the preliminary outbreak assessment here:</p>
	<p pid="b.49W.2/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimai/diseases/monitoring/index.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimai/diseases/monitoring/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="b.49W.2/7">There is a continual low risk of introduction of FMD into the UK and the EU from any affected region, including Africa, the Middle East and Central/East Asia, primarily through illegal imports. We currently consider that generally there would be a negligible risk of the introduction of FMD from an affected country through legal imports because of the system of approval and certification laid down in EU law for countries approved for export to the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.49W.2/8">Since November 2010 to today, South Korea has reported over 140 outbreaks of FMD strain O across the country in a re-emergence of disease. North Korea has similarly recently reported FMD. The disease is considered endemic in several other Asian, African, Middle Eastern and South American countries and there are a few countries which are officially FMD free either with or without vaccination. Closer to home, outbreaks are occurring regularly in North Africa (eg Egypt and Libya) and the Middle East (eg Iran and Iraq) and Turkey has reported over 1,400 outbreaks of FMD in the last 12 months. In January 2011, an incursion in Bulgaria just two kilometres from the Turkish border was reported to the European Commission. This incursion in wild boar and domestic animals has led to special protective measures being put in place by the EC for Bulgaria, in terms of biosecurity, transport and the movement of susceptible animals and POAO.</p>
	<p pid="b.49W.2/9">UK Border Agency (UKBA) is responsible for anti-smuggling checks at the Great Britain border on POAO. The Department for Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland (DARDNI) is responsible for these controls in NI. Personal imports of meat and dairy products (which may carry diseases such as FMD) are banned from outside of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.49W.2/10">UKBA frontline staff are employed as multifunctional anti-smuggling staff with a responsibility to tackle a range of risks at the border, including dealing with illegal imports of POAO. Enforcement staff are deployed on a mobile and flexible basis and, at major ports and airports, are supported by the use of detector dogs specifically trained to detect POAO, as well as X-ray technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.49W.2/11">DEFRA and UKBA continue to work together to ensure that UKBA delivers an enforcement strategy that targets the entry routes that pose the greatest threat of introducing animal disease (including FMD) and responds flexibly to changing patterns in risk. DEFRA provides UKBA with a bespoke global risk map that categorises countries into Red, Amber and Green risks according to the prevalence of animal diseases that can be transmitted in products. UKBA use this map to inform their risk-based targeting activities. Countries considered endemic for FMD and other diseases, such as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever, are always on the list, but the list of countries is constantly being updated. UKBA also use historical data on type of products seized, high-risk routings and origin, methods of concealment and risk trends; specific intelligence; results of operational checks; and information from other enforcement agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.49W.2/12">UKBA also responds to specific disease notifications, such as serious disease outbreaks, for which they can increase controls if necessary. For example, following the recent outbreak of FMD in Bulgaria (part of the EU), we have worked with UKBA to reduce the risk of unregulated products entering the UK from the affected region. This is an exceptional measure as customs powers do not normally apply to intra-EU movements of POAO goods.</p>
	<p pid="b.49W.2/13">The re-emergence of FMD in Asia and the Middle East and the incursion into Bulgaria highlights in particular the importance of farmer awareness in observing good biosecurity and reporting disease promptly, as well as how problematic disease control is, once it has emerged. We will of course continue to monitor the situation and work closely with UKBA to reduce the risk of disease incursion.</p>

There have been no sales to community or charitable bodies in this period.

	<p pid="b.62W.11/2">The European Parliament proposal that meat from animals slaughtered without stunning should be labelled was made during the Parliament's First Reading consideration of the Commission proposal for a Food Information Regulation. In December, the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council met to reach a political agreement on the Food Information Regulations but member states did not discuss the European Parliament's proposed amendment on method of slaughter labelling. As a result this proposal is not included in the common position that will be submitted to the European Parliament shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.62W.11/3">The European Parliament will undertake its Second Reading on the Food Information Regulation in the coming months in its Environment Committee and then in Plenary. If the amendment on welfare labelling is retained by the European Parliament in its Second Reading, the proposal will then go to Council for consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.62W.11/4">We believe people should know what they are buying in shops or when they are eating out, and I have had discussions with the supermarkets, the food and catering industries about the role labelling and point of sale information can play in giving consumers a greater choice. All agree this is a difficult, complex and sensitive issue that cannot easily be resolved in view of the many competing interests involved. We will be looking at this further but, will need to consider the impact of existing EU meat labelling Regulations, before any final decisions are taken.</p>

	<p pid="b.64W.6/1">Funding is available under DEFRA's Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) to improve the competitiveness of agriculture and forestry; improve the environment and the countryside; improve the quality of life in rural areas and encourage diversification of economic activity. Applicants for RDPE funding can include farmers, rural businesses, rural community groups and voluntary organisations, all of which have already benefited from this funding. Farmers also benefit from funding under the single farm payment.</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.6/2">Rural enterprise is also able to benefit from the advice and support provided by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills programmes, and considerable work has been done to ensure that the Regional Growth Fund will be accessible to rural (as well as urban) areas which are currently dependent on the public sector. This will help them make the transition to sustainable private sector-led growth and prosperity. Rural communities and rural voluntary groups can access relevant funding from both national and local government sources open to civil society bodies. In addition, DEFRA and the Department for Communities and Local Government is currently supporting the town and parish council sector through funding to support community empowerment. Local authorities have, of course, recently been notified of their formula grant allocations for the coming financial year, and this funding is intended to enable them to meet the needs of all their residents, rural and urban.</p>
	<p pid="b.64W.6/3">While the Government recognise that some of their funding can be beneficial for businesses and communities, they believe that the most serious barriers hindering economic development in both rural and urban areas are the top-down restrictions affecting planning, growth and local action. The Government are seeking to remove these barriers, for example through the provisions of the Localism Bill, in order to enable local authorities and empower communities to address their own locally- identified needs. The creation of Local Enterprise Partnerships will help with the drive to sustainable local growth, focusing on local economic priorities.</p>

A further survey was started in 2010, but the results are not yet available.</p>

This is due not just to the freezing conditions of December, but also to the rapid thaw which occurred in January. These conditions were extreme and should not impact on the long-term viability of the sugar beet industry in the UK, the prospects for which I believe remain strong.</p>

	<p pid="b.67W.8/1">Game management can be important for the management of land through the provision of cover for wildlife, and through the creation and management of habitats such as woodland, grouse moors, beetle banks and hedgerows. 96% of grouse moor sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) are now in favourable or recovering condition, an increase from 51% in 2006. This is a reflection of moorland managers' awareness of the importance and sensitivity of upland biodiversity.</p>
	<p pid="b.67W.8/2">Game management can also be important for the rural economy. While no specific assessment has been made of the contribution of game management to upland areas, shooting contributes in the region of &#163;1.6 billion to the rural economy, and supports the equivalent of around 70,000 full-time jobs; much of this contribution will be in upland areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.68W.9/1">The programme to control ruddy ducks in the UK has been delivered by the Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA) as part of an EU LIFE funded project. During the course of the programme, the project manager has made regular reports that provide information regarding the effectiveness of the eradication programme and which are available on the FERA website.</p>
	<p pid="b.68W.9/2">The reporting so far received indicates the ruddy duck population in the UK has been reduced from approximately 4,400 at the beginning of the programme in September 2005, to the most recent estimate of less than 120 birds. DEFRA considers therefore that the programme to date has been very effective.</p>

	<p pid="b.75W.5/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-06">6 May 2010</phrase>, the Ministry of Defence has not revoked any regulatory measures. However, we are currently reviewing our secondary legislation in two areas. Firstly, regulations governing the Service Pensions Order (war pensions) and the Armed Forces and Reserve Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) are reviewed annually and updated where necessary. Additionally the AFCS will be re-made with amendments following the Review by Admiral the Lord Boyce. The statutory instrument giving effect to this will be laid on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-28">28 February</phrase>. Also being reviewed are existing Defence byelaws and other local instruments in relation to land occupied for Defence purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.75W.5/2">Although regulations made by the MOD rarely impact on business, our reviews are being conducted with a view to rationalise the regulatory burden within these policy areas.</p>

The order serves mainly to update the two redundancy compensation schemes for the regular armed forces, and formed part of our current review of the legislation governing the Service Pensions and Compensation Schemes. Additionally three new prerogative instruments were made on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-15">15 December 2010</phrase> in which the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975 (AFPS 1975) was updated for each of the services. The amendments covered matters such as providing that death benefits in respect of service personnel who die while holding acting rank are based upon that rank, regardless of how long the acting rank was held. AFPS 1975 is set out in an Order in Council for the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, a Royal Warrant for the Army and a Queen's Order for the RAF.</p>
	<p pid="b.75W.8/2">One other Order-in-Council relating to Defence matters was also made during this period. This was the Visiting Forces (Designation) Order 2010 (SI 2010/2970), which added Algeria to the existing list of those countries deemed to be Visiting Forces under the terms of the Visiting Forces Act 1952. This was required following the conclusion of a defence co-operation accord between the United Kingdom and Algeria in October 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.81W.3/2">Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) originally developed a technology for the rapid detection of bacteria, which was then made available to Acolyte under licence. Acolyte, with external venture capital, looked to exploit this technology for the detection of the MRSA bacterium in the civilian sector via the BacLite product.

	<p pid="b.88W.0/1">Cannabis has been controlled as a Class B drug under Schedule 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 for most of the past 30 years. Its classification was downgraded to Class C in January 2004. In January 2009 it was reclassified to Class B.</p>
	<p pid="b.88W.0/2">Estimates on the prevalence of cannabis use are provided in the annual Drug Misuse Declared publication that covers the extent and trends in illicit drug use among 16 to 59-year-olds in England and Wales, which is based on British Crime Survey (BCS) data on self-reported drug use in the last year.

	<p pid="b.88W.0/4">In April 2009, questions were introduced into the BCS to ask respondents the age at which they first took cannabis. With the inclusion of questions from April 2010 to ask respondents the age at which they last took the drug, the BCS will be able to provide some estimates for use of cannabis over time.</p>

	<p pid="b.88W.3/4">The Government are taking forward work to increase the evidence and intelligence dividend from defendants and prisoners in terrorism cases. Sections 71-74 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 give a statutory basis for defendants and prisoners to provide evidence and intelligence which may assist the prosecution in return for immunity from prosecution or a possible reduction in sentence. The Government are looking at ways in which the use of these provisions in terrorism cases to support our prosecution efforts can be increased. Given different judicial systems this will be different from the US-style 'plea bargaining'.</p>

	<p pid="b.95W.3/1">Police and crime commissioners will be elected with a force-wide mandate, and represent all citizens in tackling crime and anti-social behaviour. In order to give effect to this the police and crime commissioners (PCC) must ensure that their Police and Crime Plan is tailored to reflect the needs of the varied and diverse communities within the force area. The plan will be prepared in consultation with those communities, and in consultation with the chief constable.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.3/2">The new Police and Crime Panels will also help to reflect the diversity of different force areas, as local councils will decide amongst themselves how best to appoint councillors that best represent the force area's population.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.3/3">The Government have made provision in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill that in larger force areas with more than 12 councils (such as the Thames Valley force area) each council will be allocated one seat on the panel, ensuring that all councils enjoy representation on it.</p>
	<p pid="b.95W.3/4">The Government envisage that police and crime commissioner salaries will vary to reflect the differing size and complexity of forces, and has asked the Senior Salaries Review Body for advice on this.</p>

	<p pid="b.100W.5/2">Beyond the work of the UK Border Agency War Crimes Team, no official data are collated that would enable an assessment of the number of war crimes suspects in the UK. Between August 2005 and June 2010, the UK Border Agency War Crimes Team recommended that immigration action be taken against 495 suspected war criminals. Subsequent to these recommendations action was taken against 360 suspects, of which; 19 were removed from the UK, 18 departed voluntarily and 75 were denied entry to the UK. Of the remaining 248 suspects; 139 were refused British Citizenship and remain in country with indefinite leave to remain, 35 were refused asylum and granted discretionary leave pending removal and 74 were appealing their decision and/or awaiting further action against them.</p>

	<p pid="b.111W.5/1">The rules governing the use by local authorities of housing receipts are to remain substantially unchanged after the introduction of self-financing in April 2012: 25% of receipts arising from Right to Buy (and similar) sales may be invested by local authorities in any capital project; receipts from all other Housing Revenue Account sales (including vacant land) may be used for affordable housing or regeneration projects, or used to pay off associated debt.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/2">Last year, the Department consulted on reforms to the Housing Revenue Account, and the paper discussed the proposal that local authorities should also retain the remaining 75% of housing receipts provided they were used for affordable housing or regeneration projects. 37 authorities are recorded as supporting it. As part of the spending review, it was decided that this option would not be pursued at this time. Instead we have added new compensation in the self-financing valuation to cover the loss of income from those homes. This has reduced the amount of debt councils will take on under self-financing by &#163;862 million, which compares with total pooled receipts last year of &#163;133 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.111W.5/3">No decision has been made on whether to change the proportion of housing receipts local authorities may retain after 2015.</p>

	<p pid="b.114W.12/7">This Government's assessment is that there would be little impact to <i> (a)</i> congestion, <i> (b)</i> pollution arising from traffic and <i> (c)</i> the use of alternative forms or transport. This is because the choice of transport mode is affected by more than just parking policies. The promotion of electric cars will reduce pollution.</p>
	<p pid="b.114W.12/8">The last Government's parking rules have led to more parking problems on local roads, clogging up residential roads with parked cars and making drivers cruise the streets hunting for a precious parking space. Parking problems on new developments can cause knock-on effects to surrounding neighbourhoods. Such spill-over creates street congestion that can cause blind spots for pedestrians, hinder emergency vehicles and lead to 'fly parking'. In this context, the new Government's more sensible parking policies will reduce the scope for congestion.</p>

	<p pid="b.118W.5/1">The sequential approach set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 3, published in 2000, put a strong emphasis on the allocation and use of brownfield sites before any other land. However, it also recognised that in some circumstances such sites may not be ready for development, and so the policy set out criteria against which other housing sites should be considered. It did not rule out the use of greenfield sites. The current policy, in Planning Policy Statement 3, published in 2006, whilst not retaining the sequential approach, continues to prioritise previously developed land for development.</p>
	<p pid="b.118W.5/2">We have announced our intention to streamline all national planning policy, including housing policy, into one document-the National Planning Policy Framework-to ensure it is fit for purpose. My Department has invited individuals and organisations to put forward their ideas on the priorities and policies we might adopt to produce a shorter, more decentralised and less bureaucratic national policy.</p>

	<p pid="b.119W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.3/2">The Department is clear that the most vulnerable, including those with health conditions and disabilities, should be protected. Benefit entitlement is not based on an individual's diagnosis or the nature of their particular disabling condition, but whether a person meets the entitlement conditions set down in the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.3/3">From October 2008 the current range of incapacity benefits (incapacity benefit, severe disablement allowance and income support where paid on the grounds of incapacity/disability), was replaced for new claimants with the employment and support allowance (ESA). The approach is based on the principle that a health condition or disability should not automatically be regarded as a barrier to work. We know that people with the same diagnosis can have very different effects in terms of their ability to work; therefore entitlement to ESA is based on the functional effects of an individual's condition rather than the condition itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.3/4">Jobcentre Plus offers support, including assistance in making benefit claims, to customers across all working age benefits before they are referred to the Work programme. From <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-04">4 April</phrase>, the support that Jobcentre Plus delivers to customers will be more flexible. Jobcentre Plus managers and advisers will be able to judge which interventions will help individual customers most cost effectively whilst meeting local need.</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.3/5">Additionally in October 2010 we launched Work Choice, a new pan-disability supported employment programme for disabled people. Accessed primarily through Jobcentre Plus Disability Employment Advisers, Work Choice provides an improved customer experience through tailored support. It targets those customers who face the most complex barriers in reaching or retaining employment, including self-employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.3/6">Cold weather payments are targeted at those most vulnerable to the cold; older people in receipt of pension credit, disabled adults and children and families with children under five who are in receipt of an income-related benefit. These are individuals who spend more time in doors and often have restricted mobility because of age or disability. We do not record the type of illness or disability a disabled adult or child has for the purposes of cold weather payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.3/7">As part of the spending review the cold weather payment was permanently increased from &#163;8.50 a week to &#163;25 a week. During the recent extreme cold spell over 17 million cold weather payments were made at an estimated cost of &#163;428 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.3/8">The extensive exemption arrangements we have in England currently mean that around 90% of all prescription items (in 2009) are already dispensed free of charge and around 60% of the English population do not pay prescription charges due to:</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.3/9" class="indent">age (under 16 or 60 or over)</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.3/10" class="indent">receipt of a qualifying income-related benefit (e.g. income support)</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.3/11" class="indent">qualifying under the NHS Low Income Scheme (provides help with health costs, including free prescriptions, based on a means tested assessment. The NHS Low Income Scheme is available to anyone who has capital below the specified limits).</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.3/12" class="indent">having a specified medical condition, and holding a medical exemption certificate (the list of specified medical conditions is very limited. It does not include sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia).</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.3/13">The current prescription charge is &#163;7.20. Prescription Prepayment Certificates (PPCs) offer savings to those who must pay for their prescriptions and need them frequently. A three-monthly prescription pre-payment certificate (PPC) is &#163;28.25. A 12-month PPC is &#163;104.00 and saves money if more than 14 items are needed in 12 months. PPCs can be purchased by 10 monthly direct debit instalment payments. PPCs allow anyone to obtain all the prescriptions they need for &#163;2 per week.</p>
	<p pid="b.119W.3/14">When taking PPCs into consideration, 94% of all prescription items dispensed are not charged for at the point of dispensing.</p>

	<p pid="b.122W.2/3">Since December 2010, the pilot scheme is being tested in five trailblazing local authority areas, with two more sites to come on stream in the spring. During the trail blazers, disabled people accessing the Right to Control will be informed how much money they are eligible to receive for their support. They will be able to choose, in consultation with the public authority delivering a particular funding stream, how that money will be used to meet agreed outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.122W.2/4">The pilots are due to run until December 2012. They will be fully evaluated with a view to making a decision on whether and how the Right to Control should be rolled out nationally. A final report is expected in the spring of 2013.</p>

	<p pid="b.125W.8/1">Unlicensed medicines are used within a professional and medicines legislative framework. Unlike licensed medicines, unlicensed medicines are not required to be assessed for safety, quality and efficacy. Therefore, for public health reasons their supply is limited by law to where there is a special need of an individual patient. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) interprets special need to be the clinical need of the individual patient that cannot be met by an available equivalent licensed product; cost and convenience are not considerations. Current General Medical Council ethical guidance on the use of unlicensed medicines states a doctor should always consider using a licensed medicinal product in the first instance. Such decisions need to be made in discussion with the patient concerned. Most, if not all, national health service trusts have established policies controlling the use of unlicensed medicines as it is considered that prescriber liability is significantly increased in such situations.</p>
	<p pid="b.125W.8/2">Medicinal products are regulated by a system of licensing defined in European Union legislation. Before approval of a licence, new medicines are required to demonstrate acceptable standards of safety, quality and efficacy such that the benefit/risk consideration for use of the product in the claimed indication is positive. The MHRA acts on behalf of the UK Licensing Authority to approve new national marketing authorisations in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.125W.8/3">Prior to licensing, new medicines undergo clinical trials to determine their efficacy and safety profile. These trials are in a carefully controlled sample of the intended treatment population. Because there is a gap between what is known at the time of licensing from clinical trials and what will happen in the 'real world' once larger numbers of patients in the target population start using the medicine, the safety of all medicines after licensing is monitored.</p>
	<p pid="b.125W.8/4">It is a legal requirement for pharmaceutical companies to develop risk management plans for all newly licensed medicines. This uses all available data at the time of licensing to identify what is and is not known about the safety of the medicine, to plan what may need to be done to extend safety knowledge and to propose measures to minimise any known risks to patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.125W.8/5">Once a medicine is marketed, the MHRA keeps all medicines authorised in the UK under close and continuous scrutiny using a number of robust procedures and a wide variety of data sources. These include spontaneous adverse drug data received from health care professionals and patients through the UK's Yellow Card Scheme, from clinical trials and epidemiological studies, worldwide published medical literature, data from the manufacturer and information from worldwide regulatory authorities. If a new safety issue is identified action is taken where appropriate to minimise risk to patients, optimise safe use and issue updated prescribing advice.</p>

	<p pid="b.133W.2/1">The consultants' contract ensures that senior doctors' time is used in the best interests of patients, by providing flexibility in job planning agreements between individual doctors and trusts. Job plans are agreed in partnership between individual consultants and their employers, and should be consistent with organisation objectives and patient and service needs. Individual job plans should set out the consultant's duties and include the agreed split of time between direct clinical care, supporting professional activities and other activities. They should be reviewed annually.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.2/2">There is no set allocation for supporting professional activities in the contract, but a guide toward a &quot;typical average&quot; of 2.5 programmed activities (or 10 hours) for a full-time consultant. Some consultants may have more; others, including newly qualified consultants, may require and receive less. This flexibility is intentional and the precise number and ratio is a matter for local determination as part of the consultant job planning process.</p>
	<p pid="b.133W.2/3">The consultants' contract ensures that senior doctors' time is used in the best interests of patients, by providing flexibility in job planning agreements between individual doctors and trusts.

The report of the review &quot;Liberating the NHS: report of the arm's- length bodies review&quot;, published in July 2010, concluded that the Institute did not satisfy the criteria for continuing as an arm's-length body.

	<p pid="b.140W.8/1">&quot;Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS&quot; described our plans to establish a comprehensive system of general practitioner (GP) consortia to commission most national health service services, supported by and accountable to a new independent NHS Commissioning Board. We believe that effective GP commissioning will require the full range of clinical and professional input alongside that of local people. Hospital doctors, nurses, pharmacists and allied health professionals and others all have a vital role to play and a real opportunity to develop services and improve the health outcomes of their local populations. GP consortia will need to ensure that they have access to and draw upon the necessary expertise of those working in health and social care to ensure that they have the most appropriate specialist input into their commissioning decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.140W.8/2">The Health and Social Care Bill therefore proposes to place a duty on the NHS Commissioning Board and GP consortia to make arrangements to ensure that they have appropriate advice from professionals with expertise in health. We believe, however, that the Board and consortia should have the freedom and flexibility to decide how best they exercise this duty, rather than rely on rigid prescribed structures.</p>

	<p pid="b.146W.2/1">No specific assessment of the provision of respite care for families of profoundly mentally ill or physically ill people has been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.146W.2/2">However, the Government's updated Carers Strategy, 'Recognised, valued and supported: Next steps for the Carers Strategy', sets out the overarching priority areas for action over the next four years. This includes the provision of personalised support for carers and those they support, and supporting carers to remain mentally and physically well. This may include carers of people with mental or physical illnesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.146W.2/3">The Carers' Strategy also identified that &#163;400 million will be made available for carers' breaks over the next four years (2011-12 to 2014-15). This funding will be made available in primary care trust (PCT) allocations. This funding is not ring-fenced so that local government and the national health service have as much discretion as possible, to concentrate resources on local priorities. These funds can therefore be used to provide breaks for all carers, including those supporting people who are mentally or physically ill.</p>
	<p pid="b.146W.2/4">The 'Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2011/12' makes clear that the additional funding in PCT baselines to support the provision of breaks for carers should be pooled budgets with local authorities to provide carers' breaks. For 2011-12, PCTs should agree policies, plans and budgets to support carers with local authorities and local carers' organisations, and make them available to local people.</p>
	<p pid="b.146W.2/5">The Department for Education announced in December that they are providing over &#163;800 million over the next four years for short breaks for families of disabled children as part of the new Early Intervention Grant. The Government will be providing &#163;198 million/&#163;202 million/&#163;206 million/&#163;210 million for short breaks over the next four years including the Child Trust Fund money of at least &#163;20 million each year. The Early Intervention Grant is not ring-fenced and it will be for local authorities to determine how they use that resource to best effect, including what services would be funded for families with disabled children.</p>

	<p pid="b.155W.2/1">There are no official estimates of people who are yet to receive any aid in Pakistan following the devastating flooding in July-August 2010. The United Nations Floods Emergency Response Plan targeted 14 million people and is 64% funded. This means not all projects under the plan will reach all intended beneficiaries. The UK was the third largest contributor to the UN appeal and led efforts to lobby the international community to respond generously to the floods.</p>
	<p pid="b.155W.2/2">The Department for International Development's (DFID's) team in Pakistan closely monitors the relief and early recovery effort. When isolated communities have been identified as being in dire need of assistance, DFID has lobbied the relevant authorities to undertake more detailed needs assessments and respond as appropriate. DFID has also been an active supporter of organisations working to identify vulnerable populations and takes steps to ensure they receive appropriate aid.</p>

	<p pid="b.158W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) strongly supports the creation of UN Women. Baroness Verma represented the UK at the official launch of UN Women on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-24">24 February</phrase> in New York, and had discussions with Michelle Bachelet, its executive director, beforehand to underline DFID's support. DFID's long-term funding commitments to UN Women will depend on a strategic plan that sets out a clear results framework outlining targets and expected impact. The strategic plan is due in June this year. In the meantime we have offered UN Women transitional funding and a secondment to allow them to set out the strongest possible plans for their work.</p>

	<p pid="b.158W.6/2">Our overseas CT priorities are driven by a comprehensive analysis across Government of the threat to the UK and our interests. We are rigorous in ensuring that our CT priorities and projects reflect current analysis of the threat.

	<p pid="b.161W.5/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) Counter Terrorism and Radicalisation programme is part of wider Government spending on counter terrorism. Within the framework provided by Contest, it focuses on overseas interventions, including building capacity overseas to help counter the risks to the UK and UK interests from international terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="b.161W.5/2">The FCO's programme expenditure on counter terrorism increased in real terms each year between 2003-04 and 2009-10, except in 2006-07, as seen in the following table. Comparisons with financial years before 2003-04 are not possible because a separate programme budget for counter terrorism did not exist until 2003-04.</p>
	<p pid="b.161W.5/3">The current budget of &#163;38 million will be sustained in cash terms for 2011-12, so we are forecasting a slight real terms decrease in expenditure. This will be managed through greater efficiency and a tighter focus in the programme. The FCO is playing its part in reducing the public expenditure deficit, and is ensuring its expenditure on this priority for the UK is spent in an efficient and focused way.</p>

We also encourage UK missions overseas to seek out appropriate opportunities to promote human rights and prevent discrimination on any grounds, including due to sexual orientation or gender identity. Posts have discretion to use their own funds to promote these rights through hosting events, working with non-governmental organisations, or supporting local activities.

Friend the Foreign Secretary has made clear, there is now a precious moment of opportunity for the people of Egypt to achieve a stable and democratic future.

	<p pid="b.165W.2/1">We have been clear that the political process in Egypt must be broad-based and include opposition figures to produce real political change. The Muslim Brotherhood is one part of the mosaic of political voices in Egypt and our embassy in Cairo has previously had contact with its members in their positions as elected representatives in the Egyptian parliament. We will continue to have contacts with those members of the Muslim Brotherhood who are, or who are likely to be, part of the political dialogue process in Egypt and who have agreed to operate within that process.</p>

	<p pid="b.172W.5/1">We have continuing concerns about media freedom in Russia. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary raised the unresolved murder of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya with Foreign Minister Lavrov on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-15">15 February 2010</phrase>. During the annual UK- Russia Human Rights Consultations in Moscow on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-18">18 January 2010</phrase> we expressed concern about the low success rate in prosecuting perpetrators of assaults on journalists. We supported EU High Representative Baroness Ashton's statement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-17">17 November 2010</phrase> regarding assaults on journalists in Russia. In addition, we fund the work of the independent media agency Caucasian Knot which provides balanced and objective online reporting of news from across the Caucasus region. We will continue to raise issues relating to freedom of expression with Russia both bilaterally and with our EU partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.172W.5/2">We remain concerned about limits on freedom of expression in China. The Foreign Secretary raised the case of imprisoned author and Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo during his discussions with Chinese Vice-Premier Li in January. We continue to call for his release. During the UK-China Human Rights Dialogue on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-13">13 January 2010</phrase> we raised our concerns about freedom of the media, citing cases of foreign journalists who have come under pressure from China for their reporting, and the blocking of some international and domestic websites. We will continue to work bilaterally and with the EU to raise our concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.172W.5/3">The Government's support for free and independent media in Afghanistan includes supporting the development of the Government Media and Information Centre, which has improved the Afghan Government's relationship and interaction with the independent media, as well as providing training in practical skills to members of the independent media. This support has also been replicated at provincial level in Helmand, through building the Governor's communications capacity. We have provided funding of &#163;837,570 for projects to support Afghan independent media to develop their infrastructure and content. We continue to monitor Afghan media freedom and work with the Afghan Government and international partners to ensure the free and independent media in Afghanistan is protected and strengthened according to the Constitution and Afghan law.</p>
	<p pid="b.172W.5/4">In 2010 media freedom in Pakistan continued to improve, though there were several high profile cases where journalists were attacked by unknown assailants. Several journalists were also killed in the border areas in terrorist incidents. Constitutional reforms passed last year include a new article which guarantees the right of every citizen to freedom of information. This was partly influenced by a UK-funded project to promote the value of improved freedom of information in support of better governance. We work closely with the Ministry for Information to support their work to formulate a freedom of information law by discussing the UK experience of such legislation. Where necessary we have lobbied at senior levels against media restrictions.</p>

	<p pid="b.173W.2/1">The Government work closely with partners to monitor human rights abuses and are committed to working to address them wherever they arise including in southern Africa. In the last year we have raised a wide range of human rights issues; for example lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights in Malawi and the situation of the San (Bushmen) in Botswana. Zimbabwe continues to be of concern regarding human rights and we work closely with human rights organisations to monitor human rights abuses in that country. In the past year, the UK has actively participated in the UN's Universal Periodic Review of the human rights situations in Angola, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia and Sao Tome and Principe. Given this coverage, we have no plans to increase monitoring further.</p>

	<p pid="b.175W.2/1">The decision by EU member states to remove 35 people from the list of those affected by its Restrictive Measures on Zimbabwe follows an in-depth assessment of the situation in Zimbabwe. 163 people and 31 economic entities remain subject to the measures for a further 12 months unless all 27 member states unanimously agree to any further relaxation.</p>
	<p pid="b.175W.2/2">The 35 people removed from the list comprise three dead, seven spouses, nine former Ministers, eight miscellaneous officials and eight minor ZANU Politburo members. These people were initially included by virtue of their marriage or their position in a pre-Government of National Unity government and have now been removed on the grounds that they are no longer involved in human rights abuses or undermining democracy or the rule of law.</p>
	<p pid="b.175W.2/3">We have always said that we will be guided by progress on the ground in Zimbabwe. Since we last reviewed the restrictive measures in February 2010 the Government of Zimbabwe has continued to make progress on economic issues and in delivering public services. However this has not been matched by equivalent political and democratic reform and we are particularly concerned at the recent upsurge in politically motivated intimidation and violence. This has prevented us from agreeing to any more substantial amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.175W.2/4">However, we and our EU partners have emphasised our willingness to revisit the measures at any time should there be further concrete developments on the ground in Zimbabwe. In this context, we fully support the Southern African Development Community and its member states in their effort to facilitate agreement among the parties in Zimbabwe on creating an environment conducive to the holding of free and fair elections.</p>

	<p pid="b.180W.5/1">78% of bus services are provided by operators on a commercial basis. The Department for Transport supports these services, including those operating in rural areas, through Bus Service Operator's Grant, the funding for which has been maintained in its entirety for 2011-12.</p>
	<p pid="b.180W.5/2">With regard to monitoring the impact of changes in bus subsidy, concessionary travel reimbursement or local authority funding, this cannot be done in isolation. Any changes to the level of services, the cost of bus fares, or the number of deregistrations will reflect wider influences, including commercial decisions by operators and, where appropriate, local authority priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.180W.5/3">The Department for Transport already publishes National Statistics on annual bus service mileage, passenger journey numbers and a local bus fares index. It plans to continue to publish these statistics in future years. The number of applications for new registrations and variations processed and accepted, and the number of registrations cancelled, is published annually in the Traffic Commissioners' Annual Report. However monitoring bus deregistrations would not be a good way of monitoring impacts in service provision, as it does not give any indication of why services have been deregistered.</p>
	<p pid="b.180W.5/4">I have regular discussions with the Confederation of Passenger Transport, who represent the bus industry, as well as the Local Government Association and the Passenger Transport Executive Group. They all provide a strategic overview of the impacts of any change.</p>

	<p pid="b.184W.9/1">Following the spending review, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a significant programme of investment in rail including significant rolling stock to address overcrowding on commuter services. Prioritising such investment will generate economic benefits and improve conditions for passengers.</p>
	<p pid="b.184W.9/2">The delivery of this major upgrade programme, together with the pressing need to tackle the deficit has forced us to take some difficult decisions on fares.

	<p pid="b.216W.2/1">The consultation document Disability Living Allowance reform, published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-06">6 December 2010</phrase>, set out our proposals for disability living allowance reform. We will replace disability living allowance for people of working age with personal independence payment, a new, more transparent and sustainable benefit with an objective assessment of individual need. Personal independence payment will be available to disabled people regardless of whether they are in or out of work and the assessment will not examine someone's capacity to work; rather it will determine how their impairment affects their ability to carry out a range of activities key to everyday life.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.2/2">From 2013 we will begin reassessing all existing working-age disability living allowance caseload and transferring people to personal independence payment where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.2/3">The consultation has closed and we are considering the responses received before we publish a formal response. However, the Welfare Reform Bill introducing the high level legislative changes necessary was introduced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-16">16 February 2011</phrase>. In the meantime we are continuing to work on the design of personal independence payment and the new assessment, which we are developing in collaboration with a group of independent specialists in health, disability and social care, including disabled people. I am, therefore, unable at this time to comment on how the new assessment will work, its likely costs or make estimates of its impact on people with specific health conditions or disabilities.</p>

We published Modernising Commissioning: Increasing the role of charities, social enterprise, mutuals and co-operatives in public service delivery, in December 2010. There were approximately 400 responses to this paper, the majority of which came from civil society organisations. The Prime Minister, Minister for the Cabinet Office and Minister for Civil Society have met with a number of organisations on this issue. These responses and discussions have informed the development of the Opening Public Services White Paper, due to be published shortly. In addition, Cabinet Office is working with non-profit contractors and statutory partners in nine local areas to develop the Local Integrated Service concept.</p>

Evidence also indicates that social enterprises have fared much the same as SMEs in the recession, and indeed a higher proportion of social enterprises compared to SMEs have managed to increase their turnover in the last 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="b.228W.5/36">In relation to the reasons for these trends, the Citizenship Survey has consistently shown, since 2005, that the main barriers to formal volunteering for all groups are related to 'work commitments', 'looking after children/the home', 'people doing other things with their spare time' and 'not hearing about opportunities to get involved'. The Citizenship Survey does not report on the barriers to informal volunteering.</p>
	<p pid="b.228W.5/37">Encouraging social action, including volunteering is one of the three aims of the Government's vision for a big society. To support this aim, in December 2010 the Government published the Giving Green Paper. The Green Paper sought to start a debate on how we can make social action a norm and encourage more people to give their time, including removing barriers to volunteering.</p>

	<p pid="b.230W.2/1">We have not made an assessment of how levels of volunteering affect levels of civic skills; these being those skills that are necessary to enable someone to play an active role as a citizen within society. However, we firmly believe that volunteering, along with other forms of social action, supports individual personal development and can enable volunteers to become more rounded and active citizens.</p>
	<p pid="b.230W.2/2">Statistics do show that volunteers feel that they are able to gain skills through their volunteering roles.

Government are aiming to do this through specific programmes, such as Community Organisers, which will aim to train 5,000 people to act as catalysts for social action within communities. In addition Government are making new funding opportunities available to the voluntary and community sector, including up to &#163;82.5 million in volunteering funds announced in the Giving Green Paper, which was published in December 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.234W.0/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-07">7 December 2010</phrase>, the Department has not revoked any statutory instruments in full.</p>
	<p pid="b.234W.0/2">However, the Energy Bill, introduced into the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-08">8 December 2010</phrase>, sets out proposals to repeal the Home Energy Conservation Act 1995 (HECA) in England, Scotland and Wales. This will reduce regulatory burdens, support the Government's localism agenda and remove redundant legislation from the statute book.</p>
	<p pid="b.234W.0/3">DECC is committed to reducing the burden of regulation on UK business, and a series of internal and external exercises have been or are being conducted towards this aim. For example, in June 2010 my noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (Lord Marland), responsible for the Department's regulatory agenda, wrote to 250 of the Department's key stakeholders asking for their views on ways to reduce DECC's regulatory burden. The response letter from Lord Marland and a summary of responses to this exercise was published in November 2010 on the DECC internet site:</p>

	<p pid="b.234W.0/5">Following on from this exercise, DECC plans to repeal a number of statutory instruments as well as powers under primary legislation (in total, 28 repeals). The exact processes for making the repeals are still being explored (suitable vehicles for the repeals are being considered, and consultation with relevant parties such as the devolved Administrations needs to take place for certain policies).</p>

	<p pid="b.235W.2/1">Green Deal finance will help householders to invest in energy efficiency measures; take-up will not depend on, or be determined by, the value of the property. Indicative analysis suggests that the price of a property rarely reflects its level of energy efficiency which would indicate that owners of properties in all price bands will be able to benefit from the Green Deal. The proposed Energy Company Obligation component of Green Deal will focus a major part of its effort on subsidised offerings to vulnerable households on low incomes, which should help to drive take-up across the spectrum of property value, including in less expensive properties.</p>
	<p pid="b.235W.2/2">No estimates of take-up have yet been made, but work is underway to develop understanding of this area and the recent Green Deal Impact Assessment provides illustrative scenarios to assist debate.</p>

These policy issues will form part of the Electricity Market Reform White Paper this spring. We are setting up with Ofgem a Smart Grid Forum to guide the actions that we are taking to address future challenges for electricity networks.</p>
	<p pid="b.239W.8/2">DECC is also managing the implementation phases of the smart metering programme, which will see the rollout of smart meters to GB households and many businesses, paving the way for smart grids.</p>
	<p pid="b.239W.8/3">Ofgem has allocated &#163;500 million in funding to encourage innovation in distribution networks over the next five years. In addition, by the end of this financial year, DECC will have awarded &#163;2.7 million to projects through its Smart Grids capital grants programme under the Low Carbon Investment Fund.</p>

	<p pid="b.240W.2/1">Development of a smart grid will be an incremental process. The Electricity Networks Strategy Group (ENSG), jointly chaired by DECC and Ofgem, set out a high level framework for smart grid development in its Route Map published in February 2010. In line with the timetable set out there, we expect the period up to 2015 to focus on the development of and trialling of smart technologies and approaches on the grid. This will interact with the smart meter roll out.</p>
	<p pid="b.240W.2/2">Between 2015 and 2020, we would expect the first layer of a smart grid to be rolled out on a larger scale where a benefit has been shown through trialling. Roll out will need to continue post-2020, largely driven by the increased electrification of transport and heating and greater penetration of distributed generation.</p>

This also sets the specified maximum capacity for small-scale FITs at 5 megawatts. As my previous answer confirmed, 50 kilowatts is used in the statutory definition of &quot;microgeneration&quot; and therefore provides the starting point for determining what is large scale for the purposes of the FITs scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.247W.6/2">Schools applying to convert to Academy Status have a statutory requirement to consult interested parties (for example, students, parents, and the local community). Schools are free to choose how they wish to do this. The consultation process must legally be completed before the Funding Agreement with the Secretary of State is signed. Prior to the Funding Agreement being signed, the school's governing body needs to confirm that it has consulted interested parties, the date on which the consultation was carried out, and that the views obtained were considered in the decision to convert to an academy.</p>
	<p pid="b.247W.6/3">The current employer of school staff (either the local authority or governing body depending on the type of school) is required to conduct a Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) consultation with all teaching and support staff and their unions as part of the staff transfer process.</p>

	<p pid="b.247W.9/2">The first academy projects required sponsors to make a capital contribution towards the cost of constructing academy buildings. In a small number of cases where a sponsor was unable to meet its capital sponsorship commitment, the Department agreed to make a payment to the contractor and then recover the amount by reducing the academy's general annual grant. The Department's expectation is that the sponsor should then make contributions to the academies to make good these deductions. There are currently eight academies whose revenue funding is being reduced in lieu of a sponsor's contribution. The following table shows each academy, along with the amount of funding that has been reduced.</p>

Ministers asked Professor Munro to undertake this review of child protection in England in June 2010, and specifically to consider whether there are better ways of using performance data to improve social work practice. Professor Munro published her interim report on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-01">1 February 2011</phrase>. She argued that process-based targets and performance indicators have skewed local priorities to focus on specific aspects of process, rather than the quality of practice.

	<p pid="b.261W.3/4" class="indent">An explanation of the context to the relevant data gathering may be helpful. Prior to receipt of PQ 025834, Ofsted was already carrying out an audit of all our serious childcare incident data dating back to <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, The data requested in PQ 025634 covered very similar ground to this audit review, staff worked on the two processes together, and answering the PQ accurately was reliant on the audit being completed. As a result the work on PQ 025634 cannot be separated entirely from the wider ongoing audit. However, we have estimated the amount of time dedicated specifically to the PQ after <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-23">23 November 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.261W.3/5" class="indent">After <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-23">23 November 2010</phrase>, Ofsted continued to audit data in respect of PQ 025634 dating back to April 2007, These data are stored in different formats and locations, and officials carefully and systematically cross-examined them to ensure there were no errors or duplication. This took one member of staff at Band A (grade 7) half a day, six staff at B1 (Senior Executive Officer) grade a total of eight and a half days and one member of staff at B2 (Higher Executive Officer) grade one day. The total staff time spent is therefore eight staff for a total of ten days.</p>
	<p pid="b.261W.3/6" class="indent">Four errors were identified and corrected during the audit process. They all related to inaccurate recording or calculation of the ages of children.</p>
	<p pid="b.261W.3/7" class="indent">I hope this is helpful and clarifies the work we have undertaken in this area. A copy of this reply has been sent to Tim Loughton MP, Minister for Children and Families, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="b.262W.0/4" class="indent">The contract with Capita currently supports a number of learner support schemes in addition to Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) so the decision to end EMAs will not trigger termination of the contract and there will therefore be no consequent liability to pay a penalty.</p>

	<p pid="b.263W.5/2">For the purposes of the 2010 performance tables the humanities element of the English Baccalaureate measure was either history or geography. We have not included religious education (RE) as fulfilling the humanity requirement of the English Baccalaureate because it is already a compulsory subject. One of the intentions of the English Baccalaureate is to encourage wider take up of geography and history in addition to, rather than instead of, compulsory RE.</p>
	<p pid="b.263W.5/3">However we recognise, as many schools do, the benefits that religious education can bring to pupils. This is why the teaching of RE remains compulsory throughout a pupil's schooling. Success in all subjects studied at GCSE will also continue to be recognised by other performance table measures, as it has in the past. We are open to arguments about how we can further improve the measures in the performance tables and will review the precise definition of the English Baccalaureate for the 2011 Tables.</p>

Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract &#163;430 of funding which will go to the school or academy via the local authority or YPLA if the pupil is in a mainstream setting or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting.</p>

	<p pid="b.286W.6/1">Collective worship in schools is one of the longest-standing traditions of the school system. It is also one that encourages pupils to reflect on the concept of belief and the role it plays in the traditions and values of this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.286W.6/2">We believe that it is wholly consistent with our culture of tolerance and inclusivity to celebrate the traditions of this country-which are, in the main, Christian-while recognising and celebrating those of others in our diverse society.</p>
	<p pid="b.286W.6/3">The law as it stands allows schools the flexibility to apply to have the requirement for broadly Christian collective worship lifted, where such a course is justified, while meeting the need for accountability to the local community. We therefore have no plans to bring forward proposals to remove the requirement on head teachers to apply to have the determination for wholly or mainly Christian collective worship lifted.</p>

	<p pid="b.291W.0/2"><i> </i>As a part of our commitment to free further education (FE) colleges and training organisations from stifling bureaucracy, we announced in &quot;Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth&quot; in November 2010 that we would suspend inspections for those FE colleges that were judged by Ofsted to be 'outstanding' and pledged to extend this to training organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.291W.0/3">We will introduce a minimum contract level (MCL) in the 2011/12 academic year as part of our commitment to create a streamlined and more efficient FE system. In an environment of declining budgets, it becomes increasing difficult for small providers to operate without realising the efficiencies of shared services or economies of scale through collaboration or sub-contracting. The Skills Funding Agency also needs to become more efficient and streamlined.</p>
	<p pid="b.291W.0/4">Where there is a risk of specialist provision being lost or a significant impact on choice available in a particular area due to the introduction of the MCL, the Skills Funding Agency will consider on a case by case basis whether alternative arrangements need to be made. Due to the nature of the contract that they have with the Skills Funding Agency, general FE and specialist colleges will be exempt from the application of the MCL.</p>
	<p pid="b.291W.0/5">We do not hold information centrally on the number of further education colleges and training organisations that have been judged to be 'outstanding' and that are below the MCL and so I have asked the chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency to write to the hon.

	<p pid="b.304W.8/1">The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) publishes the performance indicators in higher education on behalf of the Higher Education Funding Council for England. All the access performance indicators are restricted to students who are residents of England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland only, i.e. they do not report on non-UK residents. Therefore, neither non-UK residents attending UK schools nor non-UK residents attending schools outside the UK are included in the indicators.</p>
	<p pid="b.304W.8/2">Subject to the residency condition (rather than a UK citizen condition), all UK students are reported on. However, UK residents who report their school as being overseas would normally be categorised as unknown for the state schools indicator. For the low participation neighbourhood (LPN) indicator, whether such students are categorised as unknown or LPN/not LPN, depends on where their home postcode is reported. If it is an overseas postcode, they will be classified as unknown. For the lower socio-economic groups indicator, UK residents will be included regardless of whether they studied at a UK or an overseas school.</p>
	<p pid="b.304W.8/3">More information on the performance indicators is available on the HESA website:</p>

	<p pid="b.308W.8/1">The Student Loans Company (SLC) applies the same mechanisms to all borrowers who move overseas after leaving their course.</p>
	<p pid="b.308W.8/2">The SLC has established repayment arrangements for borrowers who move abroad, whether temporarily or because they live in another country. The SLC requests information about earnings and provides the borrower with a monthly repayment schedule under the terms of the contract of the loan. The SLC converts the income into pounds sterling and tells the borrower the amount they will need to repay each month in pounds sterling.</p>
	<p pid="b.308W.8/3">Repayments can be made in a number of ways: debit/credit card; cheque; standing order/direct debit; or by logging into the online account on the student loan repayment portal.</p>
	<p pid="b.308W.8/4">There is a system of banded thresholds for countries outside the UK, which takes account of the level of affordability in other countries. This means that repayment will remain based on ability to repay, wherever the borrower lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.308W.8/5">At <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-30">30 April 2010</phrase>, 8,800 English domiciled borrowers living overseas were earning above the threshold for the country and making repayments. A further 2,200 were in arrears and 1,200 had not provided details of income and were therefore considered in arrears. Therefore 72% of eligible borrowers were in repayment.</p>

	<p pid="b.309W.2/1">The Government are committed to the progressive nature of the repayment system. It is therefore important that those on the highest incomes post graduation are not able unfairly to buy themselves out of this progressive system by paying off their loans early. Any early repayment mechanism would need to ensure that graduates on modest incomes who strive to pay off their loans early through regular payments are not penalised.</p>
	<p pid="b.309W.2/2">The Government will consult on early repayment mechanisms in due course.</p>
