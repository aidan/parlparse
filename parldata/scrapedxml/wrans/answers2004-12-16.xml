	<p pid=".1215W.6/1">In the light of the European Commission rejection of the UK case for an emergency closure of the pelagic pair trawl fishery for bass in the Western Channel, which was copied to Fisheries Directors of all member states, I announced that the UK would introduce a prohibition on the UK fishery within 12 miles of the south west coast of England. I intend to put a request to the European Commission to have the 12 mile prohibition applied to vessels from other member states operating in this area. In practice, other than UK vessels, the ban would only impact on a small number of French vessels who pair trawl for bass in the 12 mile area. I have passed in person a letter to the French Minister setting out the UK case and seeking his support for the prohibition. Officials have also discussed the measures with their French colleagues at a recent Commission meeting on this issue.</p>

We continue to believe that managing fish stocks on the basis of precautionary reference points designed to keep biomass and fishing mortality well away from levels at which stocks risk collapse is the best way to proceed. The precautionary principle is an integral part of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) but the commitment of the member states and the Commission is required to make sure it is applied. It also underpins the advice produced by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea in which the UK participates.</p>

	<p pid=".1221W.2/2">The DTI has not made a specific study on the practical applications of large scale Manzanares-style solar chimneys. In the most recent report on the potential for renewables energy&mdash;Renewables Innovation Review February 2004&mdash;recommendations on solar related to photovoltaics only.</p>
	<p pid=".1221W.2/3">However the results of the Manzanares solar chimney project are widely reported. The technology is relatively inefficient as a means of converting sunlight into electricity (less than 1 per cent. of sunlight converted to electricity). In addition, to create significant power requires a high tower and a vast collection area. In addition there may be environmental impact considerations.</p>
	<p pid=".1221W.2/4">The company EnviroMission are proposing to build the first commercial scale power plant based on this technology in Melbourne, Australia. To produce 200 MW at a practical efficiency in this high solar gain area will require a tower of about 1 km high and a collection area of 40 square kilometres. The DTI will consider reviewing this technology when further results from the Australian project are available.</p>

	<p pid=".1229W.9/2">The Royal Navy attaches considerable importance to commemorating the Battle of Trafalgar, and Trafalgar Night dinners are an ideal opportunity for articulating to a wider audience the vision for today's Royal Navy. This year, while wishing to avoid being prescriptive about speech content, the Naval Staff circulated guidance to personnel at all levels which they may have found useful as aides memoire for speakers to highlight as key points. These were:</p>
	<p pid=".1229W.9/3" class="indent">&quot;The Royal Navy (RN) has a tradition of being a world-beating navy. We have this tradition for a reason&mdash;good people, good training and good equipment&mdash;and also because we have been prepared to embrace change in the face of changing strategic situations.</p>
	<p pid=".1229W.9/4" class="indent">Once again we face a period of significant change; we must remain resilient and best focus our resources to maintain our position as a world-beating navy.</p>
	<p pid=".1229W.9/5" class="indent">Our priority is to deliver the core maritime roles of the Versatile Maritime Force: Maritime Force Projection, Theatre Entry, Flexible Global Reach, UK Maritime Security and Networked Command Control Communications Computers Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR).</p>
	<p pid=".1229W.9/6" class="indent">The work earlier this year to rebalance defence has resulted in adjustments to force levels for all three Services. For the Royal Navy this has resulted in reductions in the numbers of frigates, destroyers, submarines and mine counter measure vessels over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid=".1229W.9/7" class="indent">Whilst reductions in hull numbers are never welcome, throughout the process we have been absolutely clear that delivering the future vision&mdash;a capable, flexible Navy focused on the ability to deliver effect onshore&mdash;is the priority.</p>
	<p pid=".1229W.9/8" class="indent">At the heart of the Versatile Maritime Force is the Future Carrier programme (CVF), which remains the RN's top equipment priority. The work earlier this year recognised the importance of CVF and the planned in-service dates have been maintained.</p>
	<p pid=".1229W.9/9" class="indent">The world is changing. We must respond to these changes if we are to maintain our relevance and traditional position as the best navy in the world.</p>
	<p pid=".1229W.9/10" class="indent">We need to remember that our &quot;audience&quot; among the British public, and further afield, is changing, with many not having the same innate understanding and acceptance of the whys and hows of our business as would have been the case in the past. We have an excellent story to tell&mdash;and maintaining our reputation with this audience is vital.&quot;</p>

In addition, a significant proportion of the &pound;1.85 billion allocated to the Regional Development Agencies will be spent on regeneration as one of their core functions. Between 2005&ndash;06 and 2007&ndash;08, the Government intends on current plans to allocate more than &pound;4.6 billion for regeneration, plus a proportion of the &pound;6.7 billion allocated to RDAs, alongside &pound;730 million through the European Regional Development Fund.</p>

The general permission for motor sports, however, is limited to not more than 14 days in total, in recognition that they may, in some locations, cause problems such as parking, environmental damage, and noise.

They are intended for use where there is a real and specific threat to the proper planning or amenities of a limited area. Whether to make a direction is entirely a decision for the local planning authority, though in the case of directions made under Article 4(1), approval by the Secretary of State is necessary for the direction to take effect.</p>

	<p pid=".1244W.2/1">Prior to the start of the Supporting People programme in April 2003, Supporting People teams were set up by local authorities, with a remit to drive forward the programme. The Supporting People teams are responsible for the day to day administration of the programme which includes the service review programme and ensuring all stakeholders are kept informed and consulted. The teams also facilitate the development of the Supporting People five-year strategy; identifying local strategic priorities and highlighting gaps in provision. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has allocated administration grants to administering authorities to contribute towards staff and IT costs of the Supporting People teams in delivering the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1244W.2/2">Supporting People is a local programme delivered through local partnerships with local government, probation, housing, social services, service providers and users. Local authorities are responsible for deciding which department takes the lead for Supporting People and how work is divided between county and districts. The Supporting People teams should, therefore, forge links with the appropriate commissioning managers (including social services), and social services should be an active partner on the core strategic group and commissioning body.</p>

	<p pid=".1246W.3/1">The Government are conscious that substantial reform will give rise to transitional problems for the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, and for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) seeking to develop an export trade to Europe under the Everything But Arms initiative. In order to help inform the debate and ensure the impact on developing countries is taken sufficiently into consideration, DFID commissioned a study last year with LMC International and Oxford Policy Management, &quot;Addressing the Impact of Preference Erosion in Sugar on Developing Countries&quot;. It assessed the economic and social impact on the ACP Sugar Protocol countries of the various reform scenarios suggested by the European Commission, and the alternative options for addressing the impact of preference erosion in sugar, for consideration by the ACP and the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".1246W.3/2">The European Commission has promised to initiate dialogue with the affected ACP suppliers on the basis of an Action Plan, which it will produce within the next month. This will set out possible measures to mitigate the impact of the price changes, including financial assistance and help with diversification where restructuring and improvements in competitiveness in the sugar sector are not sustainable. We attach the highest priority to ensuring that the proposed Action Plan is a success and delivers the support and assistance that ACP countries need.</p>
	<p pid=".1246W.3/3">DFID has also commissioned the Overseas Development Institute to produce a study on &quot;Forthcoming changes in EU sugar/banana markets: a menu of options for an effective EU transitional assistance package&quot;. This should be finalised by early next year. It should help those countries affected by reform determine their priorities for a transitional package, including analysis of alternative uses for sugar.</p>
	<p pid=".1246W.3/4">We are now following up this work by commissioning a series of country profiles for those Caribbean countries that will be affected by the change in the EU trade regime. This will assess the impact of sugar reform at both the national and the household level, help each country elaborate their own strategy to cope with the reforms which will occur, an identify options for transitional assistance.</p>

	<p pid=".1247W.0/1">DFID is working with the Government of Jamaica to manage the transition from the export of raw cane sugar, necessitated by the reform of the EU sugar regime. We are doing this in two ways: DFID supported a &quot;Foresighting Seminar&quot; held last week by the Government of Jamaica. Participants included representatives from the private sector and civil society, who looked at the medium to long-term future of the sugar industry including alternative options for land use. We understand that a number of proposals were presented, and these will now be submitted to the Jamaican Government for its consideration. The workshop was informed by a number of existing studies of the technical feasibility of new technologies, including ethanol production. More broadly, DFID is working with the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and in partnership with the &quot;German Technical Assistance Agency&quot; (GTZ) to produce country profiles for Caribbean sugar producing countries which will help inform their diversification or restructuring plans. The profiles may include an assessment of the feasibility of bio-ethanol.</p>

This is an important part of the China-UK HIV and AIDS Prevention and Care Project that began in 1999. DFID has also offered advice and support to the development and implementation of China's HIV programmes supported by the Global Fund. These programmes include identifying and treating people living with HIV and strengthening the role of civil society organisations in China's response to HIV. There have been no specific discussions concerning the identification and treatment of people living with HIV and AIDS in prison.</p>

	<p pid=".1250W.5/1">In July 2004, the Eritrean Ministry of Health's National Surveillance System revealed high malnutrition rates among women and children in Gash Barka, Anseba and Northern Red Sea Zobas, with global malnutrition rates estimated as high as 19.4 per cent., 18.4 per cent. and 13.9 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".1250W.5/2">According to the Growth Monitoring and Promotion report 2004, 50 per cent. of children under five are undernourished. The 2005 UN Consolidated Appeal reports that maternal malnutrition rates are among the highest in the world at 53 per cent. Global acute malnutrition (GAM) rate trends also vary according to the area. Peak rates are still often very high. For example, GAM rates in the Red Sea areas were between 28.3 per cent. in 2001 and 14.3 per cent. in 2003. GAM rates for Anseba were 19.9 per cent. in 2003 and 18.4 per cent. this year. For the period of 1995&ndash;2003 UNICEF assesses the percentage of children suffering from moderate or severe wasting (low weight for height), at 13 per cent., and stunting (low weight for age) at 38 per cent. There is no data available on nationwide malnutrition rates before the Demographic Health Survey carried out in June 2002. Since then, these have been conducted approximately every six months.</p>
	<p pid=".1250W.5/3">DFID is concerned about malnutrition in Eritrea and a large proportion of humanitarian funds support specialised supplementary feeding programmes. A team from DFID will be visiting Eritrea shortly to discuss these issues with the Eritrean Government, the UN and other agencies.</p>

	<p pid=".1251W.2/1">The levels of per capita spend on health in many low income countries are pitifully low, often government expenditure may be as little as US$5 per capita annually. DFID works with many countries to highlight the contribution of better health to development, advocates for increased allocations, and supports efforts to strengthen health systems and use available funds more effectively to deal with the major causes of ill health, disability and death. Health needs more resources, both from domestic revenue and through major increases in donor funding. However decisions on budget allocations across sectors are the responsibility of sovereign governments. Allocations will increase as economies grow wealthier. That requires more rapid progress on increasing aid volumes, in dealing with debt and in ensuring fairer trade regime.</p>
	<p pid=".1251W.2/2">A number of initiatives have highlighted the scale of need. The Commission on Macroeconomics and Health highlighted the interaction between health and poverty and has convinced many Ministers of Finance that health is a vital investment for the future. The report estimated that delivery of a basic health service would require US$ 35 per capita. The UN Millennium Project is quantifying the costs of meeting the Millennium Goals, many of which are directly or indirectly health related.</p>
	<p pid=".1251W.2/3">African Heads of State, meeting in Abuja in 2000, made a commitment to increase the health budget to 15 per cent. of the government budget&mdash;from a level that is typically less than 10 per cent. Progress has been slow to date.</p>
	<p pid=".1251W.2/4">The Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria was established in 2002 to generate significant additional resources to combat the three major communicable disease that collectively kill more than six million people each year. To date US$ 5.7 billion has been pledged to the fund, approvals to countries total US$ 3 billion through 315 grants in 128 countries and to date almost US$700 million has been disbursed.</p>
	<p pid=".1251W.2/5">The UK development budget has increased significantly since 1997. Under the terms of the Spending Review 2004, total UK official development assistance (oda) will rise from &pound;4.14 billion in 2004&ndash;05 to &pound;6.46 billion by 2007&ndash;08, The UK is making progress towards the UN 0.7 per cent. target for official development assistance (oda) as a proportion of gross national income. On current plans this will rise to 0.39 per cent. in 2005&ndash;06 and 0.47 per cent. in 2007&ndash;08, and this represents a real terms increase in UK oda of 140 per cent. since 1997. The Government wishes to continue to raise UK oda at the rate of growth achieved in 2007&ndash;08 in the aid ratio, which on this timetable would rise beyond 0.5 per cent. after 2008 and reach 0.7 per cent. by 2013. The UK has proposed an International Financing Facility (IFF), designed to deliver an additional US$50 billion annually in aid in the period to 2015. The UK, and France, will demonstrate the practicality of the IFF by launching the International Finance Facility for Immunisation in the first half of 2005. This is expected to double support for global immunisation efforts over the next decade.</p>

As part of the POA, education about population and health issues, including sexual and reproductive health is recognised as central within curricula for formal and non-formal schooling. These include health issues to promote the well-being of adolescents, education to enhance gender equality and equity as well as educate about responsible sexual behaviour and protection from early and unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV and AIDS.</p>

It is not feasible to draw up a list of the 10 countries where implementation of these policies has been most difficult, as each country has it's own cultural, religious and ethical standards.</p>

	<p pid=".1257W.3/18">Fluctuations reflect the rising number of people affected by the conflict, problems of access by agencies to determine the number of vulnerable people, the continuing insecurity, and the increase in the capacity of the World Food Programme to deliver assistance. Insecurity continues to be the main constraint on delivery. For example, the recent attack on Save the Children which killed two of their staff on <phrase class="date" code="">12 December</phrase>, led to their humanitarian operations in South Darfur being suspended. We continue to work urgently with the AU and others in the international community to address the security situation both through protection measures on the ground and pressure on all parties to use the political process in Abuja to resolve the issues underlying the conflict.</p>

	<p pid=".1258W.3/1">The greatest need in Darfur is for an improvement in the security situation. The African Union (AU) mission has a key role to play in this. They are in the process of expanding from less than 500 to more than 3,000 troops. The current mission (of approximately 800) is already having an impact on the ground. They have directly intervened in some areas to defuse tensions and have secured the release of some hostages. DFID is working with other donors to ensure the AU has the support it needs. DFID has committed over &pound;14 million to the mission (from which we have purchased and flown in 143 vehicles) and the Department has provided military planning support to the AU in Addis.</p>
	<p pid=".1258W.3/2">The AU is specifically mandated to &quot;contribute to a secure environment for the delivery of humanitarian relief.&quot;The AU has offered to provide military escort to relief convoys. The World Food Programme (WFP) has negotiated arrangements under this offer, but has yet to utilise them. However, some NGOs consider that they would be more at risk of being targeted if they travelled under armed escort.</p>

	<p pid=".1259W.9/1">The management of grants made by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to individual projects is a matter for HLF itself, not for the Government. However, the provisions in the National Lottery Bill to do with National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF) balances do not represent a threat to existing HLF commitments. HLF's forward commitments currently exceed its NLDF balance by around &pound;175 million. Income from the Lottery should, based on the Department's latest projections and taking into account the proposals in the Bill, comfortably exceed &pound;200 million in each of the next four years. We will not exercise any new powers in a way which puts at risk any existing grant.</p>

A tragic bombing incident took place in Dimapur in early October, which we have strongly condemned. Although the culprits are yet to be identified, local observers believe that the incident was perpetrated by outsiders and does not signal a general return to violence. Discussions are proceeding between the Government of India and one of the major militant factions on a political resolution of the conflict.

	<p pid=".1273W.8/2">While we recognise the importance of Ukraine for the transit of oil and gas, we have no evidence that the current situation in Ukraine is having an impact on oil and gas supplies to the UK and to the EU. It is not possible in any event to determine what percentage of UK physical oil and gas supplies has transited Ukraine, but it is believed to be negligible. It is the responsibility of the authorities in producing and transit countries to ensure that energy supplies, which are contracted for by private companies, can be delivered without impediment. We keep the situation in Ukraine under careful review. Were there to be cause for concern over energy supplies transiting Ukraine we would, with our EU partners, raise the matter urgently with the authorities there, and, if applicable, with the Russian Government.</p>

	<p pid=".1276W.12/14">DTI operates a centralised system of reviewing records. Records have a first review when they are between eight to 10-years-old. The files are examined to establish if they should be retained for departmental administrative purposes or whether they have any potential historical value. Approximately 85 per cent. of DTI files are destroyed at first review. Files that are retained are then selected for a second review when they are 25-years-old. They are re-examined to establish whether they have any continuing administrative value or should be transferred to The National Archives (TNA) for permanent preservation. Approximately 2 per cent. of DTI files are sent to TNA. Public records cannot be retained for longer than 30 years without the permission of the Lord Chancellor.</p>

	<p pid=".1277W.2/1">Ofgem has now announced its conclusions on its investigation into gas price increases in 2003 and 2004. It has concluded that the main causes of rising UK gas prices are high oil prices feeding into gas prices and declining UK gas supplies. Ofgem is taking two courses of action. It is asking the European Commission to put more resources into making gas competition work, and is continuing to examine why some UK gas supplies did not reach the market.</p>
	<p pid=".1277W.2/2">While the cost of gas to industry has been rising recently, this should be seen in the context of historical trends. In real terms gas prices for industrial users in 2003 were nearly 30 per cent. below their level in 1990 and well below their average over the last 30 years.</p>
	<p pid=".1277W.2/3">Electricity prices have increased mainly as a result of the rise in gas prices and the recovery in wholesale prices from unsustainably low levels in 2002. Industrial electricity prices in 2003 were nearly 50 per cent. below their 1990 levels. Even after the latest increases we expect prices to remain competitive with those of our major EU competitors.</p>
	<p pid=".1277W.2/4">The Department has recently published a report by Oxford Economic Research Associates which concluded that the UK has the most competitive energy markets in Europe. The report is available at:</p>

	<p pid=".1278W.9/1">Manufacturing in the region is a complex picture with DTI and its partners providing a wide range of support. In 2002, the regional development agency for the West Midlands, Advantage West Midlands (AWM), produced a strategy for manufacturing, aimed at modernising skills and the various supply chains within the region to help its long-term future. Some initiatives we are supporting to take forward this strategy are:</p>
	<p pid=".1278W.9/2" class="indent">Giving &pound;37 million towards the setting up of an International Automotive Research Centre in partnership with Ford's Premier Automotive Group and Warwick University. This will focus on improving engineering skills and technology transfer between OEMs and academia to the region's automotive suppliers.</p>
	<p pid=".1278W.9/3" class="indent">As part of AWM's Modernisation Programme, the 'Accelerate' Programme, with support from Europe, offers further help to automotive suppliers in the region. Up until 2003, over 1,500 companies have been assisted with advice on production efficiencies and best practice resulting in over 16,000 jobs being created and safeguarded. 16 companies in the Hodge Hill constituency are currently participating in the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1278W.9/4" class="indent">AWM's diversification programme also helps companies with new product development, improving business processes, supporting start-ups and improving access to finance. Its initial target to assist 800 businesses in the region by March 2005 has already been exceeded.</p>
	<p pid=".1278W.9/5" class="indent">As part of the DTI-supported SMMT &quot;Industry Forum&quot;, the &quot;Automotive Academy&quot; has been established, as a national &pound;15 million initiative, aimed at enhancing skills, productivity and competitiveness of the UK motor industry. It has a delivery hub in the West Midlands, complementing the work of the Accelerate Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1278W.9/6" class="indent">The Manufacturing Advisory Service (MAS) is one often in the country, jointly funded by DTI and, in the West Midlands, AWM and launched in 2002. Based in Wolverhampton, it has assisted over 900 businesses so far (against a three year target of 1,050) including 31 in the Hodge Hill constituency. As a result, over 70 per cent. of businesses invested money on improving their businesses. Nationally, manufacturing has been boosted by over &pound;53 million as a result of MAS activities with an average of &pound;100,000 added value to each participating manufacturer.</p>
	<p pid=".1278W.9/7" class="indent">Capital investment support to industry in the Assisted Areas of the region is also given through the DTI's Selective Financial Investment in England (SFIE)&mdash;formerly RSA&mdash;scheme. Since 2001, 114 offers of grant worth &pound;46 million have been made. Of these, 28 offers worth &pound;19.4 million have been made to companies in Birmingham, helping to create 1,268.5 new jobs and safeguard 1,816.5. Included is Frenco International Ltd. in Kitts Green, which received a &pound;95,000 grant in 2004 towards investment supporting the creation of six new jobs and the safeguarding of a further three. In addition, LDV in Washwood Heath is receiving &pound;15 million in grant to support the manufacture of a brand new van.</p>
	<p pid=".1278W.9/8">Although it is not possible to provide a figure for funding that will be available over the next three years, manufacturing remains an important part of the West Midlands industrial landscape, which is recognised in the Regional Economic Strategy (RES), which AWM and its partners will continue to actively deliver against over the next three years. This will include the continuation of some of the successful initiatives as detailed.</p>

	<p pid=".1279W.2/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) undertook a full public consultation in advance of the introduction of the Medicines (Child Safety) Regulations 2003, which enabled implementation of a new national standard for packaging aimed at reducing child poisonings. The MHRA also had discussion with representatives of the pharmaceutical industry and other interested parties about implementation of the standard, including a guideline to assist the industry in its implementation. Tamper-evident packaging is not required, nor prohibited, in law. The MHRA, however, monitors initiatives in medicines packaging to keep abreast of industry developments in this area. Tamper-evident packaging is one of many such areas that the MHRA has heard presentations on.</p>

	<p pid=".1284W.5/1">Since the start of the academic year, as of <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-30">30 November 2004</phrase>, 1,802 young people in Gloucestershire Local Authority area have received payments under the national EMA scheme. The number is increasing at a steady rate and we expect it to continue to do so. In 2004/05 across England we expect the number of 16 to 18 year olds participating in education to increase by 35,000 (3.8 percentage points) as a direct result of EMA. By 2006/07, when EMA is available to all eligible 16 to 18 year olds, an additional 72,000 young people will be in further education. If the same participation increase is applied to the South West region an additional 7,200 16 to 18 year olds will be participating in further education by 2006/07. Estimates are not available at Local Authority level.</p>

	<p pid=".1284W.8/1">Employer Training Pilots (ETPs) were launched in September 2002 to test new ways of encouraging employers to offer training, especially for their lower skilled employees. The pilots, which now cover around one third of England, have benefited over 100,000 learners, most of whom left school before the age of 16 and around 15,000 employers, of which 70 per cent. had less than 50 employees. ETPs have also been effective in encouraging more colleges and providers to deliver training on employers' premises, at a time and in a manner suited to the shift patterns of their staff.</p>
	<p pid=".1284W.8/2">The pilots have been independently evaluated by the Institute for Employment Studies and have also been the subject of a review by the Adult Learning Inspectorate. Both of these point to their overwhelming success and the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the PBR, the Government's intention to launch a new national employer training programme in 2006/07. The new programme will draw on the lessons learned from ETP and will incorporate key elements of the pilots including:</p>
	<p pid=".1284W.8/3" class="indent">free or heavily subsidised training for employees to help them overcome basic skills needs and/or to achieve their first level 2 qualification;</p>
	<p pid=".1284W.8/4" class="indent">a similar level of support towards the cost of a level 3 qualification for those employees who can jump straight to a level 3;</p>
	<p pid=".1284W.8/5" class="indent">brokerage to help employers identify providers who are able to deliver the training they need flexibly in the workplace, to help them locate other sources of funding for which they may qualify and to encourage them to finance other elements of training themselves;</p>
	<p pid=".1284W.8/6" class="indent">information and advice to learners in respect of their further development.</p>
	<p pid=".1284W.8/7">The new programme will cover the whole of England from 2007/08.</p>

	<p pid=".1292W.8/1">If a school wishes to expand its physical capacity by 25 per cent., or by 27 places annually, it must consult interested parties in the area and then publish details of its proposals in a local newspaper. Following publication people can submit comments or objections. Proposals are decided by the local School Organisation Committee (SOC) or by an independent adjudicator if the SOC cannot decide unanimously. For popular and successful schools, there is a presumption that proposals for expansion should be approved so that as many parents as possible are able to gain a place for their children at the school. As set out in the Department's Five Year Strategy, we are currently consulting on a fast-track process for the expansion of successful and popular secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.8/2">For smaller scale expansions, the proposed increased admission number should be included in the annual consultation on the school's admission arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.8/3">An LEA's recurrent funding formula is based predominately on pupil numbers on the school roll. As a school's roll increases in size, it will attract more funding under the local LEA's delegation formula; in turn, more pupils may also contribute towards a school receiving more devolved formula capital funding, Schools Standards Grant (SSG) and Standards Fund funding, as each of these resources can contain an element of &quot;per pupil&quot; funding within them.</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.8/4">If the school is a popular and successful secondary school it may apply direct to the Department for a contribution to the capital cost of building work&mdash;&pound;500,000 if the school has a sixth form, &pound;400,000 if not. If the balance of funding is not available from other sources, the Department may offer to fund the full expansion. These offers of funding are provisional on statutory proposals to expand being approved.</p>

	<p pid=".1292W.11/1">Section 79 of the Education Act 2002 puts a requirement on every LEA to ensure that all of the schools they maintain satisfy the requirements of the school curriculum (which includes the National Curriculum). A similar requirement to satisfy the requirements of the school curriculum is also placed, by the same section, on the governing body and head teacher of every school. If any part of the requirement is not being met pupils should complain to their head teacher in the first instance. Complaints can be made to the local education authority and ultimately the Secretary of State for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.11/2">Our physical education, school sport and club links strategy, being implemented jointly with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, provides targeted support to enhance school swimming. Since the Ofsted report on Key Stage 2 Swimming was published in 2000, our swimming strategy has taken forward all of the key recommendations made by the Swimming Advisory Group. We have:</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.11/3" class="indent">created a new swimming and water safety website which provides practical support for schools and swimming teachers;</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.11/4" class="indent">carried out a pilot programme which tests out how best to support those children who reach the end of Key Stage 2 and are not able to swim 25 metres. Over 1000 pupils have benefited from the scheme; and</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.11/5" class="indent">published a Swimming Charter in December 2003 which provides guidance and best practice examples to help schools overcome many of the challenges they face when planning and delivering swimming.</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.11/6">Furthermore, as part of its wider provision, the PE and School Sport National Professional Development Programme will help to improve the quality of swimming teaching throughout England. The Programme identifies where there is most need and provides specific professional development and support to help ensure high quality swimming tuition in schools.</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.11/7">A survey, carried out jointly by the Times Educational Supplement and the Central Council for Physical Recreation and published in August 2003, found that 84 per cent., or five in six, pupils are able to swim safely at least 25 metres by the end of Key Stage 2.</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.11/8">This is a modest improvement on the position reported to us by Ofsted in 2000-when 80 per cent., or four in five pupils in England, achieved this target. We will be making an announcement shortly on future funding to support further school swimming.</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.11/9">Information relating to the removal of school swimming pools is not collected centrally.</p>

	<p pid=".1295W.12/1">The information requested is not available as staffing levels are a matter for individual local authorities. There have been some changes to the methodology used to construct these figures, introduced to ease the burden on local authorities. These probably account for some of the reduction, but the exact impact is not available. Whilst it may appear that there may be fewer staff investigating fraud our latest figures show improvements in performance with a year on year increase in the number of successful prosecutions and sanctions.</p>
	<p pid=".1295W.12/2">The Government's strategy focuses on preventing fraud from entering the benefits system, deterring those who may be tempted and detecting it when it does happen. We have adopted an end-to-end approach which protects benefits from the point of claim right through to the cessation of payment. There is therefore a far greater number of local authority benefit staff involved in some aspect of programme protection than the number of fraud investigators would imply, although the precise split is not available.</p>

These include an extra &pound;30 million for New Deal for Disabled People in 2005&ndash;06; changes to the work focused interview regime; and improved arrangements for people on incapacity benefits to try out work and to take up self-employment. Also announced was extra support for GPs, including the piloting of improved arrangements on fitness for work advice and placing employment adviser support within interested GPs' surgeries.</p>

	<p pid=".1309W.0/1">Most people with asthma receive an excellent service from their general practitioner, including advice on self-management and, where necessary, appropriate medicines. The GP may also refer patients to hospital for specialist investigation and treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".1309W.0/2">Asthma is the most chronic disease in the United Kingdom. Accurate data for numbers affected are difficult to obtain. From the Office of National Statistics General Practice Database 1996 it was estimated that 6.7 per cent. of men and 6.9 per cent. of women in England and Wales were treated for asthma, about 3.5 million people.</p>
	<p pid=".1309W.0/3">In 2003&ndash;04, the last year for which data are available, there were about 13,431,000 first outpatient appointments, 5,448,000 elective hospital admissions and 15,313,000 new accident and emergency attendances at national health service hospitals. In 2002, the last year for which data are available, there were about 241 million appointments with GPs. In addition, patients received advice and, in some cases, treatment in NHS walk-in centres, through NHS Direct and community pharmacies. It is not possible to derive from the estimates how many individuals were involved, or to estimate what proportion of all contacts with the NHS included advice and treatment for a specific condition, or to estimate what proportion of the total NHS budget is involved.</p>
	<p pid=".1309W.0/4">Under the new primary medical care contracting arrangements a unique step has been taken in using indicators and information management across specific chronic disease areas, including asthma, to deliver improved outcomes for patients.</p>
	<p pid=".1309W.0/5">New primary medical care contracting arrangements provide primary care trusts with enormous potential to improve the quality and access to a wider range of services for patients. It centres on a comprehensive quality and outcomes framework. This is like a national service framework, covering the whole of primary care, with substantial financial incentives attached, and constitutes the single biggest investment in quality care in the NHS. Lives will be saved through effective chronic disease management of specific conditions, like heart diseases, diabetes, high blood pressure and asthma.</p>
	<p pid=".1309W.0/6">The main agency through which the Government supports medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC is an independent body funded by the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Technology. The MRC spent some &pound;12.6 million on asthma research in the four years from 1999&ndash;2000 to 2002&ndash;03. Information for the years 1997&ndash;98 and 1998&ndash;99 is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".1309W.0/7">The Department funds research to support policy and to provide the evidence needed to underpin quality improvement and service development in the NHS. In the six years from 1997&ndash;98 to 2003&ndash;04, the Department's national research programmes spent &pound;9 million on projects related to asthma.</p>
	<p pid=".1309W.0/8">Over 75 per cent., of the Department's total expenditure on health research is devolved to and managed by NHS organisations. From this funding, the NHS reported spending in support of respiratory diseases as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".1315W.3/2">As with all medicines, the safety of human and animal insulin is continuously monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the committee on safety of medicines (CSM).</p>
	<p pid=".1315W.3/3">The known side-effects for human and animal insulin are listed in the summary of product characteristics and patient information leaflet for each individual product. Information for prescribers is also available in the British National Formulary (BNF). The product information for prescribers and patients is amended as new information on side effects emerges. The most frequent side effect of both human and animal insulin is hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Other side effects include reactions around the injection site, allergic reactions and oedema (swelling).</p>
	<p pid=".1315W.3/4">MHRA/CSM receives reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) submitted by doctors, dentists, pharmacists, nurses and coroners via the yellow card scheme. There is also a legal requirement for companies to report suspected ADRs to their drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".1315W.3/5">Enabling patients directly to report suspected ADRs to the MHRA was one of the recommendations made in the Report of an &quot;Independent Review of the Yellow Card Scheme&quot;, published in May 2004. On the publication of the independent review report aforementioned, my noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for State for Health, the Lord Warner, immediately accepted the recommendation to introduce direct patient reporting of suspected ADRs.</p>
	<p pid=".1315W.3/6">A working group of the CSM, under the chairmanship of a lay member of the CSM, has been established to advise on the development of pilots to gauge effectiveness of mechanisms for patient reporting of suspected ADRs. The working group has wide representation from patient and consumer groups, wider academia, pharmacy and medicine.</p>

	<p pid=".1319W.5/1">The Department's Public Service Agreement for 1999&ndash;02 included targets to increase the generic prescribing rate for all practices in England to an average 72 per cent., and to move at least half of those practices with a generic prescribing rate below 40 per cent., to above that level&mdash;both to be achieved by March 2002. Those targets were achieved. The average rate of generic prescribing in England has reached 78 per cent., and some primary care trusts are achieving rates in excess of 85 per cent. The savings from increasing the current figure to 80 per cent., are likely to be relatively modest, but we have not made an estimate.</p>

It is clear that daily variations in concentrations of air pollutants, including particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide are associated with changes in daily rates of heart attacks and other acute cardiovascular events. The exact mechanisms of effects are not, however, yet clear. Long-term exposure to fine particles and to sulphur dioxide is associated with an increased risk of death from cardiovascular causes: again, the mechanisms of effect are unclear.</p>

	<p pid=".1322W.8/1">The national programme for information technology in England (NPfIT) has, from its inception, consulted closely with individual expert primary care practitioners, including practising general practitioners, as well as the national professional bodies and groups. This consultation helped to inform the user requirement which was published in the programme's output-based specification. Clinicians and users were also involved in evaluating the proof of solution demonstrators developed by suppliers, and in evaluating the supplier bid. In the procurement and delivery process, particularly in the development and testing phases, representative stakeholders are being consulted to ensure that their requirements and concerns are taken into account.</p>
	<p pid=".1322W.8/2">Local service providers (LSPs) act as prime contractors to deliver the elements of the national programme in a geographical area. It is the primary responsibility of the LSPs to work with a range of other suppliers to deliver the solutions that the national health service needs. This includes working with primary care system providers to ensure that the systems in use across the NHS conform to the national standards required and can be upgraded to integrate with new national applications as they come on line. All systems developed by suppliers contracted under NPfIT are subject to stringent testing prior to acceptance. All systems, whether NPfIT systems or existing GP or hospital systems, are subject to integration testing to ensure compliance. All systems are also made available to users in a &quot;model community&quot; environment for evaluation and feedback.</p>

	<p pid=".1325W.5/2">The latest digital technology for capturing, storing, distributing and displaying static or moving images such as X-rays or scans&mdash;picture archiving and communications systems (PACS)&mdash;has now been designated a core service within the national programme for information technology (NPfIT) in the national health service in England. PACS takes away any need to print on film and to file or distribute images manually.</p>
	<p pid=".1325W.5/3">NPfIT has produced a comprehensive common specification for what a PACS system needs to achieve, and local systems must link to the national data &quot;spine&quot; of the NHS care record service. This will ensure that images can be sent between, and viewed remotely and across, NHS locations, leading to more efficient diagnosis and treatment.By maximising the economies of scale and negotiating pan-regional contracts with their local services providers, NPfIT has been able to negotiate PACS at substantially reduced prices over the prices previously paid by individual trusts. It has also agreed an implementation plan for early deployment. Implementation has begun at the first early-adopter sites, where systems will go live across acute trusts and primary care trusts from January 2005. The plan envisages PACS to be in place in 80 per cent. of user organisations by March 2006, and in 100 per cent. of organisations by March 2007.</p>
