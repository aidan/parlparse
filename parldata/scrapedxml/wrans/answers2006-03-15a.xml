	<p pid="a.2243W.6/1">DFID attaches great importance to helping developing countries adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. DFID is a leading supporter of international and national efforts to assess and reduce the impact of climate change efforts to eradicate poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.2243W.6/2">Work to assess the potential impact of climate change on the incidence and intensity of droughts in Africa is in its early stages. We are helping African planners develop their national climate change adaptation strategies through three means: <i>(a)</i> provision of funds through the United Nations to help Africa adapt, including &pound;10 million over three years (2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;88) to the United Nations Climate Change Convention's Special Climate Change Fund; <i>(b)</i> helping to improve African climate monitoring networks and develop African regional climate centres through the G8 Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) initiative and <i>(c)</i> DFID's climate change research strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.2243W.6/3">During 2005, the UK also led the G8 to commit to improving the way we manage climate risk when providing development assistance. The UK aims to have climate risk management procedures for overseas aid in place by 2008, in line with the Commission for Africa recommendation. We are working with the World Bank and other donors to progress this.</p>

	<p pid="a.2245W.2/1">The 2002 census in the Dominican Republic records that only 80,000 people identified themselves as being born outside of the country. However, Amnesty International estimates that there are between 700,000 and 800,000 people of Haitian descent in the Dominican Republic, out of a total population of 8.56 million. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimate that the prevalence of HIV infection is below 2 per cent. nationally but this figure is up to 5 per cent. in the bateyes (local communities) living near sugar plantations, where a significant proportion of immigrants of Haitian descent live.</p>
	<p pid="a.2245W.2/2">While the Presidential AIDS Council (COPRESIDA) made significant progress towards universal access to prevention, treatment and care in the last three years, and has a policy of universal provision of anti-retroviral treatment (ARV), there is no specific policy of providing ARVs to non-nationals. The total number of people living with HIV and AIDS, who require ARV treatment, is not known. At January 2006, some 2,700 patients were receiving ARVs, likely to be substantially less than 50 per cent. of those in need of treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.2245W.2/3">Amnesty International is planning to issue a report on HIV and human rights in the Dominican Republic in May. It is expected to find that the treatment, care and prevention services for HIV and AIDS in the bateyes, where many Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent live, is very limited.</p>

	<p pid="a.2245W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) supports local communities in Latin America through its work with the International Finance Institutions (IFI), particularly the World Bank and the Inter American Development Bank (IADB), and through direct support to non-governmental organisations (NGO)s. The range of community involvement in IFI supported and civil society programmes is illustrated by the following examples.</p>
	<p pid="a.2245W.5/2">Through engagement with the IADB and the World Bank, DFID is supporting greater involvement of civil society and local communities in IFI programmes and processes, such as consultations around development and evaluation of IFI country strategies. In Brazil, the UK is helping local communities give their own assessment of the impact of the Federal Government's conditional cash transfer programme, the Bolsa Familia. This programme provides a monthly cash benefit to a current total of 8.7 million poor families across the country, which is conditional on children attending school and immunisation programmes. The UK is also contributing to a programme to enhance the capacity of indigenous people's organisations throughout Amazonia. Indigenous leaders meet regularly, receive training together, and consider how to promote their entitlements to services and to strengthen social cohesion in Amazon communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.2245W.5/3">DFID supports the IADB to promote community participation in the design and implementation of its programmes in Central America. For example, support was recently provided to local communities in the remote cross-border area between Honduras (El Paraiso) and Nicaragua (Nueva Segovia) to strengthen cross-border development plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.2245W.5/4">With civil society in Brazil, the UK is working with local communities to raise awareness of how institutional racism can be a barrier to poor people in the Afro-Brazilian population receiving the public services to which they are entitled. This work has been implemented through new partnerships between municipal authorities and civil society organisations in two states in the poor North East of Brazil, Pernambuco and Bahia, through the Programme to Combat Institutionalised Racism.</p>
	<p pid="a.2245W.5/5">In the Andes region, DFID is working to strengthen awareness among civil society and community groups of their right to information about policy processes and to engage with policy makers, both within Government and donors. In Peru, DFID's rights-based approach to development put working with local communities central to its purpose. The substantial partnership between Oxfam and DFID through the Derechos, Inclusion y Desarrollo (Rights, Inclusion and Development) programme has taken DFID's support on these issues right down to the community level.</p>
	<p pid="a.2245W.5/6">In Nicaragua, DFID contributes to the multi-donor civil society fund in Nicaragua administered by the local in-country offices of Oxfam Great Britain and Trocaire. This fund is designed to provide direct grants to local grassroots civil society to help them build governance from the bottom up and engage in development planning processes as well as social auditing of Government development programmes. DFID has supported the IADB to strengthen civil society through co-operation with local communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.2247W.2/1">Latin America has high levels of persistent and severe poverty and inequality. According to 2004 national poverty line data collected by the United Nations, 42.9 per cent. of the population of Latin America live in poverty and 18.6 per cent. live in extreme poverty. The levels of extreme poverty are higher among indigenous and afro-descendant people.</p>
	<p pid="a.2247W.2/2">DFID's strategy for Middle Income Countries (MIC) provides the framework for how DFID works to reduce poverty and inequality in Latin America. DFID's main financial contributions to Latin America are through direct contributions to the multilateral institutions (the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations). As recommended by the MICs Strategy, DFID uses its bilateral programme (&pound;11 million in 2005&ndash;06 and &pound;12 million in 2006&ndash;07) for Latin America to maximise the effectiveness of our multilateral contribution by working to enhance the overall impact of the international system in the region. DFID's assistance to Latin America from 2004&ndash;07 is set out in the Regional Assistance Plan, copies of which are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.2247W.2/3">DFID is working with the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and the World Bank to strengthen their focus and impact on poverty, inequality and exclusion. DFID assistance to the IADB and the World Bank aims to strengthen the access of poor and excluded people to local and national markets, to the benefits of international trade, and to accountable and more responsive public systems. A recent example of support to the IADB was in the development of an indigenous people's strategy, which sets out how the World Bank should assess the impact of new programmes and loans on indigenous people.</p>
	<p pid="a.2247W.2/4">DFID is working to improve the ability of Governments to develop and monitor poverty reduction strategies and the extent to which donor assistance is consistent with these strategies by promoting and exchanging regional lesson learning. DFID is also facilitating lesson sharing on global policy issues including trade, HIV and AIDS and global environmental issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.2247W.2/5">DFID also is providing over &pound;10 million in 2005&ndash;06 to British non-governmental organisations (NGO)s in the region by funding projects through its Civil Society Challenge Fund and through its Partnership Programme Agreements with six international NGOs.</p>

	<p pid="a.2248W.0/1">Lack of access to affordable credit is a persistent constraint to livelihoods of the poor in Latin America. For both formal and informal small scale enterprises, which are the main employers of the poor in urban and rural areas, limited forms of formal collateral exclude them from access to borrowing from the formal financial sector. Microfinance institutions have an important role to play in meeting this gap for small enterprises and producers. However, microfinance institutions can also have high transaction and operation costs and frequently rely on external, often donor, financing.</p>
	<p pid="a.2248W.0/2">Many donors, including the International Financial Institutions, are working on instruments that will guarantee loans to the poor, as well institutional models that will enable larger financial institutions to extend financial services to poorer communities and small enterprises. In the meantime, microfinance institutions continue to play a crucial role in meeting the demands of the poor for financial services tailored to their particular needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.2248W.0/3">If microfinance remains reliant on donor grants, it will always be limited and not reach the scale possible through involvement of the private sector. By combining the strengths of microfinance non-governmental organisations (NGO)s (microfinance expertise, community presence, commitment to serving very poor people) and those of banks (financial resources, information technology, payment systems), massive increases can be made in providing microfinance to the poor. The experience of ICICI Bank in India, the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and Bancosol in Bolivia clearly demonstrate this. ProFund Internacional (ProFund), based in Costa Rica, targets the small and microenterprises (SMEs) of Latin America and the Caribbean. Major shareholders of ProFund include the InterAmerican Development Bank, IFC/The World Bank Group and CDC.</p>
	<p pid="a.2248W.0/4">Globally, DFID has supported microfinance and financial sector projects in 25 countries. In Latin America, DFID is working closely with partner governments to improve the institutional framework within which microfinance institutions operate. DFID's Regional Assistance Plan for Latin America aims to improve the impact of International Finance Institutions (particularly the World Bank and Inter American Development Bank (IADB) on poverty and inequality. This includes working with the IADB and the World Bank to strengthen the access of poor and excluded people to local and national markets, including access to micro-credit. In Nicaragua, DFID is providing $150,000 to an International Finance Corporation initiative to support the microfinance industry to develop new products and lending models specifically targeted at the small enterprise sector. In Bolivia, DFID is in dialogue with the new Government on the institutional structure for microfinance, informed by an analysis of models for credit services to poor rural producers.</p>
	<p pid="a.2248W.0/5">Microfinance has often tended to be a component of wider DFID projects. For example, the United Nations Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) Alternative Development project in the Lower Huallaga Valley, Peru (completed in 2004), which worked with farmers to increase their incomes from alternative livelihoods and avoid a reactivation of the illegal cultivation of coca. A similar project in San Martin region of Peru included microfinance and supported small-scale production, agro-processing and environmental education to improve incomes and employment of poor producers.</p>
	<p pid="a.2248W.0/6">DFID's fund allocations are determined by country and region rather than by sector. The overall budget for microfinance and the proportion allocated for Latin America is therefore not readily available.</p>
	<p pid="a.2248W.0/7">DFID has Partnership Programme Arrangements (PPAs) with six international NGOs for their programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean. While these PPAs cover a wide range of work, it is expected that the following would include microfinance elements; CARE, CAFOD, Christian Aid and Oxfam.</p>

	<p pid="a.2252W.6/1">There has been some slippage on progress towards Target 4 of DFID's Public Service Agreement Objectives and Targets for 2003 to 2006. Progress with the current round of trade negotiations is the main influence on this target, and this depends on the actions of the EU and others within the World Trade Organisation (WTO). After the failure of the Cancun WTO Ministerial in September 2003, there was no likelihood of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) being completed by <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>. Thus the original target, which was always challenging, was unachievable. However, the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005 delivered enough progress to keep the prospect of concluding the DDA in 2006 alive. The Government are therefore pressing for an outcome to these trade talks which delivers real gains for developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.2252W.9/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.2252W.9/2" class="italic">Darfur</p>
	<p pid="a.2252W.9/3">Across the whole of Darfur, there are 1.8 million internally displaced people and 3.4 million dependent on humanitarian assistance. The priority is to provide assistance and protection for them, and to find a political solution that will allow people to return home and rebuild their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.2252W.9/4">Although the massive humanitarian response in Darfur has had a positive impact on malnutrition and mortality rates, the region remains highly dependant on food aid. This year there is expected to be above average food production, but the ability of Darfur is to bring in the harvest depends on security which remains extremely fragile in many areas. Even with a good harvest, an estimated three million people in Darfur will still require food aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.2252W.9/5">Instability, fighting and banditry in South and West Darfur, particularly along the border zone with Chad, is severely hampering humanitarian agencies operating in those areas. Violence and attacks on humanitarian agencies' staff and assets has lead to a reduction in presence, and total withdrawals in some areas, by both the UN and NGOs, leaving many vulnerable people with a greatly reduced level of assistance. Until a political settlement is reached to end the fighting and re-impose the rule of law, the civilian population of Darfur will continue to bear the heaviest burden.</p>
	<p pid="a.2252W.9/6">The UK is the second largest bilateral humanitarian donor in Darfur (after the US), providing over &pound;96 million since September 2003. These funds have meant that hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people have been provided with shelter, food, water and basic health care. The UK is also actively supporting the peace talks in Abuja, Nigeria, in the search for a sustainable political settlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.2252W.9/7" class="italic">South Sudan</p>
	<p pid="a.2252W.9/8">The humanitarian situation remains fragile. Pockets of instability, noticeably in the Upper Nile, Eastern and Western Equatoria have resulted in continued internal displacement. A recent cholera outbreak in and around Yei and Juba underlines the threat of disease and the imminent rainy season will only serve to increase the difficulties faced by vulnerable people, and the humanitarian agencies ability to assist them.</p>
	<p pid="a.2252W.9/9">While this year's harvest is predicted to be good, there will continue to be areas of high vulnerability due to insecurity and poor market access. Malnutrition levels in many areas are commensurate with, and in some cases worse than, those found in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="a.2252W.9/10">To date, the large number of returns of refugees and internally displaced people predicted by the UN has still not taken place. Although there is still potential for significant movement in the run-up to the rainy season, this is considered unlikely. To support the returns process, the UK is providing early and significant contributions to the UN 2006 Work plan, from which the UN humanitarian co-ordinator has already allocated over $40 million to the South.</p>
	<p pid="a.2252W.9/11">In addition to funding vital non-governmental organisations (NGOs) humanitarian programmes in the South, the UK is providing financial support to an emergency response fund for the South to deal with emergencies, such as the cholera outbreak. For longer term recovery and development, the UK is establishing the &pound;10 million service delivery fund which will act as a bridge to the Multi-Donor Trust Fund while it develops projects for funding to meet longer term development needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.2254W.2/1">DFID have been closely monitoring the cholera outbreak in Southern Sudan since it began late January. The outbreak started in Yei town in Southern Sudan and subsequently spread to Juba and a dozen other towns further East and North. To date (<phrase class="date" code="2006-03-12">12 March</phrase>) 212 people have died from the disease from a case load of 6,744. The recent outbreak and its subsequent rapid spread to neighbouring towns underlines the threat of disease while the imminent onset of the rainy season will serve to increase the difficulties faced by vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="a.2254W.2/2">DFID has been active in supporting the co-ordination of response efforts in the South and in monitoring the situation. The emergency preparedness and response unit managed by the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) together with the World Food Organisation (WHO) have been at the forefront of co-ordinating the response to the outbreak. DFID has been working closely with OCHA providing technical advice, support and funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.2254W.2/3">Through the Emergency Response Fund (ERF) of UNOCHA, DFID has provided over $350,000 to eight UN agencies and non-governmental organisations assisting with the response to the cholera outbreak. An additional $750,000 of DFID funds remains with the ERF for continued assistance to agencies if the disease spreads further.</p>
	<p pid="a.2254W.2/4">In addition to support such chronic and rapid onset emergencies, the UK is providing early and significant contributions to the UN 2006 Work plan, from which the UN humanitarian co-ordinator has already allocated over $40 million to the South including an allocation of US $500,000 to the Emergency Response Fund. The UN humanitarian co-ordinator additionally holds an emergency reserve of $10 million (to which DFID was a significant contributor) which could be accessed to scale up the response to the outbreak should the need arise.</p>

	<p pid="a.2256W.6/1">Specialist support services are part of the Legal Services Commission's (LSC) special projects budget that was reviewed in the summer 2005. The LSC concluded that as specialist support services provide advice in civil categories of law to other legal advisers and not directly to clients, this did not represent the most cost-effective approach to meet the increasing need for front-line advice. The LSC has therefore decided not to continue funding for specialist support from July 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.2256W.6/2">The LSC's decision to withdraw funding for specialist support services will refocus resources within the existing civil legal aid budget in England and Wales. It is not intended to increase or decrease costs overall. It will mean that &pound;2.3 million will be redirected to fund direct legal advice in the next financial year, thereby increasing access to legal services for vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="a.2256W.6/3">The LSC invited all the practitioners and specialist advice services funded under the current system to discuss how they can advise clients and consumers directly, rather than through a second-tier system.</p>
	<p pid="a.2256W.6/4">The Department for Work and Pensions is working with the LSC and the Department for Trade and Industry, as part of a national agenda to tackle rising levels of debt, to pilot a number of innovative new advice services to help people facing financial exclusion, following a &pound;6 million grant from the Treasury's Financial Inclusion Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.2256W.6/5">In terms of advice on benefits and pensions matters, there is already wide expertise and knowledge within the advice sector, and the Department for Work and Pensions, which already has excellent relationships with key national advice providers, will continue to provide for advisors comprehensive information about its legislation and procedures.</p>

	<p pid="a.2257W.2/1">Information is not available on the numbers entering employment as a direct and sole result of the introduction of lone parent Work Focused Interviews, however, research has demonstrated that these interviews have increased participation in new deal for lone parents by approximately 15 per cent. The success of new deal for lone parents has been a major contributing factor to the increase in lone parent employment in every region, the reduction in the number of children in workless households and the reduction in child poverty, and, so far, it has helped more than 423,000 lone parents into work</p>
	<p pid="a.2257W.2/2">Research has also shown that the introduction of Work Focused Interviews (WFIs) for lone parents with ongoing claims has increased the proportion of people leaving income support by between one and two percentage points.</p>

November 2005, and Department for Work and Pensions Research Report W159 'Evaluation of Lone Parent Meetings: Interim findings from administrative data analysis' Genevieve Knight and Michael White, Policy Studies Institute, May 2003; and DWP Research Report W315 'Lone Parent Work Focused Interviews and Review Meetings: Administrative data analyses and qualitative evidence' which provides longer term analysis of the impact of Work Focused Interviews on the number of lone parents leaving income support.

Class 3 contributions have only been recorded separately since 1975 and since then it has only been possible to readily distinguish full tax years in which only Class 3 contributions have been paid.

	<p pid="a.2258W.3/1">The new deal for young people has been successful in helping nearly 650,000 young people into work and has helped to virtually eradicate long-term youth unemployment. A number of independent research reports on new deal for young people, commissioned by this Department, have looked at the impact of the programme on the job search activity of programme participants.</p>
	<p pid="a.2258W.3/2">A report by Social and Community Planning Research <sup>1</sup> found that participants on new deal for young people greatly appreciated the support they received from their new deal personal advisers, which included: help with looking for vacancies; assistance with contacting employers; referral to other appropriate agencies and discussions about long-term career plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.2258W.3/3">The new deal for young people national survey <sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup> which reports on interviews with over 6,000 programme participants, includes a considerable amount of information on the job search activity of people who have taken part in the programme. A high proportion of respondents reported discussing methods of job search and their responsibilities as jobseekers with their new deal personal adviser.</p>
	<p pid="a.2258W.3/4">Research from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research <sup>4</sup> published in 2000, reported positively about the impact of new deal for young people.

We are therefore working with other Government Departments and stakeholders to determine the best action to take.</p>
	<p pid="a.2262W.5/2">As an early step we recently hosted a ticket-touting summit with representatives from the entertainment, cultural and sporting industries to consider a way forward. Subsequently my officials are currently working with other Government Departments, the Office of Fair Trading and the relevant industries to analyse the root causes of the problem and the likely options for action, and they will be reporting their findings back to me in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.2262W.5/3">Among other things a DCMS-led working group will examine the adequacy of existing consumer legislation and how it could be better enforced, in addition to identifying any gaps and loopholes that might need further action.</p>
	<p pid="a.2262W.5/4">Our aim in taking this forward must be to find solutions that protects fans and ensures that our creative, cultural and sporting industries are able to realise legitimate revenue streams. Any proposed solutions must also be both achievable and enforceable. In particular, we shall be looking at the scope for achieving greater clarity and transparency about the sale/resale of ticket sales over the Internet and other channels. And we will also seek to promote greater industry collaboration especially in the area of best practice.</p>
