The Accounting Officer of a Lottery distributor is accountable to both the Department's Permanent Secretary and to Parliament for the proper and prudent expenditure of funds, and distributors' activities are subject to external audit by the National Audit Office. As Lottery proceeds allocated to distributors are public money, the general principles of Government Accounting must be applied in the design and implementation of systems for the distribution of that money. Each Lottery distributing body must, under the terms of its financial directions, publish and make available guidance on how to apply for funds.</p>

	<p pid=".960W.8/2">Her Majesty's Government estimate that about 80 per cent. of the heroin received in the United Kingdom is trafficked through the Balkans from Afghanistan. The available information on trafficking routes suggests that a large majority of this heroin transits other Balkan and central European countries (for example, Bulgaria, over 2,000 kilograms seized in 2000) rather than Kosovo.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.8/3">We remain concerned at the trafficking of women and children through the region, including Kosovo. The United Kingdom's law enforcement agencies work closely with regional partners, including in Kosovo, to identify, disrupt and dismantle criminal networks targeting the UK. In 2002, the Trafficking and Prostitution Investigation Unit of the UNMIK Police conducted 353 raids on premises where people trafficking was suspected of taking place. 61 premises were closed down, 234 arrests were made and 92 persons were charged with trafficking offences. 89 victims were repatriated and 1,727 people were added to a database used to help target efforts to tackle trafficking from major source countries.</p>

One of the main objectives of the programme is to build local government capacity so that it can provide improved services to the communities for which it is responsible. Using participatory methods, the programme is assisting local government to work in partnership with community associations to achieve tangible outcomes such as clean water, sanitation and waste disposal. This process will contribute to strengthening local democracy as government and communities learn to work together. We are presently considering a second phase of support to LUPP.</p>

	<p pid=".965W.2/1">International humanitarian law, as embodied in the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols, prohibits the recruitment or use of children under 15 in armed conflict and provides for the protection of children, particularly those separated from their families. The Statute of the International Criminal Court, to which the UK is a state party and which has been incorporated into national law, makes the recruitment and/or use of children under 15 a war crime.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.2/2">The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, now enshrined in the Human Rights Act 1998, forbids the use of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment which may include the forcing of children to take part in hostilities.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.2/3">The UK is a Party to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which makes particular provision for the protection of all children under 18 years. It prescribes that the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration, severely restricts the circumstances in which children may be removed from their parents and protects children against arbitrary interference with their privacy and liberty. This Convention, along with International Labour Organisation Convention 182 (which the UK has ratified), prohibits the use of children in the worst forms of labour; and Convention 182 specifically prohibits the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict.</p>
	<p pid=".965W.2/4">The UK expects to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict later this year. This provides that states parties must take all feasible measures to ensure that members of their armed forces who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take a direct part in hostilities, and that children under 18 years are not compulsorily recruited into their armed forces. Non-state actors, such as insurgent groups, are prohibited from ever recruiting or using in hostilities children under 18. We take the Protocol seriously. That is why before we ratify, we need to be clear that the detailed procedures and administrative guidelines for the armed forces are finalised. These will give concrete form to our commitment. MOD officials, in consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, are in the final stages of drafting an Explanatory Memorandum which will explain the steps being taken to meet that commitment. As part of the ratification process, we will lay the Explanatory Memorandum (EM) before Parliament. This does not require any changes to UK legislation.</p>

In addressing this, my Department is working with other UK Government Departments and other governments through appropriate regional mechanisms, the non-governmental community and the multilateral system to this end. UNICEF, with the support of my Department and other governments, works to effect the disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation of child soldiers, particularly back into the community and prevent their re-recruitment.

	<p pid=".966W.2/3">Through its representation on the Security Council, the Government have been closely involved in the passing of eight resolutions since August 1999 addressing the issue of child soldiers and other children affected by armed conflict, and are currently involved in negotiations for a further resolution to strengthen the ability of the international community to take action to prevent the recruitment and use of children in armed conflicts. Along with the vast majority of other states, the Government have also ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and is taking steps to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention preventing the use of children in armed conflict.</p>

	<p pid=".966W.5/1">I was not in favour of the abolition of the Development Council, which had been useful in promoting reforms of EC development co-operation, in adopting a more coherent development policy framework and in pressing the case for an increase in the poverty focus of EC aid. The June 2002 Seville European Council decided to streamline the functioning of the Council in the run-up to enlargement and reduced Council groupings from 16 to 9 and thus abolished the development Council. There are opportunities with the new General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) for more discussions on development at monthly meetings.</p>
	<p pid=".966W.5/2">I have been working to maintain a strategic approach to development issues as established by the Development Council. In particular, I have been pushing for at least two strategic GAERC meetings per year focusing on development&mdash;one forward looking and one to assess progress. I will continue to press hard to ensure development is given due weight in the new configuration and will seek to ensure appropriate UK ministerial attendance to debate development issues.</p>

	<p pid=".968W.2/1">Over half of all new HIV/AIDS infections are in young people (15&ndash;24 age group). We believe, therefore, that HIV prevention programmes must give a high priority to informing young people about the risk of HIV/AIDS, and that young people are encouraged to participate in the development of programmes to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. We support young people's HIV/AIDS prevention through our bilateral programmes and in partnership with UNICEF.</p>

In Mozambique we have committed &pound;2.6 million over five years to support UNICEF's HIV/AIDS programme for young people. In China, we are currently developing an HIV/AIDS prevention and care programme that includes young people in a range of design activities. In Kenya, we have supported various focus group discussions with young people and trained peer HIV/AIDS educators.</p>

	<p pid=".968W.5/1">99 per cent. of the 510,000 maternal deaths and most of the widespread disability caused by complications in childbirth worldwide are in developing countries. Up to 80 per cent. of these deaths result from five relatively common obstetric complications: haemorrhage, infection, complications of abortion, eclampsia and obstructed labour. Almost all of these deaths could be avoided by timely, effective interventions by skilled attendants at delivery, backed up by a functioning referral system and access to emergency obstetric care. This requires effective care and functioning health systems. To this end my Department have committed over &pound;1 billion since 1997 to health systems strengthening. We are also working to improve access to quality reproductive and sexual health services in order to avoid unwanted pregnancies.</p>

	<p pid=".969W.2/1">The World Food Programme (WFP) has responded to the Government's request for assistance by implementing a food distribution programme focusing on six provinces and 38 districts considered worst affected by the drought. Between July and December WFP distributed some 14,301 metric tonnes of food aid. As the operation gradually expanded over the six-month period, WFP's beneficiary caseload gradually increased. In December food rations were distributed to 247,130 people.</p>
	<p pid=".969W.2/2">The programme is carried out through implementing partners representing a mix of international and national non-governmental organisations, and the Mozambique Red Cross. In 11 areas of operation the programme is implemented directly through local authorities. Implementing partners help to identify vulnerable households eligible to receive food aid, and organise physical distribution of food at the community level. The main focus of the programme to date has been on implementing food-for-work schemes. Given that Mozambique is now entering the hungry period, a programme shift, with greater emphasis on meeting the needs of vulnerable people who cannot work is planned.</p>
	<p pid=".969W.2/3">UNICEF has extended its regular country programme to include the implementation of drought response projects in areas that are considered to be particularly vulnerable. With support from DFID (&pound;973, 000), UNICEF is implementing a blanket supplementary feeding programme for children aged 6&ndash;59 months and for pregnant and lactating mothers. The project will focus on the six provinces considered most vulnerable and aims to reach 141,000 children and 71,000 women. The programme also includes follow-up treatment and care for severely malnourished children through support to the existing therapeutic feeding centre network. UNICEF will implement activities through a network of partners comprising local and international NGOs and the Mozambique Red Cross.</p>
	<p pid=".969W.2/4">In addition, UNICEF has also responded to the Government's request for assistance by supporting the creation of thirty sentinel sites for nutritional surveillance in order to measure acute malnutrition trends. This programme focuses on three drought-affected provinces. Planning work is under way to expand the programme and increase geographical coverage of the sites. UNICEF has also been working on strengthening epidemiological preparedness and providing additional support to measles vaccination campaigns. Furthermore, UNICEF has increased its focus on the provision of clean water at health centres in the districts worst affected by the drought. UNICEF is also pre-positioning school kits as an incentive for children to attend school, given indications that both the drought and the HIV/AIDS pandemic is resulting in increased drop-out rates.</p>
	<p pid=".969W.2/5">DFID has provided &pound;1 million for a cash for work programme, providing an income source in the short term and increasing access to markets in the longer term. DFID is providing &pound;973,000 in support of UNICEF's supplementary feeding programme. DFID is looking at providing up to &pound;500,000 to support agricultural input fairs given poor crop forecasts in many areas of southern Mozambique.</p>

	<p pid=".971W.5/1">The LRA have for many years made a practice of making children a main target of their war. Until security improves in northern Uganda, however, UNICEF will not be able to collect precise data on the number of unaccounted children. Renewed LRA activity last year led to a dramatic increase, and it is estimated that 4,500 children were abducted in 2002 (compared to 100 in 2001). It is unclear how many of these children have returned home and how many are still being held by the LRA inside Uganda or Sudan. Unfortunately, many of these children will have been killed. DFID is supporting Save the Children's efforts to rehabilitate and reintegrate those fortunate enough to escape, and will continue to do so as long as it is required.</p>

Humanitarian consequences of the continuing conflict are high, with an estimated 600,000 internally displaced persons and declining levels of food security due to disruption of harvesting and planting seasons. DFID has made available &pound;1.6 million for food supplies to be distributed by the World Food Programme.

I fully support the need to end the suffering inflicted by the Lords Resistance Army, however our assessment is that this objective does not justify all the additional defence expenditure. In response to the Government of Uganda's breaching of the agreed process for government resource allocations and the consequent increase of defence spending, the UK is to withhold &pound;5 million of its general budget support this financial year.</p>

	<p pid=".972W.8/1">I am in close contact with President Museveni on the possible responses to the conflict in northern Uganda. This was one of the subjects of our meeting last week at Entebbe airport. The levels of violence perpetrated by the Lord's Resistance Army are terrible, and I support the efforts of the Ugandan government to protect the lives and property of its citizens. The complex nature of the conflict means that dialogue is crucial if a sustainable end to the suffering faced by the Acholi people is to be realised. I have been encouraged by the passing of the Amnesty Act, the appointment of the Government Peace team and the work of the Acholi religious leaders as offering real potential for dialogue.</p>

	<p pid=".973W.8/2">The SADC Vulnerability Assessment Committee report of December 2002 estimated that the total number of people in need of food assistance in Zimbabwe had risen to 7.2 million. Of these, the World Food Programme (WFP) aims to reach 5.8 million. Other humanitarian assistance is provided through the Government of Zimbabwe, and bilateral support direct to non-governmental organisations in addition to donor help through the WFP. The UK bilateral programme alone is reaching 1.5 million people; 1 million of these are children receiving supplementary feeling in schools, with the remainder comprising particularly vulnerable adults (for example people in the district of Binga), pregnant women, and the elderly.</p>

The latest estimates are that, as at the end of 2001, remaining proven and probable discovered recoverable reserves amounted to 955 million tonnes. A further 475 million tonnes are classified as possible reserves. It is also estimated that, as of that date, additional reserves of between 205 and 1,930 million tonnes existed in fields that had not yet been discovered. How long these reserves will last will depend on whether the additional and possible reserves are brought into production and the rate at which they are extracted, but production is expected to continue beyond 2020.</p>

By definition, contingent liabilities may never result in actual expenditure. Therefore they are not included in estimates of public expenditure or borrowing unless or until there is a reasonable expectation that expenditure will be incurred.</p>

This lists all outstanding contingent liabilities during the financial year where they are reportable to Parliament using the criteria set out in Government Accounting. The Supplementary Statement for 2001&ndash;02 was published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-19">19 December 2002</phrase> (HC 381). In addition, departments must follow accounting standards when disclosing contingent liabilities by way of notes to their accounts.</p>

This duty is normally charged at the rate of the fuel for which that substance is substituting. Where cooking oil is used in diesel-engined cars, it will normally be liable at the rate set for ultra-low sulphur diesel, which is 45.82p per litre.

	<p pid=".1003W.5/2">This year we will be testing out the Standard Local Housing Allowances (SLHA) in around 10 pathfinder local authorities. Private sector tenants will be paid according to average local rents rather than rents charged. This will allow people to know in advance what housing benefit support they will receive, promote choice and personal responsibility and bridge the gap between benefit and work by allowing tenants to budget for their own rent. The evaluation of the pathfinders will include tracking the effects of the SLHA on people under 25 years of age, and the results will inform consideration of whether any changes to the younger person rent restrictions are necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".1003W.8/1">The Government are encouraging everyone with the necessary qualifications, including lone parents, to enter further and higher education. For further education institutions in England <sup>1</sup> , we have increased the ring-fenced budget for child care funds by 20 per cent. to &pound;36 million in 2002&ndash;03. In higher education in England and Wales <sup>1</sup> , lone parents already pay no tuition fees if their income is less than &pound;20,480, and have access to a range of support including grants for child care, school meals and travel, books and equipment. These grants are being simplified from next September, as all lone parents (including students) will now be eligible for the new child tax credit being introduced from April 2003. This will make it even easier for lone parents to make the transition from benefits to higher education.</p>
	<p pid=".1003W.8/2">Student loans are paid in three instalments and are taken into account in income-related benefits for the period they are intended to cover i.e. September to June. The Department for Education and Skills has made arrangements to ensure that students who need financial help in the period before their first loan instalment arrives, can receive a payment from the Access and Hardship Funds held by their university to tide them over. This payment is disregarded in assessing entitlement to income-related benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".1005W.2/1">Ex-offenders have particular difficulties in returning to the labour market. We also know that those without accommodation or employment are twice as likely to re-offend. In recognition of this we are introducing a number of initiatives to help ex-offenders move into work.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.2/2">&pound;3 million has been allocated over three years to the development of Freshstart, launched in October 2001. Freshstart aims to improve the transition from custody to work through improving the links between prisons and jobcentres. It also provides prisoners who have not already secured a job with an appointment for a new jobseeker interview on release, providing direct access to jobs and the new deal, as well as speeding up their claim for jobseeker's allowance. By the end of November 2002, over 23,000 new jobseeker interviews had been booked.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.2/3">In July 2002 we launched a pilot scheme to place touch-screen jobpoints in prisons. There are two trials currently running; computer access to the Department's Worktrain site in Durham, Onley, Askham Grange and Moorland prisons; and jobpoints in Lewes, Swansea, Hollesley Bay and Featherstone prisons.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.2/4">We are also currently developing an Employment and Benefit Surgeries in Prisons project to meet the recommendations made in the Home Office Social Exclusion Unit report &quot;Reducing re-offending by ex-prisoners&quot;. We aim to start national roll out later in 2003. The project will offer all prisoners aged 18 and over one-to-one guidance on access to the full range of benefits and services offered by the Department.Typically this will cover:</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.2/5" class="indent">Job search activity</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.2/6" class="indent">Training and education opportunities</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.2/7" class="indent">Support programmes such as new deal and progress2workLinkUp</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.2/8" class="indent">Procedures to follow and steps to take in making a claim to benefit</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.2/9">This new work will build upon and complement existing provision for ex-offenders.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.2/10">We have also developed a number of pilot programmes called Progress2work-LinkUP which focus on providing support for those at greatest disadvantage within the labour market, including ex-offenders. This initiative extends existing provision to tackle the issues that represent significant barriers to employment. The pilots support people by:</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.2/11" class="indent">providing specialist advice away from the normal New Deal and other mainstream measures and</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.2/12" class="indent">offering access and referral to appropriate specialists</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.2/13">Nine pilots were launched in autumn 2002 in Avon and Somerset, Merseyside and Metropolitan and West Yorkshire. Up to 10 further pilots are planned for 2003&ndash;04 focusing on the Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, West Midlands and Thames Valley areas.</p>

	<p pid=".1008W.5/1">Before any computed tomography (CT) scanner can be installed in the national health service, European Union legislation requires that a formal procurement process must be undertaken. This consists of an advert in the Official Journal of the European Community, followed by an evaluation of interested suppliers and an invitation to offer via tender. Once contracts have been signed, the successful supplier will agree a suitable delivery date with the NHS trust concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".1008W.5/2">Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre NHS trust has made a bid for central funding from the Department of Health to allow the capital purchase of an additional CT scanner, as part of the NHS Cancer Plan programme. The final stages of a consultation process with strategic health authorities, cancer networks and local commissioners will shortly confirm whether the trust has been successful in securing such funding.</p>

	<p pid=".1015W.6/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently engaged in a project to consider options for updating the Indices of Deprivation 2000 (ID 2000). As part of this project, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is investigating the potential for constructing a Crime and Social Order domain, which would measure the deprivation people face as a result of crime or as a result of living in an area with high rates of crime and social disorder. Discussions are currently taking place with officials in the Home Office over the scope, availability and quality of data.</p>

It did not find any exploitation in the borough of Christchurch, but the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is minded to reduce the maximum Right to Buy discount in this area because it is under great housing pressure as evidenced by a high local incidence of homelessness and high local house prices.</p>

For Teesdale, these figures were 15.6 per cent. and &pound;136 respectively. After their ability to raise council tax is taken into account, this gives grant increases for Berwick of 3 per cent. (the floor) and Teesdale 12.5 per cent. (the ceiling).</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.2/2">Many indicators have been removed, replaced, or updated in the EPCS Formula Review, and it is difficult to quantify every impact of the formula changes on each district.</p>
	<p pid=".1019W.2/3">Teesdale gains significantly and Berwick loses from the formula no longer taking account of overnight visitors. Both districts lose FSS from the removal of the old housing deprivation indictors (less so for Teesdale) and the lower sparsity weighting. Teesdale gains from the lower weighting for numbers on income support, but loses slightly due to an estimated population decline after the 2001 Census.</p>

In addition, we are providing around &pound;190,000 a year towards the Parentline Plus helpline for parents of pupils who have been bullied, and we are also funding anti-bullying research by ChildLine&mdash;&pound;120,000 in total, including a conference&mdash;and an external evaluation of the usefulness of our anti-bullying pack to schools that have ordered it.

	<p pid=".1023W.6/1">We are already doing much to improve the quality and availability of provision and the direct partnership between employers and the education and training system. By June we will have set out our national skills strategy and delivery plan setting out how we will further boost numbers of young people acquiring technical and craft skills across the economy and how we can get more adults to acquire vocational skills and qualifications.</p>
	<p pid=".1023W.6/2">I have set out as follows some examples of the important work already in train:</p>
	<p pid=".1023W.6/3" class="indent">We have begun to make a start through our Success for All Strategy in bringing employers and training providers closer together to ensure that skills priorities and shortages are addressed. From August, colleges will be expected to agree three year development plans with their local Learning and Skills Council (LSC). This will ensure that funding is allocated on the basis of each college meeting headline targets, including targets for employer engagement. The targets will be specific to the role each college will play in responding to local skill needs and for many, these will clearly link to reducing skills shortages and gaps in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".1023W.6/4" class="indent">The Learning and Skills Council is engaged in substantial adult skills pilots in each of the occupational areas mentioned. These pilots are nationally managed and locally delivered through a consortium of local LSCs, the development-phase Sector Skills Councils, employers and providers. The pilots are proving highly successful in identifying and overcoming barriers to employer-led training programmes, and when mainstreamed will enable large numbers of adults to train or re-train for technician skills which are currently in very high demand. The Council offers substantial support for adult trainees through its heavy subsidies (of between 50 per cent. and 75 per cent. of full cost) towards college and other provider fees. In all the Council provides several hundred million pounds of subsidy towards the training of technicians every year, and provides progression routes to high level skills and HE.</p>
	<p pid=".1023W.6/5" class="indent">A new Standards Unit has also been established within my Department to focus specifically on improving the quality of teaching and learning. The Unit will concentrate on developing best practice materials in up to four curriculum areas in the spring and summer terms of 2002&ndash;03. Construction, which includes plumbing and joinery, has been identified as one of these priority areas.</p>
	<p pid=".1023W.6/6" class="indent">We are currently setting up, through the new Sector Skills Development Agency, a network of Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) that will bring together employers, trade unions and professional bodies to work with government to meet the skills needs of their sector. SSCs covering plumbing, mechanics and construction (which includes joinery) sectors are in development phase.</p>
	<p pid=".1023W.6/7" class="indent">We are wholly committed to Modern Apprenticeships (MA) as a quality work-based learning route for young people, increasing the supply of skills at craft, supervisory and technician level across industry. We have adopted a challenging target for MA entrants by 2004&mdash;28 per cent. of young people to begin an MA by the age of 22&mdash;and are working with the LSC to ensure all MAs meet the highest standards and to encourage take-up among employers and young people. A new Modern Apprenticeship Task Force will take a key role in promoting MA to employers and thereby contributing to increased take-up. Provisional figures for 2002&ndash;03 show that the number of young people engaged in Foundation Modern Apprenticeships in construction (which includes joinery) and plumbing has increased dramatically.</p>
	<p pid=".1023W.6/8" class="indent">Our national skills strategy and delivery plan will set out how Government Departments, the Learning and Skills Council, Sector Skills Councils, Regional Development Agencies and other agencies will work even further together to deliver the economy's skill needs.</p>

New measures to tighten up the law on airguns and replica firearms will be included in the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill. Individual police forces have also introduced targeted initiatives for tackling gun crime, such as operations Trident in London and Ventara in Birmingham.</p>

We will sign a treaty soon to set the legal framework to provide for full immigration controls at Calais and subsequently at other channel ports. We will deploy immigration service resources on a targeted and flexible, intelligence led basis to ports other than Calais to counteract any displacement that may occur.</p>

	<p pid=".1031W.2/17">The BCS figures are estimates only. They are derived from a sample and so are subject to sampling error. Also, the context of the face-to-face BCS interview means the estimates are certain to be underestimates of the true extent because some respondents may be unwilling to reveal experience of domestic violence to interviewers. Results from the 1996 BCS self-completion module on domestic violence were published in Home Office Research Study No. 191, deposited in the Library. This more confidential approach to measurement revealed that the proportion of women that were victims in the last year of domestic assault was over three times higher than in the main BCS.</p>

	<p pid=".1033W.2/1">The area in question is served by two Drug Action Teams (DATs)&mdash;East Riding of Yorkshire and Kingston-upon-Hull. They work very closely and meet as a combined forum. The DATs are served by a comprehensive infrastructure including combined Joint Commissioning Groups, groups working across all sections of the National Drugs Strategy, Drug Reference Groups and 15 locality based Drug Forums. They are supported by senior and assistant DAT Coordinator posts.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/2">Last year (2001&ndash;02) the DATs oversaw the allocation of a total budget approaching &pound;15 million pounds, of which nearly 50 per cent. was allocated to treatment services, 25 per cent. on addressing the availability of drugs, 15 per cent. on community involvement and 12 per cent. on young people's initiatives.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/3">The combined DATs have recently produced and published an Annual Report for 2001&ndash;02 and a Combined Strategic Plan for 2002&ndash;03, copies of which will be placed in the Library. These documents paint a comprehensive picture of initiatives already in place and those planned for the future. In particular, there has been an increase in investment in treatment services.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.2/4">As part of the Prison Service Drug Strategy, Her Majesty's Prison Hull is actively working towards reducing the supply of, and demand for, illegal drugs among prisoners. Hull offers drug-misusing prisoners a range of drug interventions&mdash;including detoxification and counselling, assessment, referral, advice and through care (CARAT) services. The through care elements of the latter are aimed at establishing links to treatment services in the community to ensure that the progress made during custody is consolidated post-release. Prisoners are encouraged to remain drug-free, and to demonstrate this commitment, they can sign Voluntary Drug Testing compacts.</p>

	<p pid=".1033W.5/2">The recent discovery of traces of ricin, followed by arrests in the United Kingdom and abroad, show there is a continuing interest in using chemical, biological or radiological agents as weapons of terror. While there is no credible, specific threat to targets in the United Kingdom, it is vital that the Government continue to protect the public from any possible threat from terrorism. That is why the Government are making substantial investment to ensure that the emergency services have the equipment and trained officers to enable them to respond to the release of CBRN material.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.5/3">This is on-going work. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing, Crime Reduction and Community Safety was appointed Minister for CBRN co-ordination in 2001 supported by a Cabinet sub-committee and a dedicated team of officials at the Home Office. We are continually learning and developing the best way to protect the UK from terrorism and to manage the consequences of terrorism, in whatever form it comes. However the Government do not give detailed information on CBRN capabilities, as this information could be useful to terrorists.</p>

	<p pid=".1035W.0/2">The Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme (ISSP) was launched in 2001 to provide the courts with a tough community based programme designed to tackle persistent young offenders. It was extended last year and now provides for approximately 3,500 young offenders a year at an annual cost of &pound;21.5million.</p>
	<p pid=".1035W.0/3">I am pleased to announce that provision has now been made to complete full national coverage by January 2004, providing in total for 4,200 young people annually.

	<p pid=".1035W.0/4">The average cost for each six month placement including bail tagging, is &pound;8,500. The total number of young offenders who could be eligible is difficult to calculate because of the combination of criteria which must be satisfied.</p>

	<p pid=".1041W.8/1">The Prison Service owns six houses within its former quarters estates adjacent to the prisons at Parkhurst, Camphill and Albany. There is a complex pattern of ownership of boundaries within these estates with the Prison Service also retaining ownership some roads and areas of open space, some with outline planning permission for further residential redevelopment. Responsibility for maintaining all highways, open space areas and services lies with current land owners, except where adopted by utility providers. Where land and premises have been sold by the Prison Service maintenance responsibilities are specified within the sale conveyances. There is no legal obligation on the Prison Service to maintain privately owned highways and services and there is no planned maintenance programme in place. Maintenance of Prison Service owned land and services is organised by the prisons' works departments.</p>
	<p pid=".1041W.8/2">The Prison Service retains the right under the terms of sale conveyances granted to directly recharge the cost of highway and services maintenance it does complete to all private owners, on these estates, benefiting from the works. The Prison Service contributes to such expenditure according to the benefit it derives, if any, from such works. Due to Prison Service funding priorities and strong opposition from many residents to the possibility of recharges being made, only limited maintenance works have been completed in recent years.</p>
	<p pid=".1041W.8/3">The Prison Service has been working closely with the Isle of Wight council and the residents associations to try to reach agreement on proposals for upgrading the highways and services on these estates, to a standard where they can be formally adopted and maintained by the Isle of Wight council and utility providers.</p>

	<p pid=".1044W.5/1">Two recently published studies commissioned by the Home Office and Youth Justice Board provide an indication of the level of personal robbery and street crime in the vicinity of schools.</p>
	<p pid=".1044W.5/2">Recently published Home Office research (&quot;The Nature of Personal Robbery&quot;, Home office Research Study 254, 2003) which looked at the nature of personal robbery, found that only 1 per cent. of personal robberies actually occurred on or around school or college premises, though this may be an underestimate. However, the study also found that the risk period for school age victims was late afternoon (2 p.m. to 6 p.m.) when more than half (54 per cent.) were targeted and when many were making their way home from school, or similarly socialising with friends.</p>
	<p pid=".1044W.5/3">Similarly, recently published research commissioned by the Youth Justice Board (&quot;Young People and Street Crime: Research into young people's involvement in street crime&quot;), which focuses on street crime in London boroughs in the main, found that offending peaks dramatically after school finishes on weekdays, often in the vicinity of schools or on the main routes taken home by pupils. The research suggested that even if the perpetrators had not attended school during the day, they may well gravitate back there if they have nothing else to do.</p>
	<p pid=".1044W.5/4">As part of the package of measures to tackle street crime and improve behaviour in schools, there are now 100 police officers based in selected schools in areas with high levels of street crime. This is a joint initiative between the Department for Education and Skills (DfES), the Youth Justice Board (YJB) and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and is called Safer School Partnerships (SSP).</p>
	<p pid=".1044W.5/5">Safer School Partnerships build on previous police involvement in schools where police officers have tended to take an essentially teaching role; as part of an SSP their role is more operational. They provide a much fuller level of resource and will be able to develop a much closer relationship with the school and its community.</p>
	<p pid=".1044W.5/6">Police officers are working with school staff and other local agencies to reduce victimisation, criminality and anti-social behaviour within the school and its local community. SSPs aim to reduce crime in and around schools, so making cost-effective use of police time; helping schools improve, so parents keep sending their children to those schools; and reducing disorder, so heads can spend time improving their school, instead of dealing with behaviour problems.</p>
	<p pid=".1044W.5/7">The specific areas where SSPs are making a contribution to schools and their community include prevention and reduction of crime, anti-social behaviour and related incidents in and around the school, together with any bullying and violence experienced by pupils and staff, truancy and exclusion, damage to school buildings and drug related incidents.</p>

Studies published in 1997 and 2000 found that 60 per cent. and 66 per cent. of women prisoners respectively had dependent children under the age of 18.</p>
