However, the Digital Radio Upgrade programme, alongside the proposals on co-location and licence-renewals, will offer significant cost-savings for commercial broadcasters, some of which must support investment in improving coverage.</p>
	<p pid="c.1004W.7/2">In areas where the BBC's need to deliver universal access is not matched by the economic realities of the local commercial market, the BBC will need to bear a significant portion of the costs. The full cost cannot be left to the BBC alone. Where possible, the BBC and national commercial multiplex operators should work together to ensure that any new transmitters benefit both BBC and commercial multiplexes. Partnerships between the BBC and commercial local multiplex operators will be even more important at a local DAB level.</p>

	<p pid="c.1022W.7/6">No account is taken of the value of a property that a person occupies as their home, while the value of any second property is normally treated as capital. However the Government do recognise that there are certain circumstances where it would be impractical and unfair to take the value of a second property into account. An example of this is that, once a property is put up for sale, the value can be ignored for up to 26 weeks, or longer where reasonable steps are being taken to sell it.</p>

	<p pid="c.1024W.2/13">Of the &#163;5 billion additional investment, &#163;2.1 billion is allocated to 2009-10 and &#163;2.9 billion to 2010-11. The precise allocation of this resource within the Department is set out in our three-year business plan, a copy of which is in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1024W.2/14">The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance at the end of 2009 was over 450,000 lower than the NAO audited assumption at the time of Budget 2009. If unemployment follows the revised NAO audited assumption set out in the pre-Budget report 2009, benefit expenditure would be around &#163;10 billion lower over the next five years than forecast at Budget 2009. This has also led to savings from the Department's budget and allows us to reprioritise &#163;400 million over the next 18 months to fund the measures set out in &quot;Building Britain's Recovery: Achieving Full Employment&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="c.1025W.2/1">The DWP communications team has a wide-ranging remit to support the delivery of the Department's objectives. This includes communicating with staff, the public, business and stakeholders on the help and support available throughout the downturn, eligibility for entitlements, pensions, additional help and support as well as encouraging saving for later life. The team works right across the breadth of the Department's responsibilities and includes providing services for Jobcentre Plus and the Pensions, Disability and Carers Service.</p>

	<p pid="c.1025W.2/3">During 2008-09 financial year a total of &#163;42.283 million was spent by DWP on all communication services. This total covers the spend with external marketing and communication suppliers but does not include internal staff costs and any communications interim personnel. In addition a further &#163;1.735 million was spent on Marketing and Publicity services through the Department's Print and Associated Services contract with iON during the 2008-09 period. These figures are against overall DWP running costs in 2008-09 of &#163;7.9 billion (0.56 per cent. of overall spend).</p>
	<p pid="c.1025W.2/4">Included in this, DWP spent &#163;12.327 million on advertising in this period. All costs are exclusive of VAT, COI fees, advertising rebates and audit adjustments and are for media spend only. They also exclude the cost of creative work, research, production of supporting materials or launch events.</p>

	<p pid="c.1030W.12/1">In order to be entitled to industrial injuries disablement benefit (IIDB) in respect of osteoarthritis of the knee a person must satisfy criteria based on occupation and the level of disablement caused by the disease.</p>
	<p pid="c.1030W.12/2">The occupational criteria are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1030W.12/3">Underground work as a coal miner up to the end of 1985.</p>
	<p pid="c.1030W.12/4">If the work was after 1985, a person must have worked underground in one of the following occupations:</p>

	<p pid="c.1030W.12/11">If a person satisfies the occupational criteria the case is referred to medical services for advice on the level of disablement. For IIDB purposes, disablement is assessed by making a comparison with a person of the same age and sex whose physical and mental condition is normal. In each case, advice on the assessment of disablement and the likely duration is given by a doctor specially trained in industrial injuries disablement matters.</p>

	<p pid="c.1035W.6/1">The Government use a basket of three key thresholds of income, after housing costs, to measure pensioner poverty. The most commonly used figures relate to those with incomes below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income, after housing costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1035W.6/2">Estimates of poverty, published in the Households Below Average Income series, only allow a breakdown of the overall number of people in poverty at Government office region level. Therefore, information for the Stroud constituency is not available, though figures relating to the south-west Government office region are.</p>
	<p pid="c.1035W.6/3">Three-year averages are used to report regional statistics as single-year estimates are subject to volatility. Figures are quoted to the nearest 100,000. The following table shows the number and percentage of pensioners in the south-west Government office region who have incomes below 60 per cent. of the contemporary median income:</p>

	<p pid="c.1035W.6/20">The final row in this table, covering the three year period 2005-06 to 2007-08 is the most recent estimate of pensioner poverty in the south-west region produced in the Department.</p>
	<p pid="c.1035W.6/21">Our strategy since 1997 has been to target help on the poorest pensioners while providing a solid foundation of support for all.</p>
	<p pid="c.1035W.6/22">We have a good track record of reducing pensioner poverty. In 2007-08 there were 900,000 fewer pensioners in relative poverty than in 1998-99 (measured as below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income after housing costs). Today's pensioners are less likely to be living in relative poverty after housing costs than the population as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.1035W.6/23">In 1997, the poorest pensioners, who received Income Support, lived on around &#163;69 a week (equivalent to &#163;98 a week in today's prices). Today pension credit ensures that no pensioner needs to live on less than &#163;130 a week or &#163;198.45 a week for couples). This represents an increase in income by almost a third in real terms. And many of those on pension credit will also be entitled to additional support through housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.1035W.6/24">The Pension, Disability and Carers Service continue to promote take-up of benefits for those entitled. This involves data matching to identify entitled non-recipients, home visits for vulnerable customers, targeted local marketing and media campaigns, a simple claim process involving telephones as well as paper claims and ever closer working with partner organisations. The Department is also looking at innovative ways of using information that we already hold to make payments of pension credit more automatically to entitled non-recipients.</p>
	<p pid="c.1035W.6/25">In the Pensions Act 2007, we made a commitment to continue to uprate the pension credit standard minimum guarantee at least in line with average earnings over the long-term. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has commented that without this, it is likely there would be significant increases in pensioner poverty in the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.1035W.6/26">We have also made a commitment to re-link the uprating of the basic state pension to average earnings. Our objective, subject to affordability and the fiscal position, is to do this in 2012, but in any event by the end of the next Parliament at the latest. This will benefit almost 12 million pensioners.</p>

	<p pid="c.1036W.2/1">The Government are committed to helping vulnerable customers to heat their homes during the cold weather, so we are continuing cold weather payments. These provide &#163;25 towards eligible customers' heating costs during each consecutive seven-day period of very cold weather. There is no need to claim as eligible customers are paid automatically when payments are triggered in their area.</p>
	<p pid="c.1036W.2/2">External communications, including media and web interviews and briefings for welfare organisations, focus on reassuring customers that they will get payments and do not need to make a claim. An online tool is available on the Directgov website where people can find out about eligibility and whether payments have been triggered in their area. There is also a leaflet, 'The Social Fund' which provides information.</p>
	<p pid="c.1036W.2/3">The Government are also committed to reducing pensioner poverty and works hard to ensure pensioners are aware of pension credit. The claims process has been simplified and since November 2008 telephone claims for housing benefit and council tax benefit can be forwarded directly to the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.1036W.2/4">Targeted take-up campaigns continue in selected regions to raise awareness and to encourage customers to apply. The campaign uses a range or methods including targeted direct mail, supported by sustained media coverage as well as community advertising.</p>
	<p pid="c.1036W.2/5">When contacted, customer advisers in the Pension, Disability and Carers Service discuss pension credit with those who may be eligible and it also conducts around 13,000 home visits a week for vulnerable customers ensuring they are receiving the benefits they are entitled to.</p>
	<p pid="c.1036W.2/6">Joint Working Partnerships have been established with all 203 primary tier local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales. These enable the Pension Disability and Carers Service, local authorities and the voluntary sector to provide a single point of access to social care and benefit entitlement.</p>

	<p pid="c.1038W.3/1">Entitlement to incapacity benefits and disability living allowance is not dependent on a diagnosis or condition but relies instead on the effects that a person's condition has on their ability to carry out a number of everyday activities. The focus of the relevant medical assessment for incapacity benefits determines the extent to which these effects impact on a person, and benefit is only awarded after specific criteria are met. Similarly entitlement to disability living allowance is not dependent on a diagnosis or condition but relies instead on the care and/or mobility needs arising.</p>
	<p pid="c.1038W.3/2">Only the primary medical diagnosis written on a claimant's medical certificate is recorded for benefit purposes. However, many of those who claim benefit with a diagnosis of drug or alcohol dependency will also have other underlying medical conditions such as mental/psychiatric illness. Information on the cost and numbers of people on benefit who claim with a diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease is not available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1038W.3/3">From <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-27">27 October 2008</phrase> we replaced incapacity benefits for new customers with the employment and support allowance and a revised medical assessment which focuses on what people can do, as well as what they cannot.</p>

	<p pid="c.1038W.3/5">The available information has been placed in the Library. It should be noted however that this represents a sub set of the total number of customers claiming these benefits who suffer from an alcohol or drug dependency</p>

	<p pid="c.1039W.5/1">The Department for Work and Pensions and its executive agencies take into account an individual's circumstances as a matter of course, including current and former service personnel and their families.</p>
	<p pid="c.1039W.5/2">The Service Command Paper 'The Nation's Commitment: Cross-Government Support to our Armed Forces, their Families and Veterans' [Cm 7424] published in July 2008 contained a number of departmental commitments to further support service personnel families and former members of the armed forces. These included an agreement to use service medical board evidence when considering entitlement to Employment Support Allowance (supporting guidance was issued to Jobcentre Plus staff in October 2009) and the Department's commitment to award Class 1 National Insurance Credits to spouses and civil partners of service personnel posted overseas with effect from April 2010. This will enable more members of service personnel families to qualify for Jobseeker's Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance and basic State Pension. Staff in my Department are currently working with colleagues in Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and Ministry of Defence to produce guidance on this for our staff and customers. This will include producing a customer fact sheet, providing advice to go into the packs given to members of Her Majesty's forces when a posting outside the UK is about to end and making information, including the application form for the credits, available online via, the Department for Work and Pensions and Ministry of Defence websites. The addresses are:</p>

	<p pid="c.1039W.5/5">General guidance on the application and interpretation of Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance rules for our Decision Makers can be found in the Decision Makers Guide.

	<p pid="c.1039W.5/7">Following the Home Office announcement last year that all Gurkhas who retired before <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase> with four years service would be able to settle in the UK, the Pension, Disability and Carers Service has been working with other Government Departments on plans for their arrival.</p>
	<p pid="c.1039W.5/8">Internal guidance is being prepared for issue shortly to Pension, Disability and Carers Service staff to help them respond to the needs of ex-Gurkhas.</p>
	<p pid="c.1039W.5/9">In the calculation of entitlement to Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, a mandatory &#163;10 disregard of income from war pensions (war disablement pension, a pension to a war widow or war widower or a similar pension paid to a surviving civil partner), applies. In addition, local authorities have discretionary powers to disregard some or all of any income from war pensions, including service attributable pensions, once the mandatory disregard of &#163;10 has been made. It is a matter for each authority to decide the extent to which they apply the additional disregard. We have recently issued guidance clarifying that service attributable pensions fall to be disregarded under the discretionary powers.</p>

	<p pid="c.1046W.2/1">Data on sanctions is available for jobseeker's allowance from the year 2000. Data on sanctions is not available for income support, incapacity benefit and employment and support allowance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.2/2">Questions about entitlement to jobseeker's allowance can arise at any time from the commencement of a claim. For example, if there is doubt around whether the jobseeker's agreement (JSAg) is suitable, whether the claimant is actively looking for work or making them self available for work. In most cases payment of Jobseeker's Allowance will be suspended until the doubt is resolved.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.2/3">The following types of sanctions are available for jobseeker's allowance claimants:</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.2/4" class="indent">Varied Length Sanctions: A sanction of between one week and 26 weeks is imposed for leaving employment voluntarily without just cause, refusing employment without good cause, or losing employment through misconduct. The actual period in each case is at the discretion of the Adjudication Officer who makes the decision.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.2/5" class="indent">Fixed Length Sanctions: A sanction of two weeks (four weeks if repeated within 12 months, and 26 weeks if already received a four week sanction within last 12 months) are imposed for refusal, without good cause, to attend an employment programme or carry out a Jobseeker's Direction. Payment of benefit continues in full pending the Adjudication Officer's decision on a sanction question.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.2/6">Data on the number of times each type of sanction available for jobseeker's allowance has been used in each year since 2000, including those that are available in relation to compulsory employment or training programmes, has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.2/7">This information is also published on the Department for Work and Pensions website:</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.2/8" class="indent"><a href="http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/tabtool.asp">http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/tabtool.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.2/9">Please note, in 2006 the Department refreshed the delivery of the jobseeker's allowance regime within Jobcentre Plus ensuring that all customers were receiving the right support at the right time. This led to a strengthening of the rights and responsibilities agenda which underpins the regime.</p>
	<p pid="c.1046W.2/10">This coincides with the increase in jobseekers who were sanctioned between 2006-07 and 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="c.1049W.2/11">Data prior to 2002-03 are not directly comparable because of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002.</p>
	<p pid="c.1049W.2/12">Gateshead Basic Command Unit had 443 police officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase>.

There is a genuine partnership with police, local authority and other key stakeholders problem solving to tackle complex issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.1049W.2/15">Generally crime performance is positive. The overall rate of violence with injury per 1,000 population is lower than the regional and national averages.</p>
	<p pid="c.1049W.2/16">Gateshead, as part of Northumbria police force, has been part of the Tackling Knives Action Programme in 2009-10. This has provided additional funding for prevention and education activity on knife crime and serious youth violence, as well as additional enforcement operations. The partnership has have also received funding and support from the Home Office and Ministry of Justice to tackle domestic and sexual violence including the development of multi area risk assessment conference (MARAC), a special domestic violence court (SDVC) and associated independent domestic violence advisers (IDVA).</p>
	<p pid="c.1049W.2/17">Safer Gateshead uses ASB tools and powers effectively. It is currently reviewing its delivery to provide a graded approach to ASB with a focus on early intervention.</p>
	<p pid="c.1049W.2/18">Gateshead agreed to become a Neighbourhood Crime and Justice Pioneer Area in 2009. As a pioneer, it has dedicated resource to work with its communities to address local concerns on crime, antisocial behaviour and justice. The partnership uses Community Payback effectively as part of this approach.</p>
	<p pid="c.1049W.2/19">Gateshead is an intensive drug intervention programme (DIP) area and tackles drug-related offending through drug-testing on arrest and restriction on bail provisions thereby allowing more offenders to be targeted and steered into treatment and out of crime. Gateshead's DIP budget for 2009-10 is &#163;637,363. In 2008-09 there were 2,255 positive drug tests with 945 problem drug users (crack and/or opiate users) recorded as being in effective drug treatment.</p>

	<p pid="c.1053W.8/2"><i> </i>A formal assessment into the trends in the sales of illegal drugs by Somali nationals has not been made. Drug offences are not separately identifiable by nationality.</p>
	<p pid="c.1053W.8/3">The illegal supply of drugs is a serious matter. Trafficking in controlled drugs of all classes needs to be tackled robustly in order to reduce the harm drugs cause to communities and organised criminality associated with their supply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1053W.8/4">The Government's strategy is to bear down on all points in the drugs supply chain in order to disrupt criminal gangs, stifle drug supply and reduce the harm caused to communities in the UK. Increasing quantities of drugs are being seized and organised crime groups and dealers disrupted.</p>
	<p pid="c.1053W.8/5">The latest figure published show that in 2008-09, there were a record 241,090 drug seizures by police and UK Border Agency (including HMRC) in England and Wales, up six per cent from the 228,131 seizures the previous year. These figures include 3,988 drug seizures made by Essex police in 2008-09, an increase of 45 per cent. on seizures made in 2007-08 (2,747).</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-03-02c.316672.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-03-02c.1054W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1887" speakername="Alan Campbell" colnum="1054W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100302/text/100302w0013.htm#100302100002066">
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/1">The Home Office has introduced a range of policies and initiatives since 1997. However, it is not always possible to quantify their effects particularly at constituency level. Feltham and Heston comes within the Hounslow Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership. The available statistical information therefore relates to the London borough of Hounslow at either CDRP or Basic Command Unit level.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/2">In terms of police recorded crime in the Hounslow CDRP, between 2002-03 and 2008-09, total recorded crime fell by 28 per cent. More specifically:</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/3" class="indent">Violence against the person - down 22 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/4" class="indent">Sexual offences - down 30 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/5" class="indent">Robbery - down 27 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/6" class="indent">Burglary - down 23 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/7" class="indent">Offences against vehicles - down 45 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/8" class="indent">Other theft offences - down 24 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/9" class="indent">Criminal damage - down 42 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/10" class="indent">Drug offences - up 160 per cent [up 12 per cent. in last year] (there has been increased recording of drug offences which was mainly attributable to the increased use of police powers to issue cannabis warnings).</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/11">Data prior to 2002-03 is not directly comparable because of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002. Additionally, no data at borough level is available prior to 1998-99.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/12">Hounslow BCU had 518 police officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase>. The number of police officers has increased by 51 since 2003. Comparisons with 1997 for Hounslow BCU are not available. There were 98 Police Community Support Officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase> while there were none in existence in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/13">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 saw positive effects with the statutory duty to create a Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP). The CDRP has brought new ways of working in a cross cutting way with the police, council and other key stakeholders and genuine partnership working to help tackle complex issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/14">Along with the CDRP came the development of Safer Neighbourhood initiatives where there is now a dedicated police resource in each of the 20 wards of Hounslow which were not in place in 1997. Of the 20 Safer Neighbourhood Teams (SNTs) there are five in the Heston and Feltham wards, East, Central and West Heston and North and West Feltham. A more recent development is the Neighbourhood Community Safety Co-ordinators (NCSC). Part of the CDRPs pledge is to strengthen the work around community safety. This has included creating a new team of Neighbourhood Community Safety Co-ordinators of which there are five one covers Heston and Cranford and another covers Feltham. These co-ordinators are co-located at police stations throughout the borough. These officers will take a lead role in co-ordinating work around reducing crime, anti-social behaviour, alcohol and drugs by working with partners and residents in a designated area in the borough. (These officers have recently been recruited and Hounslow plan to launch the initiative in March.)</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/15">Before 1997 there were no bespoke powers to tackle anti-social behaviour but there are now a range of powers to deal with this issue. These include Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs), and Designated Public Places Orders (DPPOs) from the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/16">Hounslow is working hard tackling areas where there are poor perceptions of ASB especially where &quot;rubbish and litter is lying around&quot; and &quot;vandalism/graffiti&quot; is concerned. Hounslow have done a lot of work in this area over the past year and are confident of having better results in the 2010 Place Survey.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/17">Another of Hounslow's CDRP pledges is to &quot;introduce CCTV to more parts of the borough&quot;. They are providing a strategic community safety CCTV control room and roll out CCTV cameras in ten key sites across the borough.</p>
	<p pid="c.1054W.2/18">The Neighbourhood Statistics Service provides a wide range of statistical information at Parliamentary constituency level, taken from the 2001 census and other sources. This service is available on the National Statistics website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1061W.5/1">The Home Office has introduced a range of policies and initiatives since 2000. However, it is not always possible to quantify their effects particularly at constituency level. The available statistical information therefore relates to the Sandwell Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership area.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/2">In terms of police recorded crime in Sandwell, between 2002-03 and 2008-09, total recorded crime fell by 41 per cent. More specifically:</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/3" class="indent">Violence against the person-down 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/4" class="indent">Sexual offences-down 32 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/5" class="indent">Robbery-down 23 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/6" class="indent">Burglary-down 52 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/7" class="indent">Offences against vehicles-down 54 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/8" class="indent">Other theft offences-down 31 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/9" class="indent">Criminal damage-down 31 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/10" class="indent">Drug offences-up 37 per cent. (there has been increased recording of drug offences which was mainly attributable to the increased use of police powers to issue cannabis warnings).</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/11">Data prior to 2002-03 are not directly comparable because of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/12">Sandwell comes within the West Midlands K1 and K2 Basic Command Units, which had 717 police officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase>. The number of police officers has increased by 32 since 2003. Comparisons with 1997 for West Midlands K1 and K2 BCUs are not available. There were 78 police community support officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase> while there were none in existence in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/13">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 saw positive effects with the statutory duty to create a Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP). The CDRP has enabled new ways of working in a cross cutting way with the police, council and other key stakeholders to help tackle complex issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/14">The Sandwell CDRP is well established and continues with good results in terms of tackling antisocial behaviour (ASB) and reducing crime and disorder.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/15">Before 1997 there were no bespoke powers to tackle antisocial behaviour but there are now a range of powers to deal with this issue. These include antisocial behaviour orders and designated public places orders (DPPO) from the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 and as a result of their good work, Sandwell has been designated as an ASB Pioneer Area. The CDRP has also been instrumental in setting up an ASB Helpline in the borough; to date this has received 31,598 calls.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/16">In 2008, the UK's first 'no rogue trader' zone was set up Sandwell, this is a borough-wide initiative between the police and trading standards to raise awareness of rogue trader tricks and encourage residents to report all suspicious activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.1061W.5/17">Through the CDRP an award winning domestic violence partnership (Sandwell Organisation Against Domestic Abuse) was set up in 2006 which had received 12,017 referrals in total up to March 2009.</p>

There will therefore be no need for individuals to file their cases for review as the MOD will automatically conduct case reviews and contact all previous claimants to inform them of the increased benefits they will receive. We are committed to implementing the legislative changes arising from the review of the scheme within a year. Individual awards will be re-examined once the new legislation is in place. All new claimants under the scheme will, of course, benefit from the improvements being made in the same way.</p>

	<p pid="c.1082W.9/1">The number of procedures conducted on animals depends on the demand from the MOD research programme. The increase in the number of procedures returned by Dstl involving non-human primates in 2009 is due to the maturity of long term projects within the research programme. One of these projects concerns the development of new medical countermeasures which require the development of a non-human primate model of human infection. The model is required for the regulatory approval of new medical countermeasures to a range of bacterial and viral infections which are relevant in both military and civilian environments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1082W.9/2">The other factor that contributed to the rise in numbers is another project which followed on from earlier studies conducted in a rodent species. These studies determined a necessity for work in a species closer to man to assess the clinical effects of the inhalation of various chemical materials.</p>
	<p pid="c.1082W.9/3">The studies undertaken at Dstl Porton Down with human participants do not involve the use of chemical warfare agents. Studies involving the use of service volunteers since 2005 have included the assessment of candidate prophylactic and therapeutic drugs, and the physiological and psychological impact of wearing various combinations of personal protective clothing, including respirators.</p>

	<p pid="c.1086W.3/1">To become a qualified RAF helicopter pilot individuals undertake initial flying training. Once qualified, pilots are trained to adapt their flying skills to a specific aircraft type which is known as operational conversion unit training. Both types of training are conducted through standardised packages with a set number of flying hours for each pilot. The level of flying required of each pilot for both categories has not changed significantly since 2005.</p>

	<p pid="c.1101W.6/1">Following my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's letter to the UN Secretary General and Security Council members in August 2009, we have made broad appeals to international governments to join the EU and ban the sale of arms to Burma. We have recently focused our diplomatic effort on raising the issue of a universal arms embargo with Burma's neighbours. We have also communicated our views to the Russian Government, as Russia is a notable supplier of arms to Burma. We have not yet raised an arms embargo with the Governments of Brazil, New Zealand or Canada. These and many other countries will be covered in a structured global campaign that will be launched shortly by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>

	<p pid="c.1101W.9/1">In both the Human Rights Council and UN General Assembly we have consistently raised our serious concern at reports of human rights abuses in Burma. Our approach reflects the representations we have had from a number of concerned parties who report on situations they believe amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes. Our judgment is that we would not be able to secure support within the UN Security Council for the actions that would be necessary to follow up with formal charges on those grounds. However, resolutions secured with strong UK support in the UN's human rights bodies make specific reference to human rights violations by the military regime.</p>

Since his appointment he has had no discussions with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) or any other Department on fisheries with which MRAG is involved. Neither has Professor Beddington offered any advice on the proposed Marine Protected Area in BIOT.

	<p pid="c.1108W.9/1">Government spending on promotion of the UK's broad science base is widely distributed among the science-using Departments and a number of agencies and non-departmental public bodies, such as the research councils.</p>
	<p pid="c.1108W.9/2">Within BIS alone (and formerly as DIUS and DTI), the Science and Society team spends a focused budget, drawn from the science budget allocation, on a number of key national activities. Budgets for this work have increased from around &#163;1.25 million in 1997/98 to &#163;17.4 million for the final year (2010/11) of the latest comprehensive spending review, reflecting both the sustained increases to the science budget and the increasing importance on public engagement and the relationship between science and society in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.1108W.9/3">While BIS leads many Government activities, and is accountable to my right hon. and noble Friend the Minister of State for Science and Innovation, other Departments across Government directly promote either the science they fund, or the value of science in delivering their own objectives. For example, in January 2008 DCSF announced a &#163;140 million strategy to educate the next generation of scientists and mathematicians, and provide more STEM teachers.

The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data.

	<p pid="c.1113W.9/1">The Department's estimated expenditure on television advertising for the 2009-10 financial year is &#163;26,150,885. This is a provisional figure until records are fully audited at the end of the financial year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1113W.9/2">The figures do not include recruitment or classified advertising costs. Advertising spend is defined as covering only media spend (inclusive of agency commissions but excluding production costs, Central Office of Information commission and VAT). All figures exclude advertising rebates and audit adjustments and therefore may differ from Central Office of Information official turnover figures.</p>
	<p pid="c.1113W.9/3">The Department evaluates its campaigns using a combination of robust techniques that help to identify exactly what works. In 2009, Smokefree marketing has driven over 715,000 four-week quits. Modelling has also demonstrated a one-year return on marketing investment (ROMI) of an additional &#163;1.20 for every pound of public money spent and a three-year return of &#163;3.84 for every pound spent. The Change4Life campaign has received nearly two million responses and over 400,000 families have signed up. It has been estimated that an additional 10,000 people have been given early access to care as a result of the Department's stroke (Act FAST) campaign in 2009-10, reducing the threat of death and disability.</p>

	<p pid="c.1115W.2/1">Following the decision of the local national health service trust not to utilise the property and the landlord's decision not to accept a surrender of the lease, agreement is being finalised with the landlord on the extent of repair works to be undertaken in compliance with a previously served repairs notice. Once agreement is reached, the works will be undertaken.</p>

We have made clear that we are committed to considering further the adequacy of local authority powers following the consultation on 'Strengthening Local Democracy' (July 2009) and the responses to it. The Government are interested in extending powers-subject to certain prudential restrictions-to deal both with the issues raised in the LAML case around councils giving guarantees and indemnities to each other and also to ensure greater clarity in relation to action to drive efficiency and cost savings and so secure best value. These will be taken forward at the first legislative opportunity. Such developments are intended to ensure that councils will have a broad range of powers on which to take action in their communities' interests, building on the best value duty. The well-being power remains as a power of first resort for councils acting in relation to the social, economic and environmental well-being of their areas. The White Paper 'Putting the Frontline First: Smarter Government' (December 2009) and the pre-Budget report have committed to further exploring, subject to the overall fiscal position, what further finance mechanisms, powers and flexibilities could support local authorities to drive growth and innovation most effectively.</p>

	<p pid="c.1169W.0/1">Partnerships for Schools (PfS), as the delivery agent for Building Schools for the Future (BSF), is responsible for discussions with local authorities about prioritising and phasing of schools in the programme. Birmingham is in Waves 2 and 5 of the BSF programme and discussions with the city council have reached the following stages:</p>
	<p pid="c.1169W.0/2" class="indent">The Wave 2 Strategic Business Case and Outline Business Case (OBC) identify the prioritisation and phasing of schools in the first phase that are now either in construction or being developed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1169W.0/3" class="indent">The Wave 5 Strategy for Change and OBC, which will establish the prioritisation and phasing of the second phase, is currently being completed by the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.1169W.0/4" class="indent">PfS is currently evaluating the authority's Readiness to Deliver (RtD) proposal for Phase 3.</p>
	<p pid="c.1169W.0/5" class="indent">The local authority's Academy programme is in development.</p>
	<p pid="c.1169W.0/6">10 schools are being redeveloped and 20 are planned to be redeveloped as part of the BSF programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1169W.0/7">When an OBC for a wave of a local authority's BSF project is agreed, the funding is fixed for the first group of prioritised schools in the wave. However, as each subsequent group of schools in the wave is brought forward the funding is adjusted for changes in construction inflation and location factors. As such, all funding after the first group of schools in the wave is indicative until the respective stage submission is approved. The current funding forecasts for Birmingham's BSF projects are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="c.1170W.0/1">Data on the number of notifications of deaths of children following a serious incident is a matter for Ofsted. Ofsted has disclosed the information requested in reply to a request under Freedom of Information Act from the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="c.1170W.0/2">Serious incidents are notified to Ofsted straight away where a child has died and where abuse or neglect are known or suspected to be a factor in the death. But further investigation may indicate that the death was due to other causes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1170W.0/3">Government Offices have been working closely with Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs) to help ensure that procedures relating to child deaths are fully observed. A higher number of notifications could be due in part to an increased awareness of the procedures that need to be followed, including the notification to Ofsted of serious incidents.</p>
	<p pid="c.1170W.0/4">Every single death of a child is an absolute tragedy, whether as a result of abuse or neglect or not. We must continue to do everything we can to protect children from those who seek to harm them. This is why we commissioned Lord Laming to carry out a report of safeguarding progress nationally. Lord Laming's report confirmed that robust legislative, structural and policy foundations are in place. We accepted and are implementing all 58 of his recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1170W.0/5">It is also the case that we are the first country in the world to implement a statutory multi-agency child death reviewing system to collect, analyse and act upon information about every child's death.</p>

We do not have figures available yet for allocations below national level. We will develop detailed funding methodologies for local authority allocations after discussion with the Local Government Association and local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="c.1176W.2/83">The revenue per pupil figures shown in Table 3 are taken from the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG). They are not comparable with those for the years 2004-05 to 2005-06 (in Tables 1 and 2 above) because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>
	<p pid="c.1176W.2/84">The 2004-05 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="c.1176W.2/85">To provide a comparison for 2008-09 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06 (the baseline); as described above this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1176W.2/86">Per pupil revenue funding figures for pupils (ages 3-15)for each London borough between 2005-06 and 2008-09 are shown in Table 3. As the DSG is a mechanism for distributing funding, a split between primary and secondary schools is not available. These figures are in real terms and are based on financial years.</p>

	<p pid="c.1185W.0/2">The best schools, working in partnership with local authority services, provide excellent support for their pupils to help them to make decisions about learning and careers but the quality across all schools is variable. We published our strategy to improve information, advice and guidance (Quality, Choice and Aspiration) in October 2009. Alongside the strategy we published statutory guidance for schools, setting out clear expectations for the provision of high quality impartial information about learning options, which promotes the best interests of pupils.</p>
	<p pid="c.1185W.0/3">The way that provision of careers services has been funded has changed in the period since 1997, with the establishment of the Connexions service and, more recently, local authorities assuming responsibility for the provision of information, advice and guidance. Funding has been provided to Connexions/Careers Services as set out in the following table:</p>
