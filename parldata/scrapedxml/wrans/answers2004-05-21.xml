	<p pid=".1219W.6/2">I can confirm that the Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) Manager met with representatives of the Nappy Alliance on 23rd March. The meeting was a useful opportunity to discuss the work WIP is already taking forward through the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to promote re-usable nappies. This work stream forms an essential part of Government's renewed drive to minimise the amount of household waste generated in England.</p>
	<p pid=".1219W.6/3">One of the issues raised in the course of the meeting was the need to ensure that this element of Defra's waste strategy has full support across Government. In particular, this means working closely with the Department of Health to ensure that hospitals are in a position to encourage the supply of re-usable nappies, and that healthcare professionals give new parents the facts they need to make their own informed choice. Following the meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-23">23 March</phrase> and the subsequent publication of the Women's Environmental Network's report 'Nappies and the NHS: Waste Prevention and a Fair Choice for Parents', I have written to the Under-Secretary at the Department of Health to make the case for a strong lead from hospitals and health trusts on this important initiative.</p>

	<p pid=".1222W.3/1">We regularly monitor our existing Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) and Countryside Stewardship (CS) schemes to assess their environmental benefits. This has demonstrated substantial benefits for many Biodiversity Action Plan priority habitats and species, including mammals, birds, plants and insects.</p>
	<p pid=".1222W.3/2">Recent Defra-sponsored research has shown that simple measures such as planting a seed mix of flowers in field margins to provide pollen and nectar can attract huge numbers of insects (bumble bees, butterflies, and others) relative to the in-field crop. Full details are available at <a href="http://www.f-e-c.co.uk/Buzz/index.htm">http://www.f-e-c.co.uk/Buzz/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1222W.3/3">Defra has also sponsored specific research on butterflies. This has shown that ESAs and CS schemes are slowing, and in some cases reversing, the long-term decline in numbers of England's rarer butterflies. Further details are available at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2002/020806a.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2002/020806a.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1222W.3/4">Recent Defra-funded reports on 'Managing priority habitats for invertebrates' will help inform targeting and formulating of future agri-environment agreements. 'Environmental Stewardship' (ES) will rationalise and replace ESAs and CS in 2005. ES will be divided into two levels: an Entry Level (ELS) and a Higher Level (HLS). ELS should include measures beneficial for biodiversity, including insects, in the wider countryside. The HLS Scheme will continue the work of ESAs and CS by targeting management on the most valuable and vulnerable farmland habitats. The options available under these new schemes will also have the advantage of having greater generic benefits for insects. Further details of these schemes can be found at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/reviews/agrienv/entrylevel.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/reviews/agrienv/entrylevel.htm</a> and <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/reviews/agrienv/higherlevel.htm">http://www.defra. gov.uk/erdp/reviews/agrienv/higherlevel.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".1224W.6/2">The UK Government's current sustainable development strategy &quot;A better quality of life&quot;, launched in May 1999, describes sustainable development as 'ensuring a better quality of life for everyone, now and for generations to come'. It also refers to a widely used international definition, from the Brundtland Report of the 1987 World Commission on Environment and Development, of</p>
	<p pid=".1224W.6/3" class="indent">'development which meets the need of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'.</p>
	<p pid=".1224W.6/4">Government publications usually refer to the 'better quality of life' description as given in our 1999 Strategy. Examples would include the departmental sustainable development strategies for the Department of Health, the Department for Trade and Industry and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and HM Treasury's 2002 Spending Review Report.</p>

Such cases involve significant and complex evidence and require due consideration of public funding applications.

	<p pid=".1228W.6/1">The 'Volume Incentive' was first introduced by the Rail Regulator in his Access Charges Review 2000. The SRA set out its views on the continuing effectiveness of a Volume Incentive for Network Rail as part of its response to the Initial Consultation Paper of the Access Charge Review 2003. The SRA's view was that for a number of reasons, the Volume Incentive would no longer be cost effective or appropriate given the changes to the industry since it was first introduced. The Rail Regulator considered this view and the supporting reasons, along with the views of other consultees, in the course of the Access Charge Review 2003. His view was that the Volume Incentive would continue to be an effective way of encouraging Network Rail to make efficient use of a constrained network so that additional traffic could be accommodated. He therefore retained the Volume Incentive, with a number of modifications (including only rewarding Network Rail for growth above a certain threshold level) in the Final Conclusions to the Access Charge Review published in December 2003. This decision is entirely for the Rail Regulator, taking into account his statutory duties as set out in the Railways Act .1993.</p>

	<p pid=".1233W.2/18">1. The financial data are taken from Rochdale LEA's Section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&ndash;2000 onwards and the ODPM's RO1 statement previously. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&ndash;2000. 1999&ndash;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.</p>
	<p pid=".1233W.2/19">2. The outturn 2002&ndash;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&ndash;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. 2002&ndash;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Figures are rounded to the nearest &pound;10.</p>
	<p pid=".1233W.2/20">3. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.</p>

	<p pid=".1240W.2/13">2. The outturn 2002&ndash;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&ndash;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers.</p>
	<p pid=".1240W.2/14">3. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.</p>
	<p pid=".1240W.2/15">4. The NCE per pupil figures for primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained primary schools sector.</p>

Employment-based teacher training schemes, the largest of which is the Graduate Teacher Programme, offer an alternative route to Qualified Teacher Status which allows candidates to be employed in schools as unqualified teachers and paid accordingly while they train.

Plans for strengthening the IMOH National Drug Regulatory Authority have been agreed and guidelines for good storage practices are being prepared.

Over this period, DFID has committed a total of &pound;10.6 million for these purposes and has so far disbursed &pound;3.6 million for humanitarian programmes, &pound;0.4 million in support of the UN security coordination agency and interim care centres for children, and &pound;2.7 million for rehabilitation of basic services.

	<p pid=".1247W.5/2">In addition, DFID has pledged a total of &pound;6 million to support Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration programmes over 2003&ndash;05, of which we have so far disbursed &pound;1 million. These funds are intended to assist the re-integration into their communities of ex-combatants and others affected by war.</p>

DFID's policy on recruitment is to stimulate and encourage applications from all sections of the community specifically including   candidates with disabilities.

	<p pid=".1252W.9/1">These questions have been answered with respect to the Defence Information Infrastructure (DII) programme. The Ministry of Defence is in negotiations with two potential commercial Delivery Partners (DP) for the provision of Information Systems services. The DII programme is currently in the Assessment Phase of the Smart Procurement cycle.</p>
	<p pid=".1252W.9/2">In terms of cost, the MOD currently spends over   &pound;450 million per annum on its information infrastructure. It is anticipated that the DII Public/Private Partnership contract will cost in the region of &pound;4 billion over 10 years.</p>
	<p pid=".1252W.9/3">Track record is one of a number of factors included in the evaluation of bids. The Department's Supplier Relations Group has conducted research of bidding consortium members' performance both in Defence and across Government. In addition, the project has taken up references, by telephone and through visits, from existing customers of the key companies in the bidding consortia. Further reference visits will be conducted during the final phase of the procurement, targeting customers in receipt of a similar volume and range of services.</p>
	<p pid=".1252W.9/4">10 major legacy contracts for IT infrastructure have been identified and these will be subsumed within, or superseded by, the DII contract. The majority of these contracts are due to expire naturally over the next 18 months. An options appraisal has been conducted for each contract and an appropriate scenario agreed for each during subsequent mitigation planning. Where the risks, liabilities or known termination charges are unacceptably high, the preferred option is to allow a contract to run to expiry and then assimilate the activity within DII. Any contracts that currently lie beyond the next three years, which in the main are PFI contracts, will be subsumed on expiry. Residual liabilities will be assessed more fully following negotiations with bidders in the later stages of procurement but generally we would expect to be in no worse a position than now and   would seek to be in a better position through negotiation.</p>
	<p pid=".1252W.9/5">Support to deployed operations will continue to be supplied by Service personnel. For all other elements of IT infrastructure provision and support the MOD will mitigate the risk of supplier failure by contracting with a consortium which will provide the services through a range of service providers. This will ensure that in the event that one member of the consortium fails, there is capacity available for another consortium member to pick up the service provision. In addition, the MOD will retain rights to step in and use its own staff or other third party contractors to remedy major service failures. Ultimately, the MOD will have rights to terminate the contract for material breaches in performance, with options to take services back in-house or contract with another commercial provider for their delivery.</p>

	<p pid=".1264W.3/1">The national health service has never been required to provide statistics on the number of overseas visitors treated under the provisions of the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989. It is therefore not possible to give a definitive assessment of the scale of this matter. Nevertheless, NHS staff operating the charging regime have told us that there are significant issues in some areas, which we are taking action to deal with. We are taking forward a study of 12 NHS trusts across England, the results of which will, over time, help to give us a better understanding of the level of inappropriate use of the NHS by overseas visitors.</p>

	<p pid=".1279W.9/1">The Government are keen to ensure a co-ordinated response from the fire and rescue service in the event of a major emergency. That is why all fire and rescue authorities have been invited to sign a Mutual Aid Agreement, which will enable individual fire and rescue authorities to ask for assistance from another authority in the event of a serious emergency.</p>
	<p pid=".1279W.9/2">The development of the Mutual Aid Agreement forms part of the Government's commitment to improving resilience and the fire and rescue service's response to a major incident. The Fire and Rescue Services Bill, currently progressing through Parliament, should make such an agreement easier to establish in future as it will extend authorities' ability to enter into mutual reinforcement schemes to include new duties such as responding to the increased terrorist threat.</p>
	<p pid=".1279W.9/3">The Government have also established the New Dimension programme, which will help to ensure a co-ordinated response to any terrorist incidents on a national scale by providing suitable equipment and training to deal with such incidents. A national co-ordination centre is being established in order to provide central command and control when the New Dimension equipment is utilised. This will remain in place until such time as the regional control rooms are operational, when they will direct resources on a regional basis.</p>
