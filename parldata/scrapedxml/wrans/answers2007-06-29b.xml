	<p pid="b.878W.9/1">The full list of countries that will receive official invitations to Defence Systems and Equipment International is still being finalised. The Defence Export Services Organisation (DESO) intends to publish a list of those countries from which delegations are invited a day or so in advance of the exhibition opening, the timing being consistent with the security of guests. It is planned to place this list on the DESO internet site:</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.9/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.deso.mod.uk">www.deso.mod.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.878W.9/3">The exhibition is organised by Reed Exhibitions Ltd. We understand it will be open to registered visitors including from overseas, and accredited media representatives between 11-<phrase class="date" code="2007-09-14">14 September 2007</phrase>. It will not be open to the general public. An estimate of the number of visitors likely to attend is a matter for the organisers.</p>
	<p pid="b.878W.9/4">The costs of hosting official overseas delegations at DSEiO7 will largely be met by the organisers. The balance of these costs met from Defence funds is expected to be in the region of &pound;120,000. Other MOD costs will be met from a number of budgets and an estimate of these cannot be centrally made. No estimate has been made of costs for which MOD is not responsible.</p>

	<p pid="b.881W.4/2">No such research has been conducted and my Department has not carried out any assessments of the systems employed in other member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.881W.4/3">The Green Dot system is used in several member states to transpose the requirements of the EU directive on packaging and packaging waste. The Green Dot is a licensed trademark which denotes compliance with an authorised packaging recovery scheme in other European Union member states. Its use indicates that a financial contribution has been paid to a national packaging recovery company, set up in accordance with the principles defined in the EU directive and the national law which transposes it.</p>
	<p pid="b.881W.4/4">The Green Dot is not a recycling symbol, although is often misinterpreted as such, so should not be used to denote general recyclability or recycled content.</p>
	<p pid="b.881W.4/5">The Green Dot system is not used in the UK; producer responsibility obligations are fulfilled via a different method. The management of packaging and packaging waste is covered by two sets of regulations in the UK, the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007 and the Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended). The packaging waste regulations require producers to buy packaging waste recovery notes (PRNs), or the export equivalent (PERNs), to demonstrate that they have financed a certain amount of recycling. Introducing a Green Dot system, therefore, would simply mean changing the system we have used in the UK to implement the provision of the packaging directive, rather than extending producer responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.881W.4/6">The approach that has been taken by the UK is unique and was formulated and agreed with industry following the adoption of the EU directive on packaging and packaging waste.</p>

The average time spent by a presenting officer on an individual immigration appeal was one hour and thirty-six minutes. These figures exclude time spent travelling, waiting for and presenting appeal hearings. They represent the average preparation time spent by a presenting officer for each case type.</p>
	<p pid="b.886W.0/2">It should be noted, however, that this is only an average time. Cases vary tremendously in their complexity, therefore Presenting Officers will spend whatever time is required to prepare a case to the necessary standard.</p>

This showed the scheme, although better funded than most UK pension schemes, to have a shortfall of assets against liabilities. Additional contributions are being paid by CDC to remove that shortfall. In addition, CDC has put aside significant additional assets in a contingent funding arrangement which safeguards the future payment of the shortfall contributions and provides materially improved security for the accrued benefits of scheme members.</p>
