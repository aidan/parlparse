	<p pid="c.2248W.2/1">Section 1 of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act (DVCVA) 2004&mdash;to make breach of a non-molestation order a criminal offence&mdash;is costed at &pound;2.8 million per full year. Section 4 is costed at &pound;2.9 million per full year. However, if brought in together this limits costs to &pound;5 million per full year. These are annual continuing costs not just start-up costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.2248W.2/2">Section 10 of the DVCVA 2004 (common assault to be an arrestable offence) was also costed at &pound;5 million per full year. This has been commenced via the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act (SOCPA) 2005. Thus the full cost to DCA of implementing the DVCVA is &pound;10 million per full year. We regularly review budgets to identify funding at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="c.2256W.2/2">The Environment Agency (EA) is the principal operating authority for flood risk management in England and has a general supervisory duty over all matters relating to flood defence. The EA's River Derwent preliminary strategic review (PSR), which recommended the consideration of future works in South Derbyshire, including Alvaston, Derby and Little Chester, was completed in August 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.2256W.2/3">A viability report identified a number of gaps in data and the need for improvements to the existing hydraulic model through Derby. The report reviewed the economic case in the PSR and suggested that a significant number of properties were at risk overall during a one in 100 year flood risk event. The report was completed in October 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.2256W.2/4">Due to the scale of flooding problems, a strategic analysis is appropriate for the business case. This strategy, which is due to be completed in autumn 2007, will examine the alternative options for sustainable flood risk management in Derby during the next 100 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.2256W.2/5">The strategy has now been extended to consider the Derwent from Derby to the River Trent, including Ambaston. Data on this area are currently being collected and work undertaken to develop the hydraulic model to extend it down to the confluence. The strategy is at the pre-scoping data gathering stage. It is anticipated that the scoping report will be issued in November 2006. The strategy will provide a plan for the first five years of capital investment, including an assessment of the appropriate maintenance strategy for the existing defences. A strategic environmental assessment will also be produced. The scoping report will be reissued to cover the increased project scope and area. An extensive process of consultation is planned.</p>

	<p pid="c.2257W.2/1">Around 210 cases prosecuted by DEFRA and local authorities since 2003 have resulted in conviction for breach of the Cattle Identification Regulation. A further breakdown is not available because the figures are not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/2">These cases involved keepers prosecuted because of failure to undertake the necessary action to identify cattle and report their movements. These are fundamental requirements if we are to control disease and to prevent cattle which may have BSE from entering the human food chain.</p>
	<p pid="c.2257W.2/3">We have advised that, although these keepers failed to comply with their European Community law obligations, the enforcement provisions in the Cattle Identification and Cattle Database Regulation are invalid because they are drafted in such a way that criminal liability depends on a failure to comply with the requirements set out in European legislation (Council Regulation 1760/2000) which was not in force at the time the offences were committed. This situation arose because the original Council Regulation 820/97 was replaced by Council Regulation 1760/2000 in July 2000.</p>

	<p pid="c.2258W.5/2">Landfill tax is one of a number of measures designed to improve the efficient use of resources, encourage effective management of waste and meet our commitment to reduce the volume of household waste sent to landfill. Other measures include landfill allowance trading scheme, regulation and recycling targets for local authorities. As part of the annual Budget process, the Government assesses the impact of landfill tax alongside these initiatives against a range of social, economic and environmental factors, including assessing the volume of waste sent to landfill and the impact on business competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="c.2258W.5/3">There are clear signs that the landfill tax and the other initiatives are working together to reduce our reliance on landfill. The amount of active waste going to landfill fell by almost 16 per cent. between 1997 and 2005 while the economy grew by nearly 25 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.2259W.6/2">Additional resources were allocated at the start of the year to maintain staffing levels at the agency and ensure that farmers receive their single payment scheme payments as soon as possible. This accounts for only one of a number of pressures DEFRA has faced this year, including avian influenza incidents, the sum of which is estimated to be in the region of &pound;200 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.2259W.6/3">As a consequence of these pressures, all areas of the Department's spend have been subject to rigorous scrutiny as part of a current budget review. The review, while comprehensive in nature, is seeking to ensure that DEFRA's funding is placed where it can have the greatest impact. Ministers have agreed revised budgets for 2006-07 and business areas, including non-departmental bodies, will be informed of these decisions in the coming weeks.</p>

	<p pid="c.2261W.14/1">The Commission Regulation setting out the European Aviation Safety Agency's charges was amended in late May 2006 as part of a package of emergency measures to meet a predicted shortfall in the Agency's 2006 budget. Other measures included a substantial increase in funding from the European Community budget and savings in Agency expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="c.2261W.14/2">Increases in tariffs were limited to the very largest manufacturers in the Community. At the same time some fees for small enterprises were reduced and procedural changes made which eased the administrative burdens on all industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.2261W.14/3">Given the varying effects of these changes and their emergency and temporary nature no estimate has been made of the overall effect on costs to the UK industry. A few of the largest manufacturers will be subject to the increased tariffs, but the overall package of measures has ensured that the Agency is now able to meet the current certification needs of UK industry as a whole without costly delay.</p>
	<p pid="c.2261W.14/4">The Agency has taken steps to put future budgeting on a firmer footing, including the identification of long term amendments to its fee structure to be put in place next year. The UK Civil Aviation Authority has seconded an expert to support the Agency's work in this area.</p>

	<p pid="c.2267W.3/1">The Traffic Officer Service was first established in the West Midlands (WM) region in April 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.2267W.3/2">Two targets were set for the WM region in the 2005-06 Highways Agency business plan:</p>
	<p pid="c.2267W.3/3">1. For the busiest sections of motorway in the West Midlands, HA Traffic Officers will attend 75 per cent. of incidents within 15 minutes of being deployed.</p>
	<p pid="c.2267W.3/4">The WM service achieved 92 per cent. in 15 minutes.</p>
	<p pid="c.2267W.3/5">2. In the West Midlands, HA Traffic Officers will clear 75 per cent. of incidents within 30 minutes of taking full responsibility for re-opening the road to traffic.</p>
	<p pid="c.2267W.3/6">The WM service achieved 84 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.2267W.3/7">This experience has enabled the Highways Agency to identify a set of key performance indicators for the service. These indicators will be used to measure the activities that will contribute to delivery of the public sector agreement (PSA) target for journey reliability 2007-08 and to the delivery of the financial benefits of the service. The financial benefits derived from the introduction of the Traffic Officer Service are not due to be assessed until 2008 when the service will have been fully operational across all regions for 12 months. The Highways Agency has analysed data over a 12 month period for the West Midlands and observed a 2 per cent. reduction in incident related congestion.</p>
	<p pid="c.2267W.3/8">I would expect the full assessment, which will cover the impacts of introducing the Traffic Officer Service on reducing incident related congestion; improving safety; and freeing up police resources for tackling criminality on the strategic road network to be published at the end of 2008 when the data have been gathered and analysed.</p>

	<p pid="c.2278W.2/1">The 2010 health inequalities target is based on the performance of the spearhead areas as a whole. The extent to which each individual spearhead area is on track to narrow their local life expectancy gap with England by 10 per cent. by 2010 is shown in the following list. While the national trend is for a continuing widening in the life expectancy gap between spearhead areas and England, the table shows that some 19 per cent. of spearhead areas are on track for males and females with a further 41 per cent. on track for either males or females.</p>
	<p pid="c.2278W.2/2">Current activity to support achievement of the target includes improving our understanding of the key interventions to improve life expectancy in spearhead areas. Fast gains in life expectancy can be made by reducing the prevalence of smoking, effective control of blood pressure and cholesterol, and good care of people with long-term conditions such as diabetes. Improving performance management is also important and we have made health inequalities one of the Department's top six priorities for the national health service, and it will be a mandatory target within local area agreements.</p>
	<p pid="c.2278W.2/3">We are also looking to spread best practice across all spearhead areas, and provide support for those areas that need it.</p>

	<p pid="c.2288W.2/2">The available figures are given in the tables. The figures include enrolments and staff at those English higher education institutions which offer medicine and dentistry courses. The Department does not calculate student staff ratios for individual higher education institutions or subjects. The available data do not allow us to identify, and exclude from the calculation, the amount of time staff spend teaching further education (as opposed to higher education) courses, and the number of students who are taught at other institutions under franchising arrangements. These factors have to be excluded from the calculation in order to produce an SSR purely for higher education provision in higher education institutions. We are therefore unable to produce individual HEI SSRs which are accurate and comparable across all institutions. An SSR for all HE institutions in England as a whole, which excludes time spent on FE teaching and students taught via franchising, is published annually by the Department. In 2004-05, the staff student ratio for English institutions as a whole (excluding the Open University) was 18.2.</p>

	<p pid="c.2296W.5/1">I refer my hon. Friend to the answer given to his previous question on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-16">16 June 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1532W. This explained that the Department had written to strategic health authority chief executives and performance managers on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-16">16 February 2006</phrase>, reminding them of the obligations upon primary care trusts when deciding the future of community hospitals, as outlined in the White Paper &quot;Our health, Our Care, Our Say: a new direction for community services&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.2296W.5/2">The <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-16">16 February</phrase> letter relates only to consultations about the future of community hospitals, not to mental health trusts. Where applicable, these have carried out separate consultations, and the Gloucestershire Partnership NHS Trust began a five week consultation on the future of mental health services in its area in June.</p>
	<p pid="c.2296W.5/3">The White Paper outlines our intention to provide more care in local, convenient settings such as new community hospitals. In many ways, this move is in line with what has been happening in mental health services since the national service framework was published in 1999. The White Paper mentions our plans for mental health services, which are featured prominently throughout. For example, we made a manifesto commitment to improve access to evidence-based psychological therapies, and reinforced this in the White Paper, which includes the following commitments:</p>
	<p pid="c.2296W.5/4" class="indent">&quot;Enabling health, independence and well-being better support for mental health and emotional well-being: promoting good practice; demonstration sites for people of working age, as part of our action to help people with health conditions and disabilities to remain in, or return to, work; access to computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (Page 24, chapter two, Health, independence and well-being).&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.2296W.5/5">Copies of the White Paper are available in the Library and it is available on the Department's website at dh.gov.uk/asstRoot/04/12/74/59/04127459.pdf.</p>

	<p pid="c.2296W.8/1">The national health service will continue to need new midwives to replace those who retire or take career breaks. However, there is now a much closer match between the demand and supply of healthcare workers and there is more competition for posts. It is a joint responsibility between higher education institutions and local NHS organisations to see that midwifery and other healthcare graduates are supported to find employment. Vacancies for graduates continue to be posted on &quot;NHS Jobs&quot; and the &quot;NHS Careers&quot; information service can direct graduates to appropriate sources of information and advice. Graduates are encouraged to be flexible when applying for posts.</p>

The Department recommends all adults and children over five years consume lower fat varieties of milk to reduce the intake of saturated fats in the diet. The welfare food scheme, to become the healthy start scheme later in 2006, provides pregnant women and women with young children on qualifying benefits with vouchers for whole, semi-skimmed or skimmed milk.</p>

	<p pid="c.2301W.0/3">It is the responsibility of strategic health authorities (SHAs) to deliver overall financial balance by developing and implementing a service and financial strategy for managing the financial position within their locality. All NHS organisations that overspend are required to develop recovery plans to return to financial balance. Recovery plans are agreed and managed by SHAs, not the Department. There is a degree of flexibility, however, in how this is managed at a local level. SHAs can agree a recovery plan which phases the recovery of deficits over a number of years. NHS trusts have a three-year period to recover their deficit. This period can be extended to five years in exceptional circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.2301W.0/4">SHAs are accountable to the Department for the financial performance of the organisations within their own health economy. The Department will work with the SHAs, through enhanced performance management procedures, to ensure that overall net financial balance is returned to the NHS, and improvements are made to the financial position of all individual organisations in deficit.</p>

	<p pid="c.2302W.5/1">The contract has been signed at the end of a three year process to determine whether partnering with the private sector was the best option. After carrying out a feasibility study in 2003 a notice was published in the<i> Official Journal </i>of the European Union in August 2004. An invitation to submit outline proposals was sent to six pre-qualified organisations in November 2004. After a rigorous evaluation process of the responses, in July 2005 the Department sent three selected bidders an invitation to negotiate. After a further rigorous evaluation two bidders were taken forward and a preferred bidder was selected in February 2006. Final negotiations and a final decision to outsource was taken in September 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.2303W.12/1">As set out in &quot;A Stronger Local Voice&quot;, we plan to establish new local involvement networks (LINks) to provide flexible ways for communities to engage with health and social care organisations in ways that best suit the communities and the people in them.</p>
	<p pid="c.2303W.12/2">There will be one LINk for each local authority area with social services responsibilities and, as such, they will be able to develop a close relationship with the overview and scrutiny committee (OSC) with which they will be coterminous, informing the OSC on the public needs and experiences, enabling the OSCs to pursue critical issues based of the evidence of users' experience. LINks will also have the power to refer matters to OSCs and receive an appropriate response.</p>
	<p pid="c.2303W.12/3">These plans will be introduced when parliamentary time allows.</p>

	<p pid="c.2305W.11/1">Sexual health and improving access to genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics is one of the top six priorities for the national health service in 2006-07. The White Paper &quot;Choosing Health: Making healthy choices easier&quot; published in November 2004, a copy of which is available in the Library, made a number of commitments to improve sexual health including a target that everyone should be offered an appointment within 48 hours of contacting a GUM clinic by 2008. Strategic health authorities have submitted plans to meet this target.</p>
	<p pid="c.2305W.11/2">Overall, the number of attendees at GUM clinics seen within 48 hours in England increased from 45 per cent. in May 2005 to 54 per cent. in May 2006 and a further 4 per cent. were offered an appointment but chose not to attend.</p>
	<p pid="c.2305W.11/3">The &quot;Choosing Health&quot; White Paper also announced an accelerated timetable to achieve national roll out of the National Chlamydia screening programme. We have rolled out the screening programme successfully to over 25 per cent. of primary care trusts (PCTs) and many other PCTs will begin screening during 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.2305W.11/4">We have also taken forward the commitment that as well as the national programme we will take steps to introduce and evaluate the effectiveness of Chlamydia screening in retail pharmacies starting in London. We have contracted Boots the Chemists to evaluate the potential of retail pharmacies as Chlamydia screening venues. Screening started on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-14">14 November 2005</phrase>. This two year pilot will be independently evaluated by TNS Healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="c.2305W.11/5">We have also undertaken the audit of contraceptive provision. PCTs were recently asked to complete a national baseline questionnaire of contraceptive services. The results will inform the publication of best practice guidance by the Department of Health and will help PCTs determine how best to meet gaps in local services. We have also recently reduced the value added tax rate on condoms and other contraceptives, making the costs of these items more affordable and are working with the industry to increase the supply of free condoms to high risk groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.2305W.11/6">Later this year we will be launching a new sexual health campaign. The campaign will target 16 to 34-year-old young adults, highlighting the risks of unprotected sex and the benefits of condom use to avoid sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy.</p>
	<p pid="c.2305W.11/7">This increased priority for sexual health and the implementation of &quot;Our health, Our Care, Our Say: a new direction for community services&quot;, a copy of which is available in the Library, should significantly strengthen the incentive for local investment and service modernisation.</p>

There were however two pieces of British equipment found. One was a commercially available remote video camera for which no export licence was required. The other was a thermal imaging system that was exported under licence in 1999. Proper procedures were followed at the time, including making a careful risk assessment. This concluded there was no reason to suspect that the equipment would be used for anything other than its described purpose.</p>

	<p pid="c.2310W.0/1">The EU has a common approach on this issue. The European Council announced a review of the EU arms embargo in December 2003, which is ongoing. As set out in the December 2004 European Council Conclusions, the result of any decision on the embargo should not be an increase in arms exports from EU member states to China, either in quantitative or qualitative terms. EU leaders also recalled the importance of the criteria of the Code of Conduct on arms exports, in particular criteria regarding human rights, stability and security in the region and the national security of friendly and allied countries. The Government continue fully to implement the arms embargo.</p>

If the minor has been taken to a country that is a signatory to the Hague Convention, the normal procedures will be taken under the Hague Convention through the relevant central authority. When a non-Hague Convention country is involved, the matter has to be resolved through the courts in the respective countries. We encourage those countries not already signed up to the Hague Convention to consider becoming signatories. We are in regular dialogue with a number of non-Hague Convention countries on international child abduction, including Pakistan with which we have a bilateral judicial protocol in place which serves to return children to their country of habitual residence for matters of custody to be resolved there.</p>

Should any information come to light that military equipment supplied by the UK has been used in a manner inconsistent with the Consolidated Criteria, the Government will take this into consideration when assessing any future export licence applications.

	<p pid="c.2323W.2/2">The Financial Reporting Council are leading a public debate on competition and choice in the provision of audit services following the publication in April of a report analysing this market. This report was jointly sponsored by the Council and the Department and the Government are following the current debate closely. That debate will inform future discussions about what actions or changes might be desirable in order to promote competition and choice in the market. The Financial Reporting Council have just published a summary of the debate so far.</p>
	<p pid="c.2323W.2/3">It is possible under UK law to appoint joint auditors, and it is for companies to make that decision should they want to do so in the light of their needs and circumstances. I understand that the joint auditing approach has also been raised, in the responses received by the Financial Reporting Council, as one possible route to greater competition and choice in the audit market.</p>

	<p pid="c.2323W.5/3">However, the Government recognise that the advice sector plays an import role, particularly in disadvantaged communities. All potential advice providers can bid for a share of any special time-limited grants for which DTI is responsible. For example some Citizens Advice Bureaux are included in the partnerships that gained grants awarded by my Department from the financial inclusion fund, over a two-year period, for providing face-to-face debt advice.</p>

	<p pid="c.2324W.8/1">The DTI has held two public consultations on the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. The most recent, in December 2005, received 69 formal responses including responses from: consumer bodies, business and business organisations, trading standards departments, regulators, professional institutions and academics. A summary of these is on the Department's website. The DTI also held a number of workshops before and during the consultation process with consumer groups, enforcers and business representatives. It has also held numerous public presentations. In addition, the Department recently received eight letters from Members of Parliament and another from a local government central body that advises and supports local authority regulatory services.</p>
	<p pid="c.2324W.8/2">Implementation of the directive is overseen by a project board that includes representatives from the enforcement community. It is also informed by a stakeholder board consisting of representatives from business and consumer groups and enforcement authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.2324W.8/3">In light of comments received, the Government are still considering how best to implement the directive. Yet implementation offers an opportunity to enhance the powers available to enforcement authorities. Options include: retaining existing criminal offences and investigative powers; and extending these to the new protections contained in the directive. Such powers might also, for the first time, be made available to a national consumer protection body, the Office of Fair Trading. The Government will clarify their intentions when they publish the response to the consultation paper.</p>

	<p pid="c.2330W.2/1">The majority of the Department's expenditure on these subjects is allocated from the Science Budget to the UK Research Councils. In turn, the UK Research Councils allocate the majority of their funds in a &quot;bottom-up&quot; mode responding to the demand of the science community and making funding decisions on quality rather than international geographic focus. It is therefore not possible to provide exact figures on spending which relates to collaboration with Korea. However, there is active collaboration, supported by the Research Councils, in wide range of areas&mdash;including genome work, nano and bio-nanotechnology, sustainable development and energy technologies, ICT and mobile technologies and space science.</p>
	<p pid="c.2330W.2/2">The Office of Science and Innovation does have specific schemes to support links between UK and Korea in these areas which are administered by the Royal Society and which cost &pound;400,000 from 2001-02 to 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="c.2332W.9/1">HM Revenue and Customs consider there to be a number of factors contributing to the decline in the number of reported breaches of strategic export controls since 2000. Firstly, at that time a large number of breaches related to trade sanctions on Angola and Iraq&mdash;these sanctions no longer apply. Secondly, controls on the export of off-road vehicles to the former Yugoslavia were discontinued in 2002. HMRC also assess that there is increased exporter compliance. Since 2000 the DTI, supported by HMRC and other Government Departments, have been very active in running national and regional seminars to increase exporter awareness of the controls. Additionally, DTI and HMRC supported a series of regional seminars run by the Defence Manufacturers Association prior to the introduction of the new Orders under the Export Control Act 2002.</p>

	<p pid="c.2342W.6/2">The loss of an RAF Nimrod MR2 in Afghanistan on <phrase class="date" code="">2 September</phrase>, and the tragic loss of life of the 14 military personnel on board, is currently being investigated. The factors leading to the loss of the aircraft cannot be confirmed until the investigation is concluded, but all the indications are that it was not the result of hostile action. The incident serves to remind us of the risks that our military personnel are facing on behalf of us all, and the debt that we owe them.</p>

	<p pid="c.2349W.6/1">Crown prosecutors carefully consider all the evidence and rigorously apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors. In reaching a charging decision they ensure that the statutory obligations of disclosure are met and that proceedings are expedited. Drink driving cases can raise challenging questions of law and procedure. Frontline prosecutors are provided with detailed and up to date guidance. The DPP has recently reminded CPS prosecutors to exercise particular care in ensuring that those who drive dangerously are charged with driving dangerously, rather than the lesser charge of careless driving. This is particularly important in cases where a victim has died.</p>
	<p pid="c.2349W.6/2">Information taken from the court proceedings database held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform shows that for England and Wales in 2004 (latest available) there were 107,091 proceedings for offences of driving after consuming alcohol or taking drugs, of which there were 96,240 findings of guilt, a conviction rate of 90 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.2355W.0/1">Formula grant is largely based on relative needs formulae, together with the number of band-D equivalent properties in its area. We then ensure that every authority receives at least a minimum percentage increase (the 'floor') year-on-year on a like-for-like basis i.e. after adjusting for changes in funding and function. In order to pay for this we scale back the increases above the floor.</p>
	<p pid="c.2355W.0/2">Relative needs formulae take into account the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of authorities. One of these formulae is for children's social care. The formula is based on extensive research and has a solid evidence base. It draws on evidence from the 2003 Children in Need census. This is the largest source of information on children's social service activity in England. It contains information from almost every council who provide children's social care. Therefore children with autistic spectrum disorders included in the 2003 Children in Need census are included in the evidence base used to derive the existing formula.</p>

In addition, the UK supports multilateral organisations, including the World Bank's Angola Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme (US$25 million over five years), the European Commission's European Development Fund, which allocated &euro;146 million to Angola for 2002-07 (of which the UK's share was around 17.5 per cent.), and UNICEF's &pound;18 million programme Southern Africa programme (which includes Angola) to which DFID contributes &pound;3.5 million.</p>

In 2005, Angola ranked 160 out of 175 of the UNDP Human Development Index, with under five, infant and maternal mortality the second highest in the world. With the global rise in oil prices, the Government of Angola have substantially increased revenue to help it tackle these challenges. DFID's priorities in Angola are to support the consolidation of peace, greater civic engagement in state policy and practice, the transparent use of Government resources in a way that prioritises poverty reduction, and assistance for social sectors where Angola is off-track on the Millennium Development Goals.</p>

Projects are also supported on managing the border between Colombia and its neighbours Venezuela (&pound;25,000) and Ecuador (&pound;25,895).

This work includes studies on the determinants of rural poverty.

	<p pid="c.2359W.3/1">The aid that donors provide to Iraq is subject to standard accounting procedures and rigorous auditing. All of DFID's funds are subject to rigorous internal controls. The National Audit Office audits DFID's accounts on an annual basis. Our 2005-06 audited resource accounts are available at <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/aboutdfid/resource-accounts.asp">http://www.dfid.gov.uk/aboutdfid/resource-accounts.asp</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.2359W.3/2">As to the latest estimates of missing or misused donor funds, the US Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction produces a quarterly report for Congress. Its report in January 2006 found that $8.8 billion under management by the Coalition Provisional Authority between May 2003 and June 2004 had less than adequate financial controls. This audit did not assert that this money could not be accounted for, but rather concluded that financial controls did not meet required standards. Further reports are available at <a href="http://www.sigir.mil">www.sigir.mil</a>. There are regular audits of the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI) run by the UN and World Bank (further details available at <a href="http://www.irffi.org">www.irffi.org</a>).</p>
	<p pid="c.2359W.3/3">Regarding estimates of UK aid missing or misused in Iraq, as set out in our 2005-06 resource accounts, DFID has evidence that &pound;254,000 was misused by recipients. In addition, primarily due to the poor security situation, we have been unable to account properly for a further &pound;296,000. This is out of a total of &pound;356 million disbursed by DFID in Iraq since 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.2359W.3/4">Despite difficult security, donor assistance to Iraq has delivered tangible outcomes. For example, DFID has improved electricity transmission lines in southern Iraq which has secured power supplies for more than 1.5 million people. We have also helped to improve water supplies. And have provided strategic economic advice to the Ministry of Finance which helped Iraq secure an IMF Standby Arrangement in December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.2359W.3/5">Regarding Iraqi sources of aid, the Government of Iraq's accounting system is old and does not accurately reflect public expenditure. Budget outturns for 2005, for example, are estimates and not full audited accounts. A new computerised system should be in place in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.2359W.3/6">There are currently no reliable estimates of how much of Iraq's public money is misused or missing. There is smuggling, theft, and corruption in many sectors, especially oil. The UK, alongside the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other donors, continues to work with the Iraqi Government as they seek to improve accountability and transparency in Iraq's public finances.</p>

	<p pid="c.2360W.2/1">DFID has assessed the level of consumer price inflation in Iraq, and to the extent possible, its impact on the poor. The main causes of inflation are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.2360W.2/2" class="indent">the end of the sanctions regime represented a major boost to purchasing power for ordinary Iraqis, it brought down the prices for many imported goods but also caused inflation and big changes in relative prices of other goods, particularly non-traded goods;</p>
	<p pid="c.2360W.2/3" class="indent">concurrently, the major increase in world oil prices has greatly increased the nominal GDP of Iraq since 2003, which has been a stimulus to demand and has contributed to inflation in the prices of non-traded goods;</p>
	<p pid="c.2360W.2/4" class="indent">the Central Bank of Iraq has been roughly pegging the new Iraqi Dinar to the dollar, which is also quite inflationary given the expansion in dollar income; and</p>
	<p pid="c.2360W.2/5" class="indent">the Iraqi Government's welcome attempts to address some of the highly distorted and subsidised prices in the Iraqi economy has, inevitably, highly inflationary effects in the short term, for example in the domestic fuel market.</p>
	<p pid="c.2360W.2/6">There are regular surveys of prices, but the way these are compounded into an overall price level is made problematic by the absence of good survey data on what Iraqis consume. This makes it very difficult to make a good assessment of how the poor are being impacted by inflation. Our rough estimation is that very poor Iraqis are probably impacted less by inflation in Iraq than are average or richer Iraqis. Richer Iraqis consume a lot of fuel&mdash;the poor remain somewhat protected by the continued existence of the food rationing system. However, it is also likely that very poor Iraqis have seen less of the boost to incomes experienced by Iraqis as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="c.2361W.3/1">Throughout the Nepal conflict there has been intimidation of DFID and other aid agency workers by both Maoists and Nepal Government Security Forces. Since the mutually agreed ceasefire in May 2006, intimidation of aid workers has decreased significantly but the situation varies across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.2361W.3/2">In some areas, the Maoists continue to intimidate aid workers in order to gain funds or to force formal written recognition for parallel government systems. Although the Maoist central leadership have publicly stated that development should continue unhindered and that forced collection of &quot;taxes&quot; by their cadres is forbidden, this directive is not uniformly followed by all regional or district Maoist representatives.</p>
	<p pid="c.2361W.3/3">For DFID, staff safety and security is the first priority. The DFID Nepal Risk Management Office works closely with the UN and other donor agencies to manage and minimise the risks associated with acts of intimidation. Where there have been direct threats to staff safety, DFID has suspended activities in those districts where threats have been made until assurances have been received and threats withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid="c.2361W.3/4">DFID took the lead role in producing a set of Basic Operating Guidelines which lay out the basic principles of engagement for development workers in Nepal. The guidelines have been signed by representatives of ten bilateral partners in Nepal and, in 2005, both the Maoists and the Government of Nepal committed themselves to following the principles set out in the guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="c.2362W.2/1">Conditions in the Internally Displaced People's (IDPs) camps in Darfur stabilised during 2005, bringing mortality and malnutrition indicators in the majority of camps below the emergency threshold. The camps are still very basic, however, and many of the IDPs are now in their second or third year in camps originally designed to last for six months. Since the recent upsurge in violence, there have been a further 250,000 people displaced. This year there have also been outbreaks of cholera, and security has deteriorated in many of the camps. This insecurity has begun to hamper the delivery of humanitarian assistance and comes at a time of seasonal food shortages.</p>
	<p pid="c.2362W.2/2">The number of returns made by IDPs to their homes is currently negligible. While there is some movement back to villages (generally connected to the agricultural cycle), these are largely just day trips; the pervasive insecurity preventing longer stays. The UK is actively supporting the African Union, the UN and the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement in order to re-establish security and the rule of law and, ultimately, create an environment in which IDPs can safely return to their homes. For this to happen a transition to a UN mission is essential.</p>

	<p pid="c.2362W.5/1">DFID is very concerned with the spread of the new, highly resistant form of tuberculosis, referred to as extreme drug resistant TB (or XDR-TB). This is virtually untreatable and is made worse by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, because HIV makes people more susceptible to TB.</p>
	<p pid="c.2362W.5/2">Resistance to anti-TB drugs occurs because of poorly managed TB care. The best way of preventing the development of drug resistance is to ensure all TB patients complete treatment with effective drugs.</p>
	<p pid="c.2362W.5/3">DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short-Course) remains at the heart of the Stop TB Strategy for effective diagnosis and treatment of TB. The World Health Organisation and partner agencies have developed the DOTS-Plus approach for the management of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) which includes rational use of second line drugs.</p>
	<p pid="c.2362W.5/4">In 2004, DOTS strategy was extended to cover 183 countries, and there were 4.4 million new and relapse TB cases notified, of which 2.1 million were new cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.2362W.5/5">The UK supports TB control through a variety of channels, including bilateral country programmes and through support to international organisations and partnerships such as the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM), the World Bank, the European Commission, WHO and the Stop TB Partnership.</p>
	<p pid="c.2362W.5/6">DFID is a founder member of UNITAID (the International Drug Purchase Facility) which will be launched this month at the United Nations General Assembly, and will provide additional funding to help the scale-up of services to improve access to treatment for AIDS, TB and malaria.</p>
	<p pid="c.2362W.5/7">The UK has already pledged to provide &pound;100 million to GFATM in both 2006 and 2007, (subject to performance). We will also provide &pound;5 million to support the work of the Stop TB Partnership and its Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015. In January this year, the Chancellor also announced new UK support to combat TB in India, where DFID will provide &pound;41.7 million over five yeas.</p>
	<p pid="c.2362W.5/8">The development of new drugs will be crucial to the treatment and management of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and XDR-TB. DFID has a long history of supporting research on TB and we currently support research programme consortia on communicable disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Nuffield Centre for International Health at Leeds University. Both programmes will receive &pound;5 million each over the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.2362W.5/9">DFID is also supporting the research and development of TB drugs and diagnostics via WHO's programme on Tropical Disease Research (TDR) and the Global Alliance for TB Drugs. The Global Alliance will receive &pound;6.5 million from 2005-08 for the development of new TB drugs.</p>

	<p pid="c.2367W.2/3">HSE's regulation of such sites require a balance between observing workplace standards and working practices, verifying risk control measures (both hardware and software), examining supporting documentation and interviewing personnel.

Some testing of actual safety systems may be appropriate during a visit, for example, inspectors may ask to observe a test of a safety critical control system or a mitigation measure such as an emergency response plan.</p>

DWP has implemented this recommendation. Following the successful pilot at Balham office, new procedures for NINO allocation were introduced nationally at the end of March 2001. Specialist teams now carry out thorough and detailed interviews with applicants. Interviewing sites have access to sophisticated document examination tools. A secondary level of checks has been introduced in order fully to corroborate information provided by the applicant at the initial interview.</p>

	<p pid="c.2370W.1/2">The Department for Work and Pensions has not carried out or commissioned specific research into the impact of reimbursing expenses to volunteers.</p>
	<p pid="c.2370W.1/3">The Department for Work and Pensions has not undertaken any specific cost comparison of the cost of lunching at home, the work place or elsewhere; there are no plans to do so. However, we have received a number of representations from voluntary or charitable groups who have produced some evidence to suggest that many people on benefits may be discouraged from undertaking voluntary activity, or stop volunteering, if they are not able to claim the consequent additional costs of meals as an expense.</p>
	<p pid="c.2370W.1/4">Volunteering plays an important role in helping people move off benefits and back into work. It gives people confidence, the chance to develop skills and to gain invaluable experience after a period out of work.</p>
	<p pid="c.2370W.1/5">We do not want to create a situation whereby individuals are put off volunteering or are penalised from helping themselves and others because they cannot afford to buy something to eat.</p>

	<p pid="c.2375W.2/1">The Government and their Olympic partners recognise the importance of ensuring a skilled workforce to deliver the Olympic park and venues on time and budget. The games represent a huge opportunity for local communities in east London and partners are developing a range of programmes to ensure that local people are well-placed to benefit from these opportunities. For example, the Olympic Delivery Authority's draft procurement policy includes a commitment to working with its contractors to provide a legacy of trained and motivated people needed for their business, in association with relevant sector skills councils. ConstructionSkills, the sector skills council for the construction industry, has established a special team&mdash;Constructing London 2012&mdash;to deliver locally available construction skills. In addition, the London Development Agency is working closely with the five Olympic boroughs to set up a job brokerage service which will be based in the Lower Lea Valley and will act as a link with contractors on skills requirements, training provision and pre-employment training.</p>

Those which contain material that might be considered gross violence are classified at the '18' level. The BBFC considered 198 works of digital media, and 43 of these were classified '18'.

The figures from 1997-98 to 2005-06 are based on education formula spending (EPS) which formed the education part of the local government finance settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. In 2006-07 funding for schools changed with the introduction of the dedicated schools grant (DSG) which is based largely on an authority's previous spending.  2. The DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the schools block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's local government finance settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. This means there is a break from 2006-07 onwards in the funding series and the two sets of figures are not comparable. A new funding series is currently being developed by the Department.  3. There are other grants that support the schools budget. These are not included in the provided DSG figures as some of these grant figures are not yet available.  4. Figures are in cash terms and include the pensions transfer.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.2383W.3/1">Mature students are generally able to receive support to study law degrees on the same basis as younger students and on the same basis as for other degree courses. For full-time students, new rates of student support in 2006/07 offer above&mdash;inflation increases in the amount of maintenance loan available to students (up to &pound;6,170 in London). These maintenance loans are available to students under the age of 60. New fee loans of up to &pound;3,000 ensure that no eligible student pays upfront fees. Student loans for maintenance and tuition fees incur no real rate of interest, are repaid only when graduate earnings are &pound;15,000 or more and are written off after 25 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.2383W.3/2">A means tested HE maintenance grant of up to &pound;2,700 has been introduced for new students, who will also receive institutional bursaries of at least &pound;300 if they pay fees of &pound;3,000 at a publicly-funded institution. Students with dependants can claim additional grants including adult dependants grant (worth up to &pound;2,455), parents learning allowance (worth up to &pound;1,400) and a child care grant (worth up to &pound;8,840). In addition, student parents are eligible to receive child tax credit from the Inland Revenue. Some students are also eligible for university access to learning funds and disabled students allowances. Mature law students who do not qualify for undergraduate support may be eligible for a career development loan which has an element of subsidy from public funds.</p>
	<p pid="c.2383W.3/3">Part-time mature students receive the same support as other part-time students. In 2006/07 a fee grant of up to &pound;1,125 is available, depending how intensive the course is, together with a course grant of up to &pound;250.</p>

	<p pid="c.2385W.0/1">Higher education is the best investment most people will make, with a substantial graduate premium compared with what a similar individual would have earned if they just had A-levels. There is now more money available to students from the student finance system and, where this is in the form of student loans, the debt incurred is quite unlike commercial debt. Students repay student loans after they have left university or college and only in real terms the same amount that they originally borrowed. Graduates do not pay back until they are in work and earning more than &pound;15,000. Someone on the average graduate starting salary of &pound;18,000 could be paying only &pound;5.19 per week. If at any time their income drops below &pound;15,000 the repayments will stop until they are earning more again. We have also provided that, if after 25 years students starting in 2006/07 or later have still not paid back all their student loan, the Government will pay it off for them.</p>
	<p pid="c.2385W.0/2">There are also new grants which should benefit up to half of new entrants to full time courses. From 2006/07 lower income students are eligible for maintenance grants of up to &pound;2,700 and minimum university bursaries of &pound;300, typically &pound;1,000, which gives them the option to reduce potential loan debt substantially.</p>

	<p pid="c.2389W.2/1">Schools may offer activities, both directly and through third-party providers from the private, voluntary and independent sectors, on their premises. They may also let their premises to outside bodies, such as sports clubs and community groups. The Department does not collect data on all such usage centrally; however, a baseline survey of extended services in a sample of maintained schools in 2005 found that 75 per cent. of primary schools and 97 per cent. of secondary schools permitted some outside use of their facilities. We are committed to ensuring that by 2010 all maintained schools in England become extended schools, providing access to a core offer of opportunities and services, including activities for pupils, family learning and adult learning available to the wider community. We are on track to achieve our target for 2,500 schools to provide this offer by the end of this month; and for half of all primary schools and third of secondary schools to do so by 2008.

	<p pid="c.2389W.8/1">Parental awareness of speech, language and communication difficulties is very important. In 2005, the Department published a detailed information booklet for parent on speech and language difficulties under our Early Support Programme. This resource was produced in close collaboration with specialist organisations in the voluntary sector and the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. It explains how children normally develop communication, language and speech, how adults can help in this, the difficulties that can arise and how to seek help from professionals.</p>
	<p pid="c.2389W.8/2">The Department has supported a longitudinal study by the University of Warwick looking into the learning needs of a group of children with specific language and communication difficulties, the characteristics of the current provision made for them and its impact, their aspirations for the future and the ways in which services can best support them. The results of the study are due to be published in autumn 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.2389W.8/3">The Primary and Secondary National Strategies have also produced a range of support and guidance to schools and childcare settings on the teaching of English and the development of speaking and listening skills, including frameworks to help teachers meet the requirements of the National Curriculum. We are reviewing the frameworks to provide more detailed and up to date guidance for schools which will be available before half term. We have also provided national training materials&mdash;&quot;Communicating Matters&quot;&mdash;for practitioners in early years Foundation Stage settings to specifically support children's early language acquisition.</p>
	<p pid="c.2389W.8/4">The DfES and the Department of Health have jointly commissioned an independent scoping study to identify, for relevant professionals and other interested parties, examples of good practice in the effective delivery of speech and language therapy services to children and young people with special educational needs aged 0 to 19. A research team from Canterbury Christ Church University is carrying out the study and the fieldwork in currently under way. We expect to receive the final report on the scoping study early in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="c.2390W.5/1">Guidance on carrying out statutory assessments of special educational needs are given in the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice (2001), to which all local education authorities and schools must have regard. The code recognises that there are no hard and fast categories of need for assessment purposes. It identifies four broad types of need: communication and interaction; cognition and learning; behaviour, emotional and social development; and sensory and/or physical needs, but it stresses that each child is unique and that children may have needs that fall into more than one area. The code makes clear that children's needs must be considered on an individual basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.2398W.3/1">I am pleased to report that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland launched the Household Programme on <phrase class="date" code="">24 July</phrase> as the first initiative to provide funding for homes under the &pound;59 million Environment and Renewable Energy Fund. Householders are eligible to apply for assistance under this programme, which will provide up to 50 per cent. of the cost of installation of renewable energy systems, provided they own the property and it is used primarily for domestic purposes. The grant will be offered on a first-come first-served basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.3/2">The programme is being advertised widely and information on applying for funding, including guidance notes and application forms, can be accessed on the DETI and Action Renewables websites; they can also be requested via dedicated freephone (0800-023-4077), text and e-mail services which are being widely advertised.</p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.3/3">Some funding from the Household Programme has been set aside to install 500 solar hot water systems in private households that are deemed to be in fuel poverty. Assistance at 100 per cent. of the cost of installation is available for these cases through the Department for Social Development. The criteria used to select homes for this assistance will be based on the eligibility criteria for the existing Warm Homes Scheme as well as conditions relating to the suitability of the property including suitable orientation needed to benefit from the solar energy. Selection will initially be carried out by the Warm Homes managing agent from the database of homes that have previously received other energy-related assistance under the Warm Homes Programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.3/4">In addition to the Household Programme, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive will receive funding of &pound;1.8 million over two years under the EREF to install 600 solar hot water panels in their stock. Installation will be applied to dwellings that are in heating conversion schemes and, again, suitability, including suitable orientation of the property, will be the key selection criteria.</p>

This will include the strategy planning and review group, which we are required to have up and running to advise on the strategy's action plan. We have not agreed the membership of the groups, nor have we finalised selection criteria at this stage. I intend to seek the views of the all-party group on children and young people and other key stakeholders on how this can be effectively achieved.</p>

	<p pid="c.2403W.5/1">The Prison Service acknowledges that it is essential to have detailed monitoring systems and trends analysis of the availability of illegal drugs in prisons. The Service has a detailed monthly monitoring system which includes:</p>
	<p pid="c.2403W.5/2" class="indent">Prisoners who recorded a dependency or use of drugs or alcohol during committal screening;</p>
	<p pid="c.2403W.5/3" class="indent">Number of adjudications for possession of drugs;</p>

	<p pid="c.2403W.5/7" class="indent">Deployment of Passive Drug Dogs (FDD).</p>
	<p pid="c.2403W.5/8">Complementing the statistical data, graphs and charts are produced which provide a trend analysis over six monthly periods. This information is disseminated within the Northern Ireland Prison Service and with the exception of sensitive information, is published on the NIPS website (<a href="http://www.niprisonservice.gov.uk">www.niprisonservice.gov.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="c.2403W.5/9">More long-term, detailed assessments are carried out by external, independent consultants based on anonymous questionnaires and interviews with prisoners. These assessments provide a clear insight into the nature and scope of substance misuse in each establishment. They also provide a solid foundation on which to build and develop policy. They, too, are published.</p>
	<p pid="c.2403W.5/10">The measures in place to reduce availability of illegal drugs in prison are set out in the &quot;Policy on Alcohol and Substance Misuse&quot; document which was published for consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-26">26 July 2006</phrase>.

The Department of Culture Arts and Leisure is sponsoring a competition to facilitate the development of an Olympic standard 50m swimming pool through the provision of a capital grant to the appropriate authority with plans to build such a pool.</p>

	<p pid="c.2408W.3/1">The new speed detection project, known as SPECS III, is still at an early stage. Before the system can be deployed operationally, it must obtain Home Office Type Approval. This process is managed through the Home Office Scientific Development Board, with the assistance of police forces that are willing to practically test the equipment. SPECS III is at the beginning of this process and along with the Metropolitan Police Service, the PSNI is providing the testing capability for the system. In Northern Ireland it is to be installed and tested on the A20 dual carriageway between Newtownards and Dundonald. If successful, it is anticipated that SPECS III will be rolled out across the province. Initial costs for the pilot scheme are to be met by the equipment supplier with no budget implications for the PSNI at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="c.2415W.2/3">I fully recognise that many patients are waiting too long for a whole range of diagnostic tests. I am determined to put measures in place to ensure that these waiting times are collected to give a more accurate reflection of the total waiting time patients experience from referral by their GP to completion of their treatment. I have established a dedicated team within the Department's service delivery unit to focus on waiting times for diagnostic tests. An exercise to assess diagnostic capacity and demand is due to be completed before the end of the summer and work is under way to develop weekly waiting time information for diagnostic tests.</p>

	<p pid="c.2418W.14/1">By April 2007, all new asylum claims will be managed as part of the New Asylum Model (NAM). NAM is an integrated process and this therefore points to the need to be close both to reporting centres and to hearing centres. Analysis of the geographical locations of asylum claimants in the London area showed two large clusters of claimants in North Central London and in West London. This was a reasonable fit with the locations of IND reporting centres: at Communications House in Central London and at Eaton House in West London, near Heathrow; as well as with the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal hearing centres in London EC1 and at Feltham in Middlesex. It was accordingly decided that it would be most efficient to locate the Asylum Teams as close to the reporting centres as possible. We have now found and signed leases on buildings in both locations. The experience of the first NAM team which was set up in Croydon in June 2005 was that few of the claimants lived in the Croydon area and were having to travel a long way to report to their case owners and this validated the decision we made.</p>

	<p pid="c.2421W.2/1">The Prison Service has full, step-by-step procedural guidelines set out in the National Security Framework, accessible to all staff, on how rubdown searches must be conducted. In a standard level rubdown search the officer rubs down the upper and lower areas of the front and back of the body. Higher-level searches additionally include searching hair, feet and footwear. The power to search a passenger is contained in the Immigration Act 1971, Schedule 2 and in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004. However, this power is used sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances. An immigration officer, or a customs or police officer conducting the search under his direction, may invite any person to empty their pockets voluntarily as part of a search for documents. Detainee custody officers have a power under Schedule 11 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to undertake a clothed body search of a detained person at an immigration removal centre or a short term holding facility, including a holding room at a port of entry.</p>

	<p pid="c.2426W.2/1">John Lowe, the Director of Business in Prisons, wrote to Baroness Scotland in August 2005 requesting funding. The Minister suggested that he should speak with Neil Moore who was then the HM Prison Service National Voluntary Sector Co-ordinator, working in the National Offender Management Service Voluntary Sector Unit. A meeting was held between Neil Moore and Mr Lowe where Neil explained that there was no central funding available but that the organisation was eligible to submit a bid for the NOMS VSU grant round for 2006-07. The organisation did submit a bid for funding but the application was unsuccessful. The NOMS Voluntary Sector Unit received almost 700 applications for grants and, having identified Finance, Benefit and Debt as a Pathway which was under-resourced, had to reject applications that did not cover that area. There is a new grant round for 2007-08 with a closing date for applications of <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-15">15 September 2006</phrase> for which the organisation is eligible to apply.</p>

	<p pid="c.2428W.0/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has made significant investment in a number of projects, to enhance the quality, coverage and accessibility of its service and to deliver real changes and benefits to its customers. There are eight information technology projects being undertaken by the CRB, which have commenced since 2000. Of these, four are currently at the feasibility stage and costings and completion schedules have yet to be determined. These are: the I-PLX+ project, which aims to enhance the national police cross referencing database of local police force information (I-PLX), which is an important development in vetting and security checks, delivering significant improvements to the protection of the vulnerable; vetting and Barring Scheme: the CRB will continue to play a key role in the development of the new Vetting and Barring Scheme, introduced as a result of Bichard recommendation 19&mdash;entry to the scheme will be via a CRB check&mdash;and New Disclosure application form (DAF). The CRB has also been examining the feasibility of devising an upgraded Disclosure application form. A prototype of a new form has been produced, in consultation with a number of its customers and has been piloted with a cross section of Registered Bodies. As part of the feasibility studies, full costings will be prepared. The on-line application project aims to enable applicants to complete applications for Standard and Enhanced Disclosures via the e-channel. During 2005 the CRB developed a new Quality Assurance Framework (QAF). This is now being rolled out to all police forces and should be completed by January 2007, subject to forces' readiness to complete staff training and implementation. The framework will standardise the forces' approach to deciding what, if any, information is relevant to be released on a Disclosure. The framework also provides good practice guidelines for the wording of this information on the Disclosure, including consideration of the victim's age and mental capacity. With the introduction of the On-line Tracking Service, customers will be able to track the progress of a CRB check from receipt to issue, providing greater visibility of the process. The Registration Cancellation project aims to improve the CRB's assurance regime and enable greater support to its customers and Registered Bodies, whilst further eliminating risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.2428W.0/2">The CRB now has legislation, as a result of the recent Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, giving it access to a wider range of information that can be searched when carrying out a CRB check, for example that held by the British Transport Police, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency and the Royal Military Police. These are scheduled to come on stream during 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="c.2436W.14/1">Where a deportation order is in force against any person, the Secretary of State may give directions for the person's removal to either a country of which he is a national or citizen, or a country or territory to which there is reason to believe that he will be admitted. Immigration Act powers to detain are not time-limited. However, domestic and ECHR case law provides that detention must last for no longer than is reasonably necessary for the purpose for which it is authorised and must not be of excessive duration. In the case of a person being deported or removed from the UK detention would be lawful provided there was a realistic prospect of deportation or removal within a reasonable period of time. Where a detainee refuses to cooperate with the removal process detention may be prolonged and the risk of reoffending is a factor that may be taken into account in determining whether the duration of a person's detention is reasonable. This position has been supported by the Courts.</p>

Friend the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality indicated, the Home Secretary has identified eight priority areas to be addressed in order to improve the effectiveness of arrangements for deporting foreign national prisoners. The second of these priority areas is that there is currently no legal requirement for prisoners to provide evidence of their nationality, or consistent processes for nationality to be recorded. Before the summer, staff in IND and the criminal justice agencies worked together to design possible ways of addressing this gap, including a new legal requirement. A programme of activities is currently in hand, managed through the Office for Criminal Justice Reform, to test the options with frontline staff across the criminal justice system and to examine their feasibility and relative merits, in order for recommendations to be produced by the end of October. Information on the numbers of foreign national prisoners serving prison sentences in prison establishments in Scotland and Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Scottish Executive and Northern Ireland Office respectively.</p>

	<p pid="c.2443W.2/1">Information on the number of people awaiting deportation who have absconded or have been held in open conditions is not held centrally in the format requested and may only be obtained at a disproportionate cost. The Prison Service reviewed the criteria for the categorisation and allocation of foreign national prisoners to open conditions earlier this year. The review concluded that no changes to the security re-categorisation policy were required. However, governors were advised that before a foreign national prisoner was approved for open conditions the individual risk was to be assessed on the assumption that deportation will take place unless a decision not to deport had already been taken by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate.</p>

	<p pid="c.2448W.2/1">While the national Reducing Reoffending Delivery Plan details the partnership work in England, similar principles and the broad approach to reducing reoffending are reflected in 'Joining Together in Wales: an Adult and Young People's Strategy to Reduce Reoffending<sup>(')</sup>. The strategy was launched jointly by the Welsh Assembly Government and Home Office Ministers earlier this year and reflects the roles and responsibilities of the Welsh Assembly Government and the National Offender Management Service. It identifies the issues and aims to be addressed in Wales, which formed the basis of a consultation to develop the actions. Following the consultation, work is now underway with the Welsh Assembly Government and other key partners to develop and agree a joint action plan to deliver the strategy in Wales. Responsibility for the development of the strategy in Wales rests with the Director of Offender Management Services in Wales. Through the role of commissioning services, the Director of Offender Management Services in Wales will be able to influence the allocation of resources to pursue national objectives and in the delivery of the joint action plan. Clearly, not all resources will be allocated directly through the National Offender Management Service and those within other partners' responsibilities form part of the consideration being given to developing and resourcing the delivery of the joint action plan. In addition, to support this work, we are also developing our reducing re-offending alliances in Wales, with the corporate sector, civic society, faith groups and the voluntary sector. The aim is to bring in new skills and innovation enabling us to work effectively with ex-offenders in different ways.</p>

Information on the average length of time served in prison by prisoners discharged from determinate sentences can be found in tables 10.1 and 10.2 of the Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2004, available in the House of Commons Library. The figures provided in the tables were drawn from administrative IT systems. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system, and so is not necessarily accurate to the last whole number.</p>
