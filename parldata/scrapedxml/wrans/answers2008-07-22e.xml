	<p pid="e.975W.6/1">As of <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-30">30 June 2008</phrase>, the ODA employed 212 members of staff. This consists of permanent staff, fixed-term contract staff, and secondments. The overall management costs budget for 2008-09 is based on an ODA headcount of 276. The agreed total budget for ODA management costs for 2008-09 is &pound;24,223,000.

	<p pid="e.975W.6/3">The ODA is leading the first phase of legacy which is focused on cleaning, clearing, and creating the park and the development of new infrastructure, utilities, and venues. The second phase is led by the LDA and is focused on what the park is used for after the games. It is not possible to provide a breakdown of those ODA staff who are exclusively working on legacy planning roles as every project within the programme is considered with legacy in mind, ensuring that legacy requirements are incorporated into design briefs, specifications and business plans.</p>
	<p pid="e.975W.6/4">The ODA currently has 15 employees working in the Finance and Business Planning Team who work closely with the delivery partner on the financial oversight of the programme. In addition the ODA has engaged Ernst and Young to provide an internal audit service.</p>

	<p pid="e.976W.3/1">In June this year we published the Legacy Action Plan (LAP) which sets out the long-term benefits we hope to stimulate through hosting the Olympic games and Paralympic games in 2012, and how we plan to achieve them. This is unprecedented as no other host city has ever been at this stage of planning, nor so committed to a broad and sustainable legacy, this early in preparations.</p>
	<p pid="e.976W.3/2">The LAP sets out the Government's priorities for UK-wide legacy as defined by our five legacy promises, published in Our Promise for 2012 in June 2007. This includes a target to help get two million people more active through sport and physical activity by 2012. Sport England will seek to get one million more active through sport; they will do this through new engagement with national governing bodies and through county sport partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="e.976W.3/3">Further to the announcement in June, Government have now set out further details of the &pound;140 million cross-Government free swimming scheme. The scheme is designed to encourage as many local authorities as possible to participate in making swimming free for over-60s and under-16s in their local communities, but also to stimulate ambitious authorities to maximise and sustain uptake through other initiatives such as free lessons for adults who cannot swim, the introduction of swimming co-ordinators and to provide incentives for the most ambitious to move further towards a universal free swimming offer.</p>
	<p pid="e.976W.3/4">The LAP also includes initiatives to stimulate economic and social benefit by increasing tourism and improving access to skills and business opportunities. This includes, for example, the London 2012 Business Network giving business across the UK access to the 75,000 contracts in the London 2012 supply chains worth &pound;6 billion.</p>
	<p pid="e.976W.3/5">Facilities in the London 2012 Pre-Games Training Camp Guide which will be published in Beijing will also have the opportunity to attract inward investment and showcase their local area on an international stage. UKTI are also developing programmes to use the games as a springboard for export.</p>
	<p pid="e.976W.3/6">In addition to the LAP, each of the English regions and nations has its own plan for legacy initiatives at local level that complement this work.</p>
	<p pid="e.976W.3/7">As Members of Parliament we should do everything we can in our constituencies to ensure that the opportunities and long-term benefits generated by the games are realised at local level across the UK.</p>

	<p pid="e.981W.6/1">The independent post-project review of the Cromwell Green visitor reception building, undertaken by Roy Davis Associates LLP, has now been received by the Clerk of the House. It was reported to the Commission at its recent meeting, and will be reported to the House of Lords House Committee in October.</p>
	<p pid="e.981W.6/2">The review presents a thorough analysis of the project. The Cromwell Green entrance opened on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-21">21 April 2008</phrase> and has been operating successfully since as an important enhancement of visitor reception at Westminster. But its construction was subject to exceptional delay and significant cost overruns. The main findings of the review are:</p>
	<p pid="e.981W.6/3" class="indent">until autumn 2007 the governance of the project was poor, and it is questionable whether the Houses were advised in sufficient detail to make balanced decisions;</p>
	<p pid="e.981W.6/4" class="indent">the initial project delivery date of September 2006 drove the project but was not achievable;</p>
	<p pid="e.981W.6/5" class="indent">once on site, delays occurred due to the complexity and uniqueness of the design, the fact that it was incomplete and uncoordinated, which required it to be extensively reworked during construction, and the lack of resolution of critical issues;</p>
	<p pid="e.981W.6/6" class="indent">the requirements of major parts of the project brief were ignored;</p>
	<p pid="e.981W.6/7" class="indent">the management of the design and the construction was undermined by the split responsibilities of project managers and the lack of ownership of the project; and</p>
	<p pid="e.981W.6/8" class="indent">both the cost management and advice and the procurement and production of contracts for consultants and the contractor were poor.</p>
	<p pid="e.981W.6/9">The repeatedly escalating costs and continued slippages in this project have raised serious questions about project management competences in the House service. A number of key steps have already been taken. As part of a reorganisation following the review by Sir Kevin Tebbit it was decided to create a reunified Parliamentary Estates Directorate and recruit senior managers with appropriate skills. The Directorate is now under the direct responsibility of a Director General of Facilities. As part of their recruitment, both new postholders have been required to demonstrate competence, and personal track records of delivery, in the areas of estates and works matters.</p>
	<p pid="e.981W.6/10">Further improvements relating to transparency and control of projects are under way, and these will take account of recommendations for future practice from the post-project review. The Commission will receive a progress report from the Clerk of the House in the autumn on the establishment of the revised management arrangements and the effectiveness of the new controls over projects. It supports the Clerk of the House in his determination to ensure that full lessons are learned from this major failure in project management.</p>
	<p pid="e.981W.6/11">A copy of the post-project review has been placed in the Library and on the parliamentary website.</p>

	<p pid="e.987W.3/1">The UK Government remain firmly committed to tackling child vulnerability in Africa, including those affected by HIV/AIDS. Over the last three years the Department for International Development (DFID) has provided over &pound;120 million for support of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in Africa. This includes supporting National Plans of Action for OVC and expanding support for the needs of the most vulnerable children in health, education, social protection and HIV prevention and treatment programmes.</p>
	<p pid="e.987W.3/2">Over the next three years, the UK Government will expand their social protection programmes and increase spending to over &pound;200 million. DFID will work in at least eight African countries to develop social protection policies and programmes, with Governments and NGOs that provide effective predictable support for the most vulnerable households&mdash;ensuring access to social services and protection from abuse. DFID will also work with others to provide better diagnostics and treatment of children infected with HIV and living with AIDS. A copy of the updated strategy 'Achieving Universal Access&mdash;the UK's strategy for halting and reversing the spread of HIV in the developing world' and supporting evidence paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

	<p pid="e.990W.8/1">The UK Government have been working closely with the major international organisations (World Bank, International Monetary Fund, UN agencies and International Food Policy Research Institute) in order to assess future price trends and cereal production. Increased cereal production and the removal of export bans have brought about a calming of markets, and prices have fallen back from the very high levels seen earlier this year. But the consensus remains that the underlying demand for food remains strong, and this is likely to keep prices high for some years yet, with the trend price for grains stabilising at around 10-25 per cent. higher than 2001 levels.</p>
	<p pid="e.990W.8/2">Many countries have experienced serious social and economic consequences of the recent surge in food prices, aggravated by similar movement in fuel prices. The macroeconomic impact on developing countries varies according to the degree of dependency on food and fuel imports. Some countries (e.g. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Mozambique) are experiencing significant food price rises; some (e.g. Kenya and Zanzibar) are experiencing clear food shortages; countries in West Africa (e.g. Nigeria and Niger) are heavily affected due to their reliance on imports from international markets; some (Malawi and Zambia) are relatively insulated from global price movements, while others (e.g. Vietnam) are benefiting. The poorest are hardest hit, with some families spending up to 90 per cent. of their income on food. The UK Government are pressing for a global partnership to address both the short term impact of surging food prices, and the longer term challenges of promoting food security for the 850 million people who continue to face hunger.</p>

	<p pid="e.993W.2/1">The humanitarian situation in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria is already serious, with high levels of violence and insecurity, and very little provision of basic social services. Department for International Development (DFID) staff are unable to travel to the Niger Delta for security reasons, so we have been unable to make a direct assessment of the current humanitarian situation. DFID is in regular contact with the Office for Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP), M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF), Save the Children (SCF) and Oxfam, and none of them reported any change to the humanitarian situation in the Niger Delta.</p>

	<p pid="e.996W.6/2">The number of vehicles of all ages being abandoned is one of several indicators monitored by the Department since implementing the end-of-life vehicles directive. We believe that a combination of factors has contributed to the significant reduction in the numbers of abandoned vehicles recorded in recent years. Those factors include the introduction of the End-of-Life Vehicles Regulations 2003 and the End-of-Life Vehicles (Producer Responsibility) Regulations 2005, improvements in the accuracy of the vehicle register, various Government and local campaigns to tackle abandonment, and the continuing high value of scrap metal. It is difficult to isolate the individual impact of any one of these factors.</p>

Specific support includes the Bioenergy Capital Grants Scheme, which supports the installation of biomass-fuelled heat and combined heat and power projects in the industrial, commercial and community sectors in England. We have also recently announced a new &pound;10 million programme to support the construction of new anaerobic digestion demonstration plants, and we are doubling the incentive to generate energy through AD by changes to the renewables obligation. In addition, the Rural Development Programme for England provides support to develop energy projects or small scale on-farm renewable energy technologies (including anaerobic digestion).</p>

	<p pid="e.1001W.6/1">In 2003 the Environment Agency commissioned a report on the Prioritisation of Flame Retardants for Environmental Risk Assessment. The aim of the study was to assess the use of and risks associated with flame retardants, in particular to identify substances that might require detailed consideration in terms of their possible impact on the environment. It also considered issues concerning substitution of flame retardants. The study noted that little was known about the effects of many of the substances, including those sometimes proposed for use as environmentally-friendly substitutes.</p>
	<p pid="e.1001W.6/2">The new European Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (known as REACH) places on industry the responsibility to assess and understand the potential human health and environmental impacts of the substances they produce in accordance with the principle of &quot;No Data, No Market&quot;. REACH also has the aim of replacing substances of very high concern, as defined by criteria in the regulation, with suitable alternatives. Industry will have to justify their continued use. These provisions will drive substitution of harmful substances and also provide the assurance that the substitutes are less harmful than the substances they replace. On current evidence decabromodiphenyl ether (deca-BDE) does not meet the criteria of a substance of very high concern.</p>

	<p pid="e.1002W.6/1">There are currently no regulations or statutory instruments which place a direct requirement on farmers to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, a number of measures have an indirect impact on agriculture GHG emissions, such as measures under the nitrates directive and conditions under cross-compliance. There are also a number of voluntary initiatives which can help to reduce GHGs from farming, including the Environmental Stewardship schemes and various grant schemes.</p>
	<p pid="e.1002W.6/2">DEFRA has a programme of research dedicated to agriculture and climate change issues which includes research into reducing emissions from livestock, manure and fertiliser application, as well as measures to protect carbon stores in soils. We are working closely with relevant stakeholders, including through the Rural Climate Change Forum and the Farming Futures communications project, to help ensure that farmers have the information and advice they need to take practical action to reduce GHG emissions. As such, we are promoting anaerobic digestion to reduce methane emissions from manure, slurry and other organic material.</p>

	<p pid="e.1003W.3/1">Natural England will consult with landowners before making proposals on the most appropriate positioning of the coastal route. The amount of private land affected by the creation of the coastal corridor will depend on local decisions.</p>
	<p pid="e.1003W.3/2">The draft Marine Bill makes no provision for compensation to be paid to private landowners for the creation of the coastal access corridor. Natural England's report to Government recommended that there should be a working presumption against paying compensation for the new right of access in view of the fact that legislation would be simply creating access rights over land rather than depriving landowners of property. The legislation has been drawn up so that implementation will take account of the interests of landowners and minimise any impact on businesses. Natural England will consult with landowners on any necessary conditions on access, for example for land management purposes.</p>
	<p pid="e.1003W.3/3">Natural England has estimated a cost of &pound;50 million over 10 years for implementing the coastal access corridor. This figure includes the costs of Natural England and local authority staff, the costs for establishing the coastal access corridor on the ground, and for ongoing maintenance during the implementation period.</p>

Farm Business Income per farm on dairy farms was expected to have increased to &pound;50,700 in the year ended February 2008, from &pound;33,600 in the previous year&mdash;an increase of about 50 per cent. This was largely due to a higher farm gate milk price in 2007-08, although higher input costs, particularly feed, dampened down the size of the expected increase. This compares with the average income across all types of farms, including dairy farms, which was expected to have increased by 20 per cent. from &pound;37,600 to &pound;45,000 in 2007-08.

	<p pid="e.1006W.2/1">Cetacean abundance has been assessed recently in European waters through two large international survey projects: Small Cetacean Abundance in the North sea in 2005 (SCANS-II) and Offshore Distribution and Abundance&mdash;2007 (CODA). The first project assessed abundance of both species on the continental shelf of the European Atlantic and North sea and the latter in the offshore environment.</p>
	<p pid="e.1006W.2/2">The estimates from SCANS-II were compared with those from an earlier survey (SCANS) in 1994 and there was no significant difference found between population size for harbour porpoise. The final report has recently been submitted to the EU and will shortly be published.</p>
	<p pid="e.1006W.2/3">The CODA project focuses on cetaceans in offshore waters of the European Atlantic and began in November 2006. Shipboard surveys to assess abundance were carried out in July 2007 and the data are currently being processed. Publication of the results will follow the project's completion in September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="e.1006W.2/4">Common dolphins are widely distributed, with the number of animals in the continental shelf area varying substantially from year to year. There is no known sub- structuring of the common dolphin population in UK waters.</p>
	<p pid="e.1006W.2/5">For bottlenose dolphins there is some sub-structuring. Genetic studies have indicated that the <i> Tursiops. truncatus</i> occurring in the offshore waters of the North Atlantic belong to a large oceanic population. Conversely, and although coastal populations around the UK are not genetically isolated, there is some evidence for geographic structuring.</p>
	<p pid="e.1006W.2/6">In 2007, Favourable Conservation Status assessments were undertaken for both species under the requirements of the Habitats Directive. The bottlenose dolphin was reported to be in a favourable condition, while the status of the common dolphin was unknown, due mainly to our lacking of knowledge in the offshore abundance. CODA was in part initiated to provide this information. The UK FCS assessments are available from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee's website.</p>
	<p pid="e.1006W.2/7">The two SCANS surveys (1994 and 2005) estimated common dolphin abundance in the Celtic sea area. However, the 1994 estimate was not corrected for animals missed on the transect line or for responsive movement, and this is now known to generate significant positive bias. Therefore, it is unknown whether the differences in the abundances obtained were indicative of an actual change in abundance or were related to the different methodology used. Additionally, these two surveys only covered the continental shelf area. This species is known to move widely between inshore and offshore areas.</p>
	<p pid="e.1006W.2/8">The sub-population structure of North East Atlantic harbour porpoises has still not been elucidated fully. However, two sub-populations are recognised in UK waters. The first in the North sea and through to western Scotland; and the second in the Celtic and Irish sea area.</p>
	<p pid="e.1006W.2/9">The abundance estimates from SCANS-II were compared with those from an earlier survey (SCANS) in 1994 for the North sea. There was no significant difference found between population size for harbour porpoise over this decadal period. The final report for SCANS II has recently been submitted to the EU, following which the work will be published.</p>

	<p pid="e.1008W.2/1">Under section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA), local authorities can issue residents with a notice specifying requirements as to the collection of household waste receptacles. These requirements may include the specifics of how and when to present the receptacles for collection, or the articles which must be placed in the receptacles. It is an offence for somebody to fail to comply with these requirements.</p>
	<p pid="e.1008W.2/2">Section 47ZA of the EPA allows local authorities to issue fixed penalty notices for offences under section 46. These fixed penalty notices can be issued by the following people:</p>
	<p pid="e.1008W.2/3" class="indent">(a) an employee of the authority who is authorised in writing by the authority for the purposes of giving notices;</p>
	<p pid="e.1008W.2/4" class="indent">(b) any person who, in pursuance of arrangements made with the authority, has the function of giving such notices and is authorised in writing by the authority to perform that function; and</p>

	<p pid="e.1008W.2/6">DEFRA's guidance on fixed penalty notices explains that where local authorities authorise contractors to carry out enforcement activities, they should ensure that background checks are carried out to determine their suitability and capability. It is important that contractors receive adequate training and have a full understanding of any locally set procedures or policies before they begin to issue fixed penalties. The published guidance can be found on the DEFRA website.</p>

	<p pid="e.1009W.2/1">Section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA) allows a waste collection authority, by issuing a section 46 notice (s.46 notice), to specify the conditions of the waste collection service it provides.

	<p pid="e.1009W.5/1">The Environment Agency receives requests from planning authorities for comments on planning application consultations, development plans and pre-application consultation requests from developers. The Environment Agency replied to 49,432 planning application consultations in 2007-08. In the first quarter of 2008-09 the Environment Agency replied to 11,279 planning applications.</p>
	<p pid="e.1009W.5/2">Planning application consultations sent to the Environment Agency are initially dealt with by Planning Liaison teams, but they may also require additional input from Environment Agency technical experts in issues such as flood risk, pollution, water, waste and wetland biodiversity. There are currently 238 Area Planning posts in the Environment Agency.</p>
	<p pid="e.1009W.5/3">There is no current 'backlog' of requests. The current live workload is 3,072 items of 'casework', which includes planning applications, inquiries and other consultations. The average response time for planning applications in the first quarter of 2008-09 was 15.8 days.</p>
	<p pid="e.1009W.5/4">In the Environment Agency's most recent report (2006-07, December 2007) on replies to planning application responses within the statutory 21-day time limit (or other period as agreed in writing with the applicant), 89 per cent. of consultations (on 40,168 planning applications) were determined within the time period. The report for 2007-08 is currently being prepared and will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="e.1011W.3/2">The concept of sub-catchment management is based on managing water levels throughout a whole catchment to achieve a reduction in the risk of flooding to people, property, businesses, infrastructure, high quality agricultural land and to maintain and improve favourable conditions for environmentally sensitive areas.</p>
	<p pid="e.1011W.3/3">Once re-organised on a sub-catchment basis, IDBs will be larger, better resourced, will benefit from economies of scale and will be better placed to strategically plan, prioritise and deliver appropriate maintenance of watercourses.

	<p pid="e.1012W.2/2">The costs associated with raised water level areas protecting sites of special scientific interest (SSSI) within the Somerset Levels and Moors since 1987 are &pound;1.6 million, which includes construction and maintenance expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="e.1015W.6/2">Certain hormonal weed killers have the potential to remain in plant material from treated land and pass into the manure of livestock which eat such material. Susceptible crops may be adversely affected by the residues in the plant material. Labels of certain products which contain particular hormonal week killers therefore include warnings not to use manure from livestock which have eaten grass from treated land, or fodder derived from such grass, on susceptible crops or on land intended for growing such crops, until all plant material has fully decomposed. As with all plant protection products, users should always read and follow the label instructions; this is a statutory requirement.</p>
	<p pid="e.1015W.6/3">Some cases of damage to susceptible crops which appear to involve the weed killer aminopyralid have arisen recently. In such cases, the label precautions on the use of manure may not have been followed when manure has been supplied to allotment holders and gardeners. The manufacturer has indicated that they are withdrawing products which contain aminopyralid from sale and PSD is formally suspending their authorisations while they investigate the options for preventing a recurrence of this problem. A key issue in their consideration will be whether the conditions of use regarding manure are sufficient, or sufficiently well known.</p>

	<p pid="e.1016W.5/1">The River Mimram lies outside the area of contamination. Sampling has shown that groundwater between the plume and the Mimram contains no bromate. Given these data and the generally stable nature of the plume the Environment Agency is confident that the Mimram is not, and will not be, subject to contamination by bromate.</p>
	<p pid="e.1016W.5/2">Contamination of the chalk aquifer in Hertfordshire extends 20 km from Sandridge to the Lee Valley between Ware and Turnford, which includes Hoddesdon and Broxbourne. One borehole has been taken out of use for public supply. The contamination has restricted the use that can be made of seven other public supply boreholes and three private boreholes. The three private boreholes are all close to Sandridge. Concentrations of bromate and the size of the plume show no change with time.</p>

There have been some changes in the definitions of the waste indicators over time which may affect the comparability of data.

Such controls already apply to the Darwin Mounds site, but it will be for the Commission to propose and ultimately for the Council to decide what measures, if any, should be applied in respect of the other sites proposed for designation.</p>

	<p pid="e.1022W.11/1">Information and survey reports on all of these pests have been published on the Forestry Commission website.</p>
	<p pid="e.1022W.11/2">A survey of horse chestnut (<i> Aesculus hippocastanum)</i> in Great Britain was undertaken between June and August 2007. This was to provide information, based on visual assessment of symptoms, on the likely incidence and severity of the disease known as Horse Chestnut Bleeding Canker, caused by <i> Pseudomonas syringae pathovar</i><i> aesculi</i>.

Further surveys have been carried out each year and since. I will arrange for a copy of the Report on the Forestry Commission Re-Survey of Woodlands 2007 to Assess the Level of Incidence of <i> Phytophthora ramorum</i><i> </i>and <i> Phytophthora kernoviae</i> in woodlands in England and Wales to be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="e.1024W.2/1">The Forestry Commission's statutory remit under the Plant Health Act 1967 charges them with the responsibility for the protection of forest trees and timber against attack by pests. This statutory remit does not specifically extend to monitor amenity and urban trees in relation to pests and disease. In practice the Forestry Commission occasionally does this, either by individually financed surveys aimed at detecting specific pest problems, or by monitoring the issues raised in calls for advice through the Tree Health Diagnostic and Information Service operated by Forest Research. I have asked the Forestry Commission to consider whether there is a need to extend their remit to include a more targeted approach to amenity and urban trees.</p>

	<p pid="e.1024W.5/1">The Government believe local authorities are best placed to make decisions on the waste management strategy for their communities. Local authorities are free to chose how they fulfil their waste collection duties including the frequency of the collections, the priority, degree of effort and resources required.</p>
	<p pid="e.1024W.5/2">The authority can specify the number, size, construction and maintenance of receptacles, what can be placed in each, where and when they are to be placed for collection and can require the waste to be treated prior to placing it in a receptacle (usually washing or rinsing containers).</p>
	<p pid="e.1024W.5/3">All recycling systems require the use of more than one receptacle, so the guidance published by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) in July 2007 offers some consideration of specific issues associated with the containers for recycling and residual waste, in the context of alternating collections of recylates and residual waste.</p>

So far, over 300 local authorities have benefited from WRAP's local authority advisory service on their collection programmes for kerbside, civic amenity and bring schemes. Areas where advice is provided include collections and recycling, waste prevention and monitoring and evaluation. The service has been improved this year by integrating support for local communications with advice on collection systems so that authorities will receive a more comprehensive service. The service has also been extended to include support for authorities preparing business cases for PFI funding to ensure that they can meet the required level of recycling.</p>

	<p pid="e.1028W.2/10">On <i> (b)</i>, court conviction datasets do not contain background information in relation to offences committed; it is therefore not possible to identify separately the number of convictions for all offences where a knife was involved. For instance, if a knife was used in murder, this information would not be recorded. Prosecution and conviction data are also collated on the principal offence rule; so only the most serious offence with which an offender is charged is included in the data.</p>
	<p pid="e.1028W.2/11">I welcome the recent agreement between the PSNI and the Public Prosecution Service that people caught in possession of a knife in a public place with no reasonable excuse can expect to be prosecuted. The re-launch of the PSNI's knife campaign on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-21">21 July</phrase> will help to reinforce this message and help to raise awareness of the dangers of knives more generally.</p>
	<p pid="e.1028W.2/12">I have recently announced a range of tough new sentencing powers to tackle knife crime. The commencement of provisions in the Criminal Justice Order on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-16">16 July</phrase> means the maximum penalty for carrying a knife in a public place, including school premises, is now a four year custodial sentence.</p>
	<p pid="e.1028W.2/13">I intend to consult on a number of other proposals including a retail licensing scheme, a retail code of practice and a test purchase scheme to enforce the age limit on the sale of knives. All these initiatives will be underpinned by new research to obtain up-to-date local information on the attitude of young people in Northern Ireland to knives.</p>

	<p pid="e.1040W.0/1">The Gallagher review focused on the potential impacts of likely global demand for biofuels in 2020, rather than on the dynamics of specific regional biofuel markets. As part of this, it took account of matters such as the different types of biofuel feedstocks likely by 2020 to be used in different regions (including the EU, USA and China), and the different land requirements and impacts of these feedstocks. Matters such as current and projected levels of subsidies for biofuels and the impact these might have on different markets were outside the scope of the review.

	<p pid="e.1042W.5/1">Where the particulate emissions limit is sufficiently strict as to oblige manufacturers to use a diesel particulate filter, as the future Euro VI standard proposed by the European Commission may be, the associated fuel consumption penalty would be likely to be between 2 and 3 per cent. if no offsetting improvements to engine or vehicle technology were made.</p>
	<p pid="e.1042W.5/2">In principle, because carbon dioxide is a direct consequence of the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, the imposition of a carbon dioxide emissions limit for lorries would, if it were lower than the current average emissions rate, reduce fuel consumption proportionately. The imposition of a carbon dioxide emission limit for lorries would be technically very difficult and deliver limited environmental benefits.</p>

	<p pid="e.1047W.2/13">The changes are against a background of an increase in disposable income of 105 per cent. between 1979 and 2007 and 27 per cent. between 1997 and 2007. The decline in the real-term cost of travelling by car reflects the significant impact of the decline in real-terms cost of purchasing a vehicle.</p>
	<p pid="e.1047W.2/14">While the cost of motoring has fallen in real terms, the overall UK expenditure on motoring has increased over this period as, the estimated number of cars per household has increased from 0.75 in 1979, to 1.02 in 1997 and 1.15 in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.1047W.2/15">According to the available data from the Expenditure and Food Survey carried out by the Office for National Statistics, motoring costs were 10 per cent. of household disposable income in 1978, 14 per cent. in 1997-98 and 12 per cent. in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.1047W.2/16">Fares and other travel costs were 3 per cent. of household disposable income in 1978, 2 per cent. in 1997-98 and 2 per cent. in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="e.1047W.5/2">The Department recommends all appraisals use the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' shadow price of carbon (SPC) when valuing greenhouse gas emissions. These estimates are used across Government appraisals and, in transport, across the different types of intervention.</p>
	<p pid="e.1047W.5/3">DEFRA's recent release&mdash;&quot;The Social Cost of Carbon and the Shadow Price of Carbon: What they are, and how to use them in Economic Appraisal in the UK&quot;&mdash;documents the assumptions underpinning the current estimate and the approach used in its calculation. It is conceptually different to the market price for carbon, so the EU trading price of carbon does not enter into DEFRA's assessment.</p>
	<p pid="e.1047W.5/4">Carbon impacts will vary depending on the greenhouse gas concentration trajectory the world is on. If emissions fail to fall at the rates targeted, the higher will be the trajectory for carbon concentrations and the more damage from climate change. The SPC calculation undertaken by DEFRA is based on Nicholas Stern's analysis of this aspect.</p>

	<p pid="e.1052W.0/1">Since financial year (FY) 2006-07 targets for Ministry of Defence hospital units (MDHUs) are for a percentage of patients to attend an outpatients appointment within four weeks of referral by their GP and, with a decision to admit, for a percentage of patients to receive treatment within six weeks; this equates to a 10-week care pathway from referral to treatment for those who need it. The average of targets placed on MDHUs and the actual performance against these targets since 2006-07 and 2007-08 are shown in the following table. Targets for 2008-09 are currently being negotiated with individual NHS hospital authorities that host MDHUs.</p>

	<p pid="e.1052W.0/11">Prior to 2006, targets for outpatients appointments at all MDHUs were for 45 per cent. of patients to be seen within four weeks of GP referral and 90 per cent. within 13 weeks. Following a decision to admit for treatment, the target was for 80 per cent. of patients to be treated within 13 weeks; this equates to a total care pathway of between 17 and 26 weeks from referral to treatment for those who needed it.</p>

	<p pid="e.1052W.0/21">Regional rehabilitation unit targets since 2006 are that, from point of referral, 100 per cent. of patients should attend an RRU within 10 working days; in the majority of cases this target is being met. Areas exceeding the target time are those experiencing high operational tempo (RRUs situated near to or within garrisons with a large numbers of troops returning from deployment); waiting times in these cases can be up to 15 days. Implementation of the recommendations of the recent Rehabilitation Review, which reported in May 2008, will re-balance resources to address this.</p>
	<p pid="e.1052W.0/22">Prior to the creation of the RRUs in 2005 the policy was that following an assessment by a GP or physiotherapist that a patient commenced treatment within seven days.</p>

In addition, the target for access to in-patient care is four hours if deemed an emergency by Community Mental Health Units.</p>

	<p pid="e.1053W.2/1">We have not carried out a specific comparison with the decent homes standard for either service family accommodation (SFA) or single living accommodation (SLA).</p>
	<p pid="e.1053W.2/2">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has its own well defined criteria for assessing the condition of its properties. For the majority of SFA, this consists of a list of over 100 individual attributes that are assessed to arrive at an overall Standard for Condition (SfC) score for the property. SfC scores are banded into categories, S1fC the highest to S4fC the lowest. SfC assessment includes aspects such as the structure of the property, its energy efficiency, health and safety features, security arrangements and sanitary items as well as an assessment of the kitchen and bedrooms. On that basis, the majority of SFA is already at either S1fC or S2fC. This includes over 12,800 properties that have been upgraded to S1fC since 2001. By the end of this financial year, no Service family will have to live in S4fC accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="e.1053W.2/3">We are confident that the current SfC system used by the Department fully takes into account the four basic tenets of the decent homes standard. Rather than simply conforming to a minimum acceptable level of accommodation, MOD aspires to provide accommodation to a higher standard; and this is reflected in the criteria that must be met to achieve S1fC. (All eight categories must score at Standard 1 for the overall Standard for Condition to be 1).</p>

	<p pid="e.1060W.2/2" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Bob Ainsworth to Liam Fox, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-21">21 May</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="e.1060W.2/3" class="indent">I undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Questions on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November 2007</phrase>, (Official Report, Column 990W) and <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-20">20 May 2008</phrase> (Official Report, Column 181W) about fuel leaks from Nimrod aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="e.1060W.2/4" class="indent">The Nimrod Integrated Project Team within Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) is carrying out a detailed manual analysis of fuel leak data in order to answer your questions. Unfortunately, this is proving to be a time consuming process because the work has been disrupted by the corruption of the relevant database at RAF Kinloss. I am sorry that this has led to the delay in answering your questions, but I expect this analysis to be complete within the next four weeks.</p>
	<p pid="e.1060W.2/5" class="indent">In November 2006, after the loss of Nimrod XV230, DE&amp;S introduced new mandatory fuel leak reporting procedures (known as 'Leaflet 70 reports') on all leaks associated with fuel tanks within the fuselage, the fuel system and any residual fuel found in specific areas of the aircraft (such as the bomb bay). So far our analysis indicates that since the introduction of these procedures, 111 fuel leaks (of varying degrees of severity) have been recorded under Leaflet 70. Of course, once the outcome of the ongoing detailed analysis of fuel leak data by DE&amp;S is known, I will write to you again.</p>
	<p pid="e.1060W.2/6" class="indent">I should point out that following a recent request by the Oxfordshire Coroner relating to fuel leaks reported under Leaflet 70 we have provided the same information to him. In light of this, I was keen to ensure that you received this information as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="e.1060W.2/7" class="indent">I am copying this letter to Ian Liddell-Grainger and Sir Nicholas Winterton, who have expressed an interest in this subject.</p>
	<p pid="e.1060W.2/8" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Bob Ainsworth to Liam Fox, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-13">13 July</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="e.1060W.2/9" class="indent">I wrote to you on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-21">21 May 2008</phrase> in answer to two Parliamentary Questions that you tabled about fuel leaks from Nimrod aircraft. I explained that the Nimrod Integrated Project Team within Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) was carrying out a detailed manual analysis of fuel leak data in order to answer your questions.</p>
	<p pid="e.1060W.2/10" class="indent">This work has now been completed and I can now provide you with a full response. In your first question on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November 2007</phrase>, (Official Report, Column 990W) you asked how many instances of fuel leaks from Nimrod aircraft had been recorded in the last 12 months. This was taken to be the period from <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-31">31 October 2007</phrase>. A fuel leak is defined as any leakage of fuel from aircraft couplings, pipes or fuel tanks. In that period, there were a total of 252 fuel leaks reported on the Nimrod MR2 and R1 aircraft. In your second question on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-20">20 May 2008</phrase> (Official Report, Column 181W) you asked how many fuel leaks had been reported since January 2007. Between <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-31">31 December 2007</phrase> there were 277 fuel leaks reported on the Nimrod MR2 and R1 aircraft. Based on current data, between <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> (the last full month for which validated data is available), there have been a total of 33 fuel leaks reported on the Nimrod MR2 and R1 aircraft. That figure is however provisional, as some records have yet to be received from aircraft deployed on operations, and it is therefore likely to increase as the records are completed.</p>
	<p pid="e.1060W.2/11" class="indent">The figures quoted above do not include fuel leaks which are caused by our scheduled maintenance activity, as we disturb the fuel system. In these cases the leak is both caused and rectified while on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="e.1060W.2/12" class="indent">Although all aircraft are designed to be leak tolerant, all fuel leaks are thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, the measures implemented following the loss of Nimrod XV230 mean that the chance of any fuel leak Igniting is extremely low. In particular we have, as you know, removed potential sources of ignition by switching off the aircraft's very hot air system while airborne; it is used for short periods on the ground but does not reach temperatures sufficient to ignite fuel. Despite this, no leakage, however small, from pipes, couplings or fuselage tanks is accepted and the aircraft will not fly until such leaks have been rectified. The only occasion on which an aircraft will fly with a fuel leak is with certain categories of leaks from the integral fuel tanks in the wings. In such instances leaking fuel from the wing tanks disperses safely into the aircraft's slipstream, and, as there is no potential source of ignition, there is no hazard to the aircraft.</p>

	<p pid="e.1061W.2/2" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Bob Ainsworth to Liam Fox, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-21">21 May</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="e.1061W.2/3" class="indent">I undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Questions on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November 2007</phrase>, (Official Report, Column 990W) and <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-20">20 May 2008</phrase> (Official Report, Column 181W) about fuel leaks from Nimrod aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="e.1061W.2/4" class="indent">The Nimrod Integrated Project Team within Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) is carrying out a detailed manual analysis of fuel leak data in order to answer your questions. Unfortunately, this is proving to be a time consuming process because the work has been disrupted by the corruption of the relevant database at RAF Kinloss. I am sorry that this has led to the delay in answering your questions, but I expect this analysis to be complete within the next four weeks.</p>
	<p pid="e.1061W.2/5" class="indent">In November 2006, after the loss of Nimrod XV230, DE&amp;S introduced new mandatory fuel leak reporting procedures (known as 'Leaflet 70 reports') on all leaks associated with fuel tanks within the fuselage, the fuel system and any residual fuel found in specific areas of the aircraft (such as the bomb bay). So far our analysis indicates that since the introduction of these procedures, 111 fuel leaks (of varying degrees of severity) have been recorded under Leaflet 70. Of course, once the outcome of the ongoing detailed analysis of fuel leak data by DE&amp;S is known, I will write to you again.</p>
	<p pid="e.1061W.2/6" class="indent">I should point out that following a recent request by the Oxfordshire Coroner relating to fuel leaks reported under Leaflet 70 we have provided the same information to him. In light of this, I was keen to ensure that you received this information as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="e.1061W.2/7" class="indent">I am copying this letter to Ian Liddell-Grainger and Sir Nicholas Winterton, who have expressed an interest in this subject.</p>
	<p pid="e.1061W.2/8" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Bob Ainsworth to Liam Fox, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-13">13 July</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="e.1061W.2/9" class="indent">I wrote to you on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-21">21 May 2008</phrase> in answer to two Parliamentary Questions that you tabled about fuel leaks from Nimrod aircraft. I explained that the Nimrod Integrated Project Team within Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) was carrying out a detailed manual analysis of fuel leak data in order to answer your questions.</p>
	<p pid="e.1061W.2/10" class="indent">This work has now been completed and I can now provide you with a full response. In your first question on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November 2007</phrase>, (Official Report, Column 990W) you asked how many instances of fuel leaks from Nimrod aircraft had been recorded in the last 12 months. This was taken to be the period from <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-31">31 October 2007</phrase>. A fuel leak is defined as any leakage of fuel from aircraft couplings, pipes or fuel tanks. In that period, there were a total of 252 fuel leaks reported on the Nimrod MR2 and R1 aircraft. In your second question on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-20">20 May 2008</phrase> (Official Report, Column 181W) you asked how many fuel leaks had been reported since January 2007. Between <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-31">31 December 2007</phrase> there were 277 fuel leaks reported on the Nimrod MR2 and R1 aircraft. Based on current data, between <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> (the last full month for which validated data is available), there have been a total of 33 fuel leaks reported on the Nimrod MR2 and R1 aircraft. That figure is however provisional, as some records have yet to be received from aircraft deployed on operations, and it is therefore likely to increase as the records are completed.</p>
	<p pid="e.1061W.2/11" class="indent">The figures quoted above do not include fuel leaks which are caused by our scheduled maintenance activity, as we disturb the fuel system. In these cases the leak is both caused and rectified while on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="e.1061W.2/12" class="indent">Although all aircraft are designed to be leak tolerant, all fuel leaks are thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, the measures implemented following the loss of Nimrod XV230 mean that the chance of any fuel leak Igniting is extremely low. In particular we have, as you know, removed potential sources of ignition by switching off the aircraft's very hot air system while airborne; it is used for short periods on the ground but does not reach temperatures sufficient to ignite fuel. Despite this, no leakage, however small, from pipes, couplings or fuselage tanks is accepted and the aircraft will not fly until such leaks have been rectified. The only occasion on which an aircraft will fly with a fuel leak is with certain categories of leaks from the integral fuel tanks in the wings. In such instances leaking fuel from the wing tanks disperses safely into the aircraft's slipstream, and, as there is no potential source of ignition, there is no hazard to the aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="e.1061W.2/13" class="indent">Of the 310 fuel leaks reported between <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> over 50 per cent were leaks from integral fuel tanks in the wings, in which fuel would simply pass into the aircraft's slipstream during flight. In each of these reported incidents, whether from the integral fuel tanks in the wings or elsewhere, the fuel leaks did not compromise the safety of the aircraft and were rectified by normal maintenance procedures.</p>
	<p pid="e.1061W.2/14" class="indent">In my letter of <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-21">21 May</phrase>, I stated that in November 2006, after the loss of Nimrod XV230, DE&amp;S introduced new mandatory fuel leak reporting procedures (known as 'Leaflet 70 reports') on all leaks associated with fuel tanks within the fuselage, the fuel system and on any residual fuel found in specific areas of the aircraft (such as the bomb bay).

	<p pid="e.1063W.2/1">The theoretical phenomenon known as &quot;popcorning&quot; is a process whereby a series of accidental detonations of a number of warheads' conventional explosives could lead to some nuclear yield. This is extremely unlikely and could occur only if the warheads were located in close proximity to each other without mitigation. Warheads are designed such that there cannot be a nuclear detonation without authorisation.</p>
	<p pid="e.1063W.2/2">Warhead handling, transit and storage facilities, and processes are designed to reduce the risk of popcorning to 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' levels by, for example, separating stored warheads and having physical shielding between them. Similarly, moves of warheads are planned and executed to minimise the proximity of warheads to each other.</p>
	<p pid="e.1063W.2/3">Safety in the nuclear weapons programme is of paramount importance. There are well-rehearsed generic response plans in place to protect workers and the general public in the unlikely event of an accident; all measures are taken to ensure acceptable levels of safety throughout the life cycle of the Trident warhead.</p>

	<p pid="e.1071W.0/1">In the United Kingdom, there are strict legal controls on the retail sale, supply and advertisement of medicinal products which are set out in the Medicines Act 1968. These legal controls apply equally to medicines for human use sold or supplied via internet or e-mail transactions. Prescription-only medicines may only be sold or supplied in accordance with a doctor's prescription at registered pharmacy premises, or by an internet pharmacy which has been approved by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and bears the relevant logo, or under the supervision of a pharmacist.</p>

	<p pid="e.1073W.2/1">Young people aged under 16 are legally able to consent to medical advice and treatment, including abortion, if a doctor or other health care worker judges them competent to do so. As such, they are entitled to the same duty of care and confidentiality as older patients.</p>
	<p pid="e.1073W.2/2">For those young women seeking an abortion, guidance from the Department of Health emphasises that health professionals should discuss the benefits of the young women involving her parents. Where she cannot be persuaded to do so, every effort should be made to find another adult to provide support, for example another family member or specialist youth worker.</p>
	<p pid="e.1073W.2/3">The duty of confidentiality is not absolute. There will be instances when information needs to be shared with social services and/or the police without consent&mdash;where the young person is engaged in an abusive or coercive relationship, or there is another over-riding public interest to do so such as the prevention or detection of serious crime.</p>

Data Quality<br/> HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts, and PCTs in England. Data are also received from a number of Independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 5. Assessing growth through time<br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/>  Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/>  6. Uncrossed Data<br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

Over an extended period it has been subject to risk assessment action under the EU Existing Substances Regulation (EC no. 793/93); the UK (the Environment Agency) was the Rapporteur for the environmental elements of the risk assessment and France was the Rapporteur for the human health aspects.</p>
	<p pid="e.1082W.0/3">The conclusion of the risk assessment is that while decaBDE is very persistent in the environment, it is not on present evidence bioaccumulative, and it is not toxic.

It covered among other areas access, quality and workforce and how the Department is working, with the national health service and stakeholders, to improve services further.</p>
	<p pid="e.1084W.2/4">In addition, in order to identify and spread good practice, the Department announced in March that there will be an evaluation of how local commissioning is working in terms of the patient experience. This will look at both access and quality of services, and the incentives it offers to increase access and encourage prevention and health promotion, as well as treatment. It will also set out a vision for NHS dentistry in five years time. The evaluation is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="e.1088W.5/1">The commitment given was that the Food Standards Agency (FSA) would be &quot;tough and independent&quot;. This is fulfilled by the Food Standards Act 1999 which set up the FSA and by the code of conduct governing the conduct of its board members. The Act requires, and the capability of the agency's board depends upon, the independence and a wide range of skills and experience of members, who together act in the public interest without regard for their own financial or other interests which could prejudice the exercise of their duties. The balance of skills and experience of the whole board is reviewed at the time of each new appointment to ensure that appropriate independence of the board is maintained.</p>

	<p pid="e.1088W.5/4">However information about previous interests is not recorded when no longer held. The current register of interests of board members is published as a Standing Order paper with the papers for all the agency's open board meetings and these are also published on the website. Where relevant to the topic, those interests are also declared in advance of discussion at all board meetings. The process of appointment of members also ensures that potential conflicts of interest are thoroughly explored.</p>

</ques>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-07-22e.214043.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-07-22e.1090W.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" colnum="1090W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080722/text/80722w0024.htm#08072356002250">
	<p pid="e.1090W.0/1">The key elements of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 were as follows. The Act made provision for the creation of national health service foundation trusts (FTs), accountable to local communities rather than the Secretary of State; placed a duty on NHS bodies to monitor and improve the quality of healthcare that they provide; gave the Secretary of State power to publish standards in relation to healthcare; created a Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (usually referred to as the Healthcare Commission (HCC)) and a Commission for Social Care Inspection; and made new provisions in relation to primary dental services.</p>
	<p pid="e.1090W.0/2">There are now 103 NHS FTs in place. NHS FTs have demonstrated their ability to establish strong finances and deliver high quality services; the Healthcare Commission's Annual Healthcheck for 2006-07 showed that FTs are delivering better care and improved finances compared to non-FTs.</p>
	<p pid="e.1090W.0/3">The Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection, or HCC, reports directly to Parliament on the state of healthcare in England, and on the quality of NHS and independent healthcare, and its value for money. The assessment of individual providers of NHS healthcare takes into account the standards for healthcare published by the Secretary of State. By bringing together the expertise of previous health inspection bodies, the HCC is helping to reduce the fragmentation of inspection, easing the burdens on front-line staff.</p>
	<p pid="e.1090W.0/4">Similarly, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) is an independent body, which provides a comprehensive picture of the quality of social care services and the performance of local authorities in meeting social care needs in their areas. It gives a star rating to councils annually and, from 2008, a quality rating to care services. The CSCI regulates, inspects and reviews all adult social care services in the public, private and voluntary sectors in England. It does so on the basis of regulations and standards issued by the Secretary of State. It makes an annual report to Parliament on the state of social care that gives a comprehensive overview of the social care sector in England.</p>

As part of the Department's Pacesetters programme, designed to address health inequalities that arise from discrimination and disadvantage, the 18 participating trusts are trialling ways to improve access to the NHS for Gypsies and Travellers. In addition, DH intends to take forward work to develop a primary care commissioning framework for Gypsies and Travellers as part of wider work for transient populations.

In its regulatory impact assessment of the traditional herbal registration (THR) scheme the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) estimated that typically the costs of registering a product under the scheme could be several tens of thousand pounds but that the figure would vary widely according to specific circumstances, not least depending on whether companies already had systematic quality control systems in place. This assessment has not changed. The MHRA would expect some rationalisation in the manufacturing of herbal medicines reflecting the fact that to carry out this activity to systematic standards within a regulated environment requires specialist expertise. However, there is no basis on which to make specific estimates and feedback to the MHRA from individual companies suggests that many are still developing their plans. So far 14 companies have submitted applications to register one or more product in the United Kingdom under the THR scheme and we therefore anticipate that there will be a competitive market.</p>

	<p pid="e.1101W.5/1">The NHS Security Management Service (NHS SMS) was created in April 2003, with policy and operational responsibility for security management within the national health service. A comprehensive strategy has been implemented detailing the preventative proactive and reactive action that is to be taken both nationally and locally to tackle this problem.</p>
	<p pid="e.1101W.5/2">A network of local security management specialists (LSMS) supported nationally by the NHS SMS guidance, has been introduced. LSMS are tasked with ensuring that security work within their individual health bodies is effective. In particular they are guided to ensure that every incident of violence against NHS staff is reported, acted upon and evaluated so that measures can be adopted to prevent repeated incidents.</p>
	<p pid="e.1101W.5/3">In 2006 the NHS SMS signed agreements with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), outlining how the NHS, CPS and police will work together to drive down assaults and ensure tougher punishment for offenders. It commits the police, CPS and NHS to pursue every reported incident of violence and abuse.</p>
	<p pid="e.1101W.5/4">Mandatory conflict resolution training has also been introduced for all frontline NHS staff, with over 450,000 staff trained by March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="e.1101W.5/5">A national physical assault reporting system (PARS) has been developed to monitor and respond to incidents of assault against NHS staff. Using a clear definition as to what constitutes a physical assault, figures for the number of reported assaults against NHS staff 2006-07, released on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-05">5 November 2007</phrase>, indicate there were 4,676 fewer than 2004-05. The number of criminal sanctions against those perpetrating violence against NHS staff, also released in November 2007, rose to 869, a 17-fold increase from 2002-03 when figures were first collected.</p>
	<p pid="e.1101W.5/6">New measures to tackle nuisance and disturbance behaviour on NHS premises have also been introduced in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. As well as reducing the impact of this behaviour on the delivery of health care, this legislation gives health bodies the power to remove an individual displaying this behaviour before an incident may escalate into violence.</p>
	<p pid="e.1101W.5/7">A project to identify the best available alarm device technology to protect vulnerable lone workers is currently under way. The project will centrally fund the allocation of up to 30,000 devices and introduce a purchasing framework whereby health bodies can purchase any further requirements at the best price possible.</p>
	<p pid="e.1101W.5/8">Training for all frontline staff in preventative skills remains a commitment as does the development of the network of LSMS in health bodies to ensure that all effective action is taken to prevent and deter violence against all NHS staff.</p>

	<p pid="e.1103W.3/1">My right hon. Friend The Secretary of State would grant closed directions under section 7(2) of the Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1967 in respect of staff transferred under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE) to qualifying social enterprises. A qualifying social enterprise is a business with primarily social objectives whose surpluses are principally reinvested for that purpose in the business or in the community. The following legal forms will be acceptable; a registered charity, a community interest company or an industrial and provident society. The terms of the direction would mean that staff would be able to remain members of the NHS Pension scheme. The direction would be specific to the staff named on the direction, the organisation applying for the direction and to them remaining working wholly on the contract in respect of which they were transferred or other national health service contracts. If staff are subsequently transferred to another social enterprise or organisation qualifying for a direction, then a further direction would be granted in respect of those transferring staff. Directions will not cover a member of staff recruited individually in the open market from the NHS or elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="e.1108W.8/1">A small number of representations have been made in recent weeks from a small minority of establishments who have had difficulties meeting the deadline; additional help has been available to them over the course of the last year and support and advice is still being provided to make sure that they operate within the requirements of the law; the vast majority of mental health units have not encountered difficulties and indeed are benefiting from an end to the smoking den culture in mental health establishments.</p>
	<p pid="e.1108W.8/2">The Government commissioned the Tobacco Control Collaborating Centre (TCCC) to provide support to mental health service providers in the lead-up to the implementation of the smokefree legislation in residential mental health units on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-01">1 July 2008</phrase>. Over the past year the TCCC wrote to all foundation trusts, national health service trusts and independent providers asking about their smokefree policies and inviting individual trusts to request additional support, such as visits. The TCCC has also worked with regional stop smoking leads to organise local workshops to address implementation issues. This initial contact was followed up by sending mental health providers smokefree resources, accompanied by a further offer of support to trusts on an individual basis. To date 24 mental health service providers have been visited.</p>
	<p pid="e.1108W.8/3">Due to the one year gap between wider implementation of smokefree legislation and implementation in mental health units it is too early for comparisons to be made.</p>
	<p pid="e.1108W.8/4">Currently, the Department has made no assessment of advice given on giving up smoking to patients with a mental health problem by either general practitioners or clinicians in secondary care and nor has an assessment been made of the beneficial effects of smoking on coping with symptoms of mental distress. However, the Government are committed to review the impact of the smokefree law in its entirety within three years of implementation.</p>

The information can only be collected at trust level. The University of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust is the trust which closely corresponds to the Westmorland and Lonsdale area.<br/> 3. Data cannot be provided for the number of heart attacks and strokes recorded but are provided as the number of admissions to hospital with a primary diagnosis of a <i> (a) </i>stroke and <i> (b)</i> heart attack.<br/> 4. Finished admission episodes&mdash;A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 5. Data Quality&mdash;HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 6. Assessing growth through time&mdash;HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be accounted for when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be accounted for when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> 7. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)&mdash;The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br/> 8. Ungrossed Data&mdash;Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="e.1112W.7/1">As a result of the recent theft of a laptop, the Ministry of Defence has initiated an investigation into the details of all lost or stolen electronic media since 2003. This investigation involves the collation and examination of reports from across the Department including final disposal action, where available. While every effort is being made to gather the information as quickly and accurately as possible, not all the details are presently available. In addition, it should be noted that details of such incidents were not collated centrally before 2003 and therefore will not be available.</p>

I am responding on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="e.1112W.7/5" class="indent">Currently, all incidents are categorised as either lost or stolen. There was no centralised reporting of lost or stolen personal digital assistants (PDAs) prior to 2003 so it is not possible to provide the information for the earlier years. Prior to 2003 the reporting of lost and stolen laptops was not centrally collated and it has been found that the figures for the period 1995 to 2002 included in the replies to previous questions on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-22">22 June 2005</phrase>, (Official Report, column 1069W) and <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-19">19 January 2007</phrase>, (Official Report, columns 1363-4W) may be incomplete. As the details of incidents for the 1995/2002 period are no longer available it is not possible to provide updated figures. MOD units are not required to report centrally incidents of loss or theft of mobile phones, but some reports have been provided where the incidents have security significance or have been associated with the theft of other property.</p>
	<p pid="e.1112W.7/6" class="indent">The following figures are derived from the data collated as a result of the investigation into details of computer and other electronic media lost/stolen since 2003 and provided to Sir Edmund Burton as part of his review. These figures continue to be adjusted as a result of additional thefts and losses along with subsequent clarification of historic incidents. The following table shows the number of mobile telephones, PDAs and laptops centrally reported as lost or stolen from the Department since 2003:</p>

	<p pid="e.1114W.2/2" class="italic"> Substantive answer from Bob Ainsworth to Liam Fox, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-13">13 July 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="e.1114W.2/3" class="indent">I wrote to you on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-21">21 May 2008</phrase> in answer to two Parliamentary Questions that you tabled about fuel leaks from Nimrod aircraft. I explained that the Nimrod Integrated Project Team within Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) was carrying out a detailed manual analysis of fuel leak data in order to answer your questions.</p>
	<p pid="e.1114W.2/4" class="indent">This work has now been completed and I can now provide you with a full response. In your first question on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November 2007</phrase>, (Official Report, Column 990W) you asked how many instances of fuel leaks from Nimrod aircraft had been recorded in the last 12 months. This was taken to be the period from <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-31">31 October 2007</phrase>. A fuel leak is defined as any leakage of fuel from aircraft couplings, pipes or fuel tanks. In that period, there were a total of 252 fuel leaks reported on the Nimrod MR2 and R1 aircraft. In your second question on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-20">20 May 2008</phrase> (Official Report, Column 181W) you asked how many fuel leaks had been reported since January 2007. Between <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-31">31 December 2007</phrase> there were 277 fuel leaks reported on the Nimrod MR2 and R1 aircraft. Based on current data, between <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> (the last full month for which validated data is available), there have been a total of 33 fuel leaks reported on the Nimrod MR2 and R1 aircraft. That figure is however provisional, as some records have yet to be received from aircraft deployed on operations, and it is therefore likely to increase as the records are completed.</p>
	<p pid="e.1114W.2/5" class="indent">The figures quoted above do not include fuel leaks which are caused by our scheduled maintenance activity, as we disturb the fuel system. In these cases the leak is both caused and rectified while on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="e.1114W.2/6" class="indent">Although all aircraft are designed to be leak tolerant, all fuel leaks are thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, the measures implemented following the loss of Nimrod XV230 mean that the chance of any fuel leak igniting is extremely low. In particular we have, as you know, removed potential sources of ignition by switching off the aircraft's very hot air system while airborne; it is used for short periods on the ground but does not reach temperatures sufficient to ignite fuel. Despite this, no leakage, however small, from pipes, couplings or fuselage tanks is accepted and the aircraft will not fly until such leaks have been rectified. The only occasion on which an aircraft will fly with a fuel leak is with certain categories of leaks from the integral fuel tanks in the wings. In such instances leaking fuel from the wing tanks disperses safely into the aircraft's slipstream, and, as there is no potential source of ignition, there is no hazard to the aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="e.1114W.2/7" class="indent">Of the 310 fuel leaks reported between <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> over 50 per cent were leaks from integral fuel tanks in the wings, in which fuel would simply pass into the aircraft's slipstream during flight. In each of these reported incidents, whether from the integral fuel tanks in the wings or elsewhere, the fuel leaks did not compromise the safety of the aircraft and were rectified by normal maintenance procedures.</p>
	<p pid="e.1114W.2/8" class="indent">In my letter of <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-21">21 May</phrase>, I stated that in November 2006, after the loss of Nimrod XV230, DE&amp;S introduced new mandatory fuel leak reporting procedures (known as 'Leaflet 70 reports') on all leaks associated with fuel tanks within the fuselage, the fuel system and on any residual fuel found in specific areas of the aircraft (such as the bomb bay). I also explained that since the introduction of these procedures, 111 fuel leaks (of varying degrees of severity) had been recorded under Leaflet 70. This procedure will continue to bring fuel leaks in the fuselage to the immediate attention of the DE&amp;S Nimrod Integrated Project Team. The current maintenance policy for the Nimrod fuel system remains appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="e.1114W.2/9" class="indent">With respect to the airworthiness of the aircraft today, we have ceased air-to-air refuelling and ceased the use of very hot air systems in flight. These measures, together with the enhanced aircraft maintenance and inspection procedures introduced since the Nimrod XV230 crash ensure the aircraft, as it is today, is safe to fly. Indeed, my Department having carefully considered all the issues has declared that all reasonably practicable measures have been taken to reduce the risk of fire and explosion to As Low as Reasonably Practicable (ALARP). The work to reach this position has been contributed to by key stakeholders represented on the Nimrod Platform Equipment Safety Committee (comprising representatives of the DE&amp;S Nimrod Integrated Project Team, Air Command, the Release to Service Authority, BAE Systems, Rolls Royce and QinetiQ) which supports this declaration.</p>
	<p pid="e.1114W.2/10" class="indent">In addition, to ensure we can continue to operate the aircraft efficiently until its planned retirement from service, we have in place a programme of more permanent measures which includes replacing, where judged necessary, fuel seals and engine bay hot air ducts on the aircraft, this work is being progressed as quickly as practicable.</p>

	<p pid="e.1117W.9/4">Any recommendations which the Commission may make are without prejudice to the delimitation of the continental shelf between states with opposite or adjacent coasts. Any disputed claims would have to be settled through negotiation or through other international dispute settlement mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="e.1117W.9/5">Existing territorial claims to Antarctica pre-date the entry into force of the Antarctic Treaty in 1961. The Treaty precludes any new claim, or enlargement of an existing claim, to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica. It also provides a mechanism for the effective management of any disputes.</p>

	<p pid="e.1121W.0/2">There has been one allegation of misconduct by the Iraqi authorities against a private military and security company contracted by the Government to work in Iraq. A complaint was made in February 2008 that a weapon was discharged from a vehicle owned by a private military and security company contracted by the Government. We carried out an investigation and established that this was a case of mistaken identity, as none of the company's vehicles were in the area at the time.</p>
	<p pid="e.1121W.0/3">The only other allegation of misconduct of which we are aware was made in December 2007, by a local employee of a private military and security company which we had contracted to support police training in Basra. This individual returned a quantity of surplus ammunition which he alleged had been sold to him improperly by two expatriate employees, one British and one Australian, of the same private military and security company. By the time the allegation was made the two individuals who were the subject of the allegation were no longer employed on the contract in Basra, which was in the process of being wound up, nor were they in the UK. We and the head office of the company concerned investigated, taking a formal statement from the local employee and also contacting the two employees who were the subject of the allegation. Taking into account the content of the individuals' statements and the absence of any independent evidence, we determined that there were no grounds for taking the matter further.</p>

	<p pid="e.1124W.6/1">The EU has regular political dialogue with Ukraine at which we make clear our concerns about respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-28">28 November 2007</phrase> the EU carried out a demarche at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry to express concern about racist and anti-Semitic attacks. Under the terms of its relations with the EU, Ukraine is committed to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rights of persons belonging to minorities in line with international standards. Together with EU partners we have made it clear that we expect Ukraine to abide by these standards and values if it is to make progress on its aspirations for closer relations with the EU.</p>
	<p pid="e.1124W.6/2">We do have concerns regarding human rights and political freedoms in Russia, including the reported rise in violent attacks on ethnic and religious minorities. An outline of our assessment can be found in the 2007 Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Human Rights Annual Report.</p>
	<p pid="e.1124W.6/3">We hold annual, bilateral human rights discussions with Russia. These were last held in January 2007 and they included discussion on the rights of ethnic and religious minorities. The next meeting is planned for later this year. We also raise our concerns through the EU/Russia human rights consultations, which were last held in April 2008. At the consultations the EU raised a number of concerns related to specific human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Russian Federation, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities and combating racism and xenophobia. We welcome President Medvedev's condemnation of &quot;any ethnic or religious enmity&quot; in his speech on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-09">9 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="e.1124W.6/4">The FCO supports projects in Russia which promote human rights, including strengthening state and civil society capacity to combat religious and ethnic discrimination. Last year we spent &pound;15,000 on such projects (out of a total spend of &pound;700,000 to support human rights, good governance and reform in Russia).</p>
	<p pid="e.1124W.6/5">The UK is committed to combating anti-Semitism and all forms of racism. At the 2007 Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Human Dimension Implementation Meeting, held in Warsaw from <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-24">24 September</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-05">5 October 2007</phrase>, we were the first country to report in detail on how we have implemented the Berlin Declaration on Combating Anti-Semitism. We urged other participating states of the OSCE to do likewise. We will continue to work with our OSCE partners, including Russia, on intensifying efforts to combat anti-Semitism.</p>

	<p pid="e.1125W.5/1">We are very concerned about the high level of anti-Semitism in Ukraine. A poll conducted in 2006 found that one in three Ukrainians do not want Jews to be citizens, while investigations into suspected anti-Semitic attacks often fail to result in arrests. President Yushchenko has spoken out strongly and frequently against anti-Semitism and stated that he would take a resolute stance on the matter. This has resulted in a number of welcome developments: the security service and Ministry of Interior have set up units to combat racism and religious hatred; and a task force for the development of a national action plan to combat xenophobia and intolerance has been established. In 2008 a number of proposals for legislative reform that could result in tougher action against anti-Semitism were tabled.</p>

The recent report on marine renewable energy issued by the Renewables Advisory Board (RAB) endorsed the design of the scheme and noted that it acts as an encouragement to developers to progress beyond the research phase to demonstration and deployment.

	<p pid="e.1138W.5/2">The use of tips as part of the national minimum wage is a complex issue. It is important to remember that under the current law workers are always entitled to receive the minimum wage.</p>
	<p pid="e.1138W.5/3">Tips may count toward the minimum wage only where they have been paid through the employer's payroll.</p>
	<p pid="e.1138W.5/4">We are already looking at this issue very carefully and believe tipping should be fairer and more transparent. Practice on tipping varies widely. In considering any change in this area, the Government would obviously consult fully and look at a range of options in line with better regulation.</p>

The impossibility of quantifying the monetary value of the indemnity is the main reason that there is no commercially available insurance, and the reason an indemnity is needed.</p>

	<p pid="e.1148W.9/2">The Department works closely with other Government Departments, including the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, to improve patients' access to beneficial new treatments and medical technologies. The contribution that innovative medical technologies can make to the delivery of modern health and social care services was recognised as part of Lord Darzi's report on the NHS Next Stage Review &quot;High Quality Care For All&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-30">30 June 2008</phrase>. As a result, the Department is working across Government and with the medical technology industry to develop a strategy which promotes uptake of clinically and cost effective innovative products throughout the care pathway.

	<p pid="e.1148W.9/5">In Secondary Care, buyers procure goods and services via a tendering process. Consequently, market forces will drive a level of competition among suppliers who wish to secure NHS contracts.</p>
	<p pid="e.1148W.9/6">Regarding the provision of stoma and urology items in primary care, the Department recently published an impact assessment (IA) alongside the consultation entitled &quot;Proposed new arrangements under Part IX of the Drug Tariff for the provision of stoma and urology appliances&mdash;and related services&mdash;in Primary Care.

	<p pid="e.1160W.5/2">As we set out in the consultation document each eco-town location will need its own approach and the consultation document only provides an indication of some of the benefits that eco-towns will provide. Also, as referred to in the consultation document, the Town and Country Planning Association have produced a best practice worksheet on community development, which is available to all those taking eco-towns forward, and provides advice about working with communities, including faith communities. We will be encouraging schemes to put this guidance into practice as individual projects are taken forward, including for example the funding and endowment of community assets which may be available to faith groups, as part of the development gain.</p>
	<p pid="e.1160W.5/3">As part of the second stage of consultation we will be consulting on community issues among other criteria in the draft planning policy statement on eco-towns, and we will also be engaging more closely with faith communities to ensure that their views are taken into account in how the programmes goes forward.</p>
	<p pid="e.1160W.5/4">In planning for eco-towns local authorities will also need to take account of 'PPS1: Delivering Sustainable Development' which requires that they take into account the needs of all the community, including particular requirements relating to age, sex, ethnic background, religion, disability or income.</p>

	<p pid="e.1160W.8/1">The Housing Act 2004 introduced voluntary powers for councils to apply to make an Empty Dwelling Management Order (EDMO). The decision to pursue an Empty Dwelling Management Order (EDMO) is therefore at the discretion of the individual council where the property is based and we have no plans to amend this aspect of the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="e.1160W.8/2">We are confident that the legislation giving local authorities the power to pursue an EDMO is beginning to work well. We always intended that it should be used only as a last resort where other measures have proved unsuccessful. Our policy is to encourage voluntary re-occupation of empty homes but this can only work well where there is realistic compulsion to back them up. EDMOs provide this compulsion and should therefore be a key component of a council's comprehensive empty property strategy.</p>
	<p pid="e.1160W.8/3">Since the legislation was introduced, the number of properties empty for longer than six months has fallen by 4 per cent. from 282,461 to 271,252.</p>

	<p pid="e.1163W.5/2">We have recently amended the Housing and Regeneration Bill, to make it explicit that the object of the Homes and Communities Agency related to contributing to the achievement of good design specifically includes reference to design which has due regard to the needs of both elderly and disabled persons.</p>
	<p pid="e.1163W.5/3">We will expect the HCA to promote well designed quality homes and places by using industry benchmarks in conjunction with recognised public sector standards. The standards adopted will include social, economic, environmental and physical measures of design and performance, building on the work of English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation. They will apply equally to the private and public sector activity in which the HCA engages, covering regeneration and housing, existing places and new places. We will also expect the HCA to consult widely about their proposed approach to quality before adopting specific measures.</p>

	<p pid="e.1167W.2/1">&quot;Strong and Prosperous Communities&mdash;The Local Government White Paper&quot; was published in October 2006. The White Paper set out the Government's commitment to reform of local public services and builds on earlier progress in improving the quality of local services to turn reform into lasting transformation.</p>
	<p pid="e.1167W.2/2">The White Paper includes a large number of commitments. The vast majority of actions are proceeding to plan. These include the successful negotiations of all 150 Local Area Agreements (LAAs) which were signed-off on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-30">30 June 2008</phrase>, the agreement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-14">14 July 2008</phrase> of the first seven Multi-Area Agreements (MAAs), and the implementation of nine new unitary councils, which Parliament has approved, which is on track for <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="e.1167W.2/3">There are three areas which have taken longer to implement than the estimated timetable set out in the November 2007 Implementation Plan. These are:</p>
	<p pid="e.1167W.2/4" class="indent">the Councillor Call for Action and new overview and scrutiny powers. We are working with key stakeholders to implement in a coherent fashion changes to overview and scrutiny arrangements flowing both from the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 and the Police and Justice Act 2006&mdash;including the Councillor Call for Action, for which we are currently analysing the response to a consultation exercise which closed in March. We will work with the Local Government Association to issue guidance on this later this year. We will consult shortly on implementation of the overview and scrutiny powers.</p>
	<p pid="e.1167W.2/5" class="indent">extending the power to promote well-being to eligible parish councils. We are consulting stakeholders on secondary legislation and related guidance, with commencement scheduled before the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="e.1167W.2/6" class="indent">we will also give local authorities the power to deal with local problems both by making certain byelaws without confirmation from the Secretary of State and by enforcing them with fixed penalty notices. A consultation exercise will be launched shortly and the intention is for these provisions to be in place by the end of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="e.1167W.2/7">A further version of the White Paper Implementation Plan will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="e.1171W.8/3">DEFRA estimates that there are around 7.3 million households with fillable but unfilled cavities in 2008, plus around 800,000 households with cavities that are difficult or impossible to fill. This implies that around 54 per cent. of cavity homes in GB had cavity insulation at March 2008. It is anticipated that around 2.9 million additional cavities will be filled during the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target programme, which runs from 2008-11.</p>

	<p pid="e.1172W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="e.1172W.2/2">Tank insulation is one of the approved measures in the Energy Efficiency Commitment. The independent review commissioned by DEFRA on EEC1 (2002-05) estimated that around 195,000 tanks were insulated by this programme, which is an average of 65,000 per year.</p>
	<p pid="e.1172W.2/3">Ofgem is due to report on the second phase of the Energy Efficiency Commitment (2005-08) on <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-01">1 August 2008</phrase>. The headline report will probably not contain information on tank insulation, as this is not a major measure, however, DEFRA is commissioning a detailed study of EEC2 measures, to be completed by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="e.1172W.2/4">The Thermal Insulation Updates for 2004 and 2005 (which apply to England only) states that around 2 per cent. of tanks were uninsulated in 2003 and around 1.5 per cent. were uninsulated in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="e.1172W.2/5">Note also that the increasing market for combination boilers means that there are fewer hot water tanks to insulate.</p>

	<p pid="e.1173W.5/3">As part of the Equality Impact Assessment, we have provided an estimate of the proportion of housing benefit and council tax benefit case loads affected by the proposals to reduce the backdating facilities to three months. There are, however, important caveats to these estimates which must be noted.</p>
	<p pid="e.1173W.5/4">A copy of the Equality Impact Assessment has been placed in the Library. It is also available on the Department for Work and Pensions website at:</p>
	<p pid="e.1173W.5/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/resourcecentre/PC-HB-CTB-EIA-Apr08.pdf">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/resourcecentre/PC-HB-CTB-EIA-Apr08.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="e.1173W.5/6">Figures on the number of successful backdating claims are derived from the Single Housing Benefit Extract (HBSD-IAD scan). The backdating variable in the Single Housing Benefit Extract was introduced relatively recently in April 2007 and accordingly we have no means of corroborating the data's robustness against historical data. Furthermore, given that the data only go back six months, we currently have an insufficient pool of evidence to derive reliable figures from the data. These concerns should be allayed with time as the scan data improve.</p>
	<p pid="e.1173W.5/7">Based on the first six months of data available, it is estimated that approximately 0.2 per cent. of new housing benefit and council tax benefit claims would be affected by a reduction in the backdating period to three months. These figures may be subject to revision as more data become available.</p>

	<p pid="e.1175W.0/7" class="indent">The Child Support Agency, in line with other government departments and agencies, uses the standard Civil Service grade structure. The Agency's managers are distributed across the six traditional Civil Service management grades: Executive Officer, Higher and Senior Executive Officer, Unified Grades 7 and 6 and the Senior Civil Service.</p>
	<p pid="e.1175W.0/8" class="indent">These grades include both management and a variety of non-managerial, specialist roles. An analysis of the information that the Agency holds on the number of people within these grades with job titles suggesting managerial responsibility reveals that there are presently around 800 people employed either as 'managers', 'directors' or 'area heads', and a further 700 people employed as 'team leaders'. These figures do also include a number of specialist and professional roles which may not include people management.</p>

	<p pid="e.1177W.0/1">Poverty is a complex and multidimensional issue and, as such there are many possible measures of poverty. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that low income is central to any poverty measurement. Definitions of low income households are set out in the annual National Statistics publication 'Households Below Average Income'. This reports numbers of individuals in households below or persistently below 50 per cent., 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median household income before and after deducting housing costs.</p>
	<p pid="e.1177W.0/2">If there were 100 per cent take-up of the main income-related benefits by everyone in the population entitled to claim them, it is estimated that the number of children below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income would fall by around 200,000 before housing costs are taken into account and 100,000 on an after housing costs basis, based on 2008-09 benefit rates. Corresponding estimates are not available for 90 per cent. take-up, nor for 100 per cent. take-up of individual benefits.</p>
	<p pid="e.1177W.0/3">We have made good progress on tackling child poverty. We continue to develop strategies to support parents into work and progress in work, because we know that work is the best route out of poverty&mdash;providing increased incomes and better opportunities for people and their families. Our specialised schemes will ensure the long-term unemployed get the individualised support they need.</p>

	<p pid="e.1179W.0/2">The Department runs pilots to test the effectiveness of different approaches to service provision in achieving results and in improving the customer experience. The decision on where these pilots are operated is based on a number of different criteria. These can include the type and location of the service being tested, the customer group involved, and the location of other pilots already under way. The decision on the location of a pilot also takes account of the need to ensure the customer base is sufficiently large to make the results of the pilot meaningful. Any pilot testing a service in Wales includes testing service provision in the Welsh language. Pilots that have been run in Wales include Pathways to Work in Bridgend, Rhondda, Cynon and Taff; Swansea Bay, West Wales; and Eastern Valleys; and new deal plus for lone parents in Cardiff.</p>

	<p pid="e.1186W.5/1">The specific information requested is not available.</p>
	<p pid="e.1186W.5/2">Since the introduction of pension credit the number of pensioners with incomes below 60 per cent. of median income after deducting housing costs, have fallen by 500,000. The proposal to change the length of time allowed for customers to claim pension credit (known as backdating) from 12 to three months is part of a further package of pensions measures that will make claiming benefit entitlements simpler and less intrusive and deliver extra support to low-income pensioners. This package includes the introduction of a more automatic claims process for housing benefit and council tax benefit claims made over the phone with pension credit claims, which will benefit around 50,000 pensioners over the comprehensive spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="e.1186W.5/3">Tackling pensioner poverty is a priority. We will continue to strive to ensure that older people are aware of, and take up their entitlements through initiatives such as: sophisticated data matching to identify eligible non-recipients, home visits for vulnerable customers, local and national advertising and media campaigns, a simple and straight-forward claim process and ever closer working with partner organisations.</p>

	<p pid="e.1194W.5/2">A male median earner, who, from age 22 in 2012 to state pension age, works and saves in an occupational defined contribution pension at the minimum level set out under reform&mdash;4 per cent. from the individual, 1 per cent tax relief and 3 per cent. from the employer on banded earnings between around &pound;5,000 and &pound;33,000&mdash;can expect to receive a gross weekly private pension of around &pound;80 in today's earnings terms (roughly equivalent to the level of the basic state pension), and a total net weekly income of &pound;224. His replacement rate from saving would be 50 per cent., an improvement of around 15 percentage points from saving.</p>
	<p pid="e.1194W.5/3">A female median earner, with the same work and savings history, can expect to receive around &pound;55 gross weekly private pension, and a total net weekly income of &pound;202. Her replacement rate from saving would be 57 per cent., an improvement of around 12 percentage points from saving. Her replacement rate from the state pension system is higher than that of the previous example reflecting the fact that her state pension entitlement will be the same as that for the male median example, but the earnings with which they are compared will be lower.</p>
	<p pid="e.1194W.5/4">A male average earner, again with the same work and savings history, can expect to receive around &pound;72 gross weekly private pension, and a total net weekly income of &pound;216. The replacement rate from saving would be 53 per cent., an improvement of around 14 percentage points from saving.</p>
	<p pid="e.1194W.5/5" class="indentitalic"> Note:</p>
	<p pid="e.1194W.5/6" class="indent">These examples assume male median earnings of &pound;24,440, female median earnings of &pound;19,240 and average earnings of &pound;22,360. For all examples, an annual management charge of 0.5 per cent, and phasing over a three year period are assumed. The whole of the pension pot is annuitised using gender-specific RPI-linked annuities for the male and female earners and a male RPI-linked annuity for the average earner. All figures are in 2007-08 earnings terms. The replacement rates shown are higher than the 45 per cent targeted by the Pensions Commission for lifetime median earners as they refer to saving from age 22 rather than from around age 30 as used by the Pensions Commission.</p>

Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br/> 4. The reference period for Household Below Average Income figures is single financial years.<br/> 5. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &quot;equivalised&quot;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br/> 6. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br/> 7. Figures have been presented on both a Before Housing Cost and After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Cost they are.<br/> 8. The Government's preferred measures of low income for pensioners are based on incomes measured after housing costs. Measuring income on an after housing costs basis is appropriate, as two thirds of pensioners own their property outright and so face lower housing costs to meet from their current income while still deriving value from their home. This is different to the current working age population and to the situation for pensioners in the past. Considering pensioners' incomes compared to others after deducting housing costs allows for more meaningful comparisons of income between working age people and pensioners, and between pensioners over time<br/> 9. As part of PSA Delivery Agreement 17 three indicators of low income poverty will be monitored: the percentage of pensioners below 60 per cent. contemporary median income, 50 per cent median income and 60 per cent. of 1998-99 median income uprated in line with prices.<br/> 10.

	<p pid="e.1202W.8/2">If there were 100 per cent. take up of the main income-related benefits by everyone in the population entitled to claim them, it is estimated that the number of children below 60 per cent. of contemporary median income would fall by around 200,000 before housing costs are taken into account and 100,000 on an after housing costs basis, based on 2008-09 benefit rates.</p>

	<p pid="e.1203W.2/1">Specific information regarding low income for the UK is available in &quot;Households Below Average Income 1994-95 to 2006-07&quot;. This annual report, which is a National Statistics publication, includes the numbers and proportions of pensioners with incomes below 50 per cent., 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median income, and the proportions in persistent poverty.</p>
	<p pid="e.1203W.2/2">Information covering 40 per cent. of median income is not presented in the Households Below Average Income series as it is an unreliable measure of poverty. This is because households stating the lowest incomes to the Family Resources Survey may not actually have the lowest living standards. Many people who report very low incomes appear to have high spending. Hence any statistics on numbers in this group may be misleading. It is also the case that the Institute for Fiscal Studies in their 'Poverty and Inequality in the UK: 2008' report (June 2008) have said</p>
	<p pid="e.1203W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;Levels of material deprivation generally fall as incomes rise, but children in households with less than 40 per cent. of median income&mdash;so-called 'severe' poverty&mdash;are, on average, less deprived than those in households with between 40 per cent. and 60 per cent. of median income. This reinforces existing concerns that households with the lowest recorded incomes in HBAI are not those with the lowest living standards.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.1203W.2/4">Some types of minimal income households include:</p>
	<p pid="e.1203W.2/5" class="indent">Under-recording of very fragmented incomes. If a household draws on a high number of different income sources, some may be omitted from their survey responses.</p>
	<p pid="e.1203W.2/6" class="indent">Some households will have transitional periods of low income, being between (possibly well paid) jobs at the precise time of survey interview or being self-employed where incomes can vary greatly from year to year. Older households could be waiting to receive a private or company pension, awaiting the outcome of a benefits claim or be in probate after a partner has died.</p>
	<p pid="e.1203W.2/7" class="indent">There will also be some households who are drawing on savings to cope with perhaps a longer period of minimal incomes.</p>
	<p pid="e.1203W.2/8" class="indent">Finally, there will be some households who are genuinely having to cope on very low incomes, and perhaps be getting into debt to maintain levels of expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="e.1203W.2/9">Only the final two categories are genuinely low-income, and evidence is that statistics covering below 40 per cent. of median income include a mix of all four categories.</p>
	<p pid="e.1203W.2/10">The information given in the following table should therefore be treated with caution.</p>

Data for Northern Ireland have only been collected since 2002-03, so the information shown is for the United Kingdom from 2002-03 to 2006-07, and for Great Britain for 1997-98 to 2001-02.<br/> 3. Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br/> 4. The reference period for Household Below Average Income figures is single financial years.<br/> 5. This response includes a lower income threshold of 40 per cent. of the contemporary median income. The data for households with an income lower than 50 per cent. of median are not considered to be accurate as an indicator of living standards. Many of these households while having very low incomes would not be considered poor, but who do genuinely have few sources of income in the short-run. These figures are not National Statistics and caution must be applied because those people stating the lowest incomes in the FRS may not actually have the lowest living standards.<br/> 6. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &quot;equivalised&quot;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br/> 7. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br/> 8. Figures have been presented on both a before housing cost and after housing cost basis. For before housing cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for after housing cost they are.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="e.1203W.2/28"> <td colspan="7">9. The Government's preferred measures of low income for pensioners are based on incomes measured after housing costs. Measuring income on an after housing costs basis is appropriate, as two thirds of pensioners own their property outright and so face lower housing costs to meet from their current income while still deriving value from their home. This is different to the current working age population and to the situation for pensioners in the past. Considering pensioners' incomes compared to others after deducting housing costs allows for more meaningful comparisons of income between working age people and pensioners, and between pensioners over time.<br/> 10. As part of PSA Delivery Agreement 17 three indicators of low income poverty will be monitored: the percentage of pensioners below 60 per cent. contemporary median income, 50 per cent. median income and 60 per cent. of 1998-99 median income uprated in line with prices.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Households Below Average Income, DWP</td> </tr>

	<p pid="e.1206W.2/1">The Department for Work and Pensions was formed in June 2001 and no data are available prior to that date. At that time the compulsory retirement age for the Department was 65 for those below the senior civil service grades.

This was formalised in October 2006 when the Department removed its retirement age altogether for employees below the senior civil service grades. Employees can retire, if they wish, when they reach civil service minimum pension age. For most employees that is age 60, but they are not obliged to retire on reaching that age.</p>
	<p pid="e.1206W.2/3">Until October 2006 the mandatory retirement age for senior civil servants was 60. After this date it was raised to 65, where it currently remains. No employees at senior civil service grades in the Department have been asked to retire on reaching age 65.</p>

It is important that these decision are free from political and Government influence.</p>

At that appeal the applicants' solicitors were invited to submit further information to have their appeal reconsidered, but they chose not to do this. No further application for an MPA associated with Vioxx has since been received.

	<p pid="e.1222W.2/2">There is a clear process in place at the ICO for ensuring that individuals seconded to the ICO will not handle complaints from their own Department. A line manager who works for the ICO will allocate freedom of information complaints to the secondees from Government Departments who will be working at the ICO. The line manager will ensure that the secondees do not handle complaints involving their home Department. A permanent member of the ICO's staff will oversee the work of secondees and in conjunction with the ICO policy team will ensure consistency. Secondees will not be authorised to sign decision notices. Only senior established ICO employees can sign notices.</p>

	<p pid="e.1236W.2/19">The independent Sentencing Guidelines Council's Magistrates Court Sentencing Guidelines for possession of a bladed article (to be implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-04">4 August 2008</phrase>) states that if the bladed weapon is not used to threaten or cause fear the recommended starting point is a high level community order. If there are mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the guideline suggests a range of a Band C fine (125 to 175 per cent. of weekly income) to 12 weeks custody. Where the weapon was not used to threaten or cause fear but the offence was committed in dangerous circumstances, the suggested starting point is six weeks custody, with a range of a high level community order to referral to the Crown Court. Where the weapon was used to threaten or cause fear and the offence was committed in dangerous circumstances the guideline states that the case should be allocated to the Crown Court.</p>

	<p pid="e.1247W.0/2">Prison population figures are published every Friday. The total prison population for England and Wales on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-18">Friday 18 July</phrase> was 83,610.

Useable operational capacity is the total number of prisoners that the estate can readily be expected to hold.

	<p pid="e.1248W.5/1">There are currently no plans to conduct a review of the cost of telephones calls made from prisons. The National Offender Management Service continues to discuss the cost of calls with the providers but they are not contractually obliged to reduce the cost. To do this without their agreement would require a large subsidy from the taxpayer. The current contract is in place until 2011 and the re-tendering project will commence this year. Reasonable call prices for prisoners will form part of the requirements of the new contract. However, we are implementing reductions for some international calls as part of an extension to a contract with a third party supplier.</p>

	<p pid="e.1248W.11/5">These data are on the principal offence basis. The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>

Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>

	<p pid="e.1251W.5/1">The initial planned opening date for the Supreme Court was October 2008. This was reviewed once detailed survey work and planning conditions were finalised. The amount of work required and the quality of refurbishment necessary would not have been possible in that time-frame. It was announced in March 2006 that the Supreme Court would therefore open in October 2009 to ensure there would be no encroachment into judicial hearing time.</p>

	<p pid="e.1253W.0/1">While no specific assessment has been made of the length of time taken to transfer money between young offender institutions, the timings are dependant on where the offender is transferring to and from. For example, if the money being transferred is between public prisons, then it is processed as an electronic transfer and will be actioned overnight. When a transfer takes place to other types of establishments such as contracted-out prisons or immigration detention centres (for those over 18), the money would be transferred by cheque which would be subject to the normal cheque clearing process operated by the banking system.</p>

All those interviewed by police must be informed of their right to non-means-tested legal advice. A young person under 17 must also have an 'appropriate adult' with them when interviewed by the police; this could be a parent, guardian, social or health care professional.</p>
	<p pid="e.1253W.6/2">If a youth appears before court, legal representation is provided free of charge subject to the youth passing the 'Interests of Justice' test. If a youth does not have their own solicitor, the court duty solicitor can provide free advice and, if appropriate, representation.</p>
	<p pid="e.1253W.6/3">While in the vast majority of cases, youths are properly represented at court, the Government are currently exploring how youth defendants can be made better aware of their rights to advice and representation. It is also carrying out additional research to assess whether there are any vulnerable youths going without representation, and if so, to identify appropriate remedies.</p>

	<p pid="e.1254W.2/2">There are no current proposals to transfer child detention budgets to local authorities. The youth crime action plan sets out proposals to make local authorities responsible for the full cost of court-ordered secure remand. They are already responsible for the placement and for one third of the costs where the secure estate is used and the full cost where alternative provision is used. We are consulting on this proposal and will have further discussions with local government representatives as part of that process and prior to any final decisions.</p>

(218826)</p>
	<p pid="e.1262W.0/4" class="indent">The closest available approximation to the percentage of voter registration is the number of people who are registered to vote in the local/European elections as a percent of the estimated usually resident population age 18 and over.</p>
	<p pid="e.1262W.0/5" class="indent">The proxy percentages should not be interpreted as the percentage of the eligible population who are registered to vote. They may be an under estimates in some areas because not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote, for example foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth are not eligible.</p>
	<p pid="e.1262W.0/6" class="indent">Conversely, for other areas rates exceed one hundred per cent as figures for the registered electorate may be inflated. People who have more than one address may register in more than one place (e.g. students may register at parental and term-time addresses) and electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or died.</p>
	<p pid="e.1262W.0/7" class="indent">Bearing these caveats in mind the highest, average and lowest percentage of voter registration in local authority areas in England, for 2006, are 101.9%, 96.5% and 68.6% respectively. 2006 is the most recent year that estimates of the usually resident population are available.</p>

	<p pid="e.1264W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what the estimated average <i> (a)</i> monthly and <i> (b)</i> annual food bills for families in England and Wales were in each of the last three years (i) in total and (ii) broken down by region (220593).</p>
	<p pid="e.1264W.2/4" class="indent">Estimates of household expenditure appear in the annual ONS publication Family Spending. The following table shows the estimates of household spending on food and non-alcoholic drink for England, English regions and for Wales, as they have appeared in the last three editions of Family Spending. These estimates exclude spending on food and drink in cafes, restaurants, and pubs, as well as take away food and snack food which are all classified as catering services.</p>
	<p pid="e.1264W.2/5" class="indent">The estimates published in Family Spending are based on data collected through the Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS), which is a sample survey, covering approximately 6,000 households in the United Kingdom. Estimates for regions are normally based on data collected over three years, and estimates based on data for the periods 2002-03 to 2004-05, and 2003-04 to 2005-06 have been provided in the following table. Starting with the most recent edition of Family Spending, Family Spending 2007, which published data for 2006, estimates are now published for calendar years, and rather than calculate an average of data from financial and calendar years, regional estimates in Family Spending 2007 were based solely on data collected in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="e.1265W.5/4" class="indent">Death certificates record the place where a person dies, but not where any infections may have been acquired.

The remit of the programme was to place service users and carers at the heart of any new service model and build on the strengths of the third and private sector. The overall aim was to develop a new high quality system for delivering equipment which would give those supported by the state the sort of choice and control they have not previously enjoyed. Responsibility for assessment if need remains with local health and social care commissioners.</p>

The core offer comprises a varied menu of activities in primary and secondary schools; high quality childcare 8 am to 6 pm 48 weeks a year in primary schools; parenting support; swift and easy access to a wide range of specialist support services such as health and social care; and wider community access to ICT, sports and arts facilities, including adult learning.</p>

	<p pid="e.1291W.1/1">Our key priority is to personalise learning by focusing on each pupil's progression so that every child achieves their potential. Our renewed literacy strategy builds on Sir Jim Rose's independent review of the teaching of early reading by putting phonics at the heart of 'teaching reading in order to help to raise attainment levels amongst all pupils.</p>
	<p pid="e.1291W.1/2">The review found that there was a wide range of expert support and guidance available to help schools match provision to need regarding the teaching of literacy.</p>
	<p pid="e.1291W.1/3">Through the national strategies we will continue to encourage teachers to apply inclusive principles to address issues of accessibility, including the needs of children with severe sensory impairment such as deafness.</p>
	<p pid="e.1291W.1/4">The primary national strategy and other partners provide a range of intervention programmes to help those children who struggle most in reading and writing. These include the Every Child a Reader and Every Child a Writer programmes. The former provides intensive one to one support in reading for five and six year olds, the latter is a new pilot currently under development but will include one-to-one intervention in years three and four in the areas of writing that children find hardest to master.</p>
	<p pid="e.1291W.1/5">Extra help is available for those children who need it to prevent them from falling behind: we provide early literacy support (ELS&mdash;year 1), Y3 literacy support (Y3LS) and further literacy support (FLS&mdash;year 5). These three packages are designed to help those children who, without additional help would not reach level 4 at the end of year 6.</p>

	<p pid="e.1296W.2/2">We are not aware of any specific research into the effect of stress caused by bullying in schools. However, we are aware that many external studies link being bullied to outcomes such as anxiety, depression, lowered self-esteem and, in extreme cases, suicide. The Anti-Bullying Alliance has carried out a number of research projects on behalf of my Department around various aspects of bullying, and the findings have informed our wider work to prevent and tackle this happening in schools.

	<p pid="e.1298W.5/1">Violence to school staff is rare but any incident is one too many. We have therefore made it clear that head teachers may permanently exclude pupils for violence, even for a first offence. We are also helping to reduce the risk of violence through a national programme to strengthen schools' capacity to manage pupils' behaviour. This includes giving schools access to specialist training and advice, strengthening their legal powers to discipline pupils, reaffirming their legal power to use reasonable force to restrain pupils, giving them legal power to search pupils for weapons and encouraging them to form safer school partnerships that base police officers in schools. Sir Alan Steer is advising on how the programme could be further strengthened.</p>

These figures were produced before the apprenticeships review and were on a different basis from the starts measure that is now the agreed measure following that review. For the 2009-10 LSC grant letter and LSC statement of priorities, due to be published later this year, we will be revisiting the planned figures for apprenticeships on the agreed basis of starts and ensuring that our apprenticeship trajectory matches the ambition that we set out in world-class apprenticeships.

While levels in 2006-07 are lower than in the past five years it is too early to draw conclusions about trends. The labour force survey shows that adults with a degree in computing have the 4th highest employment rates.</p>

The ITMB degree framework helps prepare undergraduates for the changing role of the IT professional by providing them with the technology and business skills employers need. E-skills are also supporting activity in schools such as the 14-19 diploma in information technology and computer clubs for girls which improve the information available to pupils and can help drive demand for computer science courses.</p>

Five per cent. of e-skills employers have skills-shortage vacancies, the same as the UK average.

The specification for those contracts put in place a detailed requirement for the delivery of learning that has led to 55 per cent. of learners in the 2006/07 academic year completing their learning aims, which represents a significant achievement at a time when the prison service is facing real challenges in terms of overcrowding and the consequent need to move prisoners around the estate.

Funding for offender learning has more than trebled since the predecessors of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the Department for Children, Schools and Families took responsibility for offender learning in 2001 and is expected to exceed &pound;170 million in 2008-09. We have introduced heads of learning and skills in prisons to take day to day responsibility for managing the learning and skills. Prisons are now subject to the same inspection arrangements as the rest of the further education sector, delivered by Ofsted and Estyn. Inspection outcomes are improving and the proportion of failed inspections are falling to similar levels as those in community adult learning settings. In England we have given responsibility for planning and funding offender learning to the Learning and Skills Council, operating collaboratively with the National Offender Management Service in commissioning the service to be delivered. Since the Learning and Skills Council took responsibility for the service, participation rates have risen from an estimated 36 per cent. in the 2006-07 academic year to 39 per cent. in the August 2007 to May 2008. Similar arrangements apply in Wales, with the director of offender management Wales playing a significant role in planning the service.</p>
	<p pid="e.1306W.2/3">We are continuing to drive forward the agenda of attainment and employment through the programme of activity set out in 'Reducing Re-offending Through Skills and Employment: Next Steps' (December 2006) with two test bed regions (the west midlands and the east of England) trialling the plans set out in the document, ready for implementation from summer 2009.</p>

	<p pid="e.1306W.5/2">Detailed arrangements for the support offered to individual trainee educational psychologists (EPs) are matters for local determination between the host local authority, the trainee and training provider.</p>
	<p pid="e.1306W.5/3">Under the current postgraduate grant scheme for educational psychology training places, administered by the Children's Workforce Development Council, trainees receive a bursary of &pound;14,500 (&pound;14,900 with London weighting) in their the first year. Arrangements vary for years two and three depending on what has been agreed regionally.</p>
	<p pid="e.1306W.5/4">Where trainees are employed as trainee EPs, they are entitled to the same services and allowances as any other employees of the local authority, including being able to claim back expenses. Where trainees are on bursaries, local authorities are not necessarily bound by the same obligations. Some training providers are making provision to cover trainees' expenses, up to a fixed amount, where they receive a bursary.</p>
	<p pid="e.1306W.5/5">The CWDC will keep the current arrangements under review in the light of operational experience.</p>

	<p pid="e.1309W.5/39">Higher education is one of the most important investments a young person can make as graduates earn, on average, far more than people with A-levels or similar who do not go in to higher education. Over the working life, the average graduate will earn comfortably over &pound;100,000 more, after tax and in today's valuation, than a similar individual who completed their education with two or more A-levels.</p>
	<p pid="e.1309W.5/40">In recent years we have reformed student finance, offering improvements to both full-time and part-time students. For new entrants to full-time higher education in 2008/09 we have increased the means-testing threshold below which students are entitled to a full maintenance grant up from &pound;17,910 for entrants in 2007/08 to &pound;25,000. The threshold for a partial grant will increase from &pound;38,330 for entrants in 2007/08 to &pound;60,005. These thresholds relate to household income. This will mean that one third of all eligible students in England entering higher education in the academic year 2008/09 are expected to be entitled to a full non-repayable grant worth &pound;2,835 and another one third are expected to be entitled to a partial grant of between &pound;50 and &pound;2,835. Due to these reforms, by 2011 the number of students receiving some level of grant will increase by around 100,000. As part of this change, an extra 50,000 students will receive a full grant.</p>
	<p pid="e.1309W.5/41">In 2006 grants towards part time students' fees were increased by 27 per cent. with an additional &pound;40 million of institutional funding to higher education institutions to encourage participation from the most under-represented groups.</p>
	<p pid="e.1309W.5/42">Latest figures from UCAS, covering applicants to full-time undergraduate courses only, show that, after the small downturn in 2006, applicants who were accepted for entry in 2007 increased. For accepted applicants from the UK, figures show a rise of 5.5 per cent. to 364,500, with those from England showing a 6.1 per cent. rise to 307,000, the highest ever, and those from Wales up 1.3 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="e.1309W.5/43">Latest figures for students applying for entry in 2008, show as at the end of June, applicants to full-time undergraduate courses show a year-on-year rise of 6.5 per cent. with those from England up by 7.3 per cent. and those from Wales up by 4.9 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="e.1311W.5/2">The Department works closely with other Government Departments, including the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, to improve patients' access to beneficial new treatments and medical technologies. The contribution that innovative medical technologies can make to the delivery of modern health and social care services was recognised as part of Lord Darzi's report on the NHS Next Stage Review &quot;High Quality Care For All&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-30">30 June 2008</phrase>. As a result, the Department is working across Government and with the medical technology industry to develop a strategy which promotes uptake of clinically and cost effective innovative products throughout the care pathway. A copy of the Next Stage Review has already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="e.1311W.5/3">Regarding stoma and urology items that are dispensed in primary care, mechanisms are in place to assess innovation when a supplier seeks to have an item listed in the Drug Tariff. Similar mechanisms would apply to single-line items.</p>
	<p pid="e.1311W.5/4">The Department is seeking best value for money from the expenditure it makes in all areas of healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="e.1311W.5/5">In Secondary Care, buyers procure goods and services via a tendering process. Consequently, market forces will drive a level of competition amongst suppliers who wish to secure NHS contracts.</p>
	<p pid="e.1311W.5/6">Regarding the provision of stoma and urology items in primary care, the Department recently published an impact assessment (IA) alongside the consultation entitled &quot;Proposed new arrangements under Part IX of the Drug Tariff for the provision of stoma and urology appliances&mdash;and related services&mdash;in Primary Care&quot; June 2008. The IA considers the impact of the proposals set out in the consultation and includes a robust competition impact. A copy of the IA has already been placed in the Library.</p>

Draft terms of reference for the review were published in January 2004. Ahead of that there are a number of pressing questions about what Government and universities should do over the next 10 to 15 years to ensure we have a world class system of higher education, it is on these questions that Government, universities and others should now focus.</p>

We have no plans to change the way in which the assessment of such students is carried out.</p>
	<p pid="e.1317W.0/3">Students who claim to be estranged from their parents are required to provide sufficient evidence for their local authority (LA) to determine that the estrangement does exist and is permanent. For each subsequent year for which such a student applies for support; the LA has to satisfy itself that the estrangement still persists.</p>
	<p pid="e.1317W.0/4">The financial assessment for single independent students (i.e. they do not have a husband, wife, civil partner or cohabiting partner of either sex) is based on the student's own income only. The core student support package for such a student with an income of up to &pound;18,360 (or up to &pound;25,000 for new students starting their studies from 2008/09) studying outside London comprises: a non means-tested tuition fee loan of up to &pound;3,145; a means-tested maintenance grant of &pound;2,835; and a loan for maintenance of up to &pound;4,625. Students who are in receipt of the full maintenance grant and who are being charged the maximum &pound;3,145 tuition fee are also eligible for an institutional bursary of at least &pound;310.</p>
	<p pid="e.1317W.0/5">Extra support is available for disadvantaged students trough non means-tested disabled students allowances and means-tested childcare grant, adult dependant grant and parents learning allowance, in addition, students may also be able to apply to their university or college for support from its access to learning fund for students experiencing particular financial hardship.</p>

	<p pid="e.1317W.3/2">The student loan interest rate for the year from <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September 2007</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-31">31 August 2008</phrase> was confirmed by officials during August 2007 as the rate to apply for the forthcoming academic year for both types of student loan.</p>
	<p pid="e.1317W.3/3">In accordance with the requirements of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, the SLC publishes details of the forthcoming change in the interest rate payable for pre-1998 mortgage style (MS) Student Loans before the new rate takes effect on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-01">1 September</phrase> each year. There is no similar requirement for advance notification for the current income contingent repayment (ICR) student loans which have a low interest rate exemption from arrangements governing consumer credit agreements. ICR statements are issued in September each year for those borrowers whose loans are not yet in repayment. For ICR borrowers who are in repayment, statements are issued after receipt of a file from HMRC. Thus, there is no specific timescale for the issue of these statements but, for the majority, these are issued between September and December.</p>
	<p pid="e.1317W.3/4">However, the SLC publishes notices of the change of interest rates affecting all student loan borrowers in national newspapers before <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-01">1 September</phrase> each year. The change is also published on the SLC's and Government websites.</p>
	<p pid="e.1317W.3/5">Borrowers with MS loans are individually informed of the change by the SLC and private sector debt owners before <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-01">1 September</phrase>. This is important as a change in interest rate for these borrowers changes the payments they are required to make. Borrowers with ICR loans receive notification of the change with their annual statements. While any change in the interest rate applied affects the overall balance of the outstanding loan, it does not alter the income-related repayments of these borrowers.</p>

The brokerage service has played an important part in the development of Train to Gain. It has helped engage a high proportion of hard to reach employers, many of which are small businesses. Satisfaction with brokerage is high, at 80 per cent., and recent evaluations show that employers particularly value the local knowledge and impartiality of the brokerage service in helping them source high-quality training.</p>
	<p pid="e.1318W.5/3">In the financial year 2006/07 34,000 employers engaged with Train to Gain, of which around half were engaged by skills brokers. The vast majority of employers engaged by brokers will have gone on to receive Train to Gain funding to help them invest in the skills of their employees. Detailed figures are not readily available on the proportion of employees who began learning programmes in Train to Gain who worked for employers engaged by skills brokers.</p>

All of these animals were used for marine biotoxin testing.</p>
	<p pid="e.1320W.6/2">Section 5.4 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 requires the Secretary of State to weigh the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned against the benefits likely to accrue as a result of the programme to be specified in the licence. In the case of testing for the presence of marine biotoxins, the benefits of such testing are the protection of public health by ensuring that consumers are not exposed to biotoxins present in molluscan shellfish. In view of this, we have no plan to revoke or amend any project licences that have been granted authorising marine biotoxins testing. However, the Home Office is committed to the replacement of both the PSP and DSP bioassays. To this end, Home Office officials are working closely with the Food Standards Agency, as competent authority for food safety, and those contracted by them to perform routine monitoring for shellfish toxins, to progress replacements.</p>

	<p pid="e.1321W.2/3">It is not possible to separately identify prosecutions taking place in (i) local authority area and (ii) basic command units within police force areas in England and Wales from the information reported to the Ministry of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="e.1321W.2/4">These data are on the principal offence basis. The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>

	<p pid="e.1329W.2/1">Engaging and involving young people in local crime reduction strategies is important, as they are often the group most concerned about crime and are disproportionately victims of crime.</p>
	<p pid="e.1329W.2/2">The Government make it clear in the policing Green Paper that neighbourhood policing teams should always include young people in their consultations about policing priorities and also make every effort to engage hard to reach groups.</p>
	<p pid="e.1329W.2/3">We encourage all aspects of youth engagement and encourage all police forces authorities and forces to make every effort to consult with and work in partnership with young people, both through adapting existing examples of good practice and developing new ones. We recognise that approaches will differ according to local circumstances and support partnerships between the police and other agencies where there is a coordinated approach to engaging and involving young people.</p>
	<p pid="e.1329W.2/4">Police forces are already engaging positively with young people, for example by way of safer schools partnerships. SSPs are a successful mechanism for ensuring joint working between schools and police, with a dedicated police officer attached to a school, and liaising closely with the pupils. There are now about 500 SSPs of one form or another. Evaluations have shown that they are proving effective in improving behaviour and attendance, developing strong and positive relationships between the police and young people, and to help young people develop a sense of being part of the local community.</p>
	<p pid="e.1329W.2/5">The youth crime action plan, published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-15">15 July</phrase>, includes a number of additional ways in which the police will be working proactively with and for with young people includes:</p>
	<p pid="e.1329W.2/6" class="indent">Expansion of safer schools partnerships (see above).</p>
	<p pid="e.1329W.2/7" class="indent">Increase after school patrols in the locality of the school and transport hubs. This is not only intended to reduce criminal and antisocial behaviour in these areas, but also to help young people feel safer, and able to interact positively with the police.</p>
	<p pid="e.1329W.2/8" class="indent">Using existing child protection legislation to ensure young people on the street at night are taken to a safe place (Operation Stay Safe).</p>
	<p pid="e.1329W.2/9" class="indent">Establishing youth forums to address the carrying of knives by young people, including young people who have been directly involved or affected by knife crime.</p>
	<p pid="e.1329W.2/10">The YCAP also includes way of how we need to be responsive and accountable to young people to ensure they are involved in tackling youth crime and decisions that affect them and to improve the relationship between young people and the police. We will also listen to the views of young people themselves, ensuring that they can contribute to developing solutions not just feeling that they are seen as the problem.</p>
	<p pid="e.1329W.2/11">We welcome and encourage youth engagement and will continue to explore ways to achieve this. For example young people are regularly represented on the steering group of the YCAP, as their views are very important.</p>

Additional firms are approved and used as required on case by case basis to provide capacity over and above the contract. Owing to the commercial nature of these contracts, if we were to release the information requested on the financial value of each such contract, in each of the next five years this would be likely to prejudice the commercial interests of both the UK Border Agency and those companies with whom the UK Border Agency enters into contracts.

	<p pid="e.1350W.8/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-02">2 July 2008</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary laid a draft order that will, if approved by Parliament, proscribe Hezballah's military wing in substitution for the existing entry on the proscribed list, the 'Hezballah external security organisation'. Where allegations are made of links between a charity and terrorist activity, the Charity Commission for England and Wales will deal with them as an immediate priority. It is an operational matter for the police to investigate any allegations that money is being raised or used for terrorist purposes, and the Charity Commission will co-operate fully with the police and other agencies in such cases.</p>

	<p pid="e.1353W.0/2">Over the last 12 months we have drawn up plans for the biggest ever shake-up of Britain's border security. This year we will make the change.</p>
	<p pid="e.1353W.0/3">We have put in place fingerprint checks before we issue a visa anywhere in the world. We have already delivered 1.4 million sets of finger scans, generating over 14,000 hits and bringing to notice 1,255 cases of identity swaps.</p>
	<p pid="e.1353W.0/4">In February, we introduced large on the spot fines for employers who don't make the right checks. In financial year 2006-07, there were 15 successful prosecutions including cautions under section 8, and 21 so far this financial year.</p>
	<p pid="e.1353W.0/5">Last month we introduced the first stage of the points based system as part of a phased approach to manage the flow of migrants coming to the UK. Applicants under the points based system will earn points for their skills and the potential they show for economic success, competence in the English language and ability to support themselves and their dependents. It is a simple, transparent and objective process that enables us to ensure that only those migrants who benefit the UK can come here to work or study. So far over 1,800 applications have been received under tier 1, highly skilled migrant workers. Future tiers will include students, skilled workers, youth mobility and temporary workers.</p>
	<p pid="e.1353W.0/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April</phrase> we launched the UK Border Agency, an organisation of 25,000 staff, with a presence in 135 countries world-wide. The new agency will protect our border with single immigration and customs checks, tackle smuggling, immigration crime and border tax fraud, and implement fast and fair decisions.</p>
	<p pid="e.1353W.0/7">We have already had successes thanks to exporting the border. Airline liaison officers have assisted in preventing nearly 180,000 people boarding planes over the last five years. That's equivalent to about two jumbo jets a week. In 2007 our strengthening of cross channel border controls stopped 17,658 individual attempts to cross the channel illegally. Additionally at juxtaposed controls in France and Belgium we have refused over 6,000 people entry to the UK. This means the number of illegal immigrants arriving in Kent from juxtaposed locations has reduced by 86 per cent. since 2002.</p>

	<p pid="e.1354W.3/1">We have previously estimated that there are around 400,000 to 450,000 electronic and paper records, although this is difficult to assess accurately as many case records are dependants, duplicates or errors. This figure does not therefore equate to numbers of asylum applicants. Lin Homer is due to update the Home Affairs Select Committee shortly on the latest position in regard to progress.</p>

	<p pid="e.1356W.2/1">It is not possible to identify those offences that are knife-related from the data centrally collected on overall recorded crime. However, since April 2007, police forces have been providing the Home Office with aggregate data on serious violence (attempted murder, grevious bodily harm and robbery) involving knives and sharp instruments. Data relating to such offences recorded during 2007-08 were published in table 3.09 of the recent &quot;Crime in England and Wales 2007/08&quot; statistical bulletin. A breakdown by region is shown in table A. Information about the number of persons charged and number of offences detected, or 'cleared-up', by police cannot be provided as they are not collected on the new statistical return.</p>
	<p pid="e.1356W.2/2">Available data from the homicide index relates to offences currently recorded as homicide where the apparent method of killing was 'sharp instrument', as at <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-12">12 November 2007</phrase>. Table B shows the number of such offences recorded within each region in England and Wales in the years 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07, the number of these homicides with a current suspect and the number that have resulted in a homicide conviction. Figures for 2007-08 are scheduled to be published in January 2009.</p>

	<p pid="e.1358W.8/1">The total operating costs for the interview office network of 68 offices during June 2008 was &pound;2.4 million, which excludes the cost of depreciation of relevant set-up capital expenditure. There are a number of central costs within the &pound;2.4 million such as call centre appointments and IT maintenance that make it impossible to give meaningful comprehensive monthly costs for each individual office. A total of 32,792 interviews were carried out in the network during June resulting in an average cost per interview of &pound;73.19, just below the planned figure.</p>

	<p pid="e.1359W.0/1">Procedures and supporting systems for reporting lost, stolen and recovered British passports were introduced in December 2003. Since then the Identity and Passport Service has provided a range of management information on the number of passports that have been processed under these arrangements. In 2007 there were 251,751 reports of lost passports and 41,393 reports of stolen passports. In addition, 10,428 passports were reported under the &quot;other&quot; category, which includes those damaged or destroyed. The systems, however, do not capture specifically the age of the holder whose passport is reported lost or stolen.</p>

	<p pid="e.1370W.2/2">Since April there has been a neighbourhood policing team in every area&mdash;meeting the Government's commitment. Neighbourhood policing gives local communities a role in deciding policing priorities by working with them to identify and tackle local problems together, as well as providing a highly visible presence.</p>
	<p pid="e.1370W.2/3">Both Sir Ronnie Flanagan's review of policing and the Casey review 'Engaging Communities in Fighting Crime' contain recommendations about how best to embed neighbourhood policing and ensure communities have a say in how they are policed. In the forthcoming policing Green Paper the new police pledge will take forward many of the recommendations and will set out new national standards for the police service to ensure the public receive visible, accountable and responsive policing.</p>

	<p pid="e.1378W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="e.1378W.5/2">A persistent young offender (PYO) is a young person aged 10-17 who has been sentenced guilty by any criminal court in the UK on three or more separate occasions for one or more recordable offence, and within three years of the last sentencing occasion is subsequently arrested or has an information laid against them for a further recordable offence.</p>
	<p pid="e.1378W.5/3">This definition was designed to monitor the pledge to halve the average time from arrest to sentence for dealing with PYOs in England and Wales from 142 days in 1996 to 71 days. This pledge was first met over a full calendar year in 2002 and has been met in all but one calendar year since then. It is important to note that the definition was not designed to monitor overall levels of youth crime.</p>
	<p pid="e.1378W.5/4">Table 1 shows the number of PYOs, and the number of offences committed by them, for each police force area from 1997 to 2007.</p>
	<p pid="e.1378W.5/5">Young offenders are now being dealt with twice as quickly as they were prior to 1997, which means that there are much shorter intervals between sentencing occasions for those youths who repeatedly offend. Youth sentencing is therefore more timely, and for repeat offenders more frequent, than it used to be prior to 1997.</p>
	<p pid="e.1378W.5/6">Table 2 shows the total number of notifiable offences brought to justice, and the proportion of them that are attributable to PYOs, for each police force from 2000 to 2006 (the only years for which this data is available).</p>

	<p pid="e.1397W.3/1">HMRC's main channels for responding to public enquiries are through their telephone helplines and their network of enquiry centres.</p>
	<p pid="e.1397W.3/2">In 2007-08, 94.5 per cent. of telephone callers were answered on the day they rang against a target of 95 per cent. In enquiry centres, 97 per cent. of customers were given an appointment within three days, against a target of 95 per cent. HMRC also receives enquiries via post, but it is not possible to distinguish these cases from other forms of customer correspondence, such as forms.</p>
	<p pid="e.1397W.3/3">The following table provides the number of unanswered telephone calls for each of the last six months, including calls that received a busy message, the engaged tone or which were abandoned. The number of unanswered calls fluctuates according to the peaks in HMRC's business. The peak in demand in January reflects the self assessment filing date and demand has been high throughout the last three months as HMRC has approached the tax credits renewal deadline date.</p>
	<p pid="e.1397W.3/4">Customers who do not get through on their first attempt often use the rapid redial facility on their telephone to make numerous successive calls, which increases the number of unanswered calls disproportionately. However, as the statistics below show, the vast majority of callers did get through on the same day they called.</p>
