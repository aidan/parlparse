	<p pid=".1W.10/1">Since the publication of the Cruickshank report on Competition in UK Banking, the payments industry has made moves to address some of the competition concerns the report identified, in areas such as price transparency, wholesale pricing, access, and governance. In addition, in response to the findings of the Competition Commission report into SME banking, the OFT has negotiated agreements with the main clearing banks to improve conditions for competition and consumer choice in SME accounts. Finally, the OFT is currently investigating the interchange fee arrangements in the MasterCard credit and charge card schemes under the Competition Act 1998. The OFT will continue to use Competition Act powers where appropriate to address competition concerns in this sector.</p>
	<p pid=".1W.10/2">However, the Government recognises that problems remain and that an increased focus on competition in the industry would deliver significant benefits. It believes that the OFT could provide this focus and address the remaining concerns, in advance of any legislation. The Government therefore announced in the pre-Budget Report that the Office of Fair Trading will shortly take on an enhanced role in relation to payment systems for a period of four years. The Government will then review competition in the industry and legislate unless there has been significant improvement. Further details on these proposals will be announced by the OFT in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".4W.3/1">There is nothing in the Bill which changes in any way the grounds on which children may be taken into care. The Bill simply provides that families, illegally resident in the UK once their claims have failed, would no longer be entitled to support at the expense of the taxpayer if they refuse opportunities to leave the country. If, by putting themselves in this position, parents put their children at risk, it would be for the local authority to decide how the interests of their children should be protected under existing child protection legislation. We do not believe that many, if any, parents would put their children in this position. If this were to happen the costs would be met by central Government. We intend that in all cases the children concerned would be removed along with their parents.</p>

	<p pid=".7W.5/2">Re-documentation agreements are not necessary to enable us to return to most countries. Wherever possible (and this is the case with more than 160 countries), we return using the EU laissez passer, because this is the simplest and quickest approach. But where third countries do not accept the EU letter, we have sought to conclude a range of informal or formal agreements.</p>
	<p pid=".7W.5/3">The UK signed its first three bilateral readmission agreements with Romania and Bulgaria in February 2003 and Albania in October 2003. These agreements are due to enter into force in 2004. We will continue to negotiate bilateral readmission agreements and less formal re-documentation arrangements in order to facilitate removals operations.</p>
	<p pid=".7W.5/4">In addition, at EU level, the Commission has been authorised by the Council to negotiate Community readmission agreements with 11 third countries: Morocco, Sri Lanka, Russia, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Macao, Ukraine, Albania, Algeria, China and Turkey. The first of these is due to enter force in 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".10W.12/1">An external team investigates all deaths in prison custody. Out of area investigations are recommended as good practice. A review of investigations into deaths in custody has resulted in some investigations being led by an investigator independent of the Prison Service or with the support of a multi-agency advisory panel. In two recent cases the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has been commissioned to conduct an investigation and plans are in hand to transfer the function to him.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.12/2">Prison Service staff leading investigations into deaths in custody attend two training courses, the first covering investigations generally and the second dealing specifically with investigating deaths in custody. Two detailed and comprehensive Prison Service Orders (1300 &quot;Investigations&quot; and 1301 &quot;Investigating death in custody&quot;) provide guidance and advice to ensure that investigations are thorough.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.12/3">Through its partnership with the Department of Health, the Prison Service is working to establish links locally and nationally with the National Institute Mental Health England (NIMHE) in implementing Standard Seven &quot;Preventing Suicide&quot; of the National Service Framework for Mental Health published in 1999. Learning lessons and changing practice as a result of the thorough investigations that follow a death in custody is a key factor in this framework.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.12/4">Investigators always offer to meet bereaved families and investigation reports are disclosed to families in consultation with the Coroner before the inquest. In order to provide greater insight and explanation for bereaved families, investigators are now required to include families in the investigation process.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.12/5">Deaths in police custody are subject to investigation under the statutory complaints system set out in the Police Act 1996 and police forces voluntarily refer all such deaths to the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) to oversee the investigations undertaken.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.12/6">Under the provisions of the Police Reform Act 2002, a new police complaints system will be implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) will replace the Police Complaints Authority. Under the new system, all deaths in police custody which involve potential misconduct from a member of a police force must be referred to the IPCC, whether or not a complaint has been made.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.12/7">Depending on the circumstances of the case, the IPCC can investigate the incident using its own investigators, or it can choose to manage or supervise a police investigation. The IPCC and the police will have all the necessary powers and will be expected to conduct thorough investigations which comply with all relevant standards.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.12/8">Complainants and other interested persons&mdash;including family members&mdash;will have the opportunity to participate in the conduct of an investigation and will have a right to be kept informed of its progress and outcome.</p>

	<p pid=".14W.0/1">The Prison Service's efforts to reduce the numbers of self-inflicted deaths in prisons are supported by a number of broader strategies for which money is allocated at a national level. It is not, therefore possible to identify the resources that have been allocated to suicide prevention specifically.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.0/2">A proactive three-year programme to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and manage self-harm in prisons commenced in April 2001. The main principles of the strategy apply across all types of prisons and prisoners whether male or female. An investment of over &pound;21 million through the three-year programme is enabling physical improvements (now 75 per cent. complete) to be made at six 'Safer Local' pilot sites, one of which is the women's prison and YOI Eastwood Park. At Eastwood Park where there is a centrally funded Project Manager, &pound;1.5 million has been dedicated to Reception and the Healthcare Centre, while a further &pound;1.5 million is being spent on installing safer cells (cells which contain specially designed furniture and fixtures which are manufactured and installed to make the attachment of ligatures very difficult).</p>
	<p pid=".14W.0/3">A targeted and separate suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy is being developed specifically for women prisoners. In addition &pound;1 million from the Department of Health has been allocated to the Women's Estate to be spent on the recruitment of psychiatric nurses, and 11 out of the 17 prisons for women now have mental health in-reach facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.0/4">Brockhill, Eastwood Park, Holloway, New Hall and Styal prisons were among the first establishments to have full-time, dedicated Suicide Prevention Co-ordinators (SPCs). All women's prisons now have a designated full-time or part-time SPC. All women's establishments deliver suicide awareness training to staff.</p>

	<p pid=".14W.3/1">Sexual activity in public lavatories will be covered by a specific new offence in section 71 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Persons engaging in such activity may also commit the existing common law offence of outraging public decency or an offence under section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986. The Government believe that sexual activity in public lavatories is unacceptable and the new offence will cover any activity that:</p>
	<p pid=".14W.3/2" class="indent">&quot;a reasonable person would, in all the circumstances but regardless of any person's purpose, consider to be sexual&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.3/3">The maximum penalty will be six months imprisonment, or a level five fine, or both.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.3/4">The new offence will not require that someone should be caused &quot;alarm, distress, or offence&quot; by the activity, which is a requirement of section 5 of the Public Order Act. Similarly, the common law offence contains a requirement that the conduct must be lewd, obscene or disgusting. While it is a requirement that it should not be inordinate, the common law offence does not have a maximum penalty and so could be used to prosecute more serious cases where the conduct is particularly unacceptable. This offence has been made triable summarily, as well on indictment, by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 which should give greater flexibility in its use.</p>

This survey was carried out in 2001 and published in 2003. It showed that 70 per cent. (211) had children under the age of 18. Between them, the 211 mothers had 473 children. This suggests that, for every female prisoner, there are roughly 1.5 children in the community. The same survey also indicates that, prior to going to prison, 60 per cent. of the female prisoners who were mothers had been looking after their children at home.</p>

	<p pid=".17W.3/17">The general prison population, and the women's estate in particular, contains a very large number of prisoners exhibiting a combination of factors which raise their risk of suicide: these include psychiatric disorders, relationship problems, previous abuse and family background problems; and histories of self-harm, drug and alcohol abuse and homelessness. As women tend to be the primary carers in their families, concerns about child care arrangements and associated issues also come to the fore with imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid=".17W.3/18">Any member of staff who has cause for concern that a prisoner may be at-risk can open an F2052SH and it is mandatory to open an F2052SH following any incident of self-harm. The inherent vulnerability of many women in custody, combined with the high levels of self-harm in the women's estate, results in a very large number of women prisoners presenting themselves as requiring special care, and being made subject to F2052SH procedures. However, staff caring for women prisoners face exceptional difficulties in distinguishing between those women who are intensely vulnerable and those who may be actively suicidal.</p>
	<p pid=".17W.3/19">To address this issue, the F2052SH system is under review. The pilot of a replacement care planning system will begin in January 2004 at five establishments, one of which is the women's prison and YOI Low Newton. The potential replacement for the F2052SH aims to build on the successful aspects of the existing system, yet be more flexible and task teams of specially trained staff to assess the level of risk that at-risk prisoners present.</p>
	<p pid=".17W.3/20">In parallel with the review of the F2052SH, information booklets and posters to improve staff understanding of the issues surrounding self-harm have been widely distributed, and detailed guidance for staff on how to manage and care for prisoners who self-harm, as well as a video discussing self-harm, are under development.</p>

	<p pid=".18W.5/1">A survey carried out by the Prison Service in 2003 demonstrates that a wide range of support is given across the prison estate to women who report that they have been abused. This includes offering women individual support and/or counselling; the provision of advice and information and referral to appropriate outside agencies. Individual establishments work closely with local community agencies with specialist expertise in abuse issues. The support offered to individual women who report that they have suffered any kind of abuse and have asked for help, will be determined following a full assessment of their needs.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.5/2">The support offered varies between establishments and reflects local circumstances. The Prison Service is currently working with a small group of local practitioners, including both prison staff and voluntary agencies, to develop good practice principles so that consistency in the standard of support offered can be achieved. This work will be completed by March 2004 and will draw on a recently published literature review by Carol-Ann Hooper (2003), from the University of York on &quot;Abuse, Interventions and Women in Prison&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".18W.5/3">In addition, examples of specific work being done for women who are the victims of domestic violence include working to help women avoid going back into circumstances that are high risk for violence when they are released and the provision in many establishments of posters/helpline information supplied by local domestic violence networks.</p>

	<p pid=".27W.2/1">All of these equipment projects are due to come into service on an incremental basis in the period from 2004 to the end of the decade. Our first priority is to ensure that the currently planned capability (including planned upgrades where appropriate) is brought into service on time and to cost. We keep all our equipment capability requirements under review and will consider making further investment in, and upgrades to, these assets if that were the best way of meeting our future capability requirements. For Skynet 5, where we have contracted for service provision for a period of 15 years under PFI arrangements, the contractor will need to invest to meet his service obligations and is incentivised to provide technology refresh during the course of the contract.</p>

HMS Enterprise was accepted from the prime contractor, Vosper Thornycroft in September 2003 and is expected to enter service in the third quarter of 2004. Both vessels' in-service dates have been delayed by design and production difficulties at the shipbuilder and subsequent technical difficulties. Neither vessel is laid up; however, HMS Enterprise's trials programme is currently on hold because of technical problems with her propulsion system. She is expected to resume her trials programme in April next year and in the meantime her crew are using the time to undertake training and vessel familiarisation.</p>

Against an original forecast In-Service Date (ISD) of late 2004, slippage of 13 months was reported in the 2001 Major Project Report. Following incorporation of an associated programme into the project to realise efficiency benefits through the harmonisation of work packages, the programme to ISD will be reviewed early in 2004. While slippage to ISD will delay the first ship fit, compression of the ship fitting programme will enable earlier delivery of the total capability across the frigate fleet.</p>

	<p pid=".33W.0/1">The formula for determining the gross compensation to ex-servicemen whose invaliding pensions were wrongly taxed for more than six years, involves uprating the sum owed by the Retail Prices Index plus 2 per cent. per annum. The sum payable is to be based on compounding annually. Over the last 20 years this provides a slightly lower return on average than applying the National Savings rate (based on a deposit of &pound;10,000). However, in the preceding decade the Ministry of Defence's formula gives the higher return. Over the whole 30 years, the return using MOD's formula is slightly more generous than one linked to the National Savings rate.</p>

	<p pid=".35W.3/1">The indicators for a good poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) are those defined by the Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) Guidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The JSA guidelines reflect the main principles underlying the PRSP approach. The PRSP should be prepared by the Government, including broad participation that promotes country ownership of the strategy and its implementation as well as partnerships among the government, domestic stakeholders and development partners. The JSA guidelines also reflect the expectation that, although the specific content of PRSPs will vary widely among countries, a PRSP will include four core elements: a description of the country's participatory process; poverty diagnosis; targets, indicators, and monitoring systems; and priorities for public action. Good governance measures, including those which address transparency and corruption fall under the public action section.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.3/2">The UK has been working closely with the Government of Angola to ensure that the PRSP adheres to all of the JSA guidelines. The donor community in Angola fully expects the next draft version of the paper, likely to be published early in the new year, to include a strategy for good governance. Key components of that strategy will be greater transparency on Government income and expenditure as well as plans to eradicate corruption from all levels of government. The UK will continue to work closely with the World Bank and other donors to ensure that the text and implementation of the Angola PRSP meets the high standards demanded by the JSA guidelines.</p>

However prospects for the 2004 harvest remain grim, with the poorest seasonal rains since records began in 1915. It is evident that food shortages will continue and that vulnerable groups will require on-going assistance. We have earmarked funds to respond to a new emergency appeal which is being prepared.</p>

	<p pid=".37W.3/1">The progress of the on-going reforms aimed at improving EC financial accountability was reviewed by the Secretary of State and the representatives of other member states in the discussion of the annual report for 2002 at the November General External Affairs Council. The investigation by the Commission's Internal Audit Service into all Commission directorates and agencies, including AIDCO, will report early in the new year. All accusations of fraud are taken very seriously and followed up by DFID.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.3/2">Since the late 1990s, DFID has supported the reform of the EC's aid programmes and policies, in particular the establishment of the EuropeAid office, the reform of the Management Committees, the reduction in the backlog of unspent Commission funds and the reform of the financial management of the Commission's external assistance. These measures should improve the transparency and accountability standards of the EC aid programme financial management through better scrutiny, a key and integral feature of the overall reform process.</p>

	<p pid=".38W.3/1">Support to HIV/AIDS is being provided as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".38W.3/2" class="indent">Burundi: &pound;5.1 million over a three-year period (2002 to 2005) through Action Aid for support to the National AIDS Control Programme and Population Services International (PSI) for condom social marketing. Research and monitoring is carried out nationally by the National AIDS Control Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".38W.3/3" class="indent">DRC: In 2002&ndash;03 a total of &pound;375,622 through MSF for an AIDS Care project in Bukavu was spent; in 2003&ndash;04 a total of &pound;500,000 to Population Services International (PSI) for an expanded programme of condom social marketing has been spent. Research and monitoring is carried out nationally by the National AIDS Control Programme based in Kinshasa. DFID is doubling its core contribution next year as are others. DPID recently published its Country Engagement Plan for the DRC which sets out the key aims for a post-conflict DRC. The fight against HIV/AIDS is one of those aims and we will be working with partners on this as we build up our programme.</p>
	<p pid=".38W.3/4" class="indent">Rwanda: &pound;2.95 million to the National AIDS Commission over the period April 2002 to March 2005. The primary objective is to substantially enhance the effectiveness of Rwanda's response to HIV/AIDS. DFID has also committed &pound;895,993 to PSI over the period February 2002 to February 2005 to support social marketing of condoms and &pound;521,000 to support an HIV/AIDS unit within the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology over the period April 2001 to March 2006. In addition, since 2000&ndash;01 DFID has provided &pound;65.4 million in general budget support to the Government of Rwanda (GoR) and is planning to provide a further &pound;84 million over the period 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06. This provides core funding so that GoR can tackle its Poverty Reduction Strategy objectives, which include improving HIV/AIDS related health care activities.</p>
	<p pid=".38W.3/5" class="indent">Research on the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS was carried out in Rwanda before 1994 and looked at the historical background of HIV infection. In 1997 the Ministry of Health carried out research on the number of people infected and 11.1 per cent. were found to be HIV positive. During six months of every year all hospitals in Rwanda are asked to carry out a survey on the number of infected pregnant women for both rural and urban areas. The GoR currently estimate that 400,000 of its population are infected with HIV/AIDS. GoR will be carrying out an HIV/AIDS demographic survey in early 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".38W.3/6" class="indent">Uganda: In 2000&ndash;01 a total of &pound;1.5 million was spent on HIV/AIDS; in 2001&ndash;02 &pound;0.9 million was spent; in 2002&ndash;03 &pound;1.23 million was spent. A total of &pound;0.78 million has so far been spent in 2003&ndash;04 (&pound;1.27 million is forecast for this financial year). For 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 &pound;2 million is forecast respectively for each year. In addition, since 2000&ndash;01 general budget support has been provided to the Government of Uganda. However, it is impossible to estimate how much is being spent on HIV-related and health care activities. The numbers of people infected are currently measured through a sentinel surveillance system where they are anonymously tested. A survey of 30,000 people is planned for early 2004 and will be undertaken by USAID and the Government of Uganda.</p>

UN agencies and NGOs employ large numbers of Iraqi technical staff including engineers. In the south DFID funds the Recovery and Infrastructure Group (RIG), which is refurbishing key government buildings, and another project, which is rehabilitating the offices for the Governorate teams. We are also funding the Emergency Infrastructure Project, which is carrying out emergency refurbishment of power, water and fuel supply infrastructure. The consultants leading those projects employ Iraqi engineers as integral members of their teams. DFID staff have been impressed by the technical competence of the Iraqi engineers.</p>

The Government's accountability for honouring their commitments therefore primarily rests with the Rwandan people, through Parliament and civil society organisations.

	<p pid=".42W.8/1">DFID is currently working on this issue at a number of levels. Activities in the southern Africa region include increasing information on the impact of HIV/AIDS on the social services; the promotion of national plans that address its impact; funding for HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation programmes; and capacity building support for health and education services. DFID is working closely with Governments, civil society, the private sector, and other donors to tackle HIV and AIDS which is the major challenge for the region.</p>
	<p pid=".42W.8/2">The Government's recent &quot;Call for Action on HIV/AIDS&quot; promises to make HIV/AIDS a priority for the additional &pound;320 million a year which DFID will be devoting to Africa by 2006, fulfilling the UK pledge to increase development assistance to Africa to &pound;1 billion per annum.</p>

There continue to be high levels of political violence and repression, particularly against trade unions and the independent media. Failed economic policies have also undermined basic social and economic rights. This is reflected in the 5.5 million people requiring food aid and the collapse of basic services.</p>

	<p pid=".44W.2/1">In Zimbabwe it is unlikely that there will be sufficient food for the 5.5 million people who are expected to need assistance during the pre-harvest season, i.e. January to April. DFID is again providing almost &pound;20 million for emergency feeding programmes this year, but the Government of Zimbabwe's contribution to the humanitarian feeding operation is expected to be negligible. The World Food Programme has responded by reducing rations, and is now providing about 50 per cent. of daily needs. DFID is working with the World Food Programme, other UN agencies and various non-governmental organisations to ensure that the available humanitarian resources are used efficiently and prioritised to reach the most vulnerable, including households affected by AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".44W.2/2">We are monitoring closely the situation in other countries in the region. We have already provided almost &pound;3 million for food aid programmes in Mozambique, Lesotho and Swaziland to cover immediate requirements until the harvest season, and are augmenting this with support for agricultural recovery activities. We are also funding the work of the Vulnerability Assessment Committees to provide more detailed information on vulnerability, and have used this data to target nutritional support operations in Mozambique and Lesotho to complement food aid deliveries in these countries.</p>

	<p pid=".45W.7/1">In paragraphs 12.15 to 12.18 of the SERAS consultation, the Department asked for views on the potential of six existing business aviation sites including Farnborough, Northolt and Southend, to accommodate future demand for business aviation. This took account of the findings from the Department's study of business aviation in the South East which was published as the part of the consultation in July 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".45W.7/2">In addition to these sites, the business aviation study also considered that two predominantly general aviation airfields, White Waltham and North Weald, were well located to meet some of the demand for business aviation in the longer term, but the case for White Waltham would be largely dependent on the future provision of capacity at Luton, Farnborough, and Northolt during the 30 year period of the White Paper. Consequently, the White Paper recognised this potential but did not arrive at any conclusions about whether White Waltham should be expanded to meet demand for business aviation.</p>

	<p pid=".48W.5/1">The Government strongly supports the Voluntary Agreements on new car fuel efficiency between the European Commission and the automotive industry, and has put in place a number of policies to incentivise the uptake of fuel-efficient vehicles in the UK. These are set out in detail in the Powering Future Vehicles strategy, copies of which are available in the Libraries of the House and via the Department's website.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.5/2">The main measures include a number of fiscal incentives to encourage the purchase of more fuel-efficient vehicles, such as the graduated Vehicle Excise Duty and company car tax regimes. We also provide Government grants to support the purchase of certain types of fuel-efficient vehicle, including petrol-electric 'hybrid' vehicles. In recent months, we have been piloting colour-coded energy efficiency labels for new cars in some showrooms, as a way of getting clearer information on fuel efficiency to consumers, and we will be supporting the European Commission as it seeks to develop an EU-wide car energy efficiency labelling scheme. As a result of these and other measures, average new car fuel efficiency in the UK has improved by almost 10 per cent. since 1995.</p>
	<p pid=".48W.5/3">The Government's Energy White Paper, published in February 2003, confirmed the Government's strong support for the Voluntary Agreements, and committed us to working with the European Commission in developing further Voluntary Agreements to continue the improvement in average new car fuel-efficiency. We have written to the European Commission setting out our view that new Agreements should be reached at an early date, establishing a new time horizon such as 2015. We have suggested that new targets should be based on authoritative evidence on available technology improvements, having regard to the full range of environmental, social and economic factors.</p>

	<p pid=".54W.5/1">The transport session of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council met in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-05">5 December</phrase>. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State represented the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.5/2">The Presidency gave a progress report on the proposed Directive on sanctions for ship-source pollution, indicating that further work was needed. The Transport Council would call on the Justice and Home Affairs Council to look at the parallel proposal for a framework decision for criminal sanctions. The UK is among Member States seeking to ensure the exclusion of criminal sanctions from the Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.5/3">The Council reached a General Approach on an amendment to the Regulation which established the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). The Regulation extends EMSA's role into the areas of certification of third country seafarers, counter-pollution measures and ship security. The security role is to be limited, on the basis of a Presidency compromise proposal, to ships only (thereby excluding the ship/port interface and ports themselves). This was accepted by all delegations.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.5/4">The Council reached a General Approach on a Regulation on transfer of vessels between Community registers. The text is acceptable to the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.5/5">The Council reached Political Agreement on an amending Regulation on airport slot allocation. The Presidency explained that the proposal concerned technical amendments to the existing rules on slot allocation, with market measures left to a later phase. A compromise text safeguarded the possibility of secondary slot trading at congested airports (the key issue for the UK), and removed a time limit on the re-letting of public service contracts. My right hon. Friend joined others in speaking in support of the compromise. The Commission said it would come forward in 2004 with a proposal to introduce market elements to the slot allocation system.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.5/6">The Commissioner reported on her recent informal talks with the US on EU/US air service negotiations. The US had said that they envisaged the negotiations focusing on ownership and control issues, competition, leasing, and airport access.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.5/7">The Council reached Political Agreement on a revised proposal to amend the guidelines to the transport Trans-European Network. This provides for: simpler environmental assessment requirements; tighter conditions for start-up aid in the context of 'motorways of the sea'; greater Commission consultation with Member States over action in response to project delays; and scope for adding to or amending the list of priority projects on the basis of two-yearly Commission reports. The amendments are largely acceptable to all Member States, including the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.5/8">Among AOB items, the Commission reported on progress in negotiations with the United States on interoperability of the Galileo satellite navigation system with the US Global Positioning System (GPS). The Commission also welcomed the commercial and development agreement reached with China on Galileo.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.5/9">The Council reached a General Approach on the Directive on interoperability of European electronic road tolling systems. The UK has particular interest in this measure because of our plans to introduce lorry road-user charging. We were able to accept the revised text at the Council, which had moved a considerable way to accommodate concerns we had had.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.5/10">There was a policy debate on the directive on charging of heavy goods vehicles (the Eurovignette directive), on the basis of three questions put in advance by the Presidency. The written submissions by Member and accession States will be used to inform future negotiations during the Irish Presidency. We explained specific points in the UK submission, in particular pressing for the scope of the Directive to permit the inclusion of congestion and environmental costs in any charges and arguing against mandatory hypothecation of toll revenue.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.5/11">The Council failed to reach agreement on the Directive on weekend lorry bans. We joined a number of other Member States in speaking in support of the proposal. However, the number of Member States opposed to even minimal EU rules prevented agreement. This issue will now be examined further and put to a future Council.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.5/12">The Commission presented two new legislative proposals in the area of road transport: the third driving licence directive; and a proposal requiring more frequent checking of commercial vehicles for compliance with drivers' hours legislation. These will now be examined in detail before being submitted to a future Council for agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.5/13">The Council agreed Conclusions on road safety, confirming the agreement reached at the informal meeting in Verona in October. The UK welcomes the Conclusions as a significant contribution to European road safety, and will support future proposals which stand up to the tests of subsidiarity and proportionality. The Commission also presented a Recommendation on enforcement in the field of road safety.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.5/14">No formal votes were taken.</p>

	<p pid=".56W.11/1">The Department's Report, &quot;Research into Unlicensed Driving&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-15">15 December 2003</phrase>, estimated that the number of people driving without a valid driving licence would lie in a range between 620,000 and just over 1 million. The Government are committed to tackling this. We are already taking action with the widespread Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras allowing police to target unlicensed vehicles on the road. All police services have 24-hour access to DVLA driving licence records via the Police National Computer.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.11/2">The number of people driving without insurance is estimated at approximately 1.25 million <sup>1</sup> . The Department has facilitated links between the Motor Insurance Database and the Police National Computer. The database contains details of every motorist's insurance and every vehicle insured. The police are currently making up to 25,000 checks each day on this database to detect and correct uninsured driving. In addition, the Government have appointed Professor David Greenaway of the University of Nottingham to carry out an independent review of motor insurance arrangements in the U.K, to advise on how to improve procedures and to reduce uninsured driving.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.11/3">The number of unlicensed (i.e. untaxed) vehicles is estimated at 1.76 million <sup>2</sup> . Reforms of the vehicle registration system include:</p>
	<p pid=".56W.11/4" class="indent">a system of continuous registration starting in January 2004, requiring vehicle users to re-licence their vehicles on time every year, with automatic penalty notices served on those who fail to comply;</p>
	<p pid=".56W.11/5" class="indent">new registration documents, and tighter but simpler procedures to keep DVLA's vehicle register informed when vehicles change hands;</p>
	<p pid=".56W.11/6" class="indent">new powers given to local authorities to tackle abandoned cars and to bring car dumpers to book;</p>
	<p pid=".56W.11/7" class="indent">bar codes on tax discs and on re-licensing reminders to improve the accuracy of the vehicle register; and</p>
	<p pid=".56W.11/8" class="indent">an increase in DVLA's wheel clamping operations together with the introduction of a DVLA telephone hotline to target evaders.</p>
	<p pid=".56W.11/9">In combination, the above measures are designed to improve the accuracy of the vehicle register from around 92 per cent. now to 97.5 per cent. by 2005 and to reduce evasion from around 4.5 per cent. to no more than 2.5 per cent. by 2007.</p>

Figures for the regional take-up of places are not collected centrally although we are aware of regional disparities in provision. To help address those disparities we are seeking to develop the scheme, over time, by introducing non-residential complementary models to serve as focal points in regions currently poorly served.</p>

Through the strategy set out in &quot;Excellence and Enjoyment&quot; we have a comprehensive agenda for schools and local education authorities to address the strengths and weaknesses identified in the report.

	<p pid=".66W.3/1">2 FLR 124 in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid=".66W.3/2" class="indent">&quot;Where parents of a child are separated and the child is in the day-to-day care of one of them, it is almost always in the interests of the child that he or she should have contact with the other parent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".66W.3/3">This judgment means that inherent in the courts' interpretation of the Children Act 1989, is a belief that there would normally be contact between children and both their parents.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.3/4">The Adoption and Children Act 2002 contains a provision that clarifies the definition of harm set out in the Children Act 1989. This makes clear that harm includes any harm a child may suffer or is at risk of suffering as a result of witnessing the ill-treatment of another person. The Adoption and Children Act 2002 received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-07">7 November 2002</phrase>. When implemented, this new definition will apply to family proceedings relating to contact and residence applications.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.3/5">There are currently no plans to establish a legal presumption of contact between children and their non-resident parents. The interest of the child should be the basis for any decision. However, the Government support the view that, in general, children benefit from a continuing relationship with both parents following parental separation, where it is in the best interests of the child and safe for all family members.</p>
	<p pid=".66W.3/6">A recent study suggested that it was rare for courts to refuse a father all contact with his children and that of finalised contact cases initiated by fathers, only 10 per cent. resulted in an order for indirect contact. A copy of this research report has been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>

Adult and Community Learning programmes will be seen as an integral part of the wider learning opportunities for the areas.</p>
	<p pid=".67W.2/2">To safeguard the availability of these types of learning, the Government and the LSC have agreed an overall indicative budget to support non-qualification bearing programmes. That budget covers, for example, family learning, learning for older people, active citizenship, community development, and learning through cultural activities.</p>
	<p pid=".67W.2/3">From within that national budget, the LSC will agree with local LSCs a minimum figure to spend on such learning activities. Each local LSC will now decide with its local partners-including local education authorities, colleges, community and voluntary groups-the priorities for spending those funds in order to maximise the civic, social and cultural gain for the area.</p>

	<p pid=".71W.9/1">My right hon. Friend has regular meetings with the First Secretary and I meet the Assembly Minister for Environment, Planning and Countryside to discuss a variety of issues, including the recent outbreak of potato ring rot.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.9/2">The Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate and the Welsh Assembly took swift action to contain the outbreak following it's discovery, during a routine annual check. Notices were issued under the Plant Health Order, stopping all movements of potatoes from the farm and three additional farms in England that had recently taken a delivery of seed potatoes from the infected farm.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.9/3">The variety sent to the English farms has tested negative for ring rot but will not be used as seed as a precautionary measure. Tests have now been completed on 1,500 tonnes of potatoes at Middlewood Farm. Two stocks associated with the variety 'Provento' have been found to be infected. The remaining 20 stocks of other varieties of seed potatoes, at the outbreak farm have been found free from potato ring rot.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.9/4">It is a credit to the systems that the Welsh Assembly and UK Government have in place that the disease was identified during a routine check and that the swift action taken by all concerned successfully contained and managed the outbreak.</p>

	<p pid=".74W.3/2">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) encourages ethical purchasing as a key element of its procurement policy.

	<p pid=".74W.3/3">HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate (HMCPSI) does not sell products of any sort on its premises. Catering for receptions and meetings involving staff and visitors is provided by local contractors. HMCPSI does not specify how contractors should obtain their supplies. The procurement policy for all goods and services is to use reliable suppliers of suitable products that offer good value for taxpayers' money. When Government policy exists in respect of specific types of goods or services then this is taken into account for contracts of material value.</p>
	<p pid=".74W.3/4">The Treasury Solicitor's Department has no provision for making sales of any sort on its premises. Fair trade tea and coffee is, however, used where it is served at meetings and receptions involving staff and visitors</p>

	<p pid=".77W.9/1">Britain has one of the strictest and most transparent arms export licensing systems in the world. All export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case by case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria, taking account of the circumstances prevailing at the time and other announced Government policies. Our criteria clearly set out our commitment to take account of the risk that exports might be used for either internal repression or external aggression.</p>
	<p pid=".77W.9/2">The British Government have been in the forefront of international efforts to strengthen the regulation of the arms trade and proliferation. We were instrumental in getting agreement for an EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, and we regularly encourage other countries to adopt stricter and more transparent arms export policies. We are active members of all the key regimes that work to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, such as the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, and the Australia Group (which deals with chemical and biological weapons). The UK is also a member of key arms control treaties, such as the Ottawa Convention on Landmines, the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.</p>
	<p pid=".77W.9/3">We remain committed to working with other states to find common ground on the issue of export controls. The UK aims to forge partnerships across regions, with states who have different perspectives and approaches to the export of arms, in an effort to secure a universal commitment to strengthening export controls, thereby making an important contribution to the global effort to combat weapons of proliferation.</p>

	<p pid=".80W.8/1">It is estimated that over 80 per cent. of Afghan heroin reaching the UK arrives via Turkey, with Pakistan and Iran being key staging posts en route. The majority of Afghan heroin trafficked via the Central Asian Republics is judged to be destined for consumption in Russia and other countries in the region, rather than for onward transit to the European Union and United Kingdom. The trafficking of Afghan heroin via the Central Asian Republics is therefore not a significant factor in determining the amount of heroin reaching the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".83W.6/1">The UK condemns unequivocally the use of child soldiers.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.6/2">We are particularly concerned about the widespread use of child soldiers in the Great Lakes region. The UK has contributed US$25 million to the Multi-Country Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme (MDRP). The funds for this will be used in part in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to enable the Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) of child soldiers. We have provided an additional &pound;750,000 directly to UNICEF to help its programme until funding under the MDRP becomes available. The UK has also provided technical assistance to the Congolese to enable them to draw up a National Programme for DDR.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.6/3">In Uganda, the UK gave &pound;450,000 to UNICEF and Save the Children last Financial Year to rehabilitate children who have escaped from their Lords Resistance Army. We have discussed with the Ugandan Government reports of under-age soldiers being recruited by the Government defence units in the North. The Government of Uganda has assured us that they are co-operating with UNICEF to identify and demobilise the recruits. Our High Commission in Kampala is monitoring the situation.</p>

	<p pid=".89W.6/1">The Government monitored progress on Local Agenda 21 (LA21) until the end of 2000. By then over 93 per cent. of local authorities in England and Wales had LA21 strategies in place. As these were voluntary strategies developed to reflect local circumstances, we did not carry out any formal assessment. Stakeholders have, however, carried out a number of studies into LA21 in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.6/2">The Local Government Act 2000 placed a duty on local authorities to prepare community strategies for promoting the economic, social and environmental well being of their communities and contributing to sustainable development in the UK. The Government's statutory guidance says that authorities should build on the experience of partnership working and community engagement gained through LA21. The Government want to see sustainable development become a mainstream issue for local authorities, their partners, and local communities. We believe that the most effective way to achieve this is to subsume LA21 strategies within statutory community strategies.</p>

	<p pid=".91W.2/1">The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB carried out an interim analysis of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial data collected up to the end of August 2003. The analysis indicated that there is an increased risk of TB breakdowns occurring in trial areas where reactive culling has taken place, compared to the related control (survey-only) areas. The increase is estimated at 27 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.2/2">This conclusion is statistically valid and has been reached after taking into account factors other than culling (e.g. history of breakdowns in the area, number of herds, herd size etc.) which may have an impact on the number of breakdowns in a particular area. This outcome is consistent across nine of the 10 triplets; there has not been any reactive culling in the 10th reactive trial area.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.2/3">On the basis of these findings, ministers have decided to suspend culling in reactive trial areas, because the evidence suggests that such culling leads to more cases of TB in cattle.</p>

	<p pid=".93W.2/1">Defra figures are only one of a number of sources of information available to the market and individual buyers and sellers have to use their own commercial judgment. Although there was an initial increase of approximately &pound;5 per tonne immediately following publication of corrected figures, this had reduced by about half within a few days with the price back on trend. This reflects the UK's position as a price taker rather than a price maker in an international commodity market. UK production is about only 13 per cent. of EU production, and EU production is just over 20 per cent. of world production. On average, however, wheat prices this year are now some &pound;50 per tonne higher than at the same period last year. They have risen steadily throughout the marketing season in response to serious reductions in supply elsewhere in Europe as a result of heat and drought in the summer. This has also coincided with a tighter global market which has seen world wheat prices at their highest levels in recent years. There was no discernable effect on prices when the provisional agricultural census results were published in the middle of September.</p>

	<p pid=".94W.5/2">In addition we have funded the Environment Agency to trial movable temporary defences including the pallet barrier system. These are at Shrewsbury, Worcester and Ironbridge Gorge. The trials are designed to test the security of the defence that might be achieved by such systems. The results of these trials will be made publicly available once they have been completed.</p>

	<p pid=".95W.5/1">Achieving quality parish status demonstrates that a council has met certain minimum standards expected from an effective, representative and active parish council. The Council will then be in a position to do more for it's communities on behalf of the principal local authorities thus making services more responsive to local needs. The main beneficiary of Quality status will be the local community as the Council takes on an enhanced role:</p>
	<p pid=".95W.5/2" class="indent">As an integral part of all consultation arrangements set up by principal local authorities and other service providers on how services are delivered in its area;</p>

	<p pid=".95W.5/4" class="indent">In the provision of access points to information on services of principal local authorities and other service providers.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.5/5">This enhanced role will be achieved through the negotiation of charters with principal local authorities. We shall be monitoring the development of these charters and the impact of the Quality Town and Parish Scheme to ensure it achieves real benefits, but at the level of anecdote there is evidence of real engagements and enthusiasm among parish Councils up and down the country. This is very encouraging.</p>

	<p pid=".104W.0/1">The answers to the questions are as follows.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.0/2">Any victim of a crime occurring in England and Wales can apply to be a member of the Victims Advisory Panel. The next recruitment campaign for lay members will take place in 2005. Civilian victims of the Northern Ireland Troubles who live in Great Britain can apply. None did so when we first advertised for members in 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.0/3">There are no centrally held statistics about claims for compensation from victims of terrorist crime before the introduction of the tariff-based scheme in April 1996. In the period between then and <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority received 588 claims arising from incidents of terrorist bombings in Great Britain. There is no reliable way of giving a definitive breakdown between those related to the Troubles or to other terrorist incidents.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.0/4">No specific representations have been received about including the needs of victims of the Troubles within the remit of the Commissioner for Victims and Witnesses. The Commissioner, once appointed, will have a responsibility to promote and champion the needs of victims and witnesses of all crimes, who are resident in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.0/5">The National Strategy for Victims and Witnesses published in July 2003 set out the Government's plans for improving services to all victims. Although not specifically identified as a group separate from others who are bereaved or seriously injured as a result of crime, victims of terrorist incidents in England and Wales are included within the strategy. Work to implement the strategy has now begun, although there are no immediate plans to set up a group to study the needs of the victims of the Northern Ireland Troubles from Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid=".104W.0/6">There are already a number of independent victims' organisations operating in England and Wales at both national and local level, most notably the voluntary organisation, Victim Support, which this year received a grant of &pound;30 million from the Government. Victim Support provides practical advice and emotional support to victims of all types of crime, including terrorist crime. If people who have been affected by the Troubles wish to set up their own independent support network, they are free to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".110W.3/1">Business investment per worker has increased over the last decade in the UK, although it has been subject to a cyclical decline since 2001, in common with our major G7 competitors. Investment drives long run growth, and the Government are committed to ensuring that the UK provides a business environment where investment can flourish. That is why the Government have made major reforms to the macro-economic framework, which have helped to deliver low and stable inflation and to avoid large, destabilising fluctuations in output. Economic stability helps businesses plans for the long-term, giving them the confidence to invest. The Government have also reformed the corporate tax regime to give powerful incentives to invest, improved institutional investment arrangements through the Higgs and Myners reviews, and removed the regulatory barriers to investment in the planning system.</p>

	<p pid=".111W.5/1">The Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations and the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations were introduced on 1 and <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-02">2 December</phrase> respectively offering protection from discrimination in employment and vocational training. Legislation on these grounds will be enforced in the same way as other employment equality laws: through the Employment Tribunals and the Courts.</p>
	<p pid=".111W.5/2">The DTI website has information on the legislation aimed at employers and employees (<a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/er/equality">www.dti.gov.uk/ er/equality</a>). ACAS, the independent employment relations service, has produced impartial guidance on the sexual orientation and religion or belief regulations and the workplace. It includes possible scenarios and frequently asked questions. The ACAS guidance is available on their website (<a href="http://www.acas.org.uk">www.acas.org.uk</a>) and as a free printed booklet. These are both useful sources of information on rights and responsibilities under the new legislation which will help employers to avoid discrimination and help employees recognize where they may have been discriminated against.</p>
	<p pid=".111W.5/3">Both employers and employees can seek practical advice from ACAS via their national helpline (08457 47 47 47). Employers may also receive advice from their own HR specialists, legal representatives, trade association or business representative organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".111W.5/4">As with other employment legislation, individuals who wish to make a complaint to a tribunal are able to enlist the support of their trade union, law centres, Pro Bono groups or voluntary organisations with a particular interest in their case, as well seeking independent legal advice from a solicitor. In some cases, they may be eligible for legal advice and assistance under the Community Legal Service (CLS) legal help scheme. The CLS website, 'Just Ask!' (<a href="http://www.justask.org.uk">www.justask.org.uk</a>) provides co-ordinated access to several hundred legal information and help websites. Users can use the search facility on 'Just Ask!' to locate local or national legal service providers who can help with their problems. Individuals can also call into their local Citizens Advice Bureau, where free legal advice and representation may be available.</p>

	<p pid=".113W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.5/2">Private sector companies, including those carrying out public sector contracts, are subject to the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. These prohibit discrimination, respectively, on the grounds of sex, on racial grounds and on the grounds of disability, in the fields of employment, training, education, the provision of goods and services and the provision of housing. From <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-02">2 December 2003</phrase>, it has also been unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation and religion or belief in the fields of employment and vocational training.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.5/3">The Race Relations Act 1976, as amended by the (Amendment) Act 2000 (RR(A)A) placed a general duty on listed bodies to have due regard to the need:</p>
	<p pid=".113W.5/4" class="indent">(a) to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination; and</p>
	<p pid=".113W.5/5" class="indent">(b) to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.5/6">The duty applies to public bodies only listed in the Schedule introduced by the RR(A)A. The duty does not apply to private sector bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".113W.5/7">However, the Government does not want to see a dilution of the general duty in relation to functions which have been contracted out, and bodies to which the duty applies will need to be mindful of their obligations when discharging their functions through others. In placing contracts, for example, such bodies might want to consider whether the contract should be used to specify actions that the contractor should take to ensure that the body in question does not fail to meet its obligations in this area. This does not, however, mean the duty is transferred to the contractor. The responsibility for complying with the duty in relation to public functions relevant to it remains at all times with the listed body.</p>

	<p pid=".117W.2/1">Government's Manufacturing Strategy, published in May 2002, identified the UK's long-standing weakness in investment as a key factor for the gap with our main competitors in manufacturing productivity. Manufacturing investment has declined from &pound;20.4 billion in 1998 to &pound;14.6 billion in 2002, due in part to weakness of external demand, spare capacity and increased uncertainty about the prospects for the global economy. It is also the case that UK manufacturing investment is cyclical with respect to the UK economy. The accelerating economic growth currently being experienced by the UK is likely to engender stronger manufacturing investment, albeit with a lag. This is consistent with the CBI's November 2003 forecast (Economic and Business Outlook) that UK manufacturing investment will grow by 0.8 per cent. in 2004 and 4.8 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".117W.2/2">The Government are taking action to provide a climate conducive to investment for the long-term in UK manufacturing, by maintaining a stable macro-economic framework, together with measures such as reforming capital gains tax; making permanent enhanced capital allowances for small and medium sized firms; introducing the R&amp;D tax credit for small and large firms; establishing Regional Venture Capital Funds; and extending the Small Firm Loan Guarantee.</p>
	<p pid=".117W.2/3">The Pre-Budget Report contained a number of announcements that further build on this, including: measures to overcome barriers to raising finance for small business, notably a pathfinder round of Enterprise Capital Funds and proposed enhancements to Venture Capital Trusts and the Enterprise Investment Scheme. It also announced a new, clearer and more accessible R&amp;D tax credit definition and extension of the scope of qualifying costs.</p>

	<p pid=".117W.5/2">As explained in the UK Productivity and Competitiveness Indicators 2003, investment is one of the five key drivers of productivity and thus competitiveness identified by the Government. Investment in physical plant, machinery and buildings helps make workers more productive and is a way of embodying new technology in the production process. As such, investment is vital to manufacturing's long-term prosperity and the Government are committed to creating an environment where such investment can flourish. That is why the Government have reformed the macro economic framework and are undertaking extensive reform of the product, labour and capital markets. For example, in terms of capital markets, the Government have reformed capital gains tax; made permanent enhanced capital allowances for small and medium sized firms; introduced the R&amp;D tax credit for small and large firms; established Regional Venture Capital Funds; and extended the Small Firm Loan Guarantee.</p>

	<p pid=".120W.3/1">There is no such requirement. The urban network programme is designed to manage change in the urban post office branch network by closing branches where there is oversupply and poor viability and investing in branches which continue to serve the area in order to prevent unmanaged decline of the network. In putting forward proposals under this programme, Post Office Ltd undertakes extensive analysis of an area, using a modelling system showing where customers live and where they shop, and how demand for post office services is currently met. It also shows overlaps in provision where two or more branches are chasing the same customer base and where the network may need to change to create viable businesses while ensuring that branches are still accessible to the customers in the area. Checks are made of local authority plans, environmental and transport information, local shopping habits, and other local developments and features are assessed on site visits. Each closure proposal is subject to a six week public consultation in accordance with the Code of Practice agreed with Postwatch.</p>
	<p pid=".120W.3/2">At the end of the programme, 95 per cent. of the urban population will still live within a mile of the nearest post office and the majority within half a mile.</p>

A regulatory impact assessment is produced for all SIs that have a cost to or benefit for business, and copies are available from the Libraries of the House.</p>

However, regulations are necessary for creating open, dynamic markets and introducing minimum standards. It is important not to confuse the costs of minimum standards with red tape: over 1 million workers have benefited from the national minimum wage and over 3 million people have gained an entitlement to four weeks paid annual leave.</p>

The Act extends this requirement to digital cable and satellite broadcasters for the first time.</p>

	<p pid=".130W.13/1">The criteria set for switchover are that: everyone who can currently get the main public service broadcasting channels in analogue form must be able to receive them on digital systems; switching to digital is an affordable option for the vast majority of people; and as a target indicator of affordability, 95 per cent. of consumers must have access to digital equipment. The objective of the Digital Television Action Plan Project is to ensure these criteria are met so that we can, if we choose, take the decision to proceed to full switchover by ordering the switching off by 2010 of analogue terrestrial transmissions.</p>

To that end we have set two Public Service Agreement targets for the 2003&ndash;06 period: an 8 per cent. increase in adult C2DE visitors to the national museums and galleries; and 500,000 visits by new users, predominantly from social classes C2DE and ethnic minorities, to regional hub museums participating in the Renaissance in the Regions programme.</p>

Two of the programme's eight priority areas&mdash;reaching a wider community and improving access to knowledge and information&mdash;are particularly relevant. Funding for the programme is &pound;60 million during the 2003&ndash;06 period. The grant in aid the Department provides to the national museums and galleries also supports the social inclusion activities they undertake.</p>

	<p pid=".134W.2/1">Free admission together with investment in new galleries has enabled more people to see and appreciate the great collections of the national museums and visit them more frequently. Visits to the former charging museums rose from 9 million in 1998&ndash;99 to 15.3 million in 2002&ndash;03, an increase of 71 per cent. There is a good mix of new and repeat visitors. In consequence earned income from trading has held up well and was greater in 2002&ndash;03 than in 2001&ndash;02 before the introduction of full free admission. There is therefore no reason to suppose that free access has inhibited care of collections. All those museums that went free received year-on-year compensation for loss of admissions income.</p>

	<p pid=".136W.5/2">There is significant overlap between NOF and the Community Fund and an opportunity in merging them to create a new, dynamic Lottery distributor, more responsive, more streamlined and better able to exploit opportunities for joining up funding streams.

	<p pid=".136W.5/3">The new body will continue funding for charities and the voluntary sector, and health, education and the environment, and will also assume the Millennium Commission's ability to fund large scale regenerative projects.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.5/4">Establishing the new body will require primary legislation. We are encouraging NOF and the Community Fund to work as closely together as possible in the meantime to begin to exploit the synergies between the two bodies and to ensure that full merger can happen quickly when the legislation is in place.</p>

This does not include the amount raised by the local authority through council tax. Most of the funding is paid as general grant and it is not therefore possible to provide a figure for the amount of this funding which was targeted on specific services. Funding for grants within AEF are paid through local authorities.</p>

For Shire districts, the floor was raised from 2.2 per cent. to 3.0 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".147W.0/3">Without the application of floors and ceilings, Southend-on-Sea would have received &pound;125.829 million, a decrease of 0.5 per cent., before the pre-Budget Statement, and &pound;126.993 million, an increase of 0.4 per cent., after the pre-Budget Statement. These increases are obviously below the floor. However in addition to the floors the Government also announced that no authority would receive a smaller grant increase than the increase in their schools FSS. This increased Southend-on-Sea's grant above the 4 per cent. floor to &pound;131.519 million before the pre-Budget Statement. The &pound;4,142 increase in grant received by Southend-on-Sea following the pre-Budget Statement was a consequence of the technical adjustment to the base position for floors and ceilings made for new capital investment.</p>

	<p pid=".157W.8/2">As a result they are not able to make decisions about CTF accounts. In these circumstances the Inland Revenue will open a stakeholder account CTF account on behalf of the child.

The analysis can be obtained from the House of Commons Library or from the National Statistics website at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. It includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey. This is a sample survey covering about 7,500 households in the UK and sample sizes are only sufficient to give approximate estimates for pensioner households.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/5" class="indent">Pensioner households have been defined as those where the Head of Household is retired or unoccupied and aged 65 or more and male, or 60 years of age or more and female, and economically inactive. Answers to other recent parliamentary questions about council tax broken down by household type, relating to 2001&ndash;02, have used the definition of the Household Reference Person rather than the Head of Household. Detailed information on the definition of these identifiers can be found on the National Statistics website.</p>
	<p pid=".158W.2/6" class="indent">Council tax is not paid in Northern Ireland. Estimates for 1997&ndash;98 for Great Britain are shown in the following table for gross and net council tax as a percentage of disposable income for all pensioner households (single and couples) and non pensioner households, and for all households. Equivalised income has been used to divide households into quintiles. However, the estimates of Council tax as a percentage of income use unequivalised rather than equivalised income (i.e. without the adjustment for household size). Equivalisation is a standard methodology that takes into account the size and composition of households and adjusts their incomes to recognise differing demands on resources. It is used for ranking households in particular. It is more usual to analyse unequivalised income in relation to expenditure items (which are unequivalised) such as Council tax. However, if the same equivalisation factors were applied to income and expenditure, the factors would cancel each other out and the percentages would remain the same.</p>

	<p pid=".159W.2/4" class="indent">Estimates in the following table are produced from the Office for National Statistics' analysis &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income&quot; published on the National Statistics website on October 21st 2003 at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. The analysis includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey. This is a sample survey covering about 7,500 households in the UK and sample sizes are only sufficient to give approximate estimates. In particular, results for the lowest quintile are less reliable than for others because of greater variability and because it includes households with members in a state of occupational transition.</p>
	<p pid=".159W.2/5" class="indent">The table shows for 2001&ndash;02, the average disposable income and average gross council tax paid by all households in Great Britain and for each income quintile group where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. Although equivalised income has been used to divide households into quintiles, the estimates of average disposable income and average gross council tax are unequivalised. Equivalisation is a standard methodology that takes into account the size and composition of households and adjusts their incomes to recognise differing demands on resources, and is used for ranking households in particular. However, it is more usual to analyse unequivalised income in relation to an expenditure item such as Council tax which is not equivalised.</p>

	<p pid=".160W.5/1">Estimates of central Government gross debt interest depend on a combination of factors. In the PBR projection there is a large increase between 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04, mainly due to higher RPI inflation in 2003&ndash;04, and between 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05, mainly due to assumed interest rates, based on market expectations, which are much higher in 2004&ndash;05, and a larger rise in the RPI. The increase in debt interest between 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 is smaller because assumed interest rates rise by less than in the previous year and RPI inflation is lower.</p>

	<p pid=".163W.2/1">Many heritage and conservation charities benefit from a special exemption which means they can offer free admission to donors, without that admission being regarded as a benefit under Gift Aid rules. This was originally introduced in 1989 and applied to deed of covenant arrangements. Since the change to Gift Aid in April 2000 an increasing number of heritage and conservation charities are granting free admission in return for a donation equal to the entrance fee. Charities are able to claim Gift Aid on such donations. This is an undesirable and unintended side effect of the Gift Aid legislation. It is unfair for some charities to be able to reclaim Gift Aid whilst others cannot.</p>
	<p pid=".163W.2/2">The amendments to the legislation will ensure that the special exemption for certain heritage and conservation charities applies as it was originally intended and not to &quot;day memberships&quot; of this kind.</p>
	<p pid=".163W.2/3">The Government will be consulting closely with charities which might be affected, through their associations and representative bodies, on the detail of how the change may be best achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".163W.2/4">Information on the amount repaid in relation to admission charges is not available, as there is no mechanism within Gift Aid to distinguish amounts repaid to charities according to the type of the donation. For this reason there are no estimates available of the cost to charities of the ending of the relief on admission charges.</p>
	<p pid=".163W.2/5">Information about individual organisations claiming Gift Aid is not available; Exemption 15 (Statutory and other restrictions) of the Open Government Code applies.</p>

	<p pid=".177W.2/2">The focus of the work on cardiac arrhythmia is on early diagnosis for this group of patients. The Department is investing in diagnosis, investigation and treatment of cardiac related problems. In November 2001, the Department announced &pound;65 million from the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) and &pound;60 million from the Department of Health to enable the rapid expansion of facilities for angiography, to fund 89 new or replacement catheterisation laboratories.</p>

We are introducing a new, more streamlined patient process in modernised sites. We are looking at ways to increase the number of trained audiologists in the longer term and are encouraging partnerships between national health service trusts and high street registered hearing aid dispensers to increase capacity and make NHS hearing aids available, free of charge, from an increasing number of convenient locations.</p>

	<p pid=".186W.2/1">We recognised that the Department must change to reflect recent changes in the national health service and social care. It was clear that, with the Government's focus on shifting power to the frontline and the formation of many independent bodies, the Department's role and functions would reduce. We decided a reduction of at least a third was necessary to reflect our new role in providing strategic direction and leadership to the NHS and social care.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.2/2">The radical Change Programme will reduce the size of the core Department by 1,400&mdash;from over 3,600 posts to 2,200&mdash;by October 2004. This represents a 38 per cent. reduction at the centre. Half of those posts will not be replaced and will be achieved by efficiency savings, while the rest of the reduction will result from transferring posts to other national bodies, which are also the subject of review.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.2/3">We have indicated our intention to maintain the current proportion of Departmental staff in Leeds and London. The final numbers at each location are yet to be finalised. We estimate that most of the reductions will be through natural turnover or early retirements. A voluntary scheme has already been launched for those over 50. The Department has had a 'vacancy freeze' in place for the last six months, to ensure staff are given the best opportunities to seek alternative posts, and we are actively monitoring turnover. The Department is using professional support to help those staff affected by the changes.</p>

	<p pid=".196W.5/1">The Department has made a significant investment in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) of some &pound;105 million over the period 2000&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.5/2">A number of positive outcomes have been reported including improved access to specialist services, the development of new services for groups that traditionally have found it difficult to access CAMHS and better support to other agencies. In particular, this additional investment has led to a significant increase in multi-disciplinary and joint working across professions and agencies, engaging key local players in the development of the service.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.5/3">But this is only the first stage in a continuing programme of radical improvements in the quality and quantity of CAMHS. Our current public service agreement target provides for an expansion of the service by at least 10 per cent. per year for the next three years, leading to a comprehensive service, able to respond to all children with mental health needs in all areas, by 2006. This development is underpinned by over &pound;250 million of additional funding, including &pound;140 million for local authorities.</p>

We have also said that we do not think a universal ban on smoking in all public places is justified while we can make fast and substantial progress in partnership with industry. Over the years we have seen real increases in smoke-free workplaces. In 1996, 40 per cent. of people reported their workplace as being completely smoke-free. The latest figures for 2002 show this has risen to 50 per cent. We look forward to faster and more substantial progress from employers and businesses.</p>

	<p pid=".213W.0/1">Our policy is to give priority to helping people who may have difficulty in paying charges, rather than extending the exemption arrangements. We have no plans to change the current charging arrangements. However, people receiving certain benefits or tax credits do not have to pay. Those who would otherwise have to pay may seek help through the National Health Service Low Income Scheme.</p>
