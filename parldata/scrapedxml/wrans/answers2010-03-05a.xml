	<p pid="a.1416W.0/2">For example we have recently conducted Portfolio Reviews in the Education and Health sectors which have shown that DFID is delivering excellent value. DFID's bilateral aid to the education sector, delivered through Government systems, funds an estimated 5 million children through primary school. This aid is funding more children in developing countries than the number attending primary schools in the UK at just 2 per cent. of the cost. Similar reviews on Governance and Civil Society are currently under way.</p>

The needs assessment will take a broad based approach to what is needed to achieve the MDGs, retaining aid as a central component, while also taking account of other issues such as trade, aid effectiveness, climate change and international and domestic policy frameworks. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is currently undertaking this assessment and is due to produce a report in May.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-03-05a.319609.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-03-05a.1420W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1421" speakername="Helen Goodman" colnum="1420W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100305/text/100305w0002.htm#10030529009057">
	<p pid="a.1420W.2/1">Council tax benefit provides financial assistance with payment of council tax bills to people on low income and plays an important role in helping to combat pensioner and child poverty. Modernising and simplifying the claims process is a key part of the Department's strategy to increase benefit take-up among both pensioners and people of working age. We are also introducing a range of measures to improve awareness among staff, customers and advisers of the help that council tax benefit can give to people both in and out of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1420W.2/2">The main focus of activity to help poorer pensioners has been the automation of the claims process. In December 2005 a shortened, three page claim form was introduced for housing benefit and council tax benefit replacing a claim form that ran to 28 pages. Completion of the form was undertaken on behalf of the customer by officials in the Pension, Disability and Carers Service at the same time as a claim to pension credit was made over the telephone. The form was then sent to the customer to check and sign and return to the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1420W.2/3">From November 2008, the need for the customer to complete and sign a claim form was removed and housing benefit and council tax benefit claims data have been sent direct to the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1420W.2/4">This automated claims process has been further enhanced and since January 2010, all local authorities are able to receive secure electronic transfer of data making the claiming process virtually automatic for all pensioner customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1420W.2/5">Jobcentre Plus has successfully rolled out a new process which makes claiming benefits, including council tax benefit, easier and faster for people moving into and out of employment. The in and out of work process involves Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and local authorities, working with Jobcentre Plus to smooth the transition for customers moving in and out of work reducing the number of organisations the customer has to contact at the point they make a new claim or when they start work. Jobcentre Plus gathers all the information and evidence that is needed for housing benefit, council tax benefit and tax credits improving the speed and accuracy of information sharing so that the right benefit is paid more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1420W.2/6">The Department continues to explore ways to make the claiming process more automatic through wider use of data sharing and also by data matching to assist local authorities to identify customers with potential entitlement. It will continue to look for service improvements on offer to pensioners for example by partnership working with local authorities and other agencies and signposting to the most appropriate contact point too pursue a benefit claim.</p>

	<p pid="a.1423W.8/1">Attendance allowance provides an important non-contributory, non-income-related and tax free cash contribution towards the extra costs of severely disabled people. The Government are committed to providing real help to disabled people, particularly through the early stages of economic recovery. This is why the Chancellor announced in the December 2009 pre-Budget report that attendance allowance would be increased by 1.5 per cent.-bringing forward help when it is most needed.

	<p pid="a.1425W.6/8" class="indent">Demonstration of understanding by audit: In all benefits the initial cases produced by the trainee are target monitored by an experienced medical adviser and the training cannot be considered as complete until the HCP has demonstrated that their work is acceptable. Whenever any problems are identified appropriate feedback is provided. Further cases are monitored until the work is shown to be satisfactory.

	<p pid="a.1427W.3/1">It is difficult to predict the cost of mutual recognition of concessionary travel bus passes across the devolved Administrations because the precise pattern of passholder travel is not knowable in advance. However, the Department for Transport has commissioned some research and this suggested that mutual recognition, excluding Northern Ireland, could cost in the region of &#163;11 million per annum. This does not take into account the potentially significant costs of harmonisation of the different concessionary travel schemes which apply in England, Wales and Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="a.1431W.2/1">The following five star hotels were booked for civil servants carrying out official duties. SFO policy is that hotel expenditure should meet the SFO hotel booking policy which compares favourably with wider Government service policies. Hotels with five star ratings have only been selected in exceptional circumstances where other lower ratings were not available or suitable. The geographical location of the hotels has not been specified because all the bookings related to investigations conducted by the Serious Fraud Office into possible criminal activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.1433W.2/1">The Government have put in place a programme of national health service investment and reform since 1997 to improve service delivery in all parts of the United Kingdom. 93 per cent. of people nationally now rate the NHS as good or excellent. The NHS Constitution contains 25 rights and 14 pledges for patients and the public including new rights to be treated within 18 weeks, or be seen by a cancer specialist within two weeks and an NHS health check every five years for those aged 40 to 74 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/2">There is significant evidence that these policies have yielded considerable benefits for the Great Grimsby constituency. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/3" class="indent">Figures for December 2009 show that in the North East Lincolnshire Care Trust Plus:</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/4" class="indent">99 per cent. of patients whose treatment involved admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/5" class="indent">99 per cent. of patients whose treatment did not involve admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/6" class="indent">In December 2009, at the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 98.5 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in accident and emergency from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge.</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/7" class="indent">Between September 2002 and September 2008, the number of consultants at the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has increased from 120 to 141. Between September 2002 and September 2008 the estimated number of nurses has increased from 1,646 to 1,826.</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/8" class="indent">Between September 2001 and September 2008 the number of general practitioners (GPs) per 100,000 within the North East Lincolnshire Care Trust Plus has increased from 55.9 to 62.6.</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/9" class="indent">96.3 per cent. of urgent GP referrals to the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of the referral (as at December 2009).</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/10" class="indent">In July 2009, a new GP-led health centre opened in Grimsby town centre. The health centre is open from 8 am until 8 pm, seven days a week, 365 days a year, and offers bookable appointments and walk-in services for any member of the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/11" class="indent">There is one publicly funded scheme in the area that serves this constituency: a &#163;12 million women and children's unit at the Diana Princess of Wales Hospital, which opened in February 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/12">Although statistical information is not available at a local level, Great Grimsby will have also benefitted from national policies in other areas. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/13" class="indent">Since 1997, gross current expenditure on personal social services has increased by around 70 per cent. in real terms with around 105,000 households now receiving intensive home care and 3,076 new extra care housing units-exceeding the original target of 1,500 new extra care units.</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/14">Other strategies currently being implemented are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/15" class="indent">Subject to parliamentary approval, the Personal Care at Home Bill will guarantee free personal care for 280,000 people with the highest needs and help around 130,000 people who need home care for the first time to regain their independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1433W.2/16" class="indent">'Shaping the Future of Care Together' Green Paper, published in July 2009, sets out a vision of a National Care Service for all adults in England which is fair, simple and affordable.

	<p pid="a.1439W.3/2">Copyright is a private property right. In the vast majority of cases of copyright infringement, the law provides this is a civil wrong. As such it is not for Government to intervene in the enforcement of a private right. The Government are however aware of the need to ensure that the copyright framework is fit for purpose, such that copyright owners are able to take action to enforce their own rights if appropriate. Our proposals in the Digital Economy Bill will improve the options available to copyright owners in the case of online infringement of their rights. Our strategy published last October, 'Copyright-the way ahead: A Strategy for Copyright in the Digital Age', takes a broader view at changes that may be necessary to keep pace with developments. It can be found at:</p>

As part of this framework, the Digital Economy Bill will introduce increased financial penalties for online and physical copyright infringement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1444W.3/3">This covered copyright issues relating to a range of creative industries, including the music industry, and made a number of commitments which we are working to deliver. These include measures in the Digital Economy Bill to combat online infringement of copyright.</p>
	<p pid="a.1444W.3/4">The music industry is of course an integral part of the creative economy, for which the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has responsibility. DCMS works closely with the music industry on a wide range of issues and, among other things, is setting up a number of community music rehearsal spaces around England in order to encourage and develop grass-roots talent. 'Creative Britain-New Talents for the New Economy', published in February 2008, and 'Digital Britain', published in June 2009, set the strategic direction for the Government's work to support the creative and digital sectors respectively and a programme of work in these areas is ongoing.</p>

	<p pid="a.1444W.6/2">I have recently received a number of representations from photographers about Clause 42 of the Digital Economy Bill which covers the treatment of Orphan Works and Extended Licensing. Some of these have also referred to the question of attribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1444W.6/3">UK law provides certain &quot;moral rights&quot;, including that photographers and creators of other works may assert their right to be identified as the author when their work is used for certain purposes. There are, however, a number of exceptions including where a work is intended for use in a newspaper, magazine or similar periodical. I am aware that some photographers would like to see the law changed to require attribution in all cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1444W.6/4">As my Noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Postal Affairs and Employment Relations explained in the debates on the Digital Economy Bill, the Government have noted the concerns of creators (including photographers) and will be keeping the issue under review. The Strategic Advisory Board for Intellectual Property is already looking at the broader issue of moral rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.1445W.2/2">Mail volumes continue to decline, by 8 per cent. in the first half of the financial year (April to Sept 2009), due to increased use of digital methods of communication.

Royal Mail and the CWU are currently discussing a wide ranging agreement covering modernisation of the postal network.</p>

Both delegations set out their respective positions on sovereignty and the UK also set out how the UK needed to bear in mind its treaty obligations with the US and our ongoing need of the British Indian Ocean Territory for defence purposes. There was mutual discussion of fishing rights, environmental concerns, the continental shelf and future visits to the Territory by Chagossians.</p>
	<p pid="a.1447W.5/2">During the <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-21">21 July</phrase> meeting both delegations reiterated their respective positions on sovereignty and resettlement as expressed at the first round of talks held in London on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-14">14 January</phrase>. The delegations agreed on the desirability of a co-ordinated submission to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf for an extended continental shelf in the Chagos Archipelago/BIOT region. A joint technical team would be set up with officials from both sides to look into the possibilities of a co-ordinated response. The UK delegation proposed that consideration be given to the possible creation of a Marine Protected Area (MPA), which the Mauritians agreed in principle. The UK delegation agreed to examine the Mauritian proposal to set up a mechanism to look into the joint issuing of fishing licences for BIOT waters, and stated that such examination would also include consideration of the implications of the proposed MPA.</p>
	<p pid="a.1447W.5/3">UK relations with Mauritius are broad and deep, with regular contacts at all levels. The UK is Mauritius' largest trade partner and second largest tourism market. The UK and Mauritius have many shared international priorities and, subject to regional voting constraints, the UK and Mauritian Governments frequently take the same positions in international fora. Within regional blocs, such as the African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC), Mauritius is often a voice supporting UK aims. The Government also supports, through the EU, structural adjustment of the Mauritian economy to cope with the loss of sugar preferences. The UK will continue to develop this relationship-later in the year, we will be marking the 200<sup>(th)</sup> Anniversary of UK involvement in Mauritius. More immediately, the Privy Council will hold their second sitting in Mauritius this April.</p>

	<p pid="a.1470W.5/3">NOMS is also fully engaged in action to address serious and organised crime strategically, including the work identified in the Government report &quot;Extending Our Reach: A Comprehensive Approach to Tackling Serious Organised Crime&quot; to develop a strategy to manage serious organised criminals while in prison.</p>

	<p pid="a.1470W.8/2">The re-designation, which took effect on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-02">2 March 2009</phrase>, allowed NOMS to more effectively provide for the needs of all women prisoners through greater flexibility in the use of the estate. It has also improved closeness to home for some women, supported the placement of indeterminate sentenced women in accordance with their needs, and in general enabled more women to access the resettlement regimes available at these two prisons. There was no requirement to move any of the women out of either prison as a result of the change. Both establishments retained their levels of internal and perimeter security and their resettlement regimes, including their roles as specialist foreign national centres. Women suitable for open conditions are able to go these prisons if such a move meets their resettlement needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1471W.2/1">The Government are committed to reducing the number of mobile phones in prisons. We have already strengthened the law through the Offender Management Act 2007, which made it an offence with a penalty of up to two years' imprisonment to bring a mobile phone or component into a prison. We are also taking forward legislation through the Crime and Security Bill to criminalise the possession of devices, including mobile telephones within a prison without authorisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1471W.2/2">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) does not hold centrally disaggregated information on the location or ownership of phones seized. Many phones and component parts are not attributable to individuals. Prisons in England and Wales are instructed to send mobile phones and SIM cards found to a central unit for analysis, it is from this unit's records that this answer is based. The figures contained in the tables have been drawn from administrative data systems. Although care is taken when processing data, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system. These data are not subject to audit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1471W.2/3">The figures understate the actual number of finds, because they do not include items retained by the police for evidential purposes and phones not submitted for other reasons. It is not always appropriate to send phones to the central unit and some phones sent are not interrogated. These have not been included in these figures. NOMS is putting in place new procedures to improve the accuracy of these statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.1471W.2/4">Tackling mobile phones in prison presents substantial and increasing technological challenges, and while the numbers of phones found clearly indicates the scale of the challenge, it is also a reflection of prisons' increasing success in finding them and better reporting. The following tables show the number of mobile phones and SIM cards that have been received from each of the prisons over the last 12 months.</p>

The National Offender Management Service does not hold a centrally disaggregated record of the data found on illicit mobile phones found in prisons.

	<p pid="a.1490W.5/4" class="indent">Civil servants transferring within the Department in the UK may stay in temporary accommodation when they are sent on a long-term temporary basis to a different work location outside of reasonable daily travel of their home. They may also stay in temporary accommodation for a short period prior to occupying their permanent home following a transfer in the UK to a location which gives help with relocation expenses. The number of employees staying in temporary accommodation following a permanent or temporary transfer constantly fluctuates as employees enter or leave the accommodation. To obtain the numbers for each month would involve disproportionate cost, but on average, there are 250+ employees staying in temporary accommodation at any one time. This may be in private rented accommodation, service messes or staying with family or friends in the new area. Costs for each of the last 12 months are as follows:</p>

However, civil servants who are transferred on permanent terms to a new location where they may receive help with relocation costs may be eligible to receive assistance with Additional Housing Costs Allowance (AHCA).

It is payable for nine years (inclusive of a taper in the last four years). There are currently 1300 employees in receipt of AHCA at some point in the nine year cycle.

	<p pid="a.1493W.12/1">The UK recently announced a &#163;4.9 million collaboration on solar technology, led by Research Councils UK with matched funding from the Indian Department of Science and Technology. Two projects will run for three years each with a focus on creating cheaper, more effective solar panel technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.1493W.12/2">As part of the Joint Declaration by the UK and India on civil nuclear co-operation, the two countries have agreed to jointly encourage research collaboration in this area.

The costs of this first step will be shared between the two parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1493W.12/3">DFID is supporting renewable energy initiatives in remote areas through development programmes in Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. In Orissa the project is focused on provision of solar lighting and in Madhya Pradesh it is focused on biogas cooking units.

	<p pid="a.1493W.12/4">DFID is supporting power sector reforms in two states, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, with an objective to achieve more efficient public sector units. The initiative in West Bengal is in partnership with the Department of Power and Non-conventional Energy Sources, Government of West Bengal (up to &#163;11 million from June 2008 to March 2011). DFID has also supported capacity building of the power sector in West Bengal through the World Bank Trust Fund (up to $300,000 from June 2005 to March 2009). In Madhya Pradesh the power sector reforms project (2008-10, &#163;20.4 million) supported evaluation of renewables in three key sectors (1) small scale industries, (2) municipal building and (3) water and waste water treatment. Under the next phase DFID India will be providing support to build capacity of the State Renewable Energy Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1493W.12/5">DFID have also announced plans to provide the Energy and Resource Institute (TERI) with up to &#163;10 million over the next five years. This funding will help to bring electricity and clean energy to millions of the world's poorest people by supporting renewable energy projects in India. As is routine, DFID is undertaking a full institutional assessment of TERI as part of their due diligence process before releasing funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1493W.12/6">Also with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, DFID is providing &#163;285,000 through Winrock International India to develop sustainable business models for access to energy in remote rural areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.1497W.0/2">This winter we witnessed an increase in the price of heating oil, both wholesale and retail. Wholesale heating oil prices reached a peak of $729.75 (<phrase class="date" code="2010-01-08">8 January 2010</phrase>), a 14-month high.

While distributors faced access problems due to poor weather conditions, heating oil prices are driven primarily by demand changes and crude prices, which increased in the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1497W.0/3">The peak in prices follows on from a general upward trend in the price of heating oil and crude oil since the beginning of 2009. However current prices are still well below the record levels reached in July 2008. Indeed the retail heating oil price is currently 42.20p/l (<phrase class="date" code="2010-03-01">1 March 2010</phrase>), 33 per cent. below the 2008 peak, while the wholesale heating oil price is currently $689/tonne (<phrase class="date" code="2010-03-01">1 March 2010</phrase>), 53 per cent. below the 2008 peak.</p>

	<p pid="a.1502W.0/1">The Home Office has introduced a range of policies and initiatives since 1997. However, it is not always possible to quantify their effects particularly at constituency level. The available statistical information therefore relates to North East Lincolnshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.0/2">In terms of police recorded crime in North East Lincolnshire, between 2002-03 and 2008-09, total recorded crime fell by 26 per cent. More specifically:</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.0/3" class="indent">Violence against the person-up 16 per cent. (down 1 per cent. in last year)</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.0/4" class="indent">Sexual offences-down 30 per cent. (up 8 per cent. in last year)</p>

	<p pid="a.1502W.0/10" class="indent">Drug offences-up 16 per cent. (down 26 per cent. in last year) (there has been increased recording of drug offences which was mainly attributable to the increased use of police powers to issue cannabis warnings).</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.0/11">Data prior to 2002-03 is not directly comparable because of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002. Additionally, no data at borough level is available prior to 1998-99.</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.0/12">Cleethorpes comes within the North East Lincolnshire Basic Command Unit. North East Lincolnshire BCU had 263 police officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase>. The number of police officers has decreased by 115 since 2003. This decrease in numbers is due to the transfer of various functions from divisions to central services i.e. Command Centres, Traffic Units etc. Also, the recruitment of civilian Investigation Officers and Detention Officers across Humberside Police Force has contributed to the drop in police officer numbers. Comparisons with 1997 for North East Lincolnshire BCU are not available. There were 49 Police Community Support Officers as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March 2009</phrase> while there were none in existence in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.0/13">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 saw positive effects with the statutory duty to create a Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP). The CDRP (Safer Communities North East Lincolnshire) has brought new ways of working in a cross cutting way with the police, council and other key stakeholders and genuine partnership working to help tackle complex issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.0/14">The CDRP paved the way for a number of community safety initiatives which have benefited Cleethorpes. North East Lincolnshire has received funding under the Home Office Crime Reduction Programme and successor initiatives including the Safer and Stronger Communities Fund and the Basic Command Unit Fund. It has also benefited from other targeted Home Office funding streams which support work on drugs and alcohol harm reduction, domestic abuse, neighbourhood crime and justice, and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.0/15">The Home Office Partnership Support Programme helped review CDRP delivery structures and the future strategic development of the district's CCTV system. North East Lincolnshire is currently in receipt of funding from the Vigilance Programme which is helping to accelerate the development of Integrated Offender Management. This is seen as the next step in achieving further sustainable reductions in crime across the district.</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.0/16">Before 1997 there were no bespoke powers to tackle antisocial behaviour but there are now a range of powers to deal with this issue. These include Anti-Social Behaviour Orders and Designated Public Places Orders (DPPO) from the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.1502W.0/17">North East Lincolnshire's CDRP and wider partnership approach has been recognised nationally as effective practice. For example, the delivery of its Family Intervention Programme, which joins-up the resources of several Government Departments, and its work on reducing antisocial behaviour and providing visible neighbourhood justice.</p>
