	<p pid="a.172W.2/1">It is not possible to estimate the number of sham marriages taking place in the UK for the purpose of attempting to gain the right to live and work in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.2/2">Civil Registrars are legally obligated under s24 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1999 to report any prospective marriages or civil partnerships they believe may be being contracted for the purposes of circumventing immigration control to the UK Border Agency (UKBA). UKBA holds data on the number of s24 reports of suspicious marriages made by civil registrars but these are allegations and not proof of a sham marriage. S24 reports also do not cover marriages taking place in the Anglican Church in England and Wales, where the clergy are not under the same legal obligation, or those identified by UK Border Agency case workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.2/3">To the end of September 2010 665 s24 reports have been received in UKBA, this reflects an increase on the total 2009 figure of 561 but this increase reflects the raising of awareness among registrars that our work to tackle the problem has generated rather than a rise in the number of sham marriages.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.2/4">We are working closely with both the civil registration authorities and the Anglican Church in England and Wales who are all committed to helping us tackle the problem of sham marriage. We are providing training and awareness sessions and working to develop closer links between register offices and Dioceses at a local level as early detection is key to preventing foreign nationals gaining an immigration advantage from a sham marriage.</p>
	<p pid="a.172W.2/5">Entering into a sham marriage does not automatically entitle a foreign national to the right to live and work in the UK and all couples must provide comprehensive evidence to UKBA that they are in a genuine and subsisting relationship for any leave to be granted. All couples are subject to the same robust case working processes and we are working to strengthen these further. UK Border Agency has the power to refuse to grant leave if it is suspected that a marriage has taken place solely for immigration purposes and we have the power to revoke leave granted as a result of a sham marriage.</p>

One of the impacts that has been described in this report is the shifting distribution of mackerel. Fisheries scientists at CEFAS and Marine Scotland have stated there is still much uncertainty around whether or not this is a transient phenomenon associated with observed cold seawater temperatures off Norway in the winter of 2009-10, whether this simply reflects a spreading out of the mackerel population to new areas because the mackerel stock is currently large and densely distributed, or whether it reflects a long-term shift in migration routes. The impact and consequences that such changes might have on the effectiveness of fishery closure areas and allocation of quotas between countries in the long-term also remain uncertain.</p>

	<p pid="a.183W.0/1">Innovation, diversity and flexibility are at the heart of the Free Schools policy. We want the dynamism that characterises the best independent schools to drive up standards in the State sector. In this spirit we will not be setting overly prescriptive requirements in relation to qualifications: instead we will expect business cases to demonstrate how Governing Bodies intend to guarantee the highest quality of teaching and leadership in their schools. Free Schools are legally Academies, and as in Academies generally head teachers are not required to hold the National Professional Qualification for Headship. No school will be allowed to proceed unless its proposals for quality teaching are soundly based. Ensuring each Free School's unique educational vision is translated into the classroom will require talented people with a diverse range of experience.</p>

We believe that the way to secure sustainable improvement is to give responsibility to schools and for schools to learn from other schools. Our aim will be to challenge and support schools in a robust and clear manner. Central to our approach, especially in tackling the most significant areas of underperformance, will be our Academies programme, and schools working together to share best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.188W.2/3">We have also allocated &#163;110 million to establish an education endowment fund (EEF) designed to raise standards in underperforming schools.

	<p pid="a.188W.6/1">There are no immediate plans to introduce mutual recognition of concessionary bus passes across the UK. Concessionary travel is a devolved policy area so the arrangements in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland differ from those in England. The Concessionary Bus Travel Act 2007 contains a power to allow, through future regulations, for mutual recognition of bus passes across the UK. Regular discussions take place at official level with the devolved Administrations. Various technical and resource issues would need to be resolved before mutual recognition could be pursued.</p>

After considering this analysis, the Government decided to limit reduction in BSOG to 20%.</p>
	<p pid="a.188W.12/2">To help estimate sub-national impacts we have used the Department's new National Bus Model.

	<p pid="a.190W.5/1">Current motorway standards do not necessitate permanent 50 mph speed limits. Some older motorways designed in the 1960s, and some motorways in urban areas, which do not meet the current visibility requirements or which have sub-standard geometric features, have had lower speed limits introduced appropriate to the visibility and geometry to improve safety. The principle criterion used to determine the speed limit is forward visibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.190W.5/2">National advice on setting temporary speed limits for road works is given in Traffic Signs Manual, chapter 8, section D3.7. This identifies appropriate speed limits based on the relative risk to road users posed by the barriers, cones etc which are used to provide protection to road workers. This risk is normally the same whether road workers are present or not and speed limits therefore need to be in place even when workers are not on-site. The Highways Agency produced additional advice in July 2007 (Chief Highways Engineer Memo 203/07) on how to apply temporary speed limits at road works using the risk based approach in chapter 8. This advice applies to the motorway network in England; the application of this advice on other motorways is the responsibility of the relevant highway authority.</p>

Next month I intend to issue for consultation a Code of Recommended Practice, under section 2 of the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980. This will address issues such as the scope, formatting and timing of the duty to publish the data. In the meantime the Local Public Data Panel has published guidance on spend transparency, which the Local Government Association has taken as a basis for its practical guides for councils on publication of &#163;500 spend and senior salaries. The Code of Recommended Practice will not cover data archiving and legacy issues. This is an important and complex issue with implications for many bodies and is being considered in a broader context.</p>

	<p pid="a.220W.5/1">The Defence Training Rationalisation (DTR) project had already delivered some efficiencies in how tri-service training is managed. The project was terminated because it became clear that Metrix could not deliver an affordable, commercially robust proposal within the prescribed period. However, technical training collocated on as few sites as possible remains the best solution for our armed forces and we are working on assessing other options which will seek to create similar efficiencies to DTR.</p>

	<p pid="a.225W.5/73">The decision not to bring the Nimrod MRA4 into service was difficult. Since the withdrawal of the Nimrod MR2 in March 2010, the Ministry of Defence has sought to mitigate the gap in capability through the use of other military assets, including Type 23 Frigates, Merlin anti-submarine warfare helicopters and Hercules C-130 aircraft, and by relying, where appropriate, on assistance from allies and partners. Although it was originally assumed that such measures would only be required for a limited period of time, we are now developing a longer-term plan to mitigate the impact of cancellation.</p>

	<p pid="a.230W.6/1">I have regular conversations with my EU colleagues on Afghanistan through the Foreign Affairs Council which discuss the strategic direction of Afghanistan. The allocation of funding is made via the Development Cooperation Instrument and the UK has lobbied successfully for Afghanistan to get a greater share of EU financial assistance to Asia. At the recent mid-term review the allocation was increased from &#8364;150 million per year during 2001-10 to &#8364;200 million per year for 2011-2013. We are encouraging the EU to ensure its engagement in Afghanistan is co-ordinated and targeted, by following an accelerated EU action plan.</p>

	<p pid="a.238W.3/1">The recently published skills strategy ('Skills for Sustainable Growth') sets out our intention to reform adult learning and skills over the remainder of this Parliament and point the way to growth in the longer term. High quality adult education is at the heart of this strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.3/2">An underpinning principle of the strategy is freedom. Our ambition is to abandon a culture of bureaucratic, central, regulatory burdens, as we believe that control should be devolved from central Government to citizens and communities. This includes giving them a greater role in shaping services and improving quality. Through a combination of increasing competition between training providers; empowering learners by giving them better information about quality of adult education; and by tackling poor performance quickly and robustly, we will drive up standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.3/3">We are taking steps to improve the quality and range of information that is made available about adult education-including through the Next Step and development of sector led Further Education Public Information. This will ensure that learners and employers are better equipped to makes choices about where and what to learn. We are also improving opportunities for learners and employers to give feedback, which we expect providers themselves will use to improve the quality of the education and services they deliver. This user choice and influence will become a powerful mechanism for driving up quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.3/4">Alongside our move towards greater empowerment, we will continue to take steps through the Department and the Skills Funding Agency to improve quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.3/5">The Skills Funding Agency is committed to only contracting with high quality educational and vocational training providers. To this end, the Agency has recently introduced an Approved College and Training Organisation Register (ACTOR), which tests the capacity and capability of organisations to meet 'minimum levels of performance' that are set by this Department (in agreement with sector representative organisations). All providers that wish to be considered for public funding from the agency, for the delivery of educational and vocational training, must be approved on ACTOR. Those organisations that fail to meet the required standards will not be registered and therefore will be ineligible for funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.3/6">Where a provider is on ACTOR and has received funding and their performance subsequently drops, we will act decisively. If they fail to respond to opportunities to improve, we will withdraw a contract from any private training provider (and remove them from ACTOR) and we will close failing colleges. In order to protect the interests of the learners, we will ensure that alternative provision is secured through an excellent education provider. We will publish further details on this approach in spring 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.3/7">Ofsted will continue to inspect adult learning provision, although we are taking a more proportionate approach to inspections. Any provider who is deemed to be 'outstanding' will not be inspected (unless their performance drops). This will allow Ofsted to focus their attention on providers who cause concern, which improves our capacity to identify and tackle poor performance and quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.3/8">We will also continue to support measures to ensure we have a professionally-qualified teaching workforce, which takes responsibility for keeping its skills up-to-date and relevant. We intend to work with the teaching profession to look at how to create the conditions to encourage flexible and innovative approaches to teaching and learning, which are cost-effective, responsive to employer and learner needs, and make full use of the potential of technology. In specialist areas of provision, employer-led National Skills Academies can help spread good practice. This will support our drive to improve the learning experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.238W.3/9">Finally, the Learning and Skills Improvement Service will from April 2011 be the single sector led body responsible for supporting FE colleges and training organisations to maintain high quality in areas such as leadership and management, teaching and learning, learner support and resource utilisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.251W.0/1">Consortia of general practitioner (GP) practices working with other health and care professionals will commission the great majority of national health service services for their patients. To support GP consortia in their commissioning decisions, we will create an independent NHS Commissioning Board. The board will provide leadership for quality improvement through commissioning.

The NHS Commissioning Board will also commission the other family health services of dentistry, community pharmacy and primary ophthalmic services, as well as national and regional specialised services and prison health services, but with the influence and involvement of consortia.</p>
	<p pid="a.251W.0/3">The NHS Commissioning Board, supported by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, will develop a commissioning outcomes framework so that there is clear, publicly available information on the quality of healthcare services commissioned by consortia, including patient experience, and their management of NHS resources. It would include measures to reflect the consortium's duties to promote equality and to assess progress in reducing health inequalities.</p>

	<p pid="a.254W.0/1">There are various theories of causation of multiple sclerosis (MS), one of which is the chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCVSI) theory proposed by Dr Paolo Zamboni, a vascular surgeon in Bologna, Italy. He has suggested that MS is due to a narrowing or blockage of the veins that drain blood from the brain. The narrowing restricts the normal outflow of blood from the brain, causing alterations in the blood flow patterns within the brain that eventually causes injury to brain tissue and degeneration of neurons. Dr Zamboni believes that endovascular surgery can restore blood flow in these vessels, which lessens the symptoms of MS.</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.0/2">Dr Zamboni's first study in a group of 65 MS patients and 235 controls used ultrasound to investigate a possible association between CCSVI and MS. The study showed that while non-MS patients had normal circulation in their veins, all of the MS patients had blockages. This led to a second phase of research, which looked at whether balloon angioplasty treatment, or stent placement, would improve the symptoms of MS in the group of 65 MS patients. Dr Zamboni reported various degrees of improvement in the group, mostly among patients with the relapsing-remitting form of MS who experienced fewer flare-ups of symptoms and some improvements in quality of life. The more pronounced secondary and primary progressive patients had limited improvement after six months, and none at 18 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.0/3">Neurologists have outlined a number of limitations to Dr Zamboni's studies. The ultrasound phase of the study did not have its findings confirmed by another lab. Also, Zamboni theorised that narrowing veins caused increased deposition of iron in the brain. Iron deposition occurs in different neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease but CCSVI was not seen in the control group with neurological problems. In the second phase of the study, there was no control group who did not get the surgery and whose outcomes could be compared to the patients that did. It was not a &quot;blinded&quot; trial so the patients, and their doctors, all knew they had received the procedure, opening up the possibility of placebo effect. All the patients continued to take disease-modifying drugs, making it difficult to separate out what, if anything, improved their condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.0/4">A larger, more recent, study at the University of Buffalo's Neuroimaging Analysis Centre looked at how often CCSVI occurs in people with MS and in people without MS. The study of 500 subjects showed that 56.4% of people with MS showed signs of CCSVI, while 26.4% of healthy test subjects also exhibited signs of CCSVI. The centre is in the process of recruiting for a placebo-controlled trial of intravascular treatment with angioplasty in 30 relapsing- remitting MS patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.0/5">Venous stenosis due to developmental abnormalities was established as the primary cause of CCSVI by the International Union of Phlebology in its consensus document (published 2009), which provided guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of venous malformations. MS campaigners have suggested that this means that CCSVI is almost certainly one of the causal factors of MS.</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.0/6">Dr Zamboni's hypothesis has generated considerable optimism among people with MS for more effective treatment options. However, it has been received with caution by many experts, who find it relies on limited data to support claims that the syndrome actually exists; that it could be causative of (or a co-factor in) multiple sclerosis and that vascular treatments for the syndrome would prevent or reduce the incidence of multiple sclerosis. Larger clinical trials will be required before the theory is more widely accepted by the medical community (the Buffalo study organisers have said that CCSVI requires further investigation).</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.0/7">In the meantime, the neurology community and MS organisations across the world are recommending that MS patients do not use the proposed treatment, until its effectiveness is confirmed by controlled studies.</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.0/8">The overall future of all e-petitions is bound into the Martha Lane Fox review, which will be announced imminently. We continue to issue responses to petitions that had exceeded the 500 signature threshold as of <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-06">6 April 2010</phrase>, when the e-petitions system was suspended ahead of the 2010 general election.</p>
	<p pid="a.254W.0/9">The Department has made no assessment of the merits of making treatment for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCVSI) throughout the national health service.</p>

As part of this, the national health service will transfer some funding from the health capital budget to health revenue, to be spent on measures that support social care, which also benefits health.

For the remaining funding, we will set out specific allocations that they will transfer to local authorities for spending on social care services to benefit health, and to improve overall health gain. Primary care trusts and local authorities will need to work together to agree jointly appropriate areas for social care investment, with a shared analysis of need and a common agreement on the outcomes to be met.

	<p pid="a.264W.9/1">Assessments of the asset purchase facility can be found in the Bank of England quarterly inflation reports. In particular, the May 2009 inflation report explains how quantitative easing works to impact the economy through various channels including higher money supply, lower long-term interest rates and rising asset prices. An assessment of the impact on asset prices, in particular on the gilt market, is made in the May 2010 inflation report which says:</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.9/2" class="indent">&quot;asset purchases appear to be having a sizeable downward effect on gilt yields...equity and corporate bond prices have increased significantly since early 2009. That is likely, in part, to reflect the exceptional monetary stimulus&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.264W.9/3">The independent Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England has operational responsibility for monetary policy. It is the MPC which assesses and decides on the appropriate monetary policy stance in order to target 2% inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in the consumer prices index (CPI). This includes decisions on the use of the asset purchase facility (APF) and any further extensions.</p>

Responsibility for implementing the agreements rests with HMRC who are in regular contact with the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.272W.2/3">The agreements will facilitate better control over tobacco smuggling with enhanced co-operation from other member states as a result of better working relationships with EU partners. They will also hold the tobacco manufacturers accountable for their actions and encourage responsible trade by requiring the manufacturers to make substantial annual payments to the EU and participating member states over a period of years and to put in place measures to control the supply and distribution of their products.</p>
	<p pid="a.272W.2/4">The BAT agreement sets out the steps that the company are required to take in order to control the supply chain for their products. It also requires them to make supplemental payments to member states if their product is found smuggled to have been smuggled in significant volumes. Seizures made in the UK which qualify are notified to the European Commission by HMRC for this purpose.</p>

	<p pid="a.272W.5/2"><i> </i>The June 2010 Budget announced that the consumer prices index will be used to uprate local housing allowance rates from 2013-14. This replaces the existing system where rent officers determine the LHA rates on a monthly basis using a list of rents created for each category of property within every broad rental market area (BRMA). Our policy is designed to ensure that increases in housing benefit are more in line with the rent increases that would be affordable to families who do not claim benefits.</p>

No separate estimate has been made of the cost of uprating LHA rates by CPI compared to using the retail prices index (RPI) as the measure of inflation because it is not Government policy to uprate LHA rates by RPI.</p>

	<p pid="a.273W.5/2">The agricultural element of the Doha Development Agenda cannot be seen in isolation of the other areas under negotiation in the Doha round. A Doha deal would include new agricultural and industrial market access, increased transparency and security in services, and an improvement of the global trade rule book. It would increase UK prosperity, give the global economy a boost, and lift millions of people around the world out of poverty. To UK businesses in agriculture, like in other sectors, it would offer new export opportunities, provide cheaper inputs, reduce non-tariff barriers, and simplify bureaucratic trade procedures making it easier to do business around the world. To consumers, it would provide lower prices (especially of food), greater variety of products, and increased competition in the supply of goods and services. Globally, the benefits are estimated at &#163;110 billion annually, with the UK gaining in the range of &#163;3 billion every year in additional national income.</p>

The Government believe that ISAs are a trusted brand, and that it is important that this is maintained. The Government also believe that ISAs should be mainstream savings products. The Government therefore do not intend to allow shares listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM)-which can be riskier and less liquid-to be qualifying investments for ISAs. It is already the case that companies listed on AIM may benefit from other incentive schemes, such as investments made through the Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Trusts.</p>

	<p pid="a.275W.8/1">The independent Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England has operational responsibility for monetary policy.

	<p pid="a.275W.8/2">Assessments of quantitative easing can be found in the Bank of England quarterly inflation reports. In particular, the May 2009 inflation report explains how quantitative easing works to impact the economy through various channels including higher money supply, lower long-term interest rates and rising asset prices. An assessment of the impact on asset prices, in particular on the gilt market, is made in the May 2010 inflation report which says:</p>
	<p pid="a.275W.8/3" class="indent">&quot;asset purchases appear to be having a sizeable downward effect on gilt yields...equity and corporate bond prices have increased significantly since early 2009. That is likely, in part, to reflect the exceptional monetary stimulus&quot;.</p>

It will be responsible for looking at risks across the financial system as a whole and how financial markets interact with the wider economy. The Bank of England half-yearly financial stability reports will continue to capture such analysis.</p>

	<p pid="a.280W.0/18">Customer demand on HMRC's telephone helplines fluctuates significantly during the year, with demand peaks around key tax year deadlines. There are significant peaks in demand on the tax credits helpline in July for renewals and in August as customers who have had their payments terminated call to re-instate their awards. Performance therefore tends to be lower in this period than at other times of the year although HMRC switches advisers between helplines to manage this peak.</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.0/19">During peak periods, callers who cannot get through on their first attempt often use the redial facility on their telephone to make numerous successive calls which rapidly increases the number and proportion of unanswered calls. In addition, a combination of factors including increases in the number of renewals packs and termination notices issued has significantly increased demand on the tax credits helpline this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.280W.3/18">Customer demand on HMRC's telephone helplines fluctuates significantly during the year, with demand peaks around key tax year deadlines. There is a particular peak in demand in July and August connected with tax credits renewals and terminations and HMRC switches advisers between helplines to help manage this peak. Performance across all of HMRC's helplines, including child benefit, therefore tends to be lower in this period than at other times of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.3/19">Performance on the child benefit helpline has significantly improved in recent weeks.</p>

	<p pid="a.282W.6/1">The vast majority of tax disputes are resolved by agreement between HMRC and the taxpayer, rather than through the courts, as the most cost effective way of ensuring that tax due under the law is established and paid. HMRC is currently exploring whether use of a third party mediator would facilitate such agreements in certain cases. HMRC's approach for bringing tax disputes to a conclusion, whether by agreement with the taxpayer, or through the courts, is set out in its published Litigation and Settlement Strategy. This applies to all cases where criminal prosecution is not being pursued. HMRC's approach under this Strategy is always to seek agreed terms for settlement before going to litigation. In avoidance cases where HMRC has a strong case, it will not settle for less than 100% of the tax due.</p>

Given the interaction of tax credit measures with other benefits, it is the overall impact of measures that is important for a household. At the June Budget and the spending review, this Government have taken the unprecedented step of publishing detailed distributional analysis of the impacts of their decisions for the first time. This analysis shows that through providing extra support through the child tax credit, there is no measurable impact from modelled Budget and spending review measures on child poverty over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.285W.9/2">Furthermore, in chart B.6 (p100) in annex B of the 'Spending Review 2010' document the Government have made efforts to bring together tax, welfare and departmental expenditure limit changes together for the first time. This shows that the top 20% contribute most to the fiscal consolidation as a percentage of net income and benefits-in-kind.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-20">20 November 2009</phrase> the Sentencing Guidelines Council, predecessor to the Sentencing Council, published a sentencing guideline specifically for the sentencing of under-18s for the first time. This guideline states that custodial sentences should only be imposed as a measure of last resort. As this guideline is new there are no immediate plans to revise it, but the guideline will be subject to review if legislation is changed.</p>
