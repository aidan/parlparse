The spending review sets out how the Government will carry out Britain's unavoidable deficit reduction plan, and builds on the foundations for sustainable, balanced, private sector-led recovery set out in the Chancellor's June Budget. Alongside growth, the Government have prioritised fairness, including reforming the welfare system to put it on a sustainable long-term footing, while providing sustained routes out of poverty for the poorest. Scotland and its regions will stand to benefit from these priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.670W.0/1">The FiReControl project has been subject to repeated delays, missed milestones and failed obligations. In particular, the two main areas where EADS has not met its obligations under the Project Agreement are:</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.0/2" class="indent">The time for delivery of the project; and</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.0/3" class="indent">Building the system in accordance with the project agreement, especially compliance with the requirements and solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.0/4">In November 2008 the previous Government had to announce a substantial delay-of nine months-and less than eight months later, in July 2009, a further delay of ten months.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.0/5">I have made it clear that I now require this project to be delivered to time, cost and quality, and so we have activated a key milestone in our contract with EADS for the main IT system to be delivered in three control centres by mid-2011. This is in line with the July 2009 statement to the House and EADS's assurances given to the Communities and Local Government Select Committee in February this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.0/6">While EADS is contracted to deliver the FiReControl system to a fixed price-and must deliver within this-every delay increases all DCLG's running costs associated with the project, including staffing and maintenance of buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.0/7">Our aim is to give operational certainty for the fire and rescue service and financial certainty for the taxpayer. We are not going to provide additional public funding to bail out this contract.</p>

Rather than creating a new financial burden additional transparency should help reduce wasteful expenditure, which is why local authorities have been asked to publish such information, for example, research by Experian has highlighted that local authorities spend &#163;150 million a year on duplicate payments, which the process of transparency will help avoid.

	<p pid="a.674W.12/2"><i> (a)</i> In 2009, there were approximately 26,000 workers over the age of 21 (21% of non-salaried workers) who were recorded as being paid at lower rates than the minimums for their grade.</p>
	<p pid="a.674W.12/3">It is important to note that these earnings figures may include data for workers who are not covered by the Agricultural Wages Order. For example, this could be family workers who benefit from the profits of the business or apprentices. It could also include first year apprentices for whom the order supplies additional and lower minimum rates or trainees working as part of an approved agricultural training course. The analysis excludes those aged 21 and under to minimise these effects.</p>
	<p pid="a.674W.12/4">Therefore the proportion of workers apparently paid below the agricultural minimum wage rate might be overstated to the extent that the data will include some workers who are not protected by agricultural minimum wage rates or for whom there is a lower minimum rate.</p>

	<p pid="a.676W.3/1">The UK pesticides regulatory body-the Health and Safety Executive's Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD)-has liaised with other EU regulatory authorities that have imposed restrictions on the use of these pesticides. It also reviews developments on how risks to bee health from the use of pesticides are assessed and monitored. CRD scientists attended the 10th International Symposium of the International Commission for Plant-Bee Relationships (ICPBR) on Hazards of Pesticides to Bees, in October 2008; no new scientific evidence was presented at this meeting, or more recently, to suggest a need for changes to current UK pesticide authorisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.676W.3/2">Ministers have also considered scientific advice, including views of the independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides, on a report issued last year by a number of environmental organisations-the Buglife report 'The impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on bumblebees, honeybees and other non-target invertebrates (2009)'. The conclusion was that this report highlighted a need for data on the impacts of pesticides on overwintering of bees in the pesticides risk assessment process. This is an area where regulatory science has developed recently and which is being addressed by changes to the EU regulatory system. On the basis of current evidence there is no justification for making changes to data requirements in advance of these changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.676W.3/3">CRD would act on any substantive evidence should incidents occur in the UK and will continue to monitor research and developments in other EU member states and elsewhere to see if they are relevant to the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.678W.5/2">Local authorities' responsibilities under the Flood and Water Management Act will be fully funded by DEFRA, primarily through area-based grant, but it is too early to say what this means for expenditure in individual local authority areas. Local authorities will continue to be funded through formula grant from the Department of Communities and Local Government, and with capital grants from the Environment Agency. In addition, DEFRA will be fully funding new burdens under the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, primarily through area-based grant provided directly to each lead local flood authority. Formula grant and area-based grant will be provided unringfenced, to give local authorities the flexibility they need to meet their priorities.</p>

The Forestry Commission continues to play an important role in protecting and expanding the trees, woods and forests in England. There will be a new approach to ownership and management of woodlands and forests, with a reducing role for the state and a bigger role for individuals, businesses, civil society organisations and local authorities in a managed programme of reform in which the Forestry Commission will play a crucial role.</p>

Full measures will remain in place to preserve the public benefits of woods and forests under any new ownership arrangements.

The programme provides refresher training for Parliament's pool of in-house guides, including updates on developments in both Houses, and training in the mechanics of guiding and managing groups. In order to recognise the expertise of the guides, on successful completion of the course guides will receive an accreditation from the Institute of Tourist Guiding.</p>
	<p pid="a.684W.5/2">The cost of the training programme will depend on the final number of participants, but were all of the 80 guides currently registered on the in-house guide list to undertake the training, it would cost a maximum of &#163;34,186. These are gross costs. The costs are shared between the Commons and the Lords on a 70:30 basis, so the cost to the House of Commons would be &#163;23,930. The costs will be met from within the existing departmental budget. Once the initial round of training is complete, future annual costs are estimated to be &#163;4,710.</p>

The optimum weapon system solution, in light of Strategic Defence and Security Review decisions, is being evaluated. However, this will not include the Harpoon AGM-84 D anti-ship missile, which was taken out of service in 2004.</p>

It was also assessed against a fallback option involving a mix of second hand Airbus A3 30 and converted A400M aircraft. The precise cost comparisons were dependent on the scenarios tested, but in the majority of these scenarios the PFI solution was judged to be more cost effective when appropriate risk provision and full operating costs were taken into account.</p>

	<p pid="a.695W.2/2">As part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review implementation process, we are now engaging in an extensive programme of commercial negotiations, some of which will lead to the cancellation of contracts. This work will focus on the areas where there have been the most significant changes in the SDSR, but is expected to involve all of the Ministry of Defence's key suppliers. Until these negotiations are complete it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the likely impact on personnel employed on any of the programmes affected.</p>

	<p pid="a.702W.3/1">The Department for Transport has carried out an equalities impact assessment in respect of the 20% reduction in Bus Service Operators Grant which will come into effect in 2012-13. Our assessment is that this level of reduction will have a low impact, overall, on socially excluded groups, including disabled passengers.</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.3/2">We estimate that the potential average reductions in bus service mileage and increases in fares, as a direct result of the 20% reduction in Bus Service Operators Grant, in England outside London, could be:</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.3/3" class="indent">rural areas-fares increases and service mileage reductions of around 2%</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.3/4" class="indent">small towns-fares increases of around 1% and service mileage reductions of around 2%</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.3/5" class="indent">larger non-metropolitan conurbations-res increases and service mileage reductions of around 1%</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.3/6" class="indent">metropolitan areas-fares increases of around 2% and service mileage reductions of around 1%.</p>
	<p pid="a.702W.3/7">However, I spoke to the Confederation of Passenger Transport UK, who represent the bus industry, following the Chancellor's announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-20">20 October</phrase>. They were hopeful that, in general, this level of reduction could be absorbed without fares having to rise. In practice, the impact will depend on the commercial decisions of bus operators and, where relevant, local authorities and TfL.</p>

This takes into account the possible increase in casualties in darker winter mornings as well as the greater reductions expected in the lighter evenings, when more casualties occur. More recent estimates suggest the savings may currently be slightly lower-around 70 deaths and 190 serious casualties. This is due to the recent reductions in overall casualties.</p>

The volume and range of goods entering Gaza has increased since Israel eased access restrictions in June 2010, although United Nations agencies are reporting difficulties obtaining approval for reconstruction projects and the necessary materials. Approximately 75% of Gazans are dependent on food aid and cannot obtain materials needed to rebuild their homes. The water and sewage system is dilapidated, with 90% of mains water unfit for drinking. Many people continue to suffer from post-traumatic stress and other psychological disorders.</p>

	<p pid="a.720W.12/1">There is no commonly accepted definition of fossil fuel subsidies and it may be appropriate to use different definitions depending on the context. In preparing the UK's response to the G20 Fossil Fuel subsidies initiative, we used the following definition:</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.12/2" class="indent">&quot;A fossil-fuel subsidy is any government measure or program with the objective or direct consequence of reducing below world-market prices, including all costs of transport, refining and distribution, the effective cost for fossil fuels paid by final consumers, or of reducing the costs or increasing the revenues of fossil-fuel producing companies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.12/3">A number of other G20 states also used this definition of fossil fuel subsidy.</p>

	<p pid="a.722W.2/1">The 2050 pathways calculator presents a high-level framework through which to consider some of the choices and trade-offs which the UK will have to make in the over the next forty years. It shows that it is possible for us to meet the 80% greenhouse gas emissions reduction target in the UK in a range of ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.722W.2/2">The 2050 pathways calculator takes as its starting point the actual UK emissions at 2007. Emissions originating from the overseas manufacture of products which the UK imports, such as uranium, are not included in the UK's 80% emissions reduction target for 2050 as defined in the Climate Change Act and consistent with international carbon reporting practice. These 'embedded emissions' are therefore also not included within the 2050 pathways analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.722W.2/3">The 2050 pathways calculator models a wide range of future scenarios from 2007 to 2050. Given the need to ensure that the functioning and content of the model is manageable, it has been necessary to keep it as simple as possible. The UK-based emissions from energy infrastructure, materials and processes (such as enrichment and fuel fabrication) are intended to be captured within the 'Industry' sector of the 2050 pathways calculator, and no explicit assumptions were made about emissions from the specific processes mentioned in the question.</p>

As such, local authorities that have expressed an interest in west Cumbria have set up the West Cumbria MRWTS Partnership as an advisory body to 'make recommendations to Allerdale borough council, Copeland borough council and Cumbria county council on whether they should participate in the geological disposal facility siting process, without commitment to eventually host a facility'.

AM, often described as blade swish, refers to aerodynamic noise from wind turbines, but with a greater than normal degree of regular fluctuation at blade passing frequency.

The Key was established as a pilot service to support school leaders in May 2007 with initial set up taking place in late 2005. It was developed and managed by TLM under contract to the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA); a non-departmental public body of the Department.</p>

Subject to this licensing arrangement, TLM have continued to provide the service, operating under a subscription fee system.</p>
	<p pid="a.734W.2/5">During the pilot period, the service was provided free of charge to schools. The Department does not hold detailed information about the number of school leaders who have used the scheme or the amount of payments made for its services. Neither the TDA nor the Department have information on fees charged to date. This information may be available annually in due course in accordance with the terms of the IPR licence.</p>

	<p pid="a.735W.5/1">There is no legislation that deals specifically with school uniform. Although governing bodies are responsible for deciding whether there should be a school uniform and how it should be sourced, guidance by the Department for Education makes clear that governing bodies should keep the cost of uniform under review, and be able to demonstrate that best value has been achieved. Governing bodies are also asked to ensure that the uniform chosen is widely available in high street shops, other retail outlets and internet suppliers, rather than from an expensive sole supplier. This guidance is reinforced in the School Admissions Code, that schools should not seek to operate as sole suppliers in order to raise funds through the sale of school uniforms, and to ensure that their policies and practices do not disadvantage any children.</p>

In addition to providing information to the bereaved family concerned, and to enable a death to be formally registered, these verdicts are used by statisticians so that trends in causes of deaths can be recorded and reported, and any trends in public mortality identified and action taken where appropriate. To introduce further subsets of the short form verdict might cause practical difficulties for the recording function which can be tackled only at considerable expense.

Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mrs May) is the ministerial lead on Women and Equalities for Government. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Mr Blunt) has recently had discussions with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Equalities on the needs of women offenders. The Government are committed to diverting women away from crime and tackling women's offending. We are taking forward an approach to provide effective alternatives to remands for the courts with new women's enhanced bail provision and effective community sentences using the expertise of the voluntary sector through Women's Community Projects. The aim is to meet the distinct and complex needs of women which are linked to their offending.</p>

	<p pid="a.743W.2/2">The MoJ is working with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and other Government Departments who form part of the Government's strategy for sustainable farming and food.

It is therefore not possible to separately identify whether offences were committed by squatters for: non-payment of council tax; robbery; carrying out unauthorised works to a listed building; television licence evasion; criminal damage; arson; trespass; or using utilities without contacting the suppliers. Similarly it is not possible to separately identify those persons prosecuted for burglary whose apparent purpose was to squat.</p>

	<p pid="a.745W.7/1">Research undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Excellence (NFER) for HEFCE was published in October 2009. It examined the impact of Excellence Challenge (Aimhigher's predecessor) on the probability of entering higher education for young people who experienced Excellence Challenge in 2001/02, the first year of the scheme. It found that:</p>
	<p pid="a.745W.7/2" class="indent">Young people from schools with Excellence Challenge with only average levels of attainment at GCSE were more likely than their academic peers from schools without Excellence Challenge to take up a higher education place.</p>

	<p pid="a.749W.5/2">I met with US-based provider Laureate on <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-15">15 September</phrase>. Additionally, the Secretary of State, the Minister of State for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning and I met with BPP University College of Professional Studies, as a part of a wider meeting with representatives of the higher education sector, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-12">12 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.749W.5/3">The Government want to make it easier for new providers who can offer excellent teaching and a high quality experience for students to enter the higher education sector. However, this is one of a number of institutional issues in the wake of Lord Browne's independent review of higher education and student finance which requires thorough debate and consultation. We intend therefore to publish a Higher Education White Paper with detailed proposals to which experts from the sector can react, leading, subject to parliamentary time, to a Higher Education Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.750W.2/3">We have abolished HIPs and we are working with the industry to develop an approach to zero carbon homes which balances mitigating the carbon burdens from new development with ensuring the viability of development.</p>
	<p pid="a.750W.2/4">We have adopted a government wide &quot;one in, one out&quot; approach to new regulatory burdens across the economy as a whole, and in the spending review we announced that we will reduce the total regulatory burden on the house building industry in England over the spending review period. We will be seeking to work across Government Departments to put in place the mechanisms to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="a.750W.2/5">I have already initiated a review of the building regulations, to consider options for changes to the building regulations and building control system, including the potential to deregulate. Having sought views from a wide range of interested parties, my officials are now analysing the responses and I am aiming to make a statement on this around the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.750W.2/6">My colleague, the Minister for Housing, has also set out his commitment to simplify the regulations for new build housing in England. My Department will be initiating discussions with interested parties shortly about how to simplify other standards (beyond building regulations).</p>

	<p pid="a.757W.3/1">We are making the Technology Strategy Board the Government's prime channel through which we will incentivise business-led technology innovation in those sectors of the UK economy which present the greatest opportunity to boost UK growth. A business led organisation whose staff have a combined experience of over 600 years in the private sector, the Technology Strategy Board will serve as the main delivery body for supporting business innovation.</p>
	<p pid="a.757W.3/2">Where there is the genuine potential for the UK to gain competitive advantage, we want to support business in translating scientific leads into leading positions in new industries. That is why we announced that over four years we will provide over &#163;200 million of funding to establish an elite network of Technology and Innovation Centres through the Technology Strategy Board. The centres will enable industry to exploit new and emerging technologies, by providing a capability that bridges research and technology commercialisation, de-risking the process for business. This will help make new technologies investment ready and able to attract venture capital or other forms of investment, shortening the time to market. Working with industry and Government, the Technology Strategy Board will develop a strategy and implementation plan for the elite network of centres by April 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.757W.3/3">Support for these centres, together with support for R&amp;D, knowledge transfer, and demonstrators will enable the Technology Strategy Board to support and incentivise all stages of technology development.</p>

Teaching in FE and Skills is, for most teachers and trainers a second or third career. They are highly skilled and have dual profession such as plumbers, electricians and beauty therapists.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.5/2">A series of workforce reforms were introduced aimed at increasing the professionalism of the FE teaching workforce. The major levers for reform were embedded in regulations introduced in September 2007. These require teachers to hold appropriate qualifications and work towards achieving Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills (QTLS) status and to become members of the Institute for Learning (IFL), the professional body for FE teachers.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.5/3">To ensure that both teaching and subject specialist skills are maintained and enhanced all FE teachers are required to demonstrate an annual commitment of at least 30 hours of Continuing Professional Development (CPD). The Government are committed to maintaining requirements for a professional qualified FE teaching workforce.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.5/4">With regard to schools my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education has asked Professor Alison Wolf to carry out an independent review of vocational education. Professor Wolf will consider the organisation, funding, and target audience for vocational education, and the principles that should underpin the content, structure and teaching methods. She will report in spring 2011, and her findings will inform future developments to improve the standard of vocational education for 14-19 year-olds. As the findings of the review emerge the Department for Education will consider the implications for the teaching of vocational education in schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.764W.8/1">The Cancer Reform Strategy (CRS) included the commitment that the NHS Breast Screening Programme (NHS BSP) would be extended to women aged 47 to 73. In June this year, we confirmed in the &quot;Revision to the NHS Operating Framework 2010-11&quot; that all local breast screening programmes should begin the extension in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.8/2">We are working with NHS Cancer Screening Programmes to ensure local programmes begin the age extension as soon as possible. By the end of March next year, we expect over 60% of screening programmes to have started the extension.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.8/3">One of the criteria for extension of the NHS BSP is that local screening programmes should have at least one Digital Mammography (DM) machine in place before they extend, in accordance with the timetable in the revised operating framework. Based on the latest information, 14 local screening programmes are fully digital and 36 have at least one DM machine.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.8/4">NHS Cancer Screening Programmes undertook a practical and technical evaluation of DM before it was considered for use in the NHS BSP. Studies in both Europe and America have found that DM is better than film screen mammography for younger women, premenopausal or perimenopausal women and women with dense breasts.</p>

The 2006 guidance makes clear that the use of antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate non-cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and vascular or mixed dementias is not recommended. Clinical guidelines are recommendations by NICE on the appropriate treatment and care of people with specific diseases and conditions within the NHS. The NICE websites state that NICE expects to consider the need to review this guidance in November 2011.</p>

The evidence and measures within the document were scrutinised by a number of means in order to ensure validity and proportionality to the assessment of risks. Advice was taken from an expert working group, including officials from the British Dental Association, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee on Decontamination Science and Technology, which supported the general principle of the need to improve local decontamination within dentistry.

To this end, we have outlined new, strengthened tests that proposals on NHS service changes must meet.</p>

We are clear that services should be driven by the need to improve patient outcomes. NHS North West advises that the assessment for 'Making it Better' is incomplete, pending submission of the National Clinical Assessment Team report.

	<p pid="a.779W.8/1">Currently, only funding worth &#163;237 million is ring-fenced for social care. This is a very small proportion of total social care expenditure. We therefore do not anticipate that removing the ring-fence will have a significant effect on overall social care funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.779W.8/2">However, the Government have taken the decision to simplify and streamline grant funding to local government, by rolling around &#163;4 billion of specific grants in 2010-11 into the unhypothecated formula grant and reducing grants for local government from over 90 to fewer than 10. This includes &#163;2.4 billion of social care grants.</p>
	<p pid="a.779W.8/3">Streamlining local government funding will enable local authorities to redirect funds to protect the delivery of the essential frontline services that matter most to their local communities. Local authorities must be accountable primarily to their communities for how they prioritise resources. It will also allow councils to pool and align budgets with partners, reducing duplication and enabling resources to be targeted at the most effective solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.779W.8/4">The national health service will also make funding available to be spent on measures that support social care, which also benefits health. This funding will be up to &#163;1 billion in 2014-15. We will set out more detail on how the NHS should use this funding to support social care in the '2011-12 Operating Framework'. There will, therefore, be more funding hypothecated specifically for social care in the upcoming spending review period than this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.782W.2/1">Voluntary sector organisations play vital roles in health and social care, delivering innovative, high quality, user-focused services, and achieving outcomes that can provide real social value. They have a strong track-record of designing services based on insight into clients' needs, to which they are often well placed to respond flexibly to those needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.782W.2/2">It is not possible to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the impact that spending reductions will have on statutory services provided by voluntary and community organisations because of the multitude of different contractual relationships this sector has with public bodies at different levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.782W.2/3">However, the recent spending review makes no cuts to the health budget. As set out in the &quot;Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2010-11&quot;, the Department plans to make a phased move towards an 'Any Willing Provider' model for community services, which will address barriers and open up opportunities for future statutory provision by independent and voluntary sector providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.782W.2/4">The spending review also recognises the importance of social care in protecting the most vulnerable in society. In recognition of the pressures on the social care system in a challenging local government settlement, the coalition Government have allocated an additional &#163;2 billion by 2014-15 to support the delivery of social care. This means, with an ambitious programme of efficiency, that there is enough funding available both to protect people's access to services and deliver new approaches to improve quality and outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.782W.2/5">As transition to these new arrangements takes place, we are promoting restraint in budget cuts to this sector and good practice in the commissioning and decommissioning of services, with due regard for the principles of the Compact.</p>

The Equality Impact Assessment is clear that some people with a disability will be affected by the time-limit for contributory Employment and Support Allowance, but that this will be mitigated for the most severely disabled and those on low incomes as neither the Support Group nor customers in receipt of Income Related Employment and Support Allowance will be subject to the time limit. A full Equality Impact for the proposal to time-limit contributory Employment and Support Allowance for customers in the Work Related Activity Group will be published as a part of the Equality Impact Assessment for the Welfare Reform Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.793W.8/1">Motability is an independent charitable organisation and is wholly responsible for the administration of the Motability Scheme. Motability is largely self financed and the only funding the Department for Work and Pensions gives the scheme relates to the Specialised Vehicles Fund, which Motability administers on our behalf. The Specialised Vehicles Fund provides financial assistance to those severely disabled scheme customers who require complex vehicle adaptations that allow them to enter a car as a passenger while remaining seated in their wheelchair or enables them drive their car while seated in their wheelchair. Information on the number of Motability car scheme customers, the amount of funding the scheme received in respect of the Specialised Vehicles Fund and how many cars were adapted as a result of this financial assistance in each of the last five years is contained in the following tables. No decision has been reached on funding for the Specialised Vehicles Fund from 2011-12 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.793W.8/2">Independent analysis commissioned by Motability indicates that the car scheme is typically 35% cheaper on a like-for-like basis than other lease providers for the same car models. This reflects the scheme's economies of scale and the significant discounts it is able to negotiate as a result. Motability provides regular updates to the Department in respect of the Specialised Vehicles Fund and continues to work with vehicle manufacturers, the adaptation industry and other business partners to deliver the best possible value for its disabled customers.</p>

If a student suspends a course in those circumstances and has drawn-down their loan, we will only take it into account for the period the loan is intended to cover.</p>

	<p pid="a.798W.11/1">It is an integral part of the role of advisers in Jobcentre Plus to take account of local transport issues when advising unemployed people seeking work on the options available. All claimants should be willing to take employment within a reasonable travel to work area. The local travel to work area is determined by each individual Jobcentre, taking into account the availability of local transport facilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.799W.5/1">Firstly, it is important to note that the work capability assessment (WCA) is not condition-based. Rather than making assumptions about someone's capability for work based on their condition, it looks at their functional ability. This is because a health condition or disability will affect people in different ways and at different levels of severity, and we do not want to write people off by assuming that their health condition or disability is a barrier to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.799W.5/2">From March 2009 to March 2010, the Department led a review of the WCA, which engaged with medical and other experts and specialist disability groups. It conducted detailed case-study analysis, and concluded that generally the WCA is accurately assessing individuals for the right benefit. It also made a number of recommendations for improving the assessment, which we have accepted and plan to implement from spring 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.799W.5/3">In addition, we have commissioned Professor Malcolm Harrington to undertake the first of five independent reviews of the operation of the WCA. He is supported by a small scrutiny group which includes Paul Farmer, Chief Executive of Mind. Professor Harrington is evaluating the fairness and accuracy of the assessment. We look forward to receiving his report later this year and will give careful consideration to his recommendations. Where necessary, we will make changes to improve the WCA.</p>
