Council tax benefit is paid to around 3.9 million households in England, of which around two million are pensioners. With the recent introduction of pension credit, some 1.6 million pensioners will gain benefit and 310,000 will be entitled to benefit for the first time.</p>

	<p pid=".569W.3/1">For all options for additional capacity that were studied in SERAS, including those on which the Government consulted, an assessment was made of the scale of facilities needed to cater for the forecast additional throughput (eg passenger and freight handling, maintenance, aircraft stands, aprons, cargo, car parking). Layout plans based on those assessments were produced and their impacts appraised. Paragraph 6.6. of &quot;The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom&mdash;South East&quot; made clear that these layouts were not definitive proposals.

There is no legal requirement for local authorities to hold such records or to make them available to the Department.</p>

	<p pid=".573W.2/1">The Government place a high priority on reducing emissions of air pollutants from road transport. Emissions of particles (PM10) from road transport have reduced by some 50 per cent. over the last decade as a result of progressively tighter vehicle and fuel quality standards. Emissions of ultrafine particles from road transport are much harder to measure. The UK has been at the forefront of an international programme to develop appropriate ways of measuring emissions of these small particles. Once this has been completed, the Government will be in a position to take further steps, should the health evidence indicate that this is necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".574W.4/1">My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="">13 October</phrase>. No Ministers from the Devolved Administrations or Northern Ireland were present.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.4/2">The main items for substantive discussion were on Fisheries, the most important of which was agreement of a proposal for a regulation on the management of fishing effort in Western Waters. As you know this proposal had been on the table for some time but its adoption had been held up while the Presidency struggled to find a compromise acceptable to as many of the key member states as possible&mdash;the UK, Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal. In the event the compromise adopted was acceptable to ourselves, France and Portugal but was opposed by Spain and Ireland, with Belgium abstaining.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.4/3">The agreed regulation makes provision for an effort-based regime with member states' effort allocations to be based on fishing activity in the reference period 1998&ndash;2002. Management zones are to be based on ICES sea areas. This means there is no separate management zone for the Irish Sea as we wished but the Council and Commission have made a joint statement to the effect that fishing effort in previously restricted areas will be closely monitored. In other respects the final outcome is one that offers the UK significant improvements over the text originally tabled last December. These include, in particular:</p>
	<p pid=".574W.4/4" class="indent">the exclusion of under 15 metre vessels from the scope of the regime in all areas except in a special biologically sensitive area off the south west coast of Ireland (&quot;the hake box&quot;) where it will apply to all vessels over 10 metres;</p>
	<p pid=".574W.4/5" class="indent">the list of vessels able to fish in Western waters is not restricted to those with a previous history of doing so;</p>
	<p pid=".574W.4/6" class="indent">except for when entering and exiting the hake box, vessels will no longer have to hail in and out on entry and exit from Western waters zones, so substantially reducing industry's compliance costs;</p>
	<p pid=".574W.4/7" class="indent">there are arrangements for adjusting member states' effort allocations to let them take their quotas in full or increase fishing activity on non-quota stocks;</p>
	<p pid=".574W.4/8" class="indent">reduction in the number of fisheries from 5 to 3&mdash;demersal, scallops and edible/spider crabs.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.4/9">The compromise text on the table therefore represented a very good outcome for the United Kingdom with all our major areas of concern being addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.4/10">There was also a brief presentation by the Commission of proposals to manage fishing in the Mediterranean which the Council will return to at a later date.</p>
	<p pid=".574W.4/11">On agriculture, there was a brief discussion of the Commission's outline ideas for reform of the cotton and olive oil regimes. Producer member states emphasised the importance of both crops to their farming sectors and the need to maintain a significant level of production-linked aid to ensure continued activity in the sectors. The United Kingdom joined other non-producers in arguing for changes in these regimes to follow closely the pattern of reforms agreed in June for others. In particular, a substantial level of decoupling should be the norm, with the option for more if member states wished to move in that direction.</p>

	<p pid=".575W.2/1">The Government has set a domestic goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. The policy framework for delivering this goal is set out in the UK Climate Change programme.</p>
	<p pid=".575W.2/2">In the Energy White Paper, we accepted the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's (RCEP) recommendation that the UK should put itself on a path towards a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of some 60 per cent. from current levels by about 2050. The Energy White Paper sets out long-term strategies and shorter-term policies to put us on this path. The Sustainable Energy Policy Network comprising units from Central Government, energy regulators, devolved administrations and key delivery organisations will ensure that these goals and policies are delivered. Part of this is a cross governmental network reporting to a Ministerial Committee co-chaired by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Further details of the implementation plans are set out on SEPN's website <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/index.shtml">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/index.shtml</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".575W.2/3">To put ourselves on course to cut the UK's carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent. by 2050, we will need to achieve cuts of around 15&ndash;25 million tonnes of carbon (MtC) by 2020 in addition to the carbon savings from existing policies including the Climate Change Programme. The actual measures needed to reach this goal will be shaped by economic and technological developments. However, in reducing carbon dioxide emissions the government's priority is to strengthen renewables and energy efficiency.</p>

	<p pid=".578W.5/1">The Rural Enterprise Scheme (RES) is delivered by Defra's Rural Development Service (RDS), but running costs are not available broken down by both scheme and region. In 2001&ndash;02 many RDS operational staff made a substantial contribution to work related to the foot and mouth disease outbreak and were not employed on their normal duties for much of the year. In consequence, it is not possible to provide an accurate figure for RES running costs in 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid=".578W.5/2">In 2002&ndash;03 RES accounted for 75.7 staff years of RDS effort at a total estimated cost of &pound;2.6 million. RDS running costs are not funded from RES programme expenditure, however &pound;2.6 million expressed as a percentage of the final RES budget for 2002&ndash;03 is 16.7 per cent. It is important to note that 2002&ndash;03 running cost expenditure relates not just to the in-year budget, but also to the assessment and approval of projects which will incur expenditure in subsequent years; forward funding commitments at the end of 2002&ndash;03 amounted to &pound;15.4 million.</p>

	<p pid=".578W.8/2">There are two Government schemes supporting the installation of solar panels in houses. The first is the &pound;20 million First Phase of the Major Photovoltaics Demonstration Programme (PV MDP). 50 per cent. grants are available to individual householders for small PV systems, and 60 per cent. to public bodies, including social housing groups, for medium-large scale installations. The second is the &pound;10 million Clear Skies initiative, which offers flat rate grants of around &pound;500 to individuals wishing to install solar water heating panels, and grants of up to 50 per cent. to community groups.</p>
	<p pid=".578W.8/3">So far, under the PV programme, one householder in Leeds has received a grant and two applications for medium&mdash;large scale installations have been approved. They are for Park Lane College and the Ridings Housing Association.</p>
	<p pid=".578W.8/4">Under Clear Skies, no applications have been received from public landlords in Leeds for solar water heating on housing, although two grants have been awarded for solar on community buildings. For individual households, three have received assistance.</p>

Actual peak demand was 54.8 GW and adjusting this to average cold spell (ACS) weather conditions and adding back estimated voluntary demand reduction at peak, gives a figure of 55.1 GW. Peak demand under average winter weather is reckoned by National Grid Company (NGC) to be about 96 per cent. of peak demand under ACS conditions.</p>

The projections for installed capacity do not allow for any plant closures not yet announced, for return of currently mothballed plant, or for new generating capacity yet to enter transmission contracts with NGC.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/15">PowerGen announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-19">19 August 2003</phrase> its intention to return a 650 MW unit at Grain to service for the coming winter. It also announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-15">15 October 2003</phrase> that it had started work that could bring a further 650 MW unit at Grain back for this winter.

NGC will take these announcements into account for the October 2003 Update to the Seven Year Statement, due to be released later this month.</p>
	<p pid=".582W.2/16">Further information on the prospects for gas and electricity security for the coming winter, and on the outturn for last winter, can be found in the &quot;Winter Operations Report&quot;, issued by National Grid Transco (NGT) on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-14">14 October 2003</phrase>, a copy of which is in the Library of the House. That report estimated that there is some 4.2 GW of mothballed generating capacity capable of returning to service within 24 months or less, of which 0.8GW could be returned in less than three months. However, the report does not take account of the announcements of 15 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-16">16 October 2003</phrase> referred to above.</p>

	<p pid=".582W.2/18">NGC consider ACS conditions as a level of demand that has a 50 per cent. probability of occurring within any winter. Since 1990, actual peak demand has never exceeded ACS corrected peak demand, although this may be due in part to voluntary demand reduction at peak periods.</p>

	<p pid=".585W.6/2">At the end of last month, the Coal Authority launched an initiative to provide alongside every residential mining report it produces, insurance cover which will mitigate against any loss of property value, up to a maximum of &pound;20,000, attributable to any material change of the mining information revealed in any subsequent mining report on the same property. At the same time the Authority introduced an interpretive mining report service which will provide more detailed analysis and advice about mine entries including a risk assessment as to whether, in the expert opinion of the Coal Authority, the main building of a property is inside or outside the possible zone of ground movement from any reported mine entry.</p>
	<p pid=".585W.6/3">The Coal Authority has developed these services under the auspices of the Department's Mineshafts Working Group, established last year to explore initiatives which might ameliorate the blighting effect which the proximity of historic coal mineshafts is perceived to have on certain properties, particularly in the West Midlands. The Coal Authority is also investigating the scope for development of non-invasive detection techniques capable of locating mining features in built-up environments. The Authority continues to work closely with property practitioners at a local level with a view to raising awareness of the very low statistical risk which historic mineshafts represent.</p>

	<p pid=".586W.2/1">'Statutory undertaker' is a concept found in a wide range of legislation across different sectors. In the electronic communications sector, a person or undertaking (such as a mobile telephone company) is not likely to satisfy any definition of 'statutory undertaker' unless they have had the electronic communications code applied to them by a direction by Ofcom pursuant to section 106 of the Communications Act 2003. The electronic communications code gives certain powers to operators vis-a-vis the installation of apparatus. The criteria which Ofcom must consider in deciding whether or not to apply the electronic communications code to a person or undertaking are set out in section 107(4) of the Communications Act 2003. The position in the gas and electricity sectors is different, as gas and electricity still have a licensing-based regime, whereas electronic communications does not.</p>

	<p pid=".587W.0/1">The number of customers who will eventually choose to open a Post Office card account is difficult to predict, at this stage. However, the Post Office card account is only one of a range of banking options available at post offices. All the major high street banks are providing access to a basic bank account through post offices. In addition, the Alliance and Leicester, Barclays and Lloyds/TSB are providing electronic access at post offices to all their current accounts&mdash;some 20 million accounts in total. The Post Office also provides cheque based banking services for customers of the Cooperative bank and the internet banks, Smile and Cahoot. The Post Office is in discussion with the banks to modernise these services and to extend commercial arrangements to cover other financial institutions. Universal banking services, together with the Post Office's plans for an expansion of commercial banking arrangements, should lead to an increase in the number of people using post offices to do banking transactions. Wider access to bank accounts at post offices opens up a very much larger market than benefit recipients alone, and this should benefit sub-postmasters both directly and through increased footfall.</p>

	<p pid=".589W.11/2">The text of the letter (reference: D/MIN(DP)/WB/13/1/2/3) was published in the House of Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-09">9 October 2003</phrase>, <i>Official Report,</i> columns WA 67&ndash;79. A copy of the letter was placed in the Library of this House on <phrase class="date" code="">10 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".589W.11/3">Subsequent analysis of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf Conflict revealed shortcomings at the time in medical record keeping and medical preparedness. In October 2001 the Ministry of Defence published the paper: &quot;Medical Records in the Gulf&quot; which explained how the Service medical documentation system was used during that conflict and the generic reasons why a medical record may no longer exist. The paper is available on the internet at: http://www.mod.ukyissues/gulfwar/info/m</p>
	<p pid=".589W.11/4">Since that conflict, we have made significant improvements in medical record keeping through the introduction of a new operational medical record. This does ensure that health events while on deployment are more systematically recorded than in the past. Care is taken to ensure that accurate records are maintained by recording all vaccinations on individuals' medical records. Further improvements in medical record keeping will be achieved over the next few years with the progressive introduction of new information technology systems. A number of personnel were not up to date with their Service standard vaccinations. Our policy guidance has been modified to ensure that all troops are now immunised routinely. In June 2002, we announced that our Voluntary Immunisation Programme against anthrax would be expanded, in phases, to the whole of the Armed Forces, including reserves and those essential civilians who were likely to deploy on operations, beginning with those units that were held at the highest readiness. This takes account of lessons identified post the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf Conflict.</p>

	<p pid=".591W.3/1">In July 2002 public funds were exceptionally made available to enable Mr. Jeans to be present at the trial of those accused of killing his son. It was made clear to Mr. Jeans at that time that this action constituted a one-off payment for a final trip to Croatia which in no way constituted a precedent. It was also made clear to Mr. Jeans that the Ministry of Defence could not envisage making any further public funds available to support him. This remains the position.</p>

	<p pid=".593W.9/1">Career guidance services in higher education are diverse and varied. There is no statutory obligation for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to provide careers advice and guidance. However, most HEIs have established their own dedicated careers service. Some use other means, for example through academic departments or other student services; others use a combination of both approaches.</p>
	<p pid=".593W.9/2">Higher Education Careers Services are funded by HEIs themselves. Each institution makes its own decisions about the level of funding it allocates to careers and other services from its overall funding allocation, according to its individual circumstances.</p>

	<p pid=".593W.9/5" class="indent">(b) considering their policies towards their Careers Services in relation to their Operational Plan</p>

	<p pid=".593W.9/8">The Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services (AGCAS), in conjunction with the University of Reading, offers a range of tailored professional qualifications. AGCAS now sets a condition that members must have achieved or be working towards the matrix standard, which is the national quality standard for any organisation delivering information, advice and guidance services on learning and work. In addition the Higher Education Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) has developed a voluntary code of practice for careers education, information and guidance in higher education. The majority of HE Careers Services are members of local Information Advice and Guidance partnerships which are funded by the Learning and Skills Council and which ensure coherence of all adult careers services in their local areas.</p>

My officials have requested information from the LEA to find out whether the consultation has been conducted in accordance with our regulations.</p>

	<p pid=".605W.2/1">Recent assessments by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Iraqi Ministry of Health indicate that there are no major shortages of essential medical supplies in Iraq. There are however still reported shortages of some very specialised supplies such as antisera (eg anti snake venom) and some anti-cancer medicines. The supply of anti-tuberculosis medicines has improved after a period of shortage immediately after the war. Some health facilities have reported intermittent shortages of local anaesthetic, probably caused by periods of high demand.</p>

	<p pid=".607W.3/1">The HIV Umbrella Programme in Uganda has an allocation of &pound;6.2 million for 2002&ndash;05. Its purpose is to improve the coordination and monitoring of the Uganda's Strategic HIV/AIDS Framework in support of its Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). It also aims to improve the Government of Uganda's capacity to take effective action against HIV/AIDS, and supports service delivery and research on HIV/AIDS by civil society organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.3/2">The programme was last assessed in September 2003. The review concluded that overall the programme's approach was both strategic and effective. However, the review noted that progress in building the Uganda AIDS Commission's (UAC) capacity to coordinate and monitor the National Strategic Response was slower than anticipated. In response to this finding, DFID will be funding an HIV Adviser, to be located in UAC from November 2003, to assist its staff in technical and organisational management issues, and help facilitate the HIV Partnership in Uganda.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.3/3">Insecurity in Northern Uganda has made access to health services difficult for many and there is some evidence that the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has targeted health centres (for drugs) and health workers in their attacks. Anecdotal evidence from NGOs suggests that life in crowded camps encourages earlier sexual activity, leading to a higher teenage pregnancy rate and increased spread of HIV. However, no data is available to date on this point, although a nationwide prevalence survey is due to be carried out at the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid=".607W.3/4">LRA activities are not directly impacting on the functioning of the HIV Umbrella Programme. However, the continuing insecurity in the North is hampering the ability of some of the civil society organisations supported under the programme to scale up their activities.</p>

The main aims of the project are to provide access to affordable, high quality and innovative sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information and services; to increase awareness of basic health and SRH issues among beneficiary communities; and to increase the capacity of key stakeholders in providing SRH services and developing national health strategy and policy guidelines. The project aims to achieve these objectives through the existing Marie Stopes Sierra Leone centre network (four Reproductive Health Centres, two obstetric hospitals, and two laboratories) and outreach programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".608W.5/2">We receive quarterly progress reports on the project from Marie Stopes International. Our advisers last visited the project in March 2003. The main conclusion of their assessment was that the project provides high quality services and is reasonably well utilised. More can be done to improve the use of contraceptives, but awareness raising campaigns are addressing this. We have raised with Marie Stopes International the sustainability of the services provided by the project.</p>
	<p pid=".608W.5/3">DFID health advisers have regularly discussed issues concerning primary health care with the Government of Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation. These discussions have not focussed specifically or exclusively on SRH.</p>

	<p pid=".609W.5/1">The most recent official statistics from Bolivia (1992) put the maternal mortality rate at 390 for every 100,000 live births. This is one of the highest figures in Latin America and is disproportionately high for a country of the economic status of Bolivia. A key cause of mortality is unwanted pregnancy and subsequently complications resulting from illegal abortion. The aim of the Post Abortion Care (PAC) Services programme is to help Bolivia progress towards the Millenium Development Goal of a 75% reduction in maternal mortality by 2015. The approach of the programme is to increase access by poor women experiencing post-abortion complications to high quality, cost-effective Post Abortion Care (PAC) Services under the Basic Health Package. The programme supports the provision of outpatient PAC with manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) services at five tertiary-level hospitals, strengthened training capacity for PAC with MVA at five teaching hospitals, the institutionalisation of PAC training for medical residents, the introduction by Government of Bolivia of the PAC-with-MVA model in secondary-level hospitals in rural areas, and the strengthening of the supply of PAC-with-MVA medical equipment and drugs, for present and future services.</p>
	<p pid=".609W.5/2">The programme is managed in partnership with the Government of Bolivia and supports its Sexual and Reproductive Health Programme. Local communities are closely involved in discussions on the introduction of PAC with MVA in secondary level hospitals, and the church is consulted in the context of discussion on national reproductive health strategies.</p>

These included critical shortage of health personnel, lack of other resources and the rising impact of HIV/AIDS. The international financial institutions and donors including DFID are working with the Malawi Government to address the underlying issues, such as wage policy and macro economic management, that contribute to the problems affecting the health sector.</p>

Current estimates of the number of poor people in Russia vary widely from 20 per cent. to 40 per cent. of population, depending on the source of data, the methodology used and the definition of poverty. Accurate data and proper poverty analysis will help the Government of Russia to target resources to poor people more efficiently.</p>

	<p pid=".614W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-03">3 September</phrase>, the Government of Sudan and the Sudan Liberation Army agreed a ceasefire for Darfur in western Sudan. The UN estimates that some 500,000 people have been displaced in Darfur; 300,000 of which as a result of the recent conflict. It is estimated that there are about 70,000 refugees in Chad. High rates of malnutrition have been reported in Darfur. The UN responded with an Initiative to mobilise funds for the region.</p>

The Initiative includes accelerated humanitarian relief and longer-term assistance. The GDSI has not only raised the profile of the situation in Darfur, but also improved access to vulnerable groups in the region.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.0/3">The total funding requirement for the UN GDSI is $22.8 million (approximately &pound;15 million). The UK responded to the Initiative with a pledge of &pound;1 million. We are currently in the process of committing this pledge against specific proposals recently circulated by the various UN agencies, the Red Cross and non-governmental organisations. We stand ready to respond further, as the situation in Darfur determines. We have already committed &pound;0.5 million to Save the Children UK to provide humanitarian assistance to displaced people and other vulnerable groups in North Darfur. Norway has pledged $0.75 million (approximately &pound;0.5 million) to the GDSI. Others donors, including US Agency for International Development and the Humanitarian Aid Office of the European Commission (ECHO), are also contributing to the provision of humanitarian assistance in the region.</p>

	<p pid=".618W.9/1">Setting up the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) has helped the partner departments (FCO, MOD and DFID) work more closely together in the field of conflict prevention. This is also helping the departments carry out more detailed and consistent policy analysis, and establish a more integrated approach to developing and implementing programmes on the ground. The Pools are therefore strengthening the UK's contribution to international conflict prevention efforts by ensuring that initiatives are based on evidence of what works and are well targeted.</p>
	<p pid=".618W.9/2">In FY 2002&ndash;03 the total spent on GCPP programmes was &pound;66 million. The budget for FY 2003&ndash;04 is &pound;74 million. Details of the GCPP Strategies are set out in the recent publication the GCPP: The Global Conflict Prevention Pool&mdash;A joint UK Government approach to reducing conflict, which is available in the Library of the House. A copy of the booklet has also been placed on the FCO website (<a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a>) accessible under Global Issues-International Organisations-UN-Conflict Prevention.</p>
	<p pid=".618W.9/3">Since its start in April 2000, the GCPP has funded several hundred projects under a range of geographic and thematic strategies. It has been engaged in:</p>
	<p pid=".618W.9/4" class="indent">Post conflict reconstruction work in Afghanistan, the Balkans, and now in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid=".618W.9/5" class="indent">Helping to create security, stability and encourage peace negotiations in Belize and Guatemala, Nepal, Indonesia, the Middle East and North Africa, and Sri Lanka.</p>

Visits to the UK in September by the Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister, Vu Khoan, and four other Vietnamese Ministers are testimony to the growing breadth and depth of relations. We have regular engagement with the Vietnamese Government on a range of issues: development, trade and investment, and education, as well as political issues, including human rights. The UK is a major investor in Vietnam and DFID's aid programme to Vietnam, currently &pound;25 million, is its fastest growing aid programme in the world.</p>

	<p pid=".627W.0/1">Where an employer has not got appropriate employers' liability insurance, or does not produce a valid certificate of insurance when required to do so, then the Health and Safety Executive will consider prosecution.</p>
	<p pid=".627W.0/2">Each case must be considered on its own merits, and in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. Prosecution decisions will also take account of the time since the date of offence, because offences under ELCI Act 1969 are triable only summarily, which means there is a six-month time limit from the date of the offence to commencing a prosecution.</p>
	<p pid=".627W.0/3">Where there is evidence of non-insurance, and the case is within the statutory time period, then HSE will normally prosecute.</p>

	<p pid=".627W.0/5">In addition to prosecution, the issue of 'Notices to Produce' (NTPs) is an important part of HSE's enforcement of ELCI. NTPs require the employer to produce a valid certificate of insurance to HSE. During the same period, HSE issued a total of 73 NTPs.</p>

	<p pid=".627W.3/1">A survey by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) found that price increases were most concentrated on a limited number of companies. Nearly half of all companies had no price rise or less than 20 per cent. However, between 5 per cent. and 12 per cent. of businesses saw premiums at least double and often increase by several hundred per cent. More recent figures from Datamonitor, a leading business information company, show less extreme pricing trends than the OFT survey but support the general picture. Overwhelmingly, these were small and medium sized companies, mostly in sectors traditionally associated with high accident risks.</p>

	<p pid=".629W.14/1">This Government is targeting money where it is most needed. And that means targeting more money on the poorest pensioners. In 1997, the rate of income support from age 60 was &pound;68.80 for single persons and &pound;106.80 for couples. In April 2003, the rate of minimum income guarantee from age 60 increased to &pound;102.10 for single persons and &pound;155.80 for couples.</p>
	<p pid=".629W.14/2">Pension credit, introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-06">6 October 2003</phrase>, abolishes the old weekly means test, replacing it with a less intrusive form of assessment. From age 65, most pensioners will have their awards fixed for five years at a time. In addition, pension credit is intended to reward rather than penalise those people who have modest amounts of second pension or other savings.</p>
	<p pid=".629W.14/3">Compared with the 1997 system as a result of the Government's measures including pension credit, on average, from October 2003, pensioner households are &pound;1,250 a year better off in real terms, around &pound;24 extra a week, and the poorest third of pensioner households will have gained &pound;1,600 a year in real terms.</p>

	<p pid=".630W.2/1">The Royal Mint at Llantrisant is treated by the Health and Safety Executive the same as any other similar manufacturing operation, and irrespective of the issue of Crown Immunity, to the same regulatory regime and standards.</p>
	<p pid=".630W.2/2">There have been three fatalities since the operation has been on this site; one in 1987, one in 1992 and one in June 2001. The fatality in June 2001 resulted in Crown Censure proceedings. Substantial remedial measures were put in place following this tragedy.</p>
	<p pid=".630W.2/3">Over the last few years reportable accidents at the Mint have been falling; 34 in 2001, 26 in 2002 and 10 to date in 2003. This is below the national average for manufacturing industry for last year (November to November).</p>
	<p pid=".630W.2/4">In 2001 a Crown Improvement Notice was served on the Royal Mint requiring risk assessments associated with workplace transport to be carried out. This was complied with fully by the Royal Mint and the Notice discharged.</p>
	<p pid=".630W.2/5">In June 2003 there was a breakout of molten metal from an induction furnace on site. There were no injuries. Following investigation the Mint management produced an action plan and have acted positively upon this plan, and the advice given by HSE inspectors. No formal enforcement action arose out of this matter.</p>
	<p pid=".630W.2/6">Activities at the site require that the Royal Mint submits a safety report to the HSE under the Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999. This report was submitted in January 2002 as required by those Regulations. HSE will carry out inspections and interventions on the Royal Mint site taking into account the safety report, as it would for any other site with similar industrial risks.</p>

It is currently not possible to make a distinction between public and commercial sector burglary in respect of costs.</p>
	<p pid=".637W.2/2">These figures for numbers of burglaries recorded can be applied to the estimates of the average costs of burglaries presented in HORS 217. This gives total costs of recorded burglary as follows:</p>
