	<p pid="d.3W.8/2">Traffic is forecast in England to grow by just under a third between 2003 and 2025 in the central case. This assumes oil prices are $35 in 2025 (2004 prices). When Brent crude per barrel prices are assumed to be $100, traffic growth is still increasing in the period, but lowered by 6 per cent. relative to the central forecast growth.</p>

	<p pid="d.7W.2/1">Central Government provide a number of funding streams that local authorities are able to apply to road repairs, improvements and building. Authorities are also able to apply their own resources to their networks.</p>
	<p pid="d.7W.2/2">I have placed details of funding from the Department for Transport in the House Libraries, as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.7W.2/3" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> block capital funding made available to local authorities since 2000-01 as part of the LTP settlement. This funding is not ring fenced and authorities have discretion to spend their allocations in line with their priorities. Where joint plans were prepared, the figures relate to the plan rather than individual authorities. The table includes aggregate figures for funding provided prior to the introduction of the LTP settlement.</p>
	<p pid="d.7W.2/4" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> revenue and capital funding provided to authorities since 2001-02 for the maintenance of recently detrunked roads. This funding is also not ring fenced. Prior to 2000-01 funding was provided by the Local Transport Capital Expenditure settlement. I am also including the allocations from 1997-98 to 1999-2000 in this table.</p>
	<p pid="d.7W.2/5" class="indent"><i> (c)</i> capital funding that the Department has contributed (or is expecting to contribute) to local authority major road schemes generally costing over &pound;5 million. The table shows schemes completed since 2000 and those that are being delivered or at the various approval stages in line with our local major scheme guidance.</p>
	<p pid="d.7W.2/6" class="indent"><i> (d)</i> PFI credits allocated to schemes. This shows PFI credits allocated to English local authorities (including London boroughs) for improvements in their street lighting and highway maintenance where contracts have been signed or are in procurement.</p>
	<p pid="d.7W.2/7" class="indent"><i> (e)</i> funding provided for emergency repairs to local highways in 2001-02, 2003-04 and 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="d.7W.2/8">Local authorities are also provided with financial support for the revenue required for road maintenance through the Revenue Support Grant (RSG), administered by the Department for Communities and Local Government. There is no separately identified highways maintenance component in RSG and it is for each authority to determine how much of it should be allocated to their highway network.</p>
	<p pid="d.7W.2/9">Funding for highway maintenance and for transport in London has generally since 2000-01 been a matter for the Mayor.</p>

	<p pid="d.8W.2/1">Since the Department for Transport took over responsibility for rail franchise management in 2005, some operators have held discussions with the Department proposing additional rolling stock, usually linked to a wider package of contract alterations. These discussions are commercially confidential. The Department considers all such proposals to determine whether they are consistent with procurement law, affordable, provide value for money for the taxpayer and fit with objectives for the rail network.</p>
	<p pid="d.8W.2/2">The Department set out its requirements in the White Paper, Delivering a Sustainable Railway 2007, that it would procure through the operators an additional 1300 new vehicles. These discussions are now taking place and will result in the delivery of the vehicles.</p>

However, the current instructions issued to suppliers of fresh and frozen fish expressly stipulate that &quot;all fish supplied must come from approved sustainable sources&quot; and provide specific provenance requirements in the case of cod, haddock and other fish regarded as over-exploited by the Marine Stewardship Council or Marine Conservation Society. Furthermore, the House is currently in the process of letting a new contract for the supply of fish. Both the Marine Stewardship Council and the Seafish Industry Authority had input into the specification of requirements regarding environmental sustainability standards, and the relevant clauses were developed using the toolkit provided by DEFRA under the Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative.</p>

	<p pid="d.15W.2/1">The total cost of the refurbishment of the e-Library to create the Members' Centre was &pound;38,100. The furnishings installed in the centre cost &pound;25,900 and the technological equipment cost &pound;12,200. The centre was established as a part of the response to Sir Kevin Tebbit's review of the management and services of the House. It is intended to help provide a more integrated and responsive service to hon. Members and to their staff across the range of the services provided by House Departments. Benefits were assessed against costs before the centre was commissioned, though no formal cost/benefit analysis was conducted. The extent of the centre's use, and the support it has received from hon. Members and their staff, albeit after just one week of operation, suggests that the centre will fully justify its costs.</p>

	<p pid="d.16W.2/1">The Administration Committee considered proposals prepared by the Parliamentary ICT (PICT) Directorate in June 2008 for improving support and services to Members and their staff while working away from the Parliamentary Estate, and specifically in their constituency offices. The proposals included:</p>
	<p pid="d.16W.2/2" class="indent">1. Regionally based engineering services that can provide a face to face response to Members and their staffs' issues more quickly than can be achieved at present.</p>

	<p pid="d.16W.2/5">While not providing an equivalent level of service for off-site users to that available to Members and their staff based in Westminster, these proposals would provide a much improved level of service. Delivery of these proposals is dependent on financial approval. A business case will be presented in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="d.16W.5/1">The contract with Demon, the third party service provider, is subject to regular review meetings with Demon. Some service issues have already been addressed. For example, through collaborative working between BT and Demon disruption to broadband services due to constituency office moves has been reduced considerably. Further improvements are expected in the future. In the short term, the parliamentary ICT Directorate (PICT) and Demon are planning to upgrade some of the slower broadband services. A complete new broadband contract is expected to be procured within the next year.</p>

The first of the four specific targets is for 37 per cent. women in the senior civil service (grade five officers and above). In the Government Equalities Office, four of the six senior civil servants are women. The second target is for 30 per cent. women in top management posts (those occupied by grade three and above). In GEO one of the two top managers is a woman. The third target, for 4 per cent. ethnic minority staff in the SCS, is not met in the GEO.</p>
	<p pid="d.17W.3/2">The fourth target is for 3.2 per cent. disabled staff in the senior civil service. Staff may declare disabilities voluntarily.

	<p pid="d.17W.6/1">In recent months I have received representations from hon. Members of the House of Commons and members of the public on the gender pay gap in the civil service and the public and private sectors and equal pay in local government and the United Kingdom as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="d.17W.6/2">Closing the pay gap between men and women is a high priority for this Government because it allows families to make real choices about how they live their lives. The pay gap perpetuates the unequal division of labour in the home and prevents fathers from playing a more active role in their children's early years and women from fulfilling their opportunities to work. Closing the pay gap is now one of the indicators in the new Equalities Public Service Agreement. This will help to build on other practical measures we have introduced, such as giving the parents of young, or disabled, children and the carers of adults the right to request flexible working, and providing more access to child care.</p>

	<p pid="d.20W.3/1">The Government recognise that speech and language skills are vital to all areas of a child's development. Together with the Department of Health we are taking a number of steps to ensure all children get the right support to develop these skills, including targeted or specialist support for children and young people with speech, language and communication difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="d.20W.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-08">8 July</phrase> we welcomed the final report of the Bercow Review of services for children and young people with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN). We support fully the report's call for action to raise the profile of speech, language and communications across Government, local agencies and wider society and to improve services for children and young people with SLCN. We will publish a plan for implementation of the recommendations made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> in the autumn. We have already asked Sir Jim Rose to examine how schools can better focus on speech, language and communication as part of his review of the primary curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="d.20W.3/3">Alongside our response to the recommendations in the Bercow Report, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-08">8 July</phrase> the Government announced a new &pound;40 million early language programme, Every Child a Talker, which aims to improve the understanding of early language development among the early years workforce. It will provide practitioners with training and materials to enable them to support children's speaking and listening skills more effectively and free up time for practitioners to spend working with parents to enrich the home environment and networking with each other to share good practice. This will complement the materials delivered through the Inclusion Development Programme, which is focusing in its first year on SLCN, along with dyslexia.</p>
	<p pid="d.20W.3/4">Sure Start Children's Centres (SSCC) play a key role in the positive promotion of children's speech and language development. In our Children's Centre Practice Guidance (December 2006) we said that speech, language and communication should be a priority for SSCCs in developing their services and that all staff should have the skills and understanding required for high-quality, responsive interaction with children.</p>
	<p pid="d.20W.3/5">In addition, the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), being introduced from September this year, recognises the importance of supporting and extending children's learning and competence in communicating, speaking and listening and providing opportunities for children to use these skills in a range of situations and for different purposes. One of the key roles for practitioners within the EYFS is to identify and respond to any particular difficulties in children's language development at an early stage.</p>
	<p pid="d.20W.3/6">Early identification of SLCN is further promoted through the Child Health Promotion Programme (CHPP), led by the Department of Health. CHHP is the early intervention and prevention public health programme that lies at the heart of all universal services for children and families. It highlights a child's speech and language development as one of eight priority topics for health and development reviews of children.</p>

	<p pid="d.21W.2/2">In 2004, the Department published 'Home to School travel for pupils requiring special arrangements' and following the Education and Inspections Act 2006, which extended entitlement to free transport for low income families, published its 'Home to School Travel and Transport Guidance' in May 2007.

	<p pid="d.21W.5/1">There is a variety of opportunities for young people to learn about bone marrow donation within the curriculum through PSHE, citizenship and science.

	<p pid="d.25W.5/1">The Government have recently completed an initial assessment of the potential value of personal carbon trading, compared to other approaches to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The study explored some key issues highlighted by an initial scoping study produced for DEFRA by the Centre for Sustainable Energy in November 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.25W.5/2">The following DEFRA-funded research was published in May:</p>
	<p pid="d.25W.5/3" class="indent">the technical feasibility and potential cost of personal carbon trading, which was produced by Accenture;</p>
	<p pid="d.25W.5/4" class="indent">the distributional impacts of personal carbon trading, by the Centre for Sustainable Energy; and</p>
	<p pid="d.25W.5/5" class="indent">an assessment of the public acceptability of personal carbon trading, by Enviros and Opinion Leader.</p>
	<p pid="d.25W.5/6">In addition to this research, DEFRA provided a grant to the RSA (The Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) which has been leading a three year project into this area.</p>

	<p pid="d.29W.2/1">The Government-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is working with stakeholders across the food sector&mdash;producers, wholesalers, processors, retailers and consumers&mdash;to tackle the problem of food waste. For example:</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.2/2" class="indent">The Courtauld Commitment between WRAP and major food and drink retailers and manufacturers aims to reduce packaging waste and 'to identify ways to tackle the problem of food waste'.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.2/3" class="indent">WRAP will also be running a programme jointly with Envirowise to help the industry reduce packaging and food waste in the grocery supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.2/4" class="indent">WRAP provides an advisory service to local authorities on their waste collection arrangements, and has been involved in managing a series of food waste collection trials in 19 local authority areas. Where appropriate, WRAP is able to advise local authorities to consider opportunities for the co-collection of food waste from commercial premises with food waste from domestic properties.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.2/5" class="indent">WRAP is running a consumer-facing campaign, &quot;Love Food Hate Waste&quot;, to encourage behaviour change. The campaign is being delivered in partnership with stakeholders from across the food industry and retail sector, and organisations such as the Food Standards Agency and the women's institute. Its aim is to develop practical advice, to help people get the most from the food they buy, and to waste less of it.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.2/6">DEFRA is also working closely with the food industry to improve its environmental impact through the Food Industry Sustainability Strategy (FISS). The FISS targets a reduction in the food industry's own wastes of 15-20 per cent. by 2010. In responding to the targets outlined in the FISS Champions' Group on Waste report to Ministers last May, the Food and Drink Federation's &quot;Five Fold Environmental Ambition/Making a real difference&quot; document set themselves a target to send zero waste to landfill by 2015.</p>

This process considers all the conceivable risk factors, including the potential for gene transfer to other organisms. Approval for a release will only be granted if the evidence indicates that it will not have any adverse effect on human health and the environment.</p>
	<p pid="d.29W.5/2">No releases of GM trees have been proposed in the UK in recent years. Trial releases in England of GM apple, eucalyptus and poplar plants were approved and completed in the 1990s.</p>

	<p pid="d.47W.8/1">The London Thames Gateway Development Corporation's Corporate Plan for 2008-09 to 2010-11 was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-07">7 May 2008</phrase>. The Corporate Plan sets out how they will investment some &pound;237 million to take forward the strategic regeneration of the Lower Lea Valley and Barking-Havering Riverside areas.</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/2">Progress on the individual developments is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/3" class="italic"> (a) Innogy site acquisition (spend to date &pound;18.85 million)</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/4">This 26 acre site at Dagenham Dock was acquired by the corporation in May 2008 for around &pound;18 million and will form part of the London Sustainable Industries Park, which is being developed jointly with the London Development Agency. The site has been acquired to provide premises for Environmental Technology Industries some of whom are being relocated to allow other projects in the London Thames Gateway to proceed as planned. The corporation are already in negotiation with a number of businesses and the first deals are expected to be agreed later this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/5">The first occupier of the Sustainable Industries Park, Closed Loop Recycling, the UK's first food grade plastics recycling facility, opened on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-27">27 June</phrase>. The plant will divert a significant amount of waste from landfill.</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/6" class="italic"> (b) Carpetr<i> ight site in Rainham (spend to date &pound;15.87</i><i> </i><i> m</i><i> illion</i> )</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/7">The seven acre site at New Road, Rainham was acquired by the corporation in March 2007 subject to a leaseback to Carpetright plc until May 2008. The deal helped facilitate the development of a new state of the art distribution centre for Carpetright in Thurrock and has released seven acres of land adjacent for new housing and jobs adjacent to Rainham Village centre.</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/8">Agents have been appointed to seek a private sector partner to progress the project and the opportunity will be advertised later this month.</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/9">In the meantime a contract to progress the demolition of most of the buildings on the site has been let and terms have been agreed to let another of the buildings to Havering College to establish a Construction Skills Training Centre. This will be a temporary facility while the corporation works with Havering College to develop a new 80,000 square foot campus on an adjoining site. This is planned to open in 2011.</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/10" class="italic"> (c) Upgrade of Prescott Lock (spend to date &pound;5<i> </i><i> m</i><i> illion</i> )</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/11">The corporation has contributed &pound;5 million towards the construction of water control structures in Prescott Channel and Three Mills Wall River. The project will achieve tidal exclusion and allow waterborne freight delivering construction materials to the Olympic Park. The project is located in a deprived area with the potential for future housing and other developments and will result in a number of environmental, social, leisure and health benefits through the creation of a useable waterway park, an increase in boat journeys, use of cycle paths and walkways. British Waterways is the delivery agent for the project and partners include the corporation, DFT and TfL.</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/12">The project started on site in March 2007 and the planned completion date is now February 2009. This is slightly behind schedule due to land contamination issues and the discovery of an unexploded bomb on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-02">2 June 2008</phrase> but the project is now on track to provide significant benefits to the local community by removing heavy goods vehicles from the road network and creating an improved environment for existing and new waterside homes and businesses.</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/13" class="italic"> (d) Canning Town buy-backs (spend to date &pound;8.8 million)&mdash;there is no buy back programme<i> </i> in Barking Town.</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/14">The investment by the corporation of &pound;9.9 million for the Canning Town buy-backs has helped to achieve vacant possession of most of the site ear-marked for the first phase of the Canning Town centre re-development. Only three properties now remain outstanding and negotiations with the owners are ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/15">Demolition work is progressing in parallel to clear the site. A panel of developers has now been appointed who will be invited to tender for the site in September 2008 with a start on site planned for summer 2010.</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/16" class="italic"> (e) Wildspace Conservation Park visitor centre (spend to date &pound;1.9 million on related access and improvement projects)</p>
	<p pid="d.47W.8/17">Wildspace is being developed as a flagship green space for the Thames Gateway on 1,500 acres in Havering and Thurrock. The corporation are working in partnership with a number of organisations including the local authorities the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Veolia to deliver a number of projects across the park. Projects completed to date include the Purfleet Environment and Visitor Centre (part funded by Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation and managed by the RSPB); The Rainham to Purfleet path and cycleway; Discovery Zones; and improved bus access routes to Ferry Lane. The Wildspace Project Board meet on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-08">8 July</phrase> to agree a detailed programme of work for the next five years.</p>

	<p pid="d.53W.0/1">The EU as a whole is the world's largest provider of humanitarian aid. The EU's mechanisms and structures for humanitarian response give it global capability and capacity to respond to a range of disasters.</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.0/2">The Lisbon treaty (article 214) states that the adoption of the framework of the Union's humanitarian aid operations will be by qualified majority and co-decision. This is not new. The existing framework regulation on humanitarian assistance (regulation 1257/96 of <phrase class="date" code="1996-06-20">20 June 1996</phrase>) was adopted using qualified majority voting, on the basis of development cooperation provisions introduced at Maastricht (currently article 179 of the EC treaty).</p>
	<p pid="d.53W.0/3">The change made by the Lisbon treaty is to provide a specific legal base for such assistance and to make clear that humanitarian aid must conform to principles of impartiality, neutrality and non-discrimination. These principles make clear that the delivery of aid must be guided by need and not by political or ideological considerations. This provision, including the specification of the appropriate legal base, is a positive innovation of the treaty and the Government supports it. These changes will not come in unless and until the Lisbon treaty enters into force.</p>

	<p pid="d.54W.14/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) leads the Government's involvement in the MDG Call to Action campaign. The campaign aims to encourage action by a wide range of stakeholders, including governments, the private sector, NGOs, faith groups and other parts of civil society to accelerate progress on the MDGs and help make 2008 a turning point in the fight against poverty.</p>
	<p pid="d.54W.14/2">We have worked with other Government Departments to ensure that summits of the EU, and G8 discuss MDG issues. We are also actively supporting preparation by the UN of their High Level Event on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-25">25 September</phrase>, which will be attended by governments and other key stakeholders. We hope that this meeting will be a focal point for adding further momentum to efforts to achieve the MDGs.</p>
	<p pid="d.54W.14/3">In May this year the UK Government co-hosted an event in London along with the United Development Programme (UNDP) on the Business Call to Action (BCTA). At the meeting more than a dozen global companies announced new initiatives which use their unique business skills to solve problems on the ground and to transform people's lives. Since then DFID has been working with the World Economic Forum, UNDP and the International Business Leaders Forum as part of the preparations for a UN-hosted Private Sector Meeting in September.</p>

	<p pid="d.56W.5/1">The humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka is remains very serious. As a result of violence, long-term conflict and the 2006 tsunami, there are over 800,000 internally displaced persons. The continuous closure of the main A9 highway linking the Jaffna peninsula with the mainland has made land access impossible for the mainly Tamil speaking residents, severely compromised the local economy and led to the increase in the prices of essential items. Internally displaced people from the Jaffna district as well as parts of north-eastern Sri Lanka remain unable to return to their homes due to the demarcation of large areas as &quot;High Security Zones&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.56W.5/2">The UK, EU and the wider international community have repeatedly pressed the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE to guarantee free access for relief agencies to deliver humanitarian aid to all Sri Lankans affected by the fighting. In September 2007, the Department for International Development (DFID) contributed &pound;1 million to the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross to help provide protection and humanitarian assistance to people affected by the violence. DFID has already contributed a further &pound;250,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) 2008 Appeal. DFID continues to closely monitor the humanitarian situation, including by sending regular monitoring missions to Sri Lanka, the last being in November 2007.</p>

	<p pid="d.63W.0/1">The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is an independent body created by statute. Its responsibilities include handling complaints made under the Data Protection Act 1998, Freedom of Information Act 2000, Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.</p>
	<p pid="d.63W.0/2">The ICO's freedom of information work is funded by grant in aid paid through my department. Separately, the ICO's data protection work is funded by the notification fees it receives when data controllers register with the ICO and which the Office is allowed to retain with the Treasury's agreement. Within this funding framework, as an independent office, the ICO has autonomy to decide how to allocate resources to discharge its statutory responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="d.63W.0/3">The Government are committed fully to both freedom of information and data protection. My Department and the ICO regularly review the resources available to his office and as part of that dialogue my Department provides constructive challenge to ensure that the ICO delivers maximum efficiency and secures the best value from the public money allocated for its statutory responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="d.63W.0/4">In each of the last four financial years, my Department has given the ICO additional funding for his freedom of information work. This year the additional funding represented a 10 per cent. increase on his baseline.</p>
	<p pid="d.63W.0/5">In addition, the Ministry of Justice has promoted a secondment scheme to assist the ICO in tackling the outstanding backlog of freedom of information cases. Under the scheme secondees from central Government Departments, paid for by their Departments, will work at the ICO to assist with clearing the backlog. This was in response to the Commissioner's request for staffing as well as funding.</p>
	<p pid="d.63W.0/6">My Department is also in discussion with the ICO about funding for its data protection responsibilities. Government have agreed to consider new powers for the ICO for data protection inspections and that the fee arrangements should be reviewed to ensure that new powers are accompanied by funding to support the exercise of these powers.</p>

	<p pid="d.65W.9/1">The development of the carbon capture and storage industry is still in its very early stages and therefore it is difficult to estimate the number of jobs that would be created. However, if carbon capture and storage technologies achieve their potential, there will be a global market worth billions of pounds where UK-based firms will be well placed given the UK's leading position on CCS.</p>
	<p pid="d.65W.9/2">As the EU emissions trading scheme cap on CO2 emissions tightens, power generators will increasingly need to find ways of producing electricity with lower emissions. The successful development of CCS technologies could enable coal-fired power stations to play a greater part in our future energy mix than might otherwise have been the case. UK coalfields could benefit from this ongoing demand for coal; the majority of their output today supplies power stations.</p>

This will outline the demand, what is being done and make recommendations where Government can help develop the future skills base. Government will respond to this report.</p>

	<p pid="d.73W.2/1">The Government constantly monitor risks to the UK economy, including from energy-related developments, as detailed in the Energy White Paper (May 2007) and the Long-term Opportunities and Challenges for the UK (November 2006). In addition, the UK's policies, as outlined in the Energy White Paper, in promoting open and competitive markets, increasing energy efficiency, investing in low carbon technologies and the use of alternative energy sources such as renewables will reduce the risks to the UK of any potential future declines in global oil and gas production. Given these initiatives and policies, the government does not feel the need to hold contingency plans specifically for peak oil</p>
	<p pid="d.73W.2/2">The Government test the robustness of their policies against a number of oil price scenarios. These oil price assumptions are published for the period till 2030 and are disseminated throughout Whitehall and where relevant are used by Government Departments in their analytical work. In order to capture some of the uncertainty around future oil prices there are four illustrative scenarios used: low, central, high and high-high.

The NDA is conducting the Sellafield parent body organisation competition under the EU Competitive Dialogue procedure, evaluating the four bids received against agreed evaluation criteria. Within that process bidders were invited to make proposals for a nuclear indemnity under competitive tension against an established framework. It would not be viable for any of the bidders to proceed without an indemnity because any fee earning benefits of the contract would be overwhelmed by the potential liabilities. The NDA has assessed that the benefits of engaging a new contractor far outweigh the remote risk that an indemnity might be called upon. The final form of the indemnity will reflect the specific terms proposed by the preferred bidder.</p>

The QCF is concerned with the outcomes of learning, rather than context, process or delivery institution. It can recognise achievements through any of these definitions. Provided the outcomes of learning are organised into a unit format, they can be given a level and a credit value and count towards a qualification irrespective of the process of learning that leads to these outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="d.113W.5/2">On each of the five occasions where international passengers were misdirected, the UK Border Agency was immediately notified and took appropriate remedial action. All of the incidents were a result of errors made by either British Airways or the British Airports Authority staff. UKBA staff worked closely with the airport operator to redirect passengers to the appropriate area in order to complete all of the necessary immigration checks. This was successful on two occasions, although on the other three, a number of passengers had already left the domestic area.</p>
	<p pid="d.113W.5/3">In these instances, further checks were made which satisfied UKBA staff that the individuals who had entered did not present a known risk to UK security. These checks included cross checking the details of all those who had been on board the aircraft against Home Office databases. In addition, passengers' details were also passed on to the Metropolitan Police Service who carried out additional security checks.</p>

	<p pid="d.116W.3/2">While the internet is a worldwide medium, it is subject to UK law and the UK Government policy is that what is illegal offline is illegal online. As such the internet is subject to the same laws as other media.</p>
	<p pid="d.116W.3/3">The Government's policy in relation to the development of the internet is not to place general monitoring obligations or regulation on those who provide internet services, host websites etc., but rather to allow self-regulation.</p>
	<p pid="d.116W.3/4">In practice, there are excellent working relationships with the internet industry, and they have developed strong working practices and guidelines relating to services they offer and content they host. Where a UK ISP is advised&mdash;usually by law enforcement&mdash;that they are hosting material which is illegal, they have an excellent record in removing it.</p>
	<p pid="d.116W.3/5">Most recently the Home Secretary's Taskforce on Online Child Protection published the Good Practice Guidance for the Providers of Social Networking and Other Interactive Services 2008. This was produced by members of the Taskforce including representatives from social networking sites. This Guidance asks companies to consider a risk assessment approach to their services and considering putting in place a range of potential safeguards where risks to children do occur. It also identifies to both the providers of interactive services and parents, teachers and carers how these sites can be used to exploit children and gives advice on how to keep children safe while using social networking tools.</p>
	<p pid="d.116W.3/6">In September 2007, the Prime Minister announced a review into the risk to children of exposure to harmful or inappropriate content in video games and online. The review also assessed the effectiveness and adequacy of existing measures to help prevent children from being exposed to such material and help parents understand and manage the risks of access to inappropriate content.</p>
	<p pid="d.116W.3/7">Dr. Tanya Byron conducted this review and reported to Ministers in March 2008. The Government have accepted all of the recommendations arising from the review and are currently planning for their implementation. The Government are actively involved in developing the UK Council on Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS), which will replace the Home Secretary's Taskforce.</p>

	<p pid="d.121W.9/2" class="indent">whether, as a matter of interpretation, the ex gratia scheme for the payment of compensation to persons who have lost their liberty as the result of a miscarriage of justice is capable of applying to detention in the context of extradition proceedings;</p>
	<p pid="d.121W.9/3" class="indent">if it is, whether there is evidence of serious default on the part of the Metropolitan Police and/or the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) which the Secretary of State ought to consider; and</p>
	<p pid="d.121W.9/4" class="indent">whether, if an application by Mr. Raissi for compensation failed under the serious default provision, the circumstances of the case are so exceptional that the Secretary of State ought to reconsider the application under the second paragraph of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="d.121W.9/5">The Court of Appeal held that the scheme does apply to detention in the context of extradition proceedings. Further, it held that there was evidence to suggest that the Metropolitan Police and the CPS were responsible for serious defaults. The court made no findings of misconduct. Its judgment, on this point, was limited to considering whether there was evidence that the Secretary of State ought to consider; and it emphasised that it reached no firm conclusions on the issue of serious default, as neither the Metropolitan Police nor the CPS was represented before the court and in any event, findings of fact in relation to any alleged serious default are for the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="d.121W.9/6">The Attorney-General and I have discussed the Court of Appeal's judgment with the Director of Public Prosecutions. We must await the outcome of any further litigation; but pending that, the Director has asked his Principal Legal Advisor to conduct an internal review of the matters raised by the Court of Appeal's judgment and to advise him accordingly, with any such recommendations as he considers to be appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="d.123W.3/1">There has been a small increase (4 per cent.) in the number of staff from the Department for International Development (DFID) in co-located offices since the shared service delivery plan was developed in October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.123W.3/2">The overall number of co-located offices has reduced, primarily as a result of restructuring which has involved the closure of DFID offices in several countries. However, additional co-locations have taken place at our missions in Harare, Lilongwe, Georgetown and Kampala. We also plan to co-locate at Abuja, Bridgetown, Delhi, Dhaka, Kabul and Jerusalem over the course of the current comprehensive spending review period. We are currently co-located in a total of 33 sites.</p>

	<p pid="d.124W.2/10">The FCO uses non-consolidated, non-pensionable, performance-related bonuses to encourage high performance. We pay annual bonuses to staff in the grades below senior managers based on appraisal evidence of annual performance. The highest rating and bonus award is applicable where performance significantly exceeds a challenging performance agreement to a greater extent than considered possible at the start of the appraisal period, and may have radically transformed delivery of policy and/or services.</p>
	<p pid="d.124W.2/11">Variable pay (bonus) arrangements for staff in the SMS/senior civil service (SCS) follow a framework set for Whitehall Departments by the Cabinet Office. We use variable pay for SMS/SCS staff to reward excellent individual performance and achievement during the year. Variable pay decisions are based on a judgment by pay committees of what an individual has achieved in comparison with peers. Those who have delivered the best results, and shown real leadership in doing so, receive the biggest bonuses. Those who have delivered least receive nothing. Whitehall Departments were authorised to spend a sum equivalent to 7.6 per cent. of their SMS pay budget on non-consolidated variable pay for senior staff in 2007 and 8.6 per cent. in 2008. 25 per cent. of senior staff will not receive a bonus in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="d.127W.2/1">We have concerns about human rights and political freedoms in Russia, including the reported rise in violent attacks on ethnic and religious minorities. An outline of our assessment can be found in the 2007 Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Human Rights Annual Report.</p>
	<p pid="d.127W.2/2">We hold annual bilateral human rights discussions with Russia. These were last held in January 2007 and they included discussion on the rights of ethnic and religious minorities: The next meeting is planned for later this year. We also raise our concerns through the EU/Russia human rights consultations, which were last held in April 2008. At the consultations, the EU raised a number of concerns related to specific human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Russian Federation including the rights of persons belonging to minorities and combating racism and xenophobia. We welcome President Medvedev's condemnation of &quot;any ethnic or religious enmity&quot; in his speech on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-09">9 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.127W.2/3">The FCO supports projects in Russia which promote human rights, including strengthening state and civil society capacity to combat religious and ethnic discrimination. Last year, we spent &pound;15,000 on such projects (out of a total spend of &pound;700,000 to support human rights, good governance and reform in Russia).</p>
	<p pid="d.127W.2/4">The UK is committed to combating anti-Semitism and all forms of racism.

In each case the planned closure has been approved by the Minister of State following consultation. Our approach to closure of a customer-facing Jobcentre takes into account a range of issues, for example, the impact closure may have on customer service and whether the work and staff can be relocated. When we are looking to withdraw our services from a location we are committed to full consultation with our customers, partner organisations, Trade Unions, staff, and local Members of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.3/5" class="indent">I am only able to provide information on the number of Jobcentre Plus offices closed since April 2002, when Jobcentre Plus was created by the merger of the former Employment Service and Benefits Agency. A list of the Jobcentre Plus offices closed in each year since April 2002 is attached and a copy will be placed in the Library.</p>

For the current tax year, income tax personal allowances will be increased by &pound;600 for all tax payers under 65. Around 22 million basic-rate taxpayers will benefit from this change. This not only helps those that lost out from the tax changes, but also middle income families at a time of rising food and oil prices throughout the world.</p>

	<p pid="d.141W.2/1">Since 2004 the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has regulated mortgages, including lifetime mortgages, one type of equity release product. In 2007 the Government extended the scope of FSA regulation to cover home reversion plans (the other main type of equity release product), to help ensure a level regulatory playing field for the equity release market.</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/2">The FSA's regime provides consumers of equity release products with appropriate protections. These include rules on the suitability of equity release products where a firm is giving advice. The FSA's regime also offers means of redress for those consumers who experience problems.</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/3">Equity release products are complex financial products, and consumers considering equity release should seek independent financial advice.</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/4">The Government do not hold data on the number of equity release products sold each year or data on potential mis-selling.</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/5">The FSA conducts regular reviews of its regulation of financial services markets, including the equity release market. Results of these reviews and other research is available at:</p>

	<p pid="d.141W.2/8">The Chancellor receives representations from a wide range of stakeholders on issues relating to equity release products and other financial services. Locating this material and evaluating whether it might be released would present a disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.141W.2/9">There are no plans to change the regulatory regime for equity release products at this time. The Government keep all legislation under review.</p>

Security conditions are broadly stable if fragile in places, particularly in the South and East of the country. Overall in 2007, 70 per cent. of security incidents were confined to 10 per cent. of Afghanistan's 398 districts, which together contain less than 6 per cent. of the Afghan population.</p>

	<p pid="d.159W.11/1">The MOD has 15 departments of community mental health (DCMHs) in the UK with additional satellite centres in Germany, Cyprus and Gibraltar. Responsibility for their individual management is shared between the single service commands.</p>
	<p pid="d.159W.11/2">DCMHs came into being in April 2004. Prior to 2004 community-based mental health services were provided by what were known as departments of community psychiatry (DCPs). The conversion of DCPs to DCMHs involved providing uplifts of funding to the single services for the creation of specific staff posts and improvements to IT resources. The amount of funding provided to each of the single services varied depending on their needs, however in financial year 2004-05 it totalled approximately &pound;7.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.159W.11/3">Each service funds its respective DCMHs differently, with funding provision coming from a number of areas. Estimated annual costs for an average Army DCMH are approximately &pound;543,000, which covers staff pay and other associated costs, such as allowances, training, equipment and line rental.</p>
	<p pid="d.159W.11/4">Due to the number of budgets to which costs would be attributable any detailed study of DCMH finances would incur disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid="d.162W.11/1">Civilian employees who use their private vehicle for official duty may claim one of two mileage rates, the Standard Rate of Motor Mileage Allowance (SRMMA) or where there are more economic methods of travel, the Private Travel Rate of Motor Mileage Allowance (PTRMMA). Rates are:</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.11/2" class="italic"> SRMMA:</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.11/3" class="indent">40p per mile for the first 10,000 miles</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.11/4" class="indent">25p per mile for travel more than 10,000 miles</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.11/5" class="italic"> PTRMMA:</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.11/6" class="indent">25p per mile</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.11/7">The SRMMA is based on HM Revenue and Customs Authorised Mileage Allowance Payments (AMAPs) and the PTRMMA on the AMAP for travel more than 10,000 miles.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.11/8">There are several travel allowances which can be claimed by service personnel.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.11/9">The UK Private Car Rate (PCR) is more usually claimed for duty journeys (i.e. journeys undertaken for reasons such as meetings or official visits). It is payable for journeys where there is no spare seat available in a service or private motor vehicle already scheduled to undertake a journey in the required direction and, although public transport could be used without undue detriment to the interests of the service, the use of a private motor vehicle is considered reasonable. The rate is 28.3p per mile.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.11/10">The UK Official Duty Rate (ODR), which is authorised only very occasionally for duty journeys where the use of a private motor vehicle is essential and there is no cheaper alternative, is the same as the SRMMA for civilians and is also based on HM Revenue and Customs Authorised Mileage Allowance Payments AMAPs.</p>
	<p pid="d.162W.11/11">Service personnel who travel daily between the accommodation where they live and their place of duty may claim Home to Duty (HTD) (Public) if they live in public accommodation or HTD (Private) if they live in private accommodation. The allowance is based on the distance travelled up to a maximum of 50 miles per single journey, less a personal contribution of one mile per single journey for HTD (Public) and nine miles per single journey for HTD (Private). The rates are paid on a daily basis and vary according to the number of miles travelled. For example the daily HTD (Public) rate claimable for a distance of 30 miles each way from the place of duty is &pound;9.94.</p>

	<p pid="d.168W.2/1">Over the past two years the Ministry of Defence has undertaken a series of actions to reduce the amount of waste it produces and sends to landfill. These include: conducting a series of site waste audits to determine the processes that generate waste; implementing site waste minimisation schemes; and commissioning a Waste Management Improvement Project. This examined waste management activities carried out throughout the defence estate and how these could be improved to reduce the amount of waste generated in the first instance and to increase the amount of waste that remained to recycling and recovery operations. The recommendations from this report are in the process of being actioned.</p>
	<p pid="d.168W.2/2">The Ministry of Defence is also working closely with not-for-profit organisations such as WRAP (Waste Resources Action Programme) to increase the amount of construction waste re-used on site and recycled off-site, and NISP (National Industrial Symbiosis Programme) which looks to create industrial synergies with local businesses and organisations so that the Department's waste is used as another's resource.</p>
	<p pid="d.168W.2/3">The MOD Specialist Training School at RAF Halton also runs an accredited three-day waste management course which teaches individual site environmental advisers the practical aspects of waste management with an emphasis on waste reduction and recovery.</p>

The DTR contract is not yet let but Nord Anglia are envisaged as a lower-tier sub-contractor to Metrix. MOD will therefore be assuring itself that this change in ownership does not in any way preclude the inclusion of Nord Anglia under the terms of the proposed DTR contract, which includes specific provisions to protect the national interest. If these subcontracting conditions cannot be met, the requirements of the contract to provide the DTR services nonetheless persist and it will be for Metrix, as the prime contractor, to deliver against those requirements.</p>

The 2004 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guideline on the classification and care of women at risk of familial breast cancer estimates that three to 5 per cent. of women have inherited faults that can lead to a high risk of developing breast cancer. Up to 27 per cent. of women may have an inherited predisposition to breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid="d.179W.2/2">Recent research has identified other genes, which are associated with a small increased risk of developing breast cancer. Further work is needed but these discoveries offer the possibility that we will be able to identify more women at increased risk.</p>

	<p pid="d.179W.8/1">We have been informed by the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) that it assesses the performance of care homes against the Care Homes Regulations 2001, taking account of the relevant national minimum standards (NMS). Inspectors also assess how care homes comply with other regulations, such as those relating to health and safety.</p>
	<p pid="d.179W.8/2">CSCI uses key lines of regulatory assessment (KLORA) to help in making judgments about each NMS outcome group. These guidance documents provide inspectors with examples of evidence that may be found in an excellent, good, adequate or poor service. The KLORA are a description of what the standards might look like in practice, not an additional set of standards that have to be met. They help to translate evidence into a judgement of either excellent, good, adequate or poor, to assist in assessing how well a care service is performing.</p>
	<p pid="d.179W.8/3">The following tables show the information held centrally with regard to the cancellation of registration of providers of care homes and care homes with nursing in Southend, Essex and England during the operational years from 2003-04 to 2007-08. The data cover both cancellation of registration under section 17 'normal' cancellations following the set Notice of Proposal procedure and section 20 'urgent applications to a Justice of the Peace', of the Care Standards Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="d.179W.8/4">It should be noted that all care homes are residential. CSCI distinguishes between those that provide personal care only, nursing homes and non-medical nursing homes.</p>
	<p pid="d.179W.8/5">In Southend, three care homes underwent cancellation of registration during the period. These cancellations were due to continuous failure on the part of the providers in question to meet regulations and an unacceptable degree of risk to people living in the services.</p>
	<p pid="d.179W.8/6">In Essex, one care home underwent cancellation of registration during the period. The home, which was deregistered in 2004-05, provided a poor physical environment and had issues regarding staffing. This provider subsequently applied for a voluntary cancellation.</p>
	<p pid="d.179W.8/7">We have been informed by CSCI that to provide the reasons for all cancellations in England since 2003-04 would involve disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="d.182W.2/1">We have been informed by the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) that The Commission for Social Care Inspection (Fees and Frequency of Inspections) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 require CSCI to make arrangements to inspect care homes, domiciliary care agencies and adult placement schemes at least in every three-year period. The Regulations permit CSCI to take a proportionate approach to inspection, based on an assessment of the quality, risk and outcomes for the people who use services.</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.2/2">In order to make these assessments, CSCI carries out key inspections of all registered services. Key inspections, which are usually unannounced, are a thorough examination of how well a service is performing. Inspections take into account information provided by the owner or manager, the views and experiences of people living there, their relatives, staff and visiting professionals, as well as information CSCI finds when it visits the service. CSCI also considers any relevant information it has received about the service since the last inspection, for example, concerns that may have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.2/3">CSCI uses all information collected to measure how far the experiences of people using a service meet their expectations in areas that are important to them. Inspecting in this way helps CSCI to put residents at the heart of how it judges the quality of services. From these judgments, CSCI awards quality ratings, which help it to plan how often the service should be inspected in future. The frequencies are:</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.2/4" class="indent">a three star&mdash;excellent&mdash;service will receive at least one key inspection every three years;</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.2/5" class="indent">a two star&mdash;good&mdash;service will receive at least one key inspection every two years;</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.2/6" class="indent">a one star&mdash;adequate&mdash;service will receive at least one key inspection every year; and</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.2/7" class="indent">a zero star&mdash;poor&mdash;service will receive two key inspections every year.</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.2/8">This does not mean that a service will not be inspected more often if necessary. CSCI also carries out shorter, targeted, random inspections. These are usually unannounced and can take place at any time of the day or night. CSCI may undertake a random inspection because it has received information that suggests people using the service might be at risk, or to check on improvements that should have been made.</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.2/9">During each year in which services rated excellent or good are not inspected, CSCI carries out an annual service review. During a review, CSCI analyses all the information received about the service during the last 12 months, including any complaints or notifications. It also surveys people using the service and other interested parties. If, as a result of the review, CSCI considers the quality of the service may have changed, it may decide to bring forward the next key inspection or to carry out a random inspection visit.</p>
	<p pid="d.182W.2/10">To provide information on the standard of care in every care home inspected in each of the last three years would incur disproportionate cost. CSCI inspects homes against the National Minimum Standards (NMS) for Care Homes for Older People or the NMS for Care Homes for Adults. The decision as to which set of NMS should be used is made by the inspector at the time of the inspection and is based on the current age profile of the residents of the home. The following tables show the percentages of homes meeting or exceeding the individual NMS during the last three years for which information is available.</p>

	<p pid="d.197W.5/1">PCTs have been asked to follow a small number of core criteria for the general practitioner (GP)-led health centres, including that the centres should be situated in an easily accessible location, that they can be used by any member of the public, whether registered with the health centres or not by either a bookable appointment or on a walk-in basis, and that they are open from 8 am-8 pm, 365 days a year. It is, ultimately, for PCTs to identify the best location for these new services following consultation with patients, GPs and others to reflect local needs and preferences.</p>

	<p pid="d.200W.9/1">Due account was taken of the potential preventative benefit of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine against vulval and vaginal cancers. The natural history of vaginal and vulval cancers is not completely understood. Although HPV infection is a risk factor for the development of vaginal or vulval lesions, unlike cervical cancer, only approximately 50 per cent. are associated with HPV infection. The evidence for a causal association and the percentage attributable to HPV infection, is greater for HPV types 16 and 18 than for other HPV types. Further studies are being conducted on the extent to which the HPV vaccine may protect against vulval and vaginal cancers caused by HPV type 16 and 18.</p>

	<p pid="d.202W.0/1">Wherever possible surveillance and information gathering during a pandemic will be based on existing data collection mechanisms. The attack rate will be estimated by modellers, principally those at the Health Protection Agency, through clinical data emerging from the United Kingdom and other affected countries. Disease pattern and severity will also be based on this information and that from national seasonal influenza surveillance systems, coordinated through the Health Protection Agency and mortality will be monitored through death registration data from the Office for National Statistics. There are data already monitored routinely as part of national seasonal influenza surveillance.</p>
	<p pid="d.202W.0/2">Work is under way to ensure that information obtained from all these sources will be robust during a pandemic and appropriate to the needs of modellers and others who will use them.</p>
	<p pid="d.202W.0/3">The proportion of individuals infected with a pandemic strain of influenza who would go on to become clinical cases over the course of a pandemic is estimated to be between 50 per cent. and 66 per cent. Evidence from seasonal influenza and the 1957 pandemic suggest that of these between 50 per cent. and 67 per cent. will show clinical symptoms. This is consistent with a worst case clinical attack rate of around 50 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="d.202W.0/4">The increase in the antiviral stockpile from 25 per cent. to 50 per cent. will ensure treatment is available for all symptomatic patients under the maximum clinical attack rate assumption of 50 per cent. There is thus much less chance that the dynamic targeting referred to will be needed. Flexibility in antiviral distribution via the Flu Line will be achieved by adjusting the clinical algorithm based on the clinical information obtained as the pandemic unfolds, as well as stock management and policy decisions. Plans for separate distribution channels are being developed to assist the hard to reach groups and others for whom the Flu Line will not be suited.</p>
	<p pid="d.202W.0/5">As stated in the &quot;National Framework for responding to an influenza pandemic&quot;, it is possible to use antiviral medicines as a preventative measure (prophylaxis), copies of this publication have already been placed in the Library. The adoption of a policy of household prophylaxis is still being considered by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="d.202W.0/6">The Department hopes that the antiviral stockpile will be procured during the latter part of 2008 and early 2009.</p>

	<p pid="d.207W.2/1">Commissioning for local health services in England is the core responsibility of primary care trusts (PCTs). It is a complex process with responsibilities ranging from assessing population needs and prioritising health outcomes to procuring products and services, and managing service providers. As such, commissioners are required to possess a wide range of skills, including robust analysis, effective stakeholder engagement and communication, financial management, strategic planning and performance management skills. The joint Department of Health and Prime Minister's Delivery Unit review of commissioning capabilities in May 2007 suggested that some PCTs perform better in some areas than others. However, there is not yet any comprehensive evidence about commissioning strengths and weaknesses nationally.</p>
	<p pid="d.207W.2/2">In June this year, a national commissioning assurance system was launched to hold commissioners to account through assessing their performance and rewarding development. PCTs will be assessed against commissioning skill sets, or competencies, organisational governance and health outcomes. By publishing and assessing against the competencies that make commissioning for health services world class, a clearer national picture will emerge. PCTs will also be better able to understand where their commissioning strengths and weaknesses lie and will be incentivised to access support and development resources in order to improve.</p>

	<p pid="d.208W.2/1">Regulatory impact assessments no longer exist as they have been superseded by impact assessments. The Department follows the criteria contained in guidance provided by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR). Impact assessments are required:</p>
	<p pid="d.208W.2/2" class="indent">for all forms of intervention (including primary or secondary legislation as well as codes of practice or guidance) where the department or regulator considers that the effect will be to increase or decrease costs for business, the public sector, third sector organisations, regulators or consumers;</p>
	<p pid="d.208W.2/3" class="indent">when proposals would not yield an overall net change in costs and benefits but some kind of redistribution, or when there is a change in administrative costs; and</p>
	<p pid="d.208W.2/4" class="indent">when seeking collective agreement for United Kingdom negotiating positions on European Union proposals, and also when submitting bids for primary legislation to the Legislative Programme Cabinet Committee.</p>
	<p pid="d.208W.2/5">However, a proportionate approach should be used. If the cost of a proposal is below &pound;5 million only a developmental/option stage impact assessment is necessary.</p>

	<p pid="d.214W.2/1">Pedaciel, Repevax, Infanrix-IPV and Menitorix have been put on an allocation system. The allocation system aims to ensure general practitioner contractors receive doses based on their historic vaccine requirements so every child should be immunised with no need to delay immunisations. Where surgeries are concerned that they may not have sufficient stocks for a clinic they have contacted the Department's vaccine supply team who are working to ensure additional doses have been made available.</p>
