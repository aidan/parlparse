Members who have not taken their seats at Westminster&mdash;that is, at present, four Sinn Fein members from Northern Ireland&mdash;access to certain facilities and accompanying allowances here. We believe that, as well as enabling their constituents' interests to be better represented, this would be consistent with the progress made in implementing the Belfast Agreement, including recent steps to establish on a more stable footing the political institutions provided for in the Agreement, in which Sinn Fein participate fully. This is however entirely a matter for the House, and we shall therefore be tabling a motion on the subject for debate next week.</p>

This included an analysis of available research on the impact of qualifications on women's and men's wages and found that the evidence varies across studies. None the less, although it is difficult to identify the precise size of the impact, acquiring qualifications has a positive impact on wages and labour market participation for both men and women. Estimates of the relative impact also vary by qualification. Research commissioned by the skills taskforce suggests that private returns to A-levels are slightly higher for women, while returns to first degrees are broadly equivalent by gender.</p>

The proposed guidance builds on consideration of the results of an earlier consultation.

	<p pid=".943W.8/1">The Department has received representations from the public concerning the impact of noise, the misuse of fireworks in public places and issues of safety.</p>
	<p pid=".943W.8/2">Under current legislation it is an offence under section 80 of the Explosives Act 1875 to throw or set off fireworks in any highway, street or thoroughfare or public place. The power to enforce this section of the Act rests with the police.</p>
	<p pid=".943W.8/3">All fireworks sold to the public must also comply with the Fireworks (Safety) Regulations 1997. The regulations, among other things, ban certain types of larger and more powerful products from retail sale, set the minimum age for purchasing fireworks at 18 years and require that all fireworks for sale must comply with the British Standard (BS7114). Local authority trading standards officers enforce the regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".943W.8/4">In addition the Department runs an annual fireworks safety campaign, working closely with police, fire brigades and local authorities to promote safety messages during the firework season. This year over 25,000 safety toolkits were distributed to schools for use in the classroom to heighten awareness of the dangers of fireworks and to promote considerate behaviour.</p>
	<p pid=".943W.8/5">We believe that the current restrictions on the sale of fireworks and rules on their use, backed up by an active safety campaign, provide the right level of control over the sale of fireworks. We have no present plans to introduce further controls but will continue to keep the position under review.</p>

	<p pid=".945W.2/2">The Proceeds of Crime Bill, which is currently before Parliament, will consolidate and strengthen existing anti-money-laundering legislation. It will also provide new power for the investigation of money laundering. It is currently an offence for any person to fail to report knowledge or suspicion of drug or terrorist money laundering which comes to their attention in the course of their trade, business or profession. The Bill replaces that offence with an offence for a person working in a sector covered by the Money Laundering Regulations to fail to make a report to the authorities if he knows, suspects or has reasonable grounds to know or suspect that another person is laundering the proceeds of any criminal activity.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.2/3">At present, not all accountants are regulated under the 1993 Money Laundering Regulations (although all are subject to the general obligation to report knowledge or suspicions of drugs or terrorist money laundering arising in the course of one's trade, business or profession). However, under the second European money laundering directive, which is expected to be formally adopted after Christmas, accountants will be brought within the regulated sector. When this directive is implemented in UK law, accounts will be subject to both the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Bill, and the requirements of the Money Laundering Regulations as regards identification of customers, record keeping and reporting of suspect financial transactions.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is responsible for the statutory oversight of the arrangements for the regulation of company auditors and, in that respect, of the adequacy of the procedures of recognised accountancy bodies for investigating and disciplining auditors. This Department also has a wider interest in the regulatory arrangements of the main accountancy bodies for investigating and disciplining their members, including those who may have engaged in or facilitated money laundering, or who may have failed in their duties to report suspicious transactions to the appropriate authorities. Members of these bodies are subject to byelaws and regulations which make them liable to disciplinary action and penalties. Under reforms previously agreed between the bodies and the Government, a new Investigation and Discipline Board, under the aegis of the Accountancy Foundation, will take over responsibility for disciplinary cases which raise significant public interest issues.</p>

	<p pid=".950W.2/1">Although EC Regulation No. 2037/2000 now requires the recovery of CFCs and HCFCs from foam, this had not been the original intention under the proposal for a regulation published by the European Commission in August l998. The text prepared by the commission only required the recovery of ozone depleting substances from foam &quot;if practicable&quot;. The language in the relevant article was changed during negotiations shortly before the draft regulation was agreed by the Environment Council in February 1999. The UK raised this issue at a number of meetings with the commission and other member states in order to seek clarification. However, it was not until June this year that the commission finally clarified that the regulation requires the CFCs and HCFCs to be removed from foams found in waste refrigerators for destruction.</p>
	<p pid=".950W.2/2">From <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-01">1 January 2002</phrase>, the EC Regulation on Ozone Depleting Substances will require 'controlled substances' (including CFCs) in coolants and in insulating foam to be removed before recycling or reclamation of domestic refrigerators units. Waste refrigeration units will need to be stored until suitable domestic processing facilities come on-line. The Department has issued guidance on CFC extraction plant and guidance on the storage of waste refrigeration equipment, prior to CFC extraction. The Department's website <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk">http://www.defra.gov.uk</a>. also contains information on the requirements of the regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".950W.2/3">We have recently announced an extra &pound;6 million in the local government finance settlement to help local authorities with the extra costs of dealing with fridges to the end of this financial year. We are urgently assessing the impacts of the regulation and will determine what further action will be necessary beyond that.</p>

	<p pid=".952W.8/1">Much has been done to address noise from transport and industry including: reducing the level of noise generated by individual vehicles and aircraft; traffic management schemes; and addressing noise at the planning stage of new noise generation or noise sensitive developments. Such action has considerably reduced the output of noise from individual sources but has often failed to reduce the overall ambient noise because of other factors, such as the growth in the number of vehicles on our roads. A consultation seeking views on the first steps towards an Ambient Noise strategy will be launched later this month. A significant part of this strategic approach will be an exercise to build on the noise mapping already carried out of the major transport and industrial noise sources across England. The first stage of this exercise, for which &pound;13 million has been set aside, will start in the new year.</p>

	<p pid=".953W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".953W.8/2">There are no specific measures in place to manage chemical weapons and munition dumps on the seabed in the coastal waters of the United Kingdom, as the consensus of international scientific opinion is that munitions on the seabed present no significant risk to safety, human health or the marine environment, provided they remain undisturbed.</p>
	<p pid=".953W.8/3">I am aware, however, that there are two range danger areas, D306 (formerly RAF Cowden) D307 (RAF Donna Nook), which are near my hon. Friend's constituency. D306 was closed as a range a few years ago, but D307 continues to be used by the RAF for practice bombing runs. Coastal erosion of the range danger area D306 has caused much of the explosive ordnance previously used for practice bombing to re-emerge. A quantity of unexploded iron bombs are lodged in the cliffs at this range, and, periodically, these fall on to the beach area as a result of the three metres of erosion which occurs each year. To ensure that any danger to the public is kept to a minimum, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel from the Ministry of Defence are carrying out clearance and disposal of this ordnance. It is expected that this will take up to 15 years to complete.</p>
	<p pid=".953W.8/4">On the D307 range, explosive ordnance from World War Two was buried offshore under the sand, which is covered daily by the tides. An EOD team from RAF Coningsby carry out an inspection, either daily or weekly depending on tides and the programme of activities at the range, to determine if any ordnance has emerged through the sand. If any munitions or other hazardous items are discovered during the regular inspections, action is taken to remove or destroy the offending article. This is an important activity, which is intended to minimise any risks to the public from exposed ordnance on the range. A risk assessment was conducted three years ago, which endorsed the acceptability of the procedure for handling exposed munitions.</p>

	<p pid=".954W.2/2">Several thousand man days of effort on the processing of CAP payments have been lost by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) as a result of industrial action. This action comes on top of the diversion of significant numbers of staff to deal with the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. In addition the need to develop computer software upgrades for the bovines schemes to reflect regulatory changes has meant that the start of advance payments has been delayed. Moreover, because of the need to perform FMD cross-checks in order to establish entitlement to aid progress with processing is slower than normal.</p>
	<p pid=".954W.2/3">As a result of these factors advance payments on the livestock schemes are expected to be made within the advertised payment windows but later than would have been the case in a normal year.</p>
	<p pid=".954W.2/4">The Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS) under which payments are made in a regulatory payment window running from <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-16">16 November</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2001-01-31">31 January</phrase> is the scheme mainly affected by industrial action. In a normal year approximately 60&ndash;70 per cent. of the aid would be paid in the first two to three weeks of the window. This year the figure will be a little over 50 per cent. The Rural Payments Agency is taking all reasonable steps to mitigate the impact of the industrial action to ensure that payments delays are kept to the absolute minimum.</p>

	<p pid=".956W.5/1">Trade unions have a key role to play in promoting the development of learning and skills in the workplace. To help them do this our Department has provided financial support through the Union Learning Fund since 1998. The ULF budget is &pound;7 million this year. This source of funding is helping trade unions use their influence with employers, employees and others to encourage greater take up of learning at work and boost their capacity as learning organisations. It has so far benefited over 25,000 people in the workplace through a wide variety of projects ranging from tackling basic skill needs to advanced professional development. It has also led to the development of a new breed of activist, the union learning representative, and helped to establish a network of over 3,000 learning representatives nationwide.</p>
	<p pid=".956W.5/2">Union learning representatives are ideally placed to help and encourage workers to improve their skills, particularly among low skilled workers and those with literacy and numeracy problems. That is why we have included a clause in the new Employment Bill that will give statutory backing to union learning representatives. This will reinforce the invaluable role that union learning representatives are currently playing in the workplace to promote work force development and open up new training opportunities for their colleagues.</p>

The Council plans to introduce a common funding approach for 2003&ndash;04 in line with our consultations in 1999, 2000 and 2001. Progress to date has been good with development of a consistent national funding system this year for Work Based Learning. Progress in 2002&ndash;03 will continue with the development of new funding arrangements for further education and the council's assumption of responsibility for school sixth form funding. We are committed to work with the council further to develop funding systems, to ensure that funding follows the learner and facilitating the development of a rational and coherent approach to funding different forms of post-16 provision.</p>

	<p pid=".958W.2/1">Family learning, which is one strand of our strategy for involving parents in children's education, can strengthen families, help children to achieve and give adults the confidence to go on learning. That is why we have commended it to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) and, in 2002&ndash;03, are making &pound;7.5 million available to local education authorities (LEAs), through the Adult Learning Plans they will agree with local LSCs. One specific type of provision&mdash;family literacy and numeracy&mdash;is part of 'Skills for Life', our national strategy for adult literacy, language and numeracy. In 2001&ndash;02, &pound;17 million will be spent to help parents and children improve their literacy and numeracy skills together.</p>
	<p pid=".958W.2/2">Family learning is part of a wider drive to support families through our education and skills policies. We are providing a range of materials enabling parents to help their children learn, including &quot;Learning Journey&quot; guides to the curriculum, our free &quot;Parents + Schools&quot; magazine and our &quot;Parent Centre&quot; website. We are encouraging schools to offer a range of family and community services, which might include learning opportunities and child care. Study support initiatives can offer parents the change to get involved in school life. Our Sure Start programme works with parents and young children to combat disadvantage; and the Children's Fund is being used to develop family support services, including family learning, in a number of deprived areas.</p>

It was aimed at addressing the worst of the condition backlog in schools in 1997. It has now been replaced by programmes that are allocated to local education authorities and schools by needs-related formulae, so that decisions on which repairs to undertake are made locally. One such formulaic programme is new deal for schools devolved formula capital grant, which is made available principally to fund capital repairs to school buildings. Since this is allocated to all schools, we can be assured that, for the first time, every school has a budget to support high priority repair work.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.0/3">It is for local education authorities to determine the need for additional schools places in the maintained sector and, where necessary, build new schools. The Department maintains a record of all currently open schools. For the Department, in addition, to collect and hold detailed information on capital investment at individual school level would be overly bureaucratic for the Department, local authorities and for schools.</p>

These permit us to test defence equipment to a fixed standard.

Further additions to this database are expected in the coming year from new member nations.

Such employers include, for example, the Brunei Government for pay surveys in Brunei and the US embassy for pay surveys in Nepal. In Germany, where the largest proportion of locally engaged civilians are employed, pay and terms of service are negotiated centrally by the Germany Federal Ministry of Finance and the national Trade Unions in accordance with the Collective Tariff Agreement applicable to the NATO Sending States.

	<p pid=".968W.2/2">The Warship Support Modernisation initiative is looking at ways to modernise support arrangements across all UK Naval Bases and Dockyards, and, by reducing national spare capacity, to achieve savings for the defence budget. We have received proposals from the Dockyard Companies for the provision of certain Naval Base outputs in partnering arrangements with the Naval Base Commanders. These are now being assessed alongside alternative proposals received from our joint Trade Unions. All options are being evaluated fully and without prejudice. Decisions on the way ahead are expected early next year.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.2/3">Privatisation is not being considered&mdash;if partnering with private companies is decided on as the way ahead, the Naval Bases would continue to be run by the Naval Base Commander, with the commercial partner helping to provide part of the service.</p>

	<p pid=".972W.0/1">The Ministry of Defence is funding a programme designed to establish whether a scientifically rigorous test can be developed to determine historical exposures to depleted uranium (DU). Given such a test is developed, epidemiological studies will be undertaken to establish whether there is any correlation between ill-health and exposure to DU. As part of the MOD's Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme, which has so far seen over 3,000 service personnel and a small number of defence industry employees who served in the Gulf, a very small number of tests for total uranium have been carried out in cases where physicians believed that such tests would assist in treatment of their patients. All these tests showed that the signs and symptoms displayed by these patients were not due to any form of uranium exposure. In the early 1990s, a small number of UK troops concerned they had inhaled DU dust while conducting work in the Gulf conflict had their lungs monitored&mdash;no detectable DU contamination was found.</p>
	<p pid=".972W.0/2">There are established systems within the United Kingdom for monitoring the health and safety of those who are exposed to depleted uranium as part of their work activities. These systems are, and always have been, employed throughout the MOD and involve monitoring of personnel and the working environment. Some individuals also receive annual health reviews. These measures ensure that exposures to depleted uranium are as low as reasonably practicable and do not exceed statutory limits. Therefore there is no reason for investigations of the type mentioned for these employees.</p>
	<p pid=".972W.0/3">Other than those mentioned above, the health of those employed within defence industries is a matter for the employers concerned and for the Health and Safety Executive.</p>

	<p pid=".975W.2/1">By United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1373(2001) the Security Council inter alia calls upon member states both to eliminate &quot;the supply of weapons to terrorists&quot; (paragraph 2(a)) and to</p>
	<p pid=".975W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;co-operate, particularly through bilateral and multilateral arrangements and agreements, to prevent and suppress terrorist attacks and take action against the perpetrators of such attacks&quot; (paragraph 3(c)).</p>
	<p pid=".975W.2/3">I have therefore reviewed the Government's policy in respect of arms exports in light of this resolution. In view of the Government's strong continued commitment to human rights, regional stability, and the campaign against terrorism, and taking account of the fact that our human rights obligations are not affected by the adoption of the resolution, I believe there is no need to amend the consolidated criteria in order for us to comply fully with the terms of the resolution. My detailed conclusions are as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".975W.2/4">(1) Export licensing decisions are taken on a case by case basis against all of the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria, as set out on <phrase class="date" code="2000-10-26">26 October 2000</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2000-10-26.200"><i>Official Report</i>, column 200W</phrase>, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time. The last paragraph of the preamble to the consolidated criteria states that:</p>
	<p pid=".975W.2/5" class="indent">&quot;An export licence will not be issued if the arguments for doing so are outweighed by the need to comply with the UK's international obligations and commitments, by concern that the goods might be used for internal repression or international aggression, by risks to regional stability or by other considerations as described in these criteria&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".975W.2/6">(2) Criterion two of the consolidated criteria includes the statement that HMG:</p>
	<p pid=".975W.2/7" class="indent">&quot;considers that in some cases the use of force by a Government within its own borders, for example to preserve law and order against terrorists or other criminals, is legitimate and does not constitute internal repression, as long as force is used in accordance with the international human rights standards described above&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".975W.2/8">(3) In judging individual applications, the Government will take account of the terms of UNSCR 1373(2001) and will continue to pay attention to this passage in criterion two, within the discretion provided by the consolidated criteria.</p>
	<p pid=".975W.2/9">(4) The consolidated criteria already state that, when considering export licence applications, the Government will take account of the record of the buyer country with regard to</p>
	<p pid=".975W.2/10" class="indent">&quot;its support or encouragement of terrorism and international organised crime&quot; (criterion six (a)) and that</p>
	<p pid=".975W.2/11" class="indent">&quot;the Government will pay particular attention to the need to avoid diversion of UK exports to terrorist organisations&quot;. (criterion seven). This makes clear our commitment to preventing arms exported from the UK from falling into the hands of terrorists.</p>
	<p pid=".975W.2/12">(5) We are taking additional steps to strengthen our export controls. The Export Control Bill currently going through Parliament gives the Government a number of new powers which will help to improve our ability to prohibit the transfer of arms or related technology to terrorists, including new powers to control the transfer of technology by intangible means and trafficking and brokering in arms. We are aiming to sign the UN Firearms Protocol soon and will encourage others to do so, and have proposed bringing forward analysis of the OSEC's information exchange on the marking of small arms. These steps will help us to keep small arms out of terrorists' hands by helping us to trace weapons flows and to combat the illicit manufacture and trafficking in firearms.</p>
	<p pid=".975W.2/13">(6) Finally, the new Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill includes clauses to close the gaps in our present legislation relating to chemical, nuclear and biological weapons to prevent the use, production, possession or participation in unauthorised transfers of these materials.</p>

	<p pid=".977W.0/2">Data collected by the Department do not record how many foreign doctors and nurses were recruited into the national health service last year.</p>
	<p pid=".977W.0/3">In order to work in the United Kingdom foreign doctors and nurses have to be registered with the appropriate regulatory body, the General Medical Council (GMC) for doctors and the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC) for nurses. They do not necessarily work in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".977W.0/4">In the year to <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase> there were 1,416 admissions to the UKCC register via European Community arrangements. In the same period there were 5,988 foreign entrants from outside the European Community.</p>
	<p pid=".977W.0/5">GMC data do not distinguish between UK and European Economic Area (EEA) doctors. In 2000 there were 5,649 newly registered doctors from the UK/EEA. 3,054 new doctors with overseas qualifications (outside the EEA) registered with the GMC in 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".977W.0/6">The Department does not collect data for Britain. In England in 2000&ndash;01 there were 49,090 nurses in training. We forecast that in 2001&ndash;02 this will rise to around 53,500.</p>

	<p pid=".981W.11/42">These figures show a significant increase in the number of admissions to hospitals and the number of people seen as out-patients since 1990&ndash;91.</p>
	<p pid=".981W.11/43">The NHS Plan commitment is that by 2005 the maximum waiting time for in-patient treatment will be cut from 18 months now to six months, the maximum waiting time for a routine out-patient appointment will be halved from over six months now to three months and traditional waiting lists will be replaced with booking systems. By the end of 2008 we aim to treat all out-patients and in-patients within three months, subject to recruitment and reform.</p>

	<p pid=".982W.2/2">The decision on how quickly a patient should be referred to out-patients is a clinical matter and it is for general practitioners to decide this on a case by case basis. To assist GPs in referring, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is developing referral guidance for certain conditions including benign prostate disease, osteoarthritis of the hip, and lower back pain. The Department has issued guidance to the national health service that priority treatment should be given to war pensioners, both as in-patients and as out-patients, for examination or treatment relating to the condition for which the patient receives a pension, unless in emergencies or if another case demands clinical priority.</p>
	<p pid=".982W.2/3">The process of booking appointments should be patient focused. The national booked admissions programme, launched in 1998, is putting in place systems that allow patients to pre-book appointments for a time that is convenient for them, and by the end of 2005 we are committed to all out-patient and in-patient elective admissions being pre-booked.</p>

The approved guidance on the role and duties of the ward housekeeper&mdash;&quot;Housekeeping, a first guide to new, modern and dependable ward housekeeping services in the NHS&quot;&mdash;was placed on the national health service estates website in November 2001 for public access. A short video film and complementing leaflet, &quot;Ward Housekeepers, getting the basics right&quot;, showing how the housekeeper works within the ward team, were also produced and distributed in November 2001 to interested NHS trusts.

	<p pid=".985W.0/1">The National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) was published on <phrase class="date" code="2000-03-06">6 March 2000</phrase> setting out national standards for the care of patients with CHD. This includes guidance on appropriate care on discharge from hospital following a heart attack, on secondary prevention of CHD to prevent further events, and on the provision of cardiac rehabilitation. In addition, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has produced a clinical guideline on secondary prevention for patients who have had a heart attack which covers appropriate drug treatment and the role of rehabilitation.</p>
	<p pid=".985W.0/2">Spending on national health service services generally comes from a unified allocation to health authorities and it is not possible to identify the total spend on a particular area of care. We have provided substantial increased funding and by 2003 we will be investing an extra &pound;230 million a year in heart services. Money has also been made available from Her Majesty's Treasury capital modernisation fund to provide equipment for rehabilitation (&pound;10 million) and primary care services (&pound;15 million).</p>

The cost of haemodialysis treatment in satellite units, where most private sector involvement rests, is not available in published literature because of the variation in structure, process and patient case-mix in these units.</p>

	<p pid=".986W.8/2">The &pound;5 million of current expenditure funding is to support the process of moving inappropriately placed patients out of the high security hospitals to more suitable accommodation. Agreement has been reached with the regional commissioners of high and medium secure psychiatric services about the split of the &pound;5 million between regions, and an allocation will shortly be made to the lead commissioning health authority for each region.</p>
	<p pid=".986W.8/3">The &pound;38 million of capital expenditure relates to improvements to the physical security of the high security hospitals, particularly the upgrading of perimeter security that Sir Richard Tilt saw as being necessary in the interests of maintaining public safety. The funding was split, in line with estimated need, between the three Department of Health regional offices with performance management responsibility for a high security hospital. Actual spend across the three hospitals as at the end of November 2001 was &pound;8.4 million. It is estimated that financial year-end spending will be significantly greater than this amount but that there will be a carry over of spending planned for 2001&ndash;02 into 2002&ndash;03, particularly due to a delay in the perimeter security upgrading at Ashworth hospital arising from complications in obtaining planning permission.</p>

	<p pid=".989W.2/19" class="italic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/20">1. Expenditure is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total spent by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within each region. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/21">2. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. The effect of this double counting within the answer cannot be identified.</p>

One of these incidents resulted in the public caller area being closed all day and customers were diverted to another nearby BA office. Feedback from Group 4, who provide security services for the BA, is that they have not been notified of any incidents or complaints, and generally BA customers have been very understanding and co-operative.</p>

	<p pid=".993W.2/28" class="italic">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".993W.2/29">1. The derivation of year on year percentage change in income levels from the above data is not recommended due to the fact that sampling variation for any individual year is large in relation to year on year change.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.2/30">2. All figures are estimates. There is evidence to suggest that the poorest 10 per cent. of the population as defined by their income may not be the poorest 10 per cent. in terms of living standards.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.2/31">3. Data are not available for each year of the period requested&mdash;with the financial year 1999&ndash;2000 being the latest data available.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.2/32">4. Results from the Family Resources Survey have been available only since 1994&ndash;95. Prior to that the Family Expenditure Survey was used as the data source for the Households Below Average Incomes (HBAI) series. Due to differences in the methodology employed in both the collection and analysis of data from both surveys, the figures presented above are not directly comparable across the two surveys.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.2/33">5. FRS data are presented on a financial year basis. FES data for 1987 are presented on a single calendar year basis, that for 1988&ndash;89 to 1992&ndash;93 on a two-year combined calendar year basis and 1993&ndash;94 to 1995&ndash;96 on a two-year combined financial year basis where, for example, &quot;1995&ndash;96&quot; denotes the financial years 1995&ndash;96 and 1996&ndash;97 combined. The coverage of the FRS is Great Britain only, as it excludes Northern Ireland, while that of the FES is the whole of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.2/34">6. The monetary values presented are rounded to the nearest pound and are equivalised. That is to say that incomes are adjusted to take into account both the size and composition of the household to allow fair comparisons between different family types. The incomes presented above relate to the actual incomes of a couple with no children, which is used as the benchmark for equivalisation in HBAI.</p>
	<p pid=".993W.2/35">7. As is standard HBAI convention, figures are presented on both a Before and After Housing Costs basis, in order to take into account variations in housing costs between households that do not necessarily reflect equivalent variations in the quality of housing.</p>

	<p pid=".997W.0/2">Social security spending is under control. The rate of growth under this Government is around half that under the previous Government. Indeed, without the extra spending of around &pound;3 billion on families and &pound;7.5 billion on pensioners, forecast spending in 2003&ndash;04 would be lower in real terms than it was in 1996&ndash;97. We can spend more on priority groups because we have reduced the costs of social and economic failure. For example, spending on benefits for unemployed people this year will be around &pound;4 billion less than in 1996&ndash;97.</p>

	<p pid=".1003W.13/1">Official statistics on the number of antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) issued are based on quarterly returns received from magistrates courts committees (MCC). A review identified an under-count and my Department therefore undertook an exercise with the police to obtain more reliable figures. As a result of this reconciliation exercise the total number of ASBOs issued up until the end of September this year was 466, 184 more than previously reported. A breakdown by MCC area is given in the table.</p>

Radar displays a primary speed using several hundred measurements taken during the passage of the vehicle through its beam. It requires most of these to be within two kilometres per hour. Devices using sensors on or in the road show a primary speed which is the lower of two measurements taken between different sensor pairs. The speed is only shown when they agree within two miles per hour.</p>

	<p pid=".1006W.0/19">From April 2000 eight partnerships, comprising local police forces, local authorities, highways authorities and magistrates courts have been piloting a new 'netting off' scheme. This allows the fixed penalty revenue from speed and red-light traffic cameras to be re-invested to fund additional camera enforcement.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.0/20">Under the scheme, local magistrates courts within a partnership collect all fixed-penalty notice and fine revenue from offenders. The element to be netted off goes to the partnership's Local Authority, which acts as treasurer for the scheme, and distributes the funds to each of the partners on the basis of invoiced spend. Any revenue not used for camera enforcement goes to HM Treasury. The Home Office receives no money.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.0/21">In August the Government announced the national roll-out of the netting off scheme, and a further seven partnership areas joined the scheme in October 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".1006W.3/2">Speed cameras indicate whether or not a driver may be exceeding the speed limit. The enforcement of speed limits is an operational matter for chief officers of police. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) published guidelines on speed enforcement thresholds in February 2000 to support a transparent and consistent approach, while recognising that not all speeding offences are the same. The police retain discretion to take account of the particular circumstances of any individual speeding incident.</p>

	<p pid=".1010W.3/1">Currently, it is not possible for individuals, other than those with ancestral ties to the United Kingdom, to come to this country to seek and take up work in the absence of a job offer. This makes it difficult to attract highly mobile people with the special talents that are required in a modern economy. We are therefore introducing a programme specifically for highly skilled migrants which will enable them to come to the United Kingdom and seek work.</p>
	<p pid=".1010W.3/2">This programme is designed to allow highly skilled people to migrate to the United Kingdom in order to seek and take up work. It differs from the work permit scheme, as it does not require an employer to obtain a permit for the individual, and from the existing business routes (for example, the Innovators scheme or other business categories) in that it does not require a detailed business plan or investment in the United Kingdom. It will initially be run as a concession outside the current immigration rules.</p>
	<p pid=".1010W.3/3">In order to qualify, applicants will need to demonstrate that they score 75 points or more. Points can be scored in five areas: educational qualifications, work experience, past earnings, achievement in chosen field and &quot;Highly Skilled Migrant Programme priority applications&quot;. This final area has been specifically designed to facilitate the recruitment and retention of suitably qualified overseas doctors who wish to work as general practitioners for the national health service.</p>
	<p pid=".1010W.3/4">I am today placing in the Library a draft version of the guidance to applicants. This includes full details on how an individual can score sufficient points to meet the standard required to qualify under this programme. Applicants will also have to demonstrate that they can continue their chosen careers and that they will be able to maintain and accommodate themselves and any family while in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".1010W.3/5">Those already in the United Kingdom in a capacity leading to settlement may apply directly to the Home Office to obtain this status. We will also allow those graduating from a United Kingdom university, or completing their post-graduate medical studies, to apply while remaining in the United Kingdom, provided they have not been sponsored by their home governments.</p>
	<p pid=".1010W.3/6">The Highly Skilled Migrant Programme will run for an initial period of 12 months and will come into force in January 2002. Application forms will be available from the Home Office and Foreign and Commonwealth Office websites at <a href="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a> respectively. Applications will be accepted by diplomatic posts overseas from <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-28">28 January 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1010W.3/7">This programme represents a further step in developing our immigration system to maximise the benefits to the United Kingdom of highly skilled workers who have the qualifications and skills required by United Kingdom businesses to compete in the global marketplace. It will allow eminent scientists to base their research projects here, should encourage the movement of business and financial experts to the City of London and give those at the top of their chosen profession the choice of making the United Kingdom their home.</p>

	<p pid=".1011W.2/2">Over the West Midlands as a whole, the most common category of crime is theft (including handling of stolen goods), which comprises about 38 per cent. of crime recorded by the police. This category is also the most common over England and Wales as a whole. Figures for all theft are not collected centrally below police force area level.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.2/3">Totals of offences of violence against the person, sexual offences, and robbery, which comprise violent crime, have been collected at the Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) level since <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-01">1 April 1999</phrase>. The total numbers of violent offences recorded in the Coventry CDRP area in the years ending March 2000 and March 2001 were 5,986 and 6,912 respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.2/4">It should be noted that recorded violent crime is subject to changes in reporting and recording. The 2001 British Crime Survey found that, over England and Wales as a whole, reporting to the police of violent offences comparable to those in recorded crime rose from 35 per cent. in 1999 to 45 per cent. in 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.2/5">Also, the British Crime Survey has shown that, in England and Wales as a whole, victimisation for the violent crime in the survey which is comparable to recorded crime decreased by 19 per cent. between the 1999 and 2000 calendar years, whereas comparable violent crime recorded by the police increased by nine per cent. Violent crime recorded by the police may therefore not necessarily be a reflection of real changes in the level of victimisation.</p>

	<p pid=".1013W.9/1">I have decided to provide up to &pound;40 million of financial assistance to compensate airlines for losses arising directly from the <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September</phrase> terrorist attacks in the United States. Qualifying airlines will now be invited to submit claims under this scheme. I have placed a copy of the scheme conditions in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.9/2">Compensation under the scheme will cover lost revenue over the period during which airspace was closed. It will also compensate for additional costs incurred during that period, such as (but not limited to) airport and airspace charges, costs incurred in transporting passengers from their diverted destination to their intended destination, additional operating costs of diverted aircraft and additional crew costs.</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.9/3">In making this decision I have had regard to the views of many hon. Members who have written to me, of their constituents, of the airlines and of the trade unions. I accept that the circumstances, which are consequent both on the terrorist attacks and on the subsequent decisions affecting airspace, are indeed exceptional and therefore merit exceptional assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.9/4">The Government have worked with their European partners to minimise distortions to the single market, and have therefore supported guidelines which limit airline compensation to cover these exceptional circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.9/5">The assistance I am offering will help airlines at a time when passenger numbers on services between the UK and US, and therefore revenues, are still significantly below their pre-<phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September</phrase> levels, but without distorting competition or relieving airlines of the need to take appropriate measures to meet the changed conditions in the market. The UK is giving a lead in the EU in announcing a scheme of financial assistance in respect of the closure of US airspace, just as it was the first to provide third-party war risk insurance when the market failed.</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.9/6">Assistance under this package is in conformity with Commission guidelines on state aid, and I have notified the Commission of my intention accordingly.</p>

Although qualifying rural areas are designated centrally it is the responsibility of the local authorities to identify qualifying settlements of less than 3,000 persons in these rural areas. They are not required to notify us of these settlements. Therefore, we do not know where or how many properties in a particular area are in qualifying rural settlements.</p>

Although local authorities provide the Department with the amount of rate relief granted in any year this is not broken down into the different types of property that are eligible to receive it.

	<p pid=".1022W.5/13">The figures cover both receipts from the central list (collected by central Government) and from local lists (collected by local authorities). There are several factors that can influence the amount of business rates received from one year to the next. Some of them are likely to have led to overall increases in amounts received between 2000&ndash;01 and 2001&ndash;02, and others are likely to have led to overall decreases. Factors that are known to have influenced the pattern of business rates received in 2000&ndash;01 compared with so far in 2001&ndash;02 are described as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.5/14" class="indent">(a) The total rateable value increased from &pound;39,169 million in April 2000 to &pound;41,807 million in April 2001;</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.5/15" class="indent">(b) The multiplier increased from 41.6p in 2000&ndash;01 and to 43.0p in 2001&ndash;02. This increase was in line with changes in the Retail Prices Index, as required by legislation;</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.5/16" class="indent">(c) The transfer of Crown properties to local lists in 2000&ndash;01 caused some delay to the issue of bills in that year. Consequently, in 2001&ndash;02 there has been a change in the pattern of business rate receipts as result of some Crown properties paying their bill in full at the start of the financial year;</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.5/17" class="indent">(d) Similarly, the transfer of power stations from the central list to local lists from 2000&ndash;01 caused some delay to the issue of bills in that year. Consequently, business rate receipts for power stations are spread more evenly across the financial year in 2001&ndash;02 than they were in 2000&ndash;01, with a higher proportion being received in the first half of the year;</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.5/18" class="indent">(e) The effects of foot and mouth disease, resulting in an increase in the amount of hardship relief granted, deferment of payment by business rate payers to help overcome short-term cash-flow difficulties and, on a slightly longer timescale, a reduction in rateable values.</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.5/19">Other general factors that can influence business rate receipt levels in any year include:</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.5/20" class="indent">(f) addition of new assessments to the rating list as a result, for example, of the opening of new large retail premises;</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.5/21" class="indent">(g) other local difficulties, such as the closure of significant businesses in the area;</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.5/22" class="indent">(h) late dispatch of bills; and difficulties faced by the introduction of new computer systems; and</p>
	<p pid=".1022W.5/23" class="indent">(i) successful appeals on the rateable value, with refunds going back several years.</p>

	<p pid=".1024W.0/1">I am today announcing the first all-purpose capital allocations to local authorities through the single capital pot for 2002&ndash;03. A total of &pound;2.3 billion will be provided in this first year of the pot. This is more than double the amount authorities received last year in basic credit approvals (BCAs).</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.0/2">Today's announcement reflects the substantial increases in public resources provided for local government investment in Spending Review 2000 and demonstrates our real commitment to delivering first rate public services.</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.0/3">These funds will not be ring-fenced for any particular capital investment. While the pot is made up of allocations from housing, transport, education and health budgets, councils will be free to make their own decisions about investing their capital funds locally. This delivers to councils more autonomy and flexibility to invest according to the priorities of the local community.</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.0/4">The single capital pot also includes a new discretionary element. Five per cent. of the total resources available through the pot have been distributed to authorities on the basis of their performance in delivering the relevant services and the quality of their strategic asset management planning. Its purpose is to encourage and reward the effective use of a council's physical assets and new capital investment in supporting delivery of quality services and achieving better value for local people.</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.0/5">Detailed tables, showing the total service allocations and the discretionary allocations for each authority, have been placed in the Library of the House. These include allocations that form part of the local transport capital settlement announced today. In parallel, housing authorities will today receive details of their housing allocations and a copy of these has also been placed in the Library.</p>

These include improvements to public transport, schemes to make local roads safer, less congested and better maintained, and measures to encourage cycling and walking. In addition we are accepting for funding a further 23 major local transport schemes, to add to the 69 major schemes accepted last year.</p>

	<p pid=".1026W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Minister for Transport has today written to the Head of Planning and Transportation at the East of England Local Government Conference and has placed a copy of his letter in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/2">The multi-modal studies programme is a key element of our policies for integrated transport. It applies rigorously the principles which underpin our 10 Year Plan, matching solutions to severe transport problems by assessing all the options across different transport modes.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/3">The Cambridge to Huntingdon multi-modal study has looked in depth at the problems caused by the congested A14. These include unreliable journey times, affecting freight and public transport, as well as motorists, and accidents and congestion on other unsuitable local roads.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/4">The study, recommended in full by the East of England Local Government Conference, called for:</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/5" class="indent">A guided bus system utilising the former Cambridge to St Ives rail corridor as its core;</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/6" class="indent">Complementary measures to encourage public transport, cycling and walking;</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/7" class="indent">The widening and partial realignment of the A14 in the corridor to form a three-lane carriageway, including a southern bypass of Huntingdon;</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/8" class="indent">Associated junction and local road improvements, including parallel local roads between the M11 and east of Fenstanton.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/9">We welcome the solutions proposed by the study. They present an integrated package of measures to improve conditions for travel in the corridor between Huntingdon and Cambridge. I am particularly encouraged that many local transport elements, such as a new guided bus system, park and ride, bus priority and improved walking and cycling facilities have been included in the recommendations. These offer the prospect of great benefits to the city of Cambridge and the surrounding area.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/10">Some concerns have been expressed about the potential environmental impacts of the proposed road improvements. The provision of additional road capacity should only be considered after measures for making better use of existing capacity have been fully explored. In this case, however, we believe that public transport investment alone could not meet the objectives of the study. We are satisfied that a new alignment for the A14 south of Huntingdon would secure balancing environmental benefits by taking through traffic off the highly intrusive viaducts through Huntingdon.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/11">The multi-modal study process does not pre-empt any of the other statutory processes. More detailed work is now required to develop and appraise individual proposals. We are inviting Cambridgeshire County Council to come forward with a full appraisal of the early phases of the guided bus project within six months and to explore further with the Strategic Rail Authority, Railtrack and the train operators the viability of the third phase alongside an existing railway line.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/12">We have also asked the County Council to develop, in consultation with district councils and others, local transport proposals for measures to support public transport, cycling and walking. The proposals will need to be developed in consultation with local people whose commitment to reducing congestion and pollution in the area will be essential to the success of the Preferred Plan.</p>
	<p pid=".1026W.2/13">In addition, the Highways Agency will commence preparatory work on the trunk road elements in the Preferred Plan with a view to adding the scheme to the Targeted Programme of Improvements in the near future. I am also aware that the recently published Cambridge Implementation Study has set out ideas for substantial public and private investment in transport and other infrastructure and I envisage that the partnership which supports that study should be a good foundation for further co-ordinated working to implement CHUMMS.</p>
