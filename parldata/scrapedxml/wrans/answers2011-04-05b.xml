	<p pid="b.737W.0/2">In view of the range of reforms that have been announced and the different periods over which they will be carried out, the benefits will be realised over different time scales, with some delivering net savings beyond the current spending review period.</p>
	<p pid="b.737W.0/3">Estimated savings are in the following table. These estimates are subject to ongoing review as the final details of the implementation of the reforms are agreed.</p>

			<tr pid="b.737W.0/8"> <td>Gambling Commission/National Lottery Commission</td> <td>Merge</td> <td>Reforms including co-location and merger are estimated to generate savings of approximately &#163;600,000 to &#163;900,000 per annum (Note: neither costs nor savings fall to the Exchequer).</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.737W.0/14">For reforms relating to the UK Film Council, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, Public Lending Right, Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, Sport England and UK Sport the costs and benefits are subject to ongoing analysis and while we expect they will generate material savings no final figures are yet available.</p>
	<p pid="b.737W.0/15">DCMS also has a number of advisory NDPBs that have either little or no associated costs. Reforms relating to these bodies will not therefore generate any significant savings, but likewise will be achieved at little or no cost. In some cases, such as the Theatres Trust, it is important to note that the bodies are not being abolished but will be declassified, as the NDPB status is not necessary for the body to carry out its functions. The correct proposed reforms for our advisory bodies listed are:</p>

	<p pid="b.739W.6/1">Ministers have received representations from a number of interested parties about recent difficulties in resolving funding arrangements for some services to problem gamblers. This is a matter for the independent charities concerned, and for their respective Boards of Trustees where relevant. I understand that the immediate issues have now been resolved. I hope that the parties involved will continue to demonstrate their commitment to tackling problem gambling by working together constructively to agree a longer term solution. The current funding structure was established by the industry, in preference to a statutory levy, to try to ensure that industry donations are used to the best effect to reduce problem gambling levels. It does not involve public money, nor any publicly imposed administrative burdens.</p>

	<p pid="b.742W.3/1">Where a customer is in hardship due either to the time taken to process their benefit claim or to the fact that an emergency has arisen before their next payment is due, they may be able to get an interim payment or a Social Fund crisis loan. An interim payment is always considered in the first instance. Where either there is a doubt about entitlement or no benefit is due, for example at the beginning of a claim, a Social Fund crisis loan is appropriate. An interim payment is not appropriate for a delayed crisis loan because interim payments are made in recognition of the fact that benefit will ultimately be payable for the period in question.</p>
	<p pid="b.742W.3/2">Training for the administration of interim payments is included in the new entrant learning for a benefit delivery processor dealing with claims to income support (IS), jobseekers allowance (JSA) and employment support allowance (ESA), supported by links to the relevant guidance. This training provides an awareness of the interim payment process and includes the priorities for an interim payment and a crisis loan, the action to take on entitlement, and the action to take when the customer does not qualify for an interim payment. The training for these types of payments across the three benefits also includes the detailed processes and actions to take within prescribed time limits to ensure the accuracy of an interim payment.</p>

	<p pid="b.755W.3/1">Winter fuel payments are one part of the overall Government programme to support vulnerable groups in winter. For winter 2011-12, most people who have reached women's state pension age will receive a winter fuel payment of either &#163;200 or &#163;300 depending on their household circumstances. The winter fuel payment remains a significant contribution to an older person's winter fuel costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.755W.3/2">Targeted help for vulnerable groups is provided through cold weather payments-which the coalition Government has permanently increased from &#163;8.50 a week to &#163;25 a week. Cold weather payments provide real help to those most vulnerable to the cold i.e. disabled adults and children; the elderly and families with children under five who are in receipt of an income related benefit. They are paid when the average temperature where a customer lives is 0&#176; C or below for seven consecutive days. This winter over 17 million cold weather payments have been paid in Great Britain worth an estimated &#163;430 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.755W.3/3">In addition, subject to parliamentary approval, from winter 2011-12 some of the poorest pensioners would get direct assistance with their energy costs through a rebate off their electricity bills under the Warm Home Discount scheme. Rebates would be at least &#163;120.</p>
	<p pid="b.755W.3/4">The programme of support for vulnerable groups also includes the annual seasonal influenza vaccination programme which offers free flu jabs to people most at risk from potentially life-threatening complications of flu. The Government ran a new website service, Winter Watch, as well as its annual Keep Warm Keep Well Campaign for 2010/11 to provide advice on staying warm over the winter and staying in touch with people who may be vulnerable during cold weather, including the elderly, in order to reduce illness and deaths.</p>

	<p pid="b.756W.3/13">The smaller proportion of contracts by value in the three years from 2006-07 reflects the award of a few very large contracts to non-SMEs. However, these large contracts will themselves have generated significant business for SMEs as subcontractors. Indeed, the figures shown above are all under-representative of the total number of contracts placed with SMEs throughout the supply chain.</p>
	<p pid="b.756W.3/14">The December 2010 Green Paper entitled &quot;Equipment, Support and Technology for UK Defence and Security&quot; includes a section which discusses ways in which the MOD might make procurement easier and improve access to Defence contract opportunities for SMEs at both prime and subcontract level.

	<p pid="b.759W.5/2">We are in dialogue with the Interim National Council (INC) and other elements of the opposition inside and outside Libya. We are convinced that political reform in Libya is necessary, that the Gaddafi regime has lost all legitimacy, and that the Libyan people have clearly indicated their desire for change. But the form of any political settlement is for the Libyan people themselves to decide. We support the efforts of the INC to prepare for a more democratic and accountable government in Libya. Their announcement of a political programme was an important first step in that process.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.5/3">We have no details of the involvement in the Libyan internal opposition movement of individuals with a background in violent political activities or international terrorism in Afghanistan or Iraq, or of membership of proscribed terrorist organisations. We have been clear that it is essential that the Libyan opposition ensure that they are not infiltrated by Al-Qaeda. It is clear from our engagement with the INC that that they are sincere in their wish for an inclusive, democratic Libya which rejects extremism, as shown by their manifesto and public statements rejecting extremist ideas, and committing to combating them in all circumstances and implementing UN Security Council Resolutions on counter-terrorism.</p>

	<p pid="b.761W.7/2">I can confirm that since May 2010, grants and contracts have been awarded to external bodies to assist the development of sponsored academies which generally replace underperforming schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.761W.7/3">Contracts are awarded through an established framework to procure project management and educational services needed by academies in their pre-opening development phase. The value of contracts varies according to the needs of the project.</p>
	<p pid="b.761W.7/4">Grant funding can be paid to academy trusts who undertake themselves the pre-opening project management and educational services needed by academy projects rather than appoint a commercial project management company.</p>
	<p pid="b.761W.7/5">Since May 2010, 20 projects have been approved and therefore eligible for funding. Of those, grant payments have been made to one project and contracts entered into for five totalling &#163;2,358,766.</p>

	<p pid="b.777W.0/1">Local authorities have a strong strategic role to fulfil as commissioners of schools and school places and a statutory duty to plan and secure the provision of schools. Free schools are designed to respond to local parental demand for change and as such we would expect local authorities to work with groups who come forward with an idea for a school. The changes in the Education Bill also provide for LAs to invite, as a first choice, solutions from an academy or a free school group where they have identified a need for additional school places.</p>

	<p pid="b.781W.3/1">The Department has assessed the effectiveness of a number of pre-natal and adult parenting classes in improving child development. Details of these are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.781W.3/2" class="italic"> Pre-natal classes</p>
	<p pid="b.781W.3/3">The Family Nurse Partnership programme (FNP), which includes a focus on parenting skills, starts in the pre-natal period and continues until the child is two years old. It is designed to improve the health, well-being and self-sufficiency of parents and their children.</p>
	<p pid="b.781W.3/4">Early research into the implementation of FNP has demonstrated that the programme generates high levels of engagement with hard to reach families, strong engagement with fathers, a reduction in smoking during pregnancy and increasing breastfeeding rates. More information is available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.781W.3/6" class="italic"> Adult parenting classes</p>
	<p pid="b.781W.3/7">The Department for Education currently provides funding support to the National Academy of Parenting Research (NAPR) that looks at effective parenting interventions and evidence-based parenting programmes that work to improve child well-being and educational attainment. Findings about the effectiveness of the parenting programmes will be published in 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.781W.3/8">In 2008 and 2010 the Department for Education published results from the evaluation of the Parenting Early Intervention Pathfinder (PEIP). The parenting programmes have had positive effects on the parents' mental well-being and the style of parenting, as well as their children's behaviours. More information is available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.781W.3/10">Family intervention services work with the most challenging families. The intervention provides the families with the support of a dedicated 'key worker' who co-ordinates a multi-agency package of support and works directly with the families to help them overcome problems. In 2006 the Department commissioned the National Centre for Social Research to conduct a programme of research to monitor and evaluate Family Intervention Projects (FiPs) as they were then known. This programme of work is currently ongoing. Published statistics can be found here:</p>

	<p pid="b.782W.2/7">In Reading West constituency in January 2010 there were 2,500 pupils known to be eligible, which would give rise to a pupil premium of &#163;1,073,000.

The Principal Agreement contains a comprehensive dispute resolution process which would be used if a dispute arose between the parties after it had been signed. It sets out that, where initial efforts fail, and mediation by the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) does not solve the problem, any party can refer the matter to an adjudicator. If the parties cannot agree who should adjudicate, the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators would appoint one.</p>

	<p pid="b.787W.12/1">The latest available data from the 2010 School Census shows that the majority (54.9%) of children with special educational needs (SEN) statements-those with the most severe and complex needs-are educated in mainstream schools. Other than in exceptional circumstances, all children with SEN but without statements are educated in mainstream schools. In January 2010, 90% of the 1.7 million pupils identified with Special Educational Needs were in maintained mainstream schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.787W.12/2">For children with statements of special educational needs, parents currently can request that their child goes to a local authority maintained school, including a maintained mainstream school, and the local authority has a conditional duty to send the child to the school the parents have requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.787W.12/3">The Green Paper 'Support and Aspiration: A new approach to special educational needs and disability' was published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-09">9 March</phrase>. In that, the Government makes clear that parents should have a real choice between mainstream and special schools in meeting their children's needs. To this effect, it proposes to introduce legislation to ensure that the parents of children with an SEN statement, or a new 'Education, Health and Care Plan', have equivalent rights to request any state-funded school-whether that is a mainstream school, special school, mainstream or special Academy or Free School-and that the local authority will have the same conditional duty to send the child to the school the parents have requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.787W.12/4">Where parents request a mainstream place, the Green Paper proposes a number of ways to help equip mainstream school teachers with the necessary skills and knowledge to meet the needs of children with SEN. These include: funding for a greater number of teacher trainee placements in special school settings so that prospective teachers can develop their skills in meeting the needs of children with SEN; encouraging learning from the best practice in mainstream and special schools; scholarships for serving teachers to develop their practice in supporting pupils with SEN, including in specific impairments and; launching a tender for bids from external organisations to build on the good practice achieved by the successful Achievement for All approach to school improvement, with its emphasis on high expectation and constructive engagement with parents.</p>

	<p pid="b.788W.5/2">We expect the first special academies to open in September 2011. Parents will then have the right to ask for their child with a statement of special educational needs to go to a special academy. Local authorities will have to consider parental requests for a place at a special academy, but will not be obliged to name it in the statement as the school the child will attend. In cases where parent's preferences have not been met, parents have the right to appeal to the first-tier tribunal (special educational needs and disability).</p>
	<p pid="b.788W.5/3">Local authorities cannot direct all children with statements to-attend their local special schools.

The Government's Green Paper &quot;Support and Aspiration: A new approach to special educational needs and disability&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-09">9 March</phrase>, proposes that all parental requests for a placement in state-funded schools, including special academies, will be treated in the same way.

	<p pid="b.789W.8/2">Decisions on pay and conditions are taken at local level, by the employer of the staff in question. All employers are obliged to ensure that their reward structure delivers equality of pay across their work force. This is the purpose of the Single Status review that has been carried out in Cumbria. The Government believe it is right for this matter to be dealt with locally. In doing so, however, there is an expectation that the staffing structures in place in schools will be those that provide for the greatest impact on pupil outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.789W.8/3">I am aware that many school support staff in Cumbria are concerned about the outcomes of the county council's Single Status job evaluation.

	<p pid="b.790W.12/2">Sentencing Guidelines are clear that the amount of a fine must reflect the seriousness of the offence. The court must also take into account the financialcircumstances of the offender, so that the impact is equal on offenders with different incomes; it should be a hardship but not force an offender below a reasonable subsistence level. For the offence of driving without insurance the guideline is that a 'Band C' fine should be imposed, with a starting point of 150% of weekly income.</p>

Since a decision has been taken not to implement the provision, it will no longer have that impact on the Department.</p>

	<p pid="b.797W.13/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.797W.13/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated March 2011:</p>
	<p pid="b.797W.13/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking how many men in each age group were diagnosed with prostate cancer in each of the last five years; and what proportion (a) died and (b) recovered in each such year.</p>
	<p pid="b.797W.13/4" class="indent">The latest available figures for newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer (incidence) are for the year 2008. Please note that these numbers may not be the same as the number of people diagnosed with cancer, because one person may be diagnosed with more than one cancer.</p>
	<p pid="b.797W.13/5" class="indent">The numbers of newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer in England by age group, in each year from 2004 to 2008, are presented in Table 1.</p>
	<p pid="b.797W.13/6" class="indent">ONS does not publish figures on what proportion of people diagnosed with a cancer (a) died or (b) recovered. Instead, ONS publishes figures on one-year and five-year relative survival for adults diagnosed with cancer, by age group and sex.</p>
	<p pid="b.797W.13/7" class="indent">Relative survival is an estimate of the probability of survival from cancer alone. This takes into account the fact that some cancer patients will die from other causes other than their cancer during the period in question.</p>
	<p pid="b.797W.13/8" class="indent">For some cancers, five-year survival figures are interpreted as 'cure' rates. However, some prostate cancer tumours progress very slowly and may not cause symptoms or death. Patients diagnosed with these types of tumours are monitored in the first instance, rather than being treated with a view to being 'cured'. For these reasons, five-year survival from prostate cancer is not the same as 'recovery' or 'cure'.</p>
	<p pid="b.797W.13/9" class="indent">The latest one-year and five-year survival rates available for adults diagnosed with prostate cancer are for men diagnosed in 2003-2007 and followed up to 2008. These figures are presented by age group in Table 2.</p>
	<p pid="b.797W.13/10" class="indent">ONS does not publish site-specific cancer survival figures by single year of diagnosis. For statistical reliability, figures are published for three- to five-year periods, to avoid over-interpretation of random year on year fluctuations.</p>
	<p pid="b.797W.13/11" class="indent">The latest published figures on the incidence of prostate cancer in England are available on the National Statistics website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.797W.13/12" class="indent"><a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_health/mb1-39/mb1-no39-2008.pdf">www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_health/mb1-39/mb1-no39-2008.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.797W.13/13" class="indent">The latest one-year survival figures available for England, for 21 common cancers, for patients diagnosed in 2003-2007 and followed up to the end of 2008, are available on the National Statistics website at:</p>

The increase in farmgate prices for feed wheat over the last 12 months are a reaction to the lower wheat production in Russia and other Black Sea countries, and the subsequent implementation of grain export restrictions by Russia and Ukraine. An additional factor is higher energy prices, which have pushed up farm input costs such as fuel and fertiliser.</p>

	<p pid="b.803W.2/1">The Sustainable Development Commission ceased its activities on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase> prior to its formal closure. We are working with the food industry and across Government to ensure that we have a sustainable food industry capable of dealing with a growing population and changing climate while protecting biodiversity. The Foresight report on Global Food and Farming Futures has given us a roadmap for how to go forward with this in conjunction with governments around the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.803W.2/2">The Taskforce on barriers to increasing fruit and vegetable production and consumption reported in August 2010 and agreed an action plan in October 2010. The Taskforce consisted of industry leaders including growers, retailers, researchers, and health advisers. They propose continuing the upward trend of UK production of indigenous fruit over five years to meet 50% of consumption. Consumption had grown from 33% in 1998 to 38% 10 years later. Both the SDC and the Taskforce acknowledge that the UK will never be totally self sufficient in fruit, especially fruits such as bananas and citrus.</p>
	<p pid="b.803W.2/3">Although swill feeding is banned, EU legislation permits the use in feed of certain low-risk foodstuffs, such as surplus bread, cakes, confectionary (not-containing ruminant gelatine), vegetables and fruit, which are no longer intended for human consumption, provided they are only sourced from food manufacturing sources or retail establishments and procedures for adequate separation can be established preventing any contact with meat, fish and other animal by-products.</p>
	<p pid="b.803W.2/4">A significant amount of local food activity already exists, working to address local concerns about health, sustainability, social cohesion and the economy. Such activity ranges from very small scale, such as community gardens, to larger scale producer networks, food hubs and small businesses, such as box schemes. I recently met with the English Food and Drink Alliance, which consists of regional food groups and initiatives working across the food chain, to understand how they are working. I also urge Local Enterprise Partnerships, where appropriate, to encourage local food hubs, which bring growers, processors and small food businesses together in sustainable operations. In addition, the Plunkett Foundation will soon be launching the findings of Social Enterprise Action Research funded by Government to explore the role of social enterprise in food policy in England.</p>

	<p pid="b.804W.2/3" class="indent">Government Buying Standards will be published in the next few weeks which will, for the first time, set out what constitutes healthier and more sustainable food and catering services for the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/4" class="indent">Established the industry-led Task Force on Farming Regulation which will identify ways to reduce the regulatory burden for all farm sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/5" class="indent">Invested &#163;13.6 million of Government funding for collaborative research, with matching contributions from industry, through the Technology Strategy Board's first call for research under the Sustainable Agriculture and Food Innovation Platform (co-funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and DEFRA).</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/6" class="indent">A Taskforce on barriers to increasing fruit and vegetable production and consumption reported in August and agreed an action plan in October 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/7" class="indent">The Groceries Code Adjudicator will be established very soon, which will help to strike a balance between farmers and food producers getting a fair deal, and supermarkets ensuring their customers are getting the high-quality food they want at a price they can afford.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/8" class="indent">Encouraged Local Enterprise Partnerships and local development hubs as vehicles to encourage local food hubs which bring growers, processors and small food businesses together.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/9" class="indent">Continued engagement with consumers (e.g. via Love Food Hate Waste) and work with industry (e.g. via the Courtauld Commitment) to prevent food waste arising wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/10" class="indent">Reviewed all the farming and food advisory groups across DEFRA and reduced down to one group focused on the issues facing farming, food and rural communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/11" class="indent">Funded research to support sustainable food production by developing options to reduce negative impacts on the environment and support biodiversity. Also research to develop the evidence base on sustainable, healthy diets.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/12" class="indent">Produced an Aquaculture Plan for England setting out how the industry will develop itself, including a review of relevant regulations as part of this process.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/13" class="indent">Launched 'Fishing for the Markets' which looks to encourage consumption of under-utilised, sustainable species that are often discarded.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/14" class="indent">Made commitments on uplands including a guarantee that 100% of hill farmers eligible to enter Uplands Entry Level Stewardship-the key environmental management scheme-will be able to do so, which would be worth up to an extra &#163;6 million a year from within the Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE). Also, creation of an &quot;Uplands Theme&quot; in the new delivery arrangements for the socio-economic elements of RDPE to target support to hill farmers, details of which will be announced later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/15" class="italic"> Global Action</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/16" class="indent">Set out actions for Government after publication of the recent Foresight Report 'The Future of Food and Farming: Challenges and Choices for Global Sustainability' including an international workshop on food waste.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/17" class="indent">Provided &#163;2.9 billion towards tackling issues related to land use and food production abroad, with a significant amount of this money to be used for addressing illegal logging, deforestation and ensuring forestry contributes to climate change mitigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/18" class="indent">Commissioned an evidence study to map the UK's palm oil consumption to understand how far the commitments that businesses have already made to sustainable sourcing will take us, and to consider whether further action is needed. Also convened (jointly with the Netherlands Government) a meeting with business leaders to discuss how to mainstream sustainable palm oil.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/19" class="indent">In the ongoing EU negotiations on new food labelling rules, we have successfully extended the current text to include compulsory origin labelling to fresh and frozen meat with the possibility of further extension to other foods.</p>

	<p pid="b.806W.6/1">I consider that the existing law already protects horses and other equidae against long-term tethering. Long-term tethering could constitute an offence under the Animal Welfare Act because it restricts a horse's ability to exercise, to find food and water or to escape from attacks by dogs or extremities of the weather.</p>
	<p pid="b.806W.6/2">In addition to the 2006 Act, DEFRA introduced a Code of Practice for the Welfare of Horses, Ponies, Donkeys and their Hybrids which includes advice on tethering, and it is one of the priority issues for secondary legislation under the 2006 Act. The code does not contain any offences but it could be used in court as evidence to support a case of poor horse welfare. A copy of the code can be downloaded from the DEFRA website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.806W.9/1">The Forestry Commission is leading an ongoing research programme into acute oak decline. Scientists from Forest Research have discovered a number of previously unknown bacteria which they believe are playing a key role. Further work, to obtain a better understanding of the disease, how it spreads, and what other factors might be involved, is continuing.</p>
	<p pid="b.806W.9/2">The Forestry Commission is monitoring the effect of the disease on oak to ascertain the impact that it may have over the next 10 years. Early indications are that on average 25% of trees on susceptible sites show symptoms of acute oak decline. From 2006 to 2010 the number of confirmed incidences rose from eight to 44. Current studies by Forest Research suggest that after one year 1% of the trees showing symptoms had died. Most reports of symptomatic oaks are from the midlands, however reports from south-east England and Wales have also been received.</p>

	<p pid="b.821W.2/1">Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary (HMIC) will publish a report of their findings following the review. Any findings which could include operational detail leading to the identification of an undercover officer or to the compromise of covert operations or tactics will be reported separately in a confidential report.</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.2/2">I understand from HMIC that the HMIC review team do not have any team members that have had direct involvement in the deployment of undercover officers by the National Public Order Intelligence Unit. Some members of the team do have experience in the deployment of undercover officers and covert policing. This knowledge is essential in order to fully examine the operational accountability of undercover work and covert policing.</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.2/3">HMIC has included independent oversight into their review in the form of an external reference group comprising representatives from the judiciary, Parliament, academia, the London Assembly, the Home Office, and Liberty. Full details of the membership of this group have already been announced on the HMIC website.</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.2/4">The full terms of reference for the review are to review how intelligence that supports the policing of protest involving criminal activity is prioritised, gathered, assessed and managed by the National Public Order Intelligence Unit by considering:</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.2/5" class="indent">1. the existing remit of these units and whether they are appropriate for the future;</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.2/6" class="indent">2. the effectiveness of operational oversight and governance arrangements for these units;</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.2/7" class="indent">3. the adequacy and resilience of structures, funding, staffing and resourcing of these units and the future requirements;</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.2/8" class="indent">4. how intelligence activity associated with these units is authorised in accordance with the law including (a) consideration of how the 'proportionality' of covert tactics is determined, in particular the use of undercover officers for collecting intelligence; (b) the process by which covert methods to collect intelligence are tasked and co-ordinated; (c) the process by which covert intelligence is translated into operational activity and, where appropriate, tested through a judicial process; and (d) the training, experience and accreditation of all staff involved in the process;</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.2/9" class="indent">5. how covert intelligence gathering associated with these units is managed, including the use of undercover police officers;</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.2/10" class="indent">6. whether existing legislation, and the guidance provided by ACPO, is sufficient to maintain public confidence in managing intelligence about protest activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.2/11">HMIC will be considering within the terms of reference, how covert intelligence gathering associated with these units is managed, including the use of undercover police officers. This will include undercover officers both in this country and when working abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.821W.2/12">HMIC inspect policing in the public interest and will publish a report with recommendations at the conclusion of the review.</p>

	<p pid="b.825W.2/2">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated April 2011:</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/4" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, Questions asking:</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/5" class="indent">1. How many and what proportion of deaths in care homes were attributable to (a) MRSA, (b) Clostridium difficile infections, (c) malnutrition and (d) dehydration in each of the last 13 years. (49797)</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/6" class="indent">2. How many (a) cases of and (b) deaths where the death certificate refers to healthcare acquired infections there were in care homes for each type of (i) infection and (ii) care home in each of the last 13 years. (49828)</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/7" class="indent">Tables 1 to 4 provide the number and percentage of deaths in care homes where (a) Meticillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) (Table 1), (b) &quot;Clostridium difficile&quot; (C. difficile) (Table 2), (c) Malnutrition or effects of hunger (Table 3), and (d) Dehydration (volume depletion or lack of water) or effects of thirst (Table 4) were (i) the underlying cause of death and (ii) mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, either as the underlying cause or as a contributory factor, in England and Wales, for 1997 to 2009 (the latest year available).</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/8" class="indent">There is no official definition of a Healthcare Associated Infection (HCAI). Tables 5 and 6 provide the number of deaths where (a) Meticillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) (Table 5) and (b) &quot;Clostridium difficile&quot; (C. difficile) (Table 6), two specific types of HCAIs, were (i) the underlying cause of death and (ii) mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, either as the underlying cause or as a contributory factor, for local authority care homes and non-local authority care homes in England and Wales, for 1997 to 2009 (the latest year available).</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/9" class="indent">Copies of the tables will be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/10" class="indent">Death certificates record the place where a person died, but not where any infections may have been acquired. It is not possible from the information on a death certificate to know whether an infection was acquired in the care home where a person died. People are often transferred between hospitals, care homes and other establishments, and may acquire infections in a different place from where they died.</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/11" class="indent">The number of cases of healthcare associated infections in care homes is not available. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) publish regular reports about anti-microbial surveillance, HCAIs and their consequences for human health in the UK. These are available on the HPA website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/12" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/Publications/InfectiousDiseases/AntimicrobialAndHealthcareAssociatedInfections/">www.hpa.org.uk/Publications/InfectiousDiseases/AntimicrobialAndHealthcareAssociatedInfections/</a></p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/13" class="indent">Those who die with the conditions specified above are usually already very ill, and it is often their existing illness which is designated as the underlying cause of death. For example, someone with malnutrition or effects of hunger mentioned on their death certificate may have cancer of the digestive tract, which means they cannot eat properly or cannot absorb nutrients; they may have suffered from a stroke or have advanced dementia which can cause difficulties chewing and swallowing; or they may abuse alcohol and so not eat properly. Therefore two sets of figures have been provided: the first showing deaths where one of these conditions was the underlying cause of death, and the second where the condition was either the underlying cause or a contributory factor.</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.2/14" class="indent">The number of deaths registered in England and Wales each year by sex, age, cause and place of death are published annually on the National Statistics website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.829W.2/1">The Government's policy is that national health service services should be commissioned from the best providers able to meet patients' needs and deliver value for taxpayers' money. Guidance on the procurement of health services in the NHS has been published since May 2008. This guidance has consistently made clear that procurement processes, including any evaluation of bids for contracts, must be transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory with equality of treatment for all providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.829W.2/2">We have also consulted on plans to extend patient choice so that patients have greater choice and control over their treatment and care, including choice of provider wherever possible. A key principle of our proposed approach is that 'any qualified provider' should be able to offer services where the provider meets quality standards and accepts the NHS standard contract tariff. Prices would be fixed in advance with money following patients' choices and competition on quality. We will publish our response to the consultation shortly.</p>

A clear set of underpinning rules and guidance will be developed to apply to general practitioner (GP) consortia, so that they have the necessary support to make decisions that are fair and transparent and avoid any perceived conflicts of interest. In addition, the Bill also includes a requirement that each consortium's constitution sets out arrangements for decision-making and managing potential conflicts of interest. The economic regulator will also have powers to intervene if there are concerns that a consortium has not met its duties in relation to fairness and choice or has engaged in anti-competitive behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="b.832W.2/2">The Government will create a health research regulatory agency to combine and streamline the approvals for health research which are at present scattered across many organisations.

The agency will be established in the first instance as a special health authority, with the National Research Ethics Service as its core, during 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.832W.2/3">The new agency will work closely with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to create a unified approval process and promote proportionate standards for compliance and inspection within a consistent national system of research governance.</p>
	<p pid="b.832W.2/4">From autumn 2011, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funding will become conditional on organisations playing their part in the national research governance system. The Government will launch a framework of standard procedures and good practice for local health research management-the NIHR Research Support Services framework-by May 2011. Recipients of NIHR funding will regularly publish metrics on their performance in initiating and delivering health research. When deciding on funding, the NIHR will take account of performance against public NIHR benchmarks, including an initial benchmark of 70 days from receipt of a valid research protocol to recruitment of the first participant in a study.</p>

	<p pid="b.836W.2/1">The purpose of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Office for Clinical Research Infrastructure (NOCRI) is to maximise the contribution of the NIHR-funded clinical research infrastructure: for health research and patient benefit; and for the nation's international competitiveness as a location for applied clinical research.</p>
	<p pid="b.836W.2/2">NOCRI is discharging this function by facilitating cross-NIHR funded facility co-operation on scientific, technical and process challenges, supporting spread of bureaucracy-busting measures led by other areas of NIHR and leading on the development of model agreements, e.g. the recently published NIHR/Medical Research Council model Industrial Collaborative Research Agreement to streamline contracting for research partnerships between industry, universities and the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.836W.2/3">NOCRI is supporting research funders big and small in the life sciences industry and charities by helping them to navigate the research environment to find suitable individuals or organisations to support their research needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.836W.2/4">NOCRI was established in December 2009 and its Managing Director took up post in May 2010. It would therefore be premature to assess its full impact.</p>

	<p pid="b.846W.8/2">A two stage or interim tenancy discharge would require an initial assured shorthold tenancy of six to twelve months while the homelessness duty is still owed, before the duty could be ended with a further twelve month tenancy. This would offer no greater protection than the measures in the Localism Bill, would be unnecessarily complex and could, for some, mean a longer wait in expensive temporary accommodation. It would also effectively require private landlords to offer a minimum eighteen month tenancy and responses to the &quot;local decisions: a fairer future for social housing&quot; consultation indicated that this would not be practical.</p>
	<p pid="b.846W.8/3">Existing safeguards in the homelessness legislation already mean that the local authority must, by law, consider whether the accommodation is affordable in determining whether it is suitable for the applicant and their household's particular needs. This is in addition to considering its size, its condition, its accessibility and also its location.</p>

	<p pid="b.849W.0/1">On average a semi-detached home built to 2010 Building Regulation standards will emit 2.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum from all energy use in the home. Of this, 1.3 tonnes will be from emissions subject to the Building Regulations (i.e. emissions from heating, hot water, lighting and any other fixed building services but not emissions from the use of appliances). The new definition of zero carbon homes requires house builders to mitigate these emissions to ensure that, in net terms, they are reduced to zero. This is the equivalent to the energy standard in Level 5 of the Code for Sustainable Homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.849W.0/2">On top of this, to meet the energy standard in Level 6 of the Code for Sustainable Homes, emissions from appliances, such as televisions and hairdryers, have to be reduced, in net terms, to zero. However, emissions from appliances are also subject to a suite of other policies including the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and policies to increase the energy efficiency of appliances and the operation of these policies, cumulatively and in combination with the new definition, should have the result that the carbon footprint of new homes does not add to overall carbon reduction burdens.</p>
	<p pid="b.849W.0/3">The Code for Sustainable Homes continues to be supported by the Government and goes far wider than just an energy based definition of sustainability. House builders can, if they wish, still seek to achieve the Code level 6 energy standard through their own measures.</p>

	<p pid="b.850W.5/2">Our package of fiscal incentives includes the New Homes Bonus which will give communities a significant incentive to build the homes they need by matching the council tax for the following six years. Additionally, we are investing nearly &#163;4.5 billion over the next four years to deliver up to 150.000 new affordable homes. Key to this is the introduction of an 'Affordable Rent' product which will give Housing Associations greater financial capacity to develop new affordable homes.</p>

	<p pid="b.856W.3/1">Charities are generally entitled to 80% mandatory business rate relief. Local authorities must grant that relief where the relevant eligibility criteria have been met.</p>
	<p pid="b.856W.3/2">In addition, councils have a power to offer discretionary rate relief. They can offer up to 100% rate relief to non-profit making organisations. Central Government funds 75% of the cost of discretionary rate relief.</p>
	<p pid="b.856W.3/3">While the granting of discretionary rate relief is ultimately a decision for the local authority, I believe it has an important role to play in supporting the local voluntary sector, recognising the public benefit that voluntary groups give to their local community. We would expect local authorities to take full account of the central Government funding support for discretionary rate relief in making their decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.856W.3/4">Certain voluntary organisations may also be eligible for small business rates relief which we have doubled until <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-30">30 September 2012</phrase>. Eligible organisations with rateable values below &#163;6,000 will pay no rates for that period.</p>
	<p pid="b.856W.3/5">Moreover, I have recently corresponded with the London borough of Camden on the issue of discretionary rate relief to the innovative People's Supermarket, as outlined in my Department's press notice of <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-03">3 March 2011</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.860W.6/2">The Government believe that European legislation should be based upon a strong evidence base, including, when appropriate, scientific evidence. In this context we support President Barroso's intention to appoint a Chief Scientific Advisor. We also welcome a strengthening of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre in providing robust scientific and technical advice to support development and implementation of EU legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.860W.6/3">It should also be noted that evidence presented in support of EU legislation will be examined by the UK and, where necessary, challenged well before any legislation reaches the European Council. For proposals which do go to Council it may be that scientific arguments will previously have been discussed at working groups of member states including the UK. The lead Department in the UK will have assessed the evidence presented by the Commission and may have presented its own evidence to the Commission. Scientific evidence is therefore thoroughly examined but final decisions do take into account broader issues and a range of evidence, not always principally scientific, may be offered in support.</p>

It is vital that this date does not slip, as any political vacuum or loss of momentum would threaten the continuity of the reconstruction efforts so essential to Haiti's rehabilitation. The Organisation of America States Caribbean Community Election Observation Mission will give its considered opinion of the conduct of the Second Round in the coming weeks. We, along with others in the International Community and in Haiti, will draw important conclusions from that assessment about the state of Haitian democracy. It is vital that the next President works in the interests of all the Haitian people to continue the important task of reconstruction.</p>

	<p pid="b.862W.2/1">No UK aid flights have landed in Libya since the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1973; however the UK is providing assistance and protection to the people of Benghazi through our funding of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The UK is providing &#163;2 million to ICRC, enabling it to provide medical teams to treat and provide medical supplies to 3,000 people in Libya affected by the ongoing fighting. The ICRC will also provide food and supplies to 100,000 of those most in need.</p>
	<p pid="b.862W.2/2">Lack of access by humanitarian agencies makes it difficult to give a comprehensive view of humanitarian needs in Libya. However, to date humanitarian agencies have reported no widespread, urgent humanitarian needs in Benghazi. In eastern Libya more generally, people have access to food, water and electricity, although there remain pockets of specific needs. Disruption to regular supply chains also risks causing shortages of basic items. Medical supplies are reaching eastern Libya and hospitals are functioning but stretched, with some staff shortages. Throughout Libya we have serious concerns for the protection of civilians.</p>
	<p pid="b.862W.2/3">Over 12,000 people have been repatriated from the borders with Libya on UK-funded flights. Blankets and tents also delivered by the UK provide shelter for up to 10,000 people. UK funded air operations specialists are helping co-ordinate repatriations as part of our efforts to prevent logistics difficulties in Tunisia and Egypt becoming a humanitarian crisis.</p>

	<p pid="b.865W.2/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has a strong tradition of voluntary work, ranging from individuals getting involved with their local communities to whole Departments undertaking voluntary activities in the UK and throughout our overseas network.</p>
	<p pid="b.865W.2/2">The FCO actively supports public and private voluntary service by its staff through allowing both paid and unpaid special leave to undertake voluntary activities. The amount of time given varies according to the nature of the activity, but all employees are offered up to five days paid special leave a year to volunteer. Examples of some of the voluntary activity undertaken by individual members of staff granted special paid leave are:</p>
	<p pid="b.865W.2/3" class="indent">Independent Custody Visitor, reporting findings of unannounced visits to detention centres</p>
	<p pid="b.865W.2/4" class="indent">Youth Educator, Envision Project</p>

	<p pid="b.865W.2/7" class="indent">Event promotion for Croydon Community Against Trafficking</p>
	<p pid="b.865W.2/8">In addition, in 2010 FCO staff in London and at 55 posts overseas ran a mile as part of Sport Relief and raised over &#163;43,000 for 60 charities in the UK and overseas.</p>
	<p pid="b.865W.2/9">The Big Society approach is also reflected in the activities of our posts around the world in empowering local communities. Many of our staff overseas have given up their time to help local community projects, and have assisted charitable organisations through donations and fund-raising activities. The 'Speed Sisters' project in Palestine is an example of a project where, by providing financial and practical support to a Palestinian women's racing team that had been struggling to compete, our consulate staff were able to challenge widely held views of women in the middle east.</p>

	<p pid="b.866W.9/2">Most light aircraft are required to meet international standards on aircraft noise and will be fitted with some form of silencer to provide basic reduction in noise from the engine's exhaust system. In addition, enhanced silencers have been developed for many light aircraft types.</p>
	<p pid="b.866W.9/3">The responsibility for the certification of small aircraft is dependent upon the type of aircraft. For those that fall under the provisions of Regulation (EU) 216/2008, the Basic Regulation, the responsibility rests with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). However, for small aircraft EASA will largely validate the certification carried out by the State of Design, e.g. the USA. The configuration of the aircraft to meet noise requirements is generally achieved as part of the aircraft design process.</p>
	<p pid="b.866W.9/4">For aircraft that do not fall within EASA's remit the UK CAA is responsible for those aircraft that are registered in the UK. At present, homebuilt aircraft are not required to conform to the noise requirements.</p>

These rights are set out in part 17 of schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development Order 1995 (the GPDO). The GPDO is administered by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG).

Instead the Department for Transport (DfT) use data from the independent Office for National Statistics (ONS). This shows that between 2000 and 2010 the real cost of motoring, including the purchase of a vehicle, declined by 8%, bus and coach fares increased by 20% and rail fares increased by 15% in real terms.</p>

	<p pid="b.882W.5/1">Greater transparency is at the heart of our commitment to enable the public to hold political and public bodies to account and deliver better value for money in public spending. DECC aims to ensure that its data are as accessible to the public as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.882W.5/2">The Department publishes information through a wide range of avenues including the DECC website and data.gov.uk. Data on energy production including renewables are published monthly on the DECC website, while each quarter fuller analysis of energy production and use is published in 'Energy Trends'. Annually full information is published in the 'Digest of UK Energy Statistics' as well as a more detailed look at energy use in 'Energy Consumption in the UK'. Other important data sets included data on GHG emissions, detailed local level electricity and gas consumption data and work with the Energy Saving Trust to publish data on installation of insulation measures at local authority and parliamentary constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="b.882W.5/3">A number of recent publications also provide the public with relevant information:</p>
	<p pid="b.882W.5/4" class="indent">The DECC Business Plan sets out actions against coalition priorities to 2015 and a number of impact and input indicators which can be used to assess progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.882W.5/5" class="indent">The DECC website and the Energy Savings Trust provide consumers with extensive information on how they can generate low-carbon energy (through the domestic feed-in tariffs) and energy saving measures more generally.</p>
	<p pid="b.882W.5/6" class="indent">DECC's Annual Energy Statement, consultation for electricity market reform (EMR) and 2050 Pathways Analysis all describe the major energy challenges over the next decade and beyond. The EMR consultation also includes projections for future demand and supply and how the balance could be maintained.</p>
	<p pid="b.882W.5/7" class="indent">Affordability is a key concern for DECC. We support the independent regulation of electricity markets through Ofgem-their primary duty is to protect the interests of present and future consumers. The proposals set out in the EMR consultation document were assessed to gauge their likely impact on consumers and that has been published alongside the policy proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.886W.0/1">Following the nuclear incident at Fukushima in Japan, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change asked Dr Mike Weightman, HM Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations, to report on the lessons to be learnt for the UK from the incident, with an interim report requested from Dr Weightman in May 2011 and a final report in September 2011. Dr Weightman has complete independence to determine the scope of his reports and the arrangements for conducting his inquiries for them. However, the Secretary of State's responsibilities only relate to civil nuclear facilities. I understand that Dr Weightman's focus for his interim report will be on any early lessons for existing and prospective UK nuclear power stations. His final report may have lessons that are relevant for nuclear safety at defence related sites.</p>

ORED does this through a framework of financial incentives that provide long-term, comprehensive and targeted support across the range of renewable technologies; and by taking steps to address non-financial barriers that hinder renewables deployment.</p>
	<p pid="b.886W.3/5">ORED works with others to meet its objectives, both in DECC and across Whitehall-particularly DECC's teams that deal with heat and microgeneration technologies and the Green Deal; with the Department for Transport on renewable transport technologies; and DECC's Science and Innovation Group on renewable technologies which are still at relatively early stages of development and demonstration but which are expected to be important contributors for the pathway to 2050.</p>

	<p pid="b.890W.5/1">The reduction of child care support to 70% from 80% is part of a range of reforms to the tax credits system announced at the spending review. However, to ensure support is better targeted at low-income families with children, some of the savings from measures announced at the spending review have been recycled into significant above indexation increases to the child tax credit in 2011-12 and 2012-13. Treasury analysis shows that modelled tax and benefit reforms announced since Budget 2010 have a small reduction in child poverty in 2011-12 and 2012-13; however given the uncertainty around these types of estimates, this change may not be statistically significant.</p>
	<p pid="b.890W.5/2">There are interactions between the measures so estimating the impact of just one measure does not give a clear indication of the full impact on households.</p>

	<p pid="b.896W.2/1">HM Treasury and its associated public bodies have a number of staff involved in working across government and with other partners on Solvency II as part of their wider roles.</p>
	<p pid="b.896W.2/2">The Treasury is working closely with the FSA and with UK industry on assessing the scale of, and implications for, the annuities market. The Association of British Insurers estimate, that in 2009 (the last date available) the total premium written for annuity was &#163;10.8 billion, and that the total amount of annuity liability is around &#163;130 billion. Finance Ministries across Europe take a similar approach with respect to the products offered by their industries. Government do not engage in the public benchmarking of the UK annuity market against other European markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.896W.2/3">The Chancellor and other Treasury Ministers have regular discussions with European counterparts on a range of issues, including the new approach to capital for insurers under Solvency II, and the treatment of long-term products such as annuities.</p>
	<p pid="b.896W.2/4">The potential effect on consumer prices of implementation of the Solvency II capital requirements cannot be sensibly estimated yet as the rules are still not finalised. The Government continue to work closely with the Financial Services Authority and with industry to ensure a full understanding of the potential effect on consumer prices.</p>
	<p pid="b.896W.2/5">The Solvency II directive has already been adopted by the Council of Ministers. The directive is being amended through Omnibus II, to bring it into line with the decision-making process agreed in the Lisbon treaty. Omnibus II will be subject to agreement via the qualified majority decision process, as well as agreement with the European Parliament. When Omnibus II comes into force, the Delegated Acts-which will set out the technical details and rules of Solvency II-will then be subject to the qualified majority decision process in the Council of Ministers.</p>

I have asked the Skills Funding Agency to propose how the additional funding can best be allocated to colleges and training providers to support delivery of these additional apprenticeships. Take-up by region follows employer demand. For this reason, we are not able to provide estimates of the geographical distribution of apprenticeship places or funding as these would be either too broad to be of use or would be potentially misleading.</p>

	<p pid="b.899W.5/2">From the 2011/12 academic year (AY) colleges and training organisations will have a single adult skills budget, with earmarked delivery for adult apprenticeships so that they can use the increased freedoms and flexibilities that we have given them to respond to and be accountable to the needs of learner, employers and communities. This means that while we do not plan apprenticeship places or set targets, we have provided illustrative learner forecasts to show the capacity for adult training that Government investment can support.</p>
	<p pid="b.899W.5/3">Using the funds committed in the spending review alone, as set out with illustrative forecasts in &quot;Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth&quot;, we anticipate that Government funding will support 437,068 adult apprenticeships in the 2011/12 AY. For those aged 16 to 18 years old, we estimate we will fund 230,000 in the 2011/12 AY. We will publish a revised forecast for academic year 2011/12 and a forecast for 2012/13 later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.902W.2/1">My officials in the Insolvency Service have analysed the likely effect of an increase to the bankruptcy level and undertook some targeted consultation with interested parties last year. About 80% of bankruptcies are as a result of the bankrupt's own petition where no limit applies. If the limit was increased to &#163;1,750 (which would have been approximately in line with inflationary increases since the limit was last set), there would be expected to be about 3% fewer bankruptcy orders made on a creditor's petition. Views were invited on the whole personal insolvency regime in our consultation &quot;Managing Borrowing and Dealing with Debt&quot;. Officials are carefully analysing the responses and will be reporting to me in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.905W.8/1">We welcome the noble Member Lord Davies' review into women on boards and encourage companies to implement his business-led strategy. A growing body of evidence now exists to show that well balanced boards are better boards, benefiting from fresh perspectives, talent, new ideas and broader experience which lead to better decision making. In addition, diverse organisations reflect their customers better, understand them better and offer better products and services as a result.</p>
	<p pid="b.905W.8/2">We remain committed to seeing more women reaching the boardrooms of UK plc and are working with stakeholders, including leading business representative organisations, and academia to monitor progress.</p>

It is for individual colleges and training organisations, working directly with their local partners, to determine the offer that best meets the needs of their communities.

	<p pid="b.917W.3/1">There are no plans for a specific review of the role of Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) in further education. The role of SSCs is changing and will increasingly focus on raising employer ambition and investment in skills. The UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UK CES) works with the SSCs to produce and utilise high quality sectoral labour market intelligence to reduce skill gaps, and to raise skill levels. This information helps to ensure that the further education sector provides accurate advice and guidance, as well as delivering qualifications relevant to the changing skill needs of the work force. In addition, SSCs have a central role in developing apprenticeship frameworks, and in enhancing the quality and accessibility of apprenticeships. The majority of SSCs also work closely with national skills academies to promote excellence in vocational training.</p>

	<p pid="b.919W.0/1">The equality impact assessment published alongside 'Skills for Sustainable Growth' (November 2010) found that, at the aggregate level, there are unlikely to be disproportionate impacts on protected groups. A separate assessment of how the changes to skills funding may affect English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) learners is currently being carried out by the Department, and I expect to be able to publish the assessment in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.919W.0/2">The Department's equality impact assessment is drawing on published analytical information and on views offered to us in person or in writing by a wide range of organisations with an interest in this area, including correspondence from learners and their representatives and principals of further education colleges.</p>

It has developed a range of corporate training programmes to underpin new business methods, such as relationship building with the most significant inward investors and exporters. UKTI's aim is to develop innovative approaches to working with the private sector in order to raise the quality of its services, build successful relationships with trade and investment clients and to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction.</p>
	<p pid="b.920W.2/2">UKTI is a service delivery organisation and the use of private sector expertise is integral to the development and the delivery of these services. In addition, more than 200 senior business people help to shape and support UKTI's strategy and service delivery. 1,100, or 85% of people working in UKTI's trade teams overseas are locally engaged, and most of these have business experience. Trade and investment delivery services in England, apart from London, are outsourced to private sector organisations.</p>
