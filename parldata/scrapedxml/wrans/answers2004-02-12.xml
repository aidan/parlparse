	<p pid=".1555W.2/1">Customs will normally prosecute in those cases where a deliberate or organised attempt has been made to evade or breach for commercial gain the controls on ivory. Customs would look carefully at the circumstances of any case where seized ivory is either antique or harvested legitimately prior to the ban imposed on commercial trade in ivory from African elephants in 1990. Such ivory can be lawfully traded provided that it is accompanied by the appropriate documentation issued by the competent authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".1555W.2/2">Many seizures of ivory involve a small quantity found in the possession of members of the travelling public who are shown after inquiries to have breached the controls unwittingly&mdash;for example by importing items which were on open sale and were bought in good faith, or by exporting items that have been held in the UK legitimately for some time.</p>
	<p pid=".1555W.2/3">Two detections in 2001 involved commercial quantities of ivory which had been deliberately concealed. Both cases involved ivory in transit through the UK to another country of destination. Customs agreed with the law enforcement authorities in the countries of destination to allow these consignments to go forward for further investigation there. Customs have no information on the outcome of those investigations.</p>

	<p pid=".1556W.0/1">The Large Business Office (LBO) IT system was developed by a partnership of EDS and the LBO between October 1996 and November 1997 with a commercial software package, 'Composer'. The system cost &pound;1.92 million including equipment and software licenses. The number of staff days of development is not now known. The system enabled the LBO to support and monitor their casework; it was formally accepted in 1998 by senior management of the LBO.</p>
	<p pid=".1556W.0/2">There was a credibility check of the data provided early in the use of the system, and in 2000, LBO senior management asked questions about data on some individual cases. The Director asked the Inland Revenue's internal auditors to review the accuracy of data for 2001&ndash;02. Their interim report enabled some adjustment to be made to the reported figures for that year and errors in reporting future years' tax effects were eliminated for 2001&ndash;02 onwards. A follow up review of processes commissioned in 2003 revealed that some LBO caseworkers were not reporting yield in line with departmental guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".1556W.0/3">The relevant Commissioner was kept fully informed throughout. The Board received a report on the issues raised by the 2003 review. Ministers were informed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-12">12 November 2003</phrase> of the need to correct yield figures. The NAO have discussed LBO yield as part of their current work on corporation tax. There is no information available for 1998&ndash;99.</p>

	<p pid=".1558W.3/1">We have received no guidance from the European Commission regarding the definition of &quot;covered space&quot;. However, the Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 requires Intermediate Plants to have a &quot;covered space &quot; to receive animal by-products. It also requires the plant to be constructed in such a way that it is easy to clean and disinfect, and that floors must be laid down in such a way as to facilitate the draining of liquids. The plant must also have appropriate arrangements for protection against pests, such as insects, rodents and birds. In our view, the combination of these requirements make it necessary for the plant to have a roof, walls and a floor before we can approve it. The application form for approval of an Intermediate Plant provides guidance on the requirements of the Regulation, and states that</p>
	<p pid=".1558W.3/2" class="indent">&quot;the covered space must be securely enclosed, i.e. in a permanent, weather-proof, vermin-proof structure&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".1559W.5/1">Like most terrestrial mammals, domestic cats are susceptible to infection by <i>Mycobacterium bovi</i>s (<i>M. bovis</i>). Cases have been recorded in Great Britain and other countries but current incidence is very sporadic. TB in cats is not notifiable although it is good practice to contact the State Veterinary Service (SVS) if it is suspected.

	<p pid=".1559W.5/2">The infection can be transferred to man, therefore, if a confirmed case of <i>M. bovis</i> infection in a cat comes to the attention of the SVS, the Divisional Veterinary Manager will inform the Consultant in Communicable Disease Control (CCDC) of the local health authority. Investigation of the TB status of any human contacts is the responsibility of the CCDC. If TB is reported in a farm cat the SVS will instigate tuberculin check tests of cattle on that farm, and of potential contacts on neighbouring premises.</p>

	<p pid=".1560W.5/1">In a 1995 <sup>1</sup> report reviewing the status of mammals in the United Kingdom, commissioned by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, the badger population estimate provided by the 1980s National Badger Survey was given the highest possible rating for accuracy (one on a scale of one to five, where one is the most accurate). As the 1990s National Badger Survey <sup>2</sup> followed the same methodology as the earlier exercise, its results can be afforded a similar high level of confidence.</p>
	<p pid=".1560W.5/2">I can confirm that the Department has not estimated any of the following population parameters for badgers in the United Kingdom:</p>
	<p pid=".1560W.5/3" class="indent">The minimum population size necessary to ensure its continued survival.</p>
	<p pid=".1560W.5/4" class="indent">The optimum size of the population.</p>
	<p pid=".1560W.5/5" class="indent">The maximum size of population that can be sustained.</p>
	<p pid=".1560W.5/6">In the report of the 1990s National Badger Survey <sup>2</sup> , the authors concluded that there was &quot;substantial scope for further badger population expansions&quot; as badger setts were still scarce or absent in many suitable areas (especially in East Anglia and parts of Scotland). However, the authors also said that &quot;in areas with established badger populations, it was unlikely that further significant increases would occur&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1560W.5/7">Since there has been no national badger survey since the mid-1990s, we do not know whether the population level has changed in the interim.</p>
	<p pid=".1560W.5/8">As I explained in my reply to the hon. Member's earlier question, <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-26">26 January 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2004-01-26.1"><i>Official Report</i>, column 1W</phrase>, my Department has been funding the Winter Mammal Monitoring Project <sup>3</sup> which is being carried out by the Mammal Society and the British Trust for Ornithology. This is a pilot study intended to develop a terrestrial monitoring system for British mammals, including badgers. Early findings confirm the pattern of distribution reported in the National Badger Survey, but it is too early to say whether, and by how much, badger numbers have changed since the 1990s.</p>

	<p pid=".1562W.3/1">The badger benefits from legal protection introduced to outlaw cruelty towards animals. For example, the Protection of Animals Act 1911, which among other things, made the baiting of animals illegal, and the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996, which made certain specified acts of cruelty illegal.</p>
	<p pid=".1562W.3/2">In addition, there are legal restrictions on the range of methods that can be used to kill or take badgers. This protection was introduced to outlaw inhumane and/or indiscriminate methods of control. The key legislation in this respect is the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Some of these restrictions apply to all animals, while others apply only to animals, like the badger, listed on schedule 6 of the Act.</p>
	<p pid=".1562W.3/3">There have also been specific laws to protect badgers. These were introduced as a welfare measure to combat illegal badger baiting, and also as a conservation measure in response to declines in badger numbers in the 1970s and 1980s. The various statutes specifically relating to badgers were consolidated under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992.</p>

	<p pid=".1568W.3/2">Table 1 sets out the difference that the proposed methodology would have on previously published figures on the basis of information currently held. However, this is unlikely to provide a full picture of the impact of the change as data for previous years is insufficient to be able to distinguish between staff who have declared they do not have a disability and those who have not made any declaration. This information would be collected in future if the proposed change in methodology goes ahead.</p>

	<p pid=".1570W.7/1">I have written to Jonathan Evans MEP to apologise for an error in my letter of <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-17">17 December 2003</phrase>. No Treaty was agreed at the Inter-Governmental Conference. The Prime Minister did, however, make it clear that good progress had been made in relation to energy matters during negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".1570W.7/2">An Energy Chapter will bring European competence on energy together in a single legal base. We support the proposal on the basis that it is more transparent than existing legislation. We have, however, consistently set out our concern that any uncertainty about the impact of the Energy Chapter could undermine investment in North sea oil and gas. With that in mind, we proposed a series of amendments to this part of the Treaty with the aim of ensuring that European member states would retain the right to control the exploitation of their natural resources. Maintaining unanimity in relation to tax proposals remains part of the Government's &quot;red line&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1570W.7/3">We are confident that all our efforts, including work with other member states, will provide a sound basis for future negotiations.</p>

In addition, if a sport offers an NVQ the LSC will fund the employer and the training provider directly rather than the individual. The value of any LSC grant depends on the length of the course. Typically a coaching qualification in the above sports taking between 60&ndash;90 hours to achieve can attract funding of approximately &pound;400 per candidate, irrespective of employment status.</p>

	<p pid=".1573W.3/1">The only public money spent on the Pickett's Lock stadium was for a feasibility study conducted in 2000&ndash;01. Sport England have estimated that the study cost &pound;1.5 million.</p>

	<p pid=".1575W.6/1">DFID have worked closely with the Fairtrade Foundation since 1997. In the last four years:</p>
	<p pid=".1575W.6/2" class="indent">Through the Development Awareness Fund, we have provided &pound;120,000 to the media campaigns of the Fairtrade Foundation. These are designed specifically to raise both supermarket and consumer awareness of products carrying the Fairtrade Mark.</p>
	<p pid=".1575W.6/3" class="indent">In 2002, the Foundation began to expand the Fairtrade product range. DFID provided &pound;300,000 to the foundation on a project to extend the reach of Fairtrade labelling to new producers in developing countries. This will lead to an increase in the range of products in the shops for consumers. Nuts, rice and wine are examples of types of products likely to be in the first wave.</p>
	<p pid=".1575W.6/4" class="indent">In 2002 we gave a grant to support the Fairtrade town/city brand over three years.</p>
	<p pid=".1575W.6/5" class="indent">A number of the regional Enabling Effective Support strategies for work in schools also include a focus on Fairtrade Fortnight.</p>

	<p pid=".1576W.0/1">DFID is closely following events. Early season rainfall was well below normal in much of central and southern Mozambique, raising concerns of a third consecutive drought year. Recent rains may still spark crop recovery in the centre of the country, but many areas of southern Mozambique are likely to experience crop failure. Steep price rises in maize, the main staple food, are also probable in southern areas due to crop failure in South Africa and other neighbouring countries. A national assessment of vulnerability and hunger will be made in March after the first harvests have started, and a full needs assessment will be published by April. This will provide sufficient time for DFID and others to look carefully at the assessment and respond as required.</p>

	<p pid=".1577W.2/1">The DFID Wildlife and Poverty Study estimated that 150 million very poor people are significantly dependent on wildlife for their food and livelihoods, and that bushmeat is one important part of this. The study drew out implications for donors, governments, the private sector and civil society, but did not make any explicit recommendations to DFID. We have however disseminated the findings of the study widely.</p>

I am, however, aware of the work that Dr. Brown has been doing for the CITES Bushmeat Working Group, with support from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), with whom DFID works closely on bushmeat and livelihoods issues. DFID supports the view that any actions to address bushmeat should take the livelihoods of poor people fully into account, and that blanket bans on bushmeat harvesting would not be effective and would hit the poor the hardest.</p>
	<p pid=".1577W.2/4">At the ministerial segment of the Africa Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (AFLEG) Conference, held in Cameroon in October 2003, I discussed bushmeat and forest management issues with Ministers from Ghana, Cameroon and other countries.

	<p pid=".1579W.2/1">Uganda has a well-developed and consultative process for deciding the Government's annual budget. Donors are involved throughout, and have an opportunity to endorse the budget at the annual public expenditure review. This level of consultation allows partners, including the UK, to ensure Government meets its commitment to prioritise poverty reduction. Allocations to the Government's &quot;Poverty Action Fund&quot; (PAF), for example, have risen from less than 20 per cent. to over 37 per cent. of the Government's budget in the past six years. These allocations have been fully protected during budget execution. Our budget support, and that of other donors, is conditional on our endorsement of the budget and its subsequent execution.</p>
	<p pid=".1579W.2/2">The level of defence spending is a major element of this consultation. The UK has supported a defence review, which is about to conclude. The review's purpose is to develop a long-term strategy for the Army, setting out how roles and capabilities should be adapted to meet the security challenges Uganda faces. It will provide the basis for making well-informed and affordable decisions on the defence budget in the future. We are impressing upon Government the need for consultation around the review's recommendations before future levels of defence expenditure are set. Our aim is to ensure its affordability, and guarantee expenditure for core poverty reduction programmes is not displaced. We will monitor this issue very closely, especially in the context of our budget support.</p>

	<p pid=".1579W.5/1">The UK remains deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation caused by the conflict in northern Uganda, now in its 18th year. Insecurity prevents normal development activities, resulting in 63 per cent. of households in the north living below the poverty line compared with 38 per cent. nationally. Our immediate concern is the plight of the large number of displaced people across the region. This group of over 1.3 million faces declining levels of food security due to disruption of the planting and harvesting seasons. They also face serious problems of lack of shelter and physical insecurity. A number of local and international organisations are working to address the emerging needs.</p>
	<p pid=".1579W.5/2">We have provided &pound;7.3 million of humanitarian assistance over the last 12 months. This has been channelled through the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the Uganda Red Cross Society. We are currently allocating a further &pound;1.1 million. Linked to this we are financing UNICEF personnel working on the protection of women and children. We have also provided Save the Children Fund with a grant to improve conditions for the increasing number of unaccompanied children who are sleeping in town centres at night to avoid abduction by the LRA. We are working hard, in partnership with others, to ensure humanitarian assistance reaches all those in need despite some access difficulties across the region.</p>
	<p pid=".1579W.5/3">The Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary and I raised the conflict and its humanitarian impact in our discussions with President Museveni during his recent UK visit. We, along with our partners in Uganda and the international community, will continue to encourage the Government of Uganda to bring about a sustainable resolution to the conflict.</p>

	<p pid=".1583W.5/14">Changes to the test mark schemes were introduced in 2003. The consequent unfamiliarity with the mark scheme resulted in an increase in the number of reviews requested by schools. Due to the increase in level changes following review and the concerns raised by schools, the Department asked QCA to examine the quality control measures in place for both marking and reviews.</p>
	<p pid=".1583W.5/15">Improvements planned for this year include:</p>
	<p pid=".1583W.5/16" class="indent">The separate marking of reading and writing Key Stage 3 English scripts.</p>
	<p pid=".1583W.5/17" class="indent">Markers will be asked to focus on one mark scheme and specialise in one component of the tests, either reading or writing.</p>
	<p pid=".1583W.5/18" class="indent">The electronic calculation of marks and levels, which should eliminate the need to request reviews due to clerical error.</p>
	<p pid=".1583W.5/19" class="indent">Increased marker supervision, revised marker training and additional training for new markers.</p>
	<p pid=".1583W.5/20">The Government believes that any occurrence of unacceptable marking is a cause for concern and QCA will continue to work together with the EMA to improve the quality and reliability of marking. I believe it is absolutely vital to ensure reliable test results in which pupils, teachers and parents can be confident.</p>

	<p pid=".1588W.8/1">&quot;Pathways to Work&mdash;Helping People into Employment&quot; Cm 5690 set out a strategy for enabling people on incapacity benefits to move into work. The first tranche of three pilot areas (Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taff, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, Argyll and Bute, and Derbyshire) went live from October 2003. The second tranche of areas (Gateshead and South Tyneside, Somerset, Essex, and East Lancashire) are on track to go live in April.</p>
	<p pid=".1588W.8/2">Spending Review 2002 announced just under &pound;100 million in additional funds for these pilots (&pound;15 million for 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;41 million for each of 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06). &pound;3.9 million was spent in the period April 2003 to December 2003; we estimate expenditure will be &pound;7.45 million for January 2004 to March 2004, and &pound;42.6 million for April 2004 to March 2005. These estimates include running costs, learning and development costs for personal advisers and other staff, the return to work credit, the NHS condition management programmes, and marketing and publicity costs.</p>

	<p pid=".1589W.5/1">The fifth annual 'Opportunity for all' (Cm 5956) report sets out the latest assessment of progress in tackling child poverty, showing significant progress.</p>
	<p pid=".1589W.5/2">As set out in &quot;Tackling Child Poverty&mdash;Giving Every Child the Best Possible Start in Life&quot;, published in December 2001, the Government's strategy for tackling child poverty involves ensuring decent family incomes, with work for those who can and support for those who cannot, and providing support for parents. It also involves delivering high quality public services and harnessing the power and expertise of the voluntary and community sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".1589W.5/3">Based on the latest outturn data (for 2001&ndash;02) we have made significant progress on our PSA target to reduce the number of children in low-income households by a quarter by 2004&ndash;05. The 2003 Pre-Budget Report announced that the per child element of the Child Tax Credit will increase from April 2004 by &pound;180 to &pound;1,625 a year, equivalent to a weekly increase of &pound;3.50.</p>
	<p pid=".1589W.5/4">As a result of this new investment, the Government is on track to meet its PSA target to reduce by a quarter the number of children in low-income households by 2004&ndash;05 on a before housing costs basis. The target is more challenging on an after housing costs basis. The nature of the target means that there are uncertainties either way. This extra investment will enable the Government to make progress step by step towards its goal to halve child poverty by 2010 and eradicate it by 2020.</p>
	<p pid=".1589W.5/5">The 2003 Budget announced a Child Poverty Review to examine, for the next Spending Review, the welfare reform and public services changes needed to advance faster towards its long-term goals to halve and then eradicate child poverty. The review is under way, with a series of seminars having been held during the autumn covering issues such as ethnic minority groups, educational outcomes, parenting, early years services, health outcomes, supporting families with disabled children and deprived areas. The Review will feed into the 2004 Spending Review.</p>
	<p pid=".1589W.5/6">In December 2003 we published Measuring Child Poverty, which outlines our measure of child poverty for the long term, effective from 2004&ndash;05. A copy is available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".1591W.8/3">HSE's IT services were first contracted out in 1995 as part of the market testing policy of the previous administration. Although occupational pensions issues do not fall within the scope of the TUPE Regulations, the Government Actuary certified the Bull-lntegris (hereafter &quot;Bull&quot;) pension scheme as broadly comparable to the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme. Staff were also provided with access to expert independent advice so that they could make informed choices about their pension arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".1591W.8/4">The contract for HSE's IT services was re-let in 2001 and won by a consortium made of Logica/CMG and Computacenter. As a result, Bull transferred former HSE employees to either Logica/CMG or Computacenter (depending on their function). Although these issues are matters between the contractors, HSE encouraged Logica/CMG, Computacenter and Bull to come to a bulk transfer arrangement on the matter of pensions.</p>
	<p pid=".1591W.8/5">Logica/CMG have been unable to agree a bulk transfer of pension benefits from Bull in respect of employees past service with HSE and Bull. This is because such a transfer would result in staff being credited with a significantly reduced number of years in the CMG scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1591W.8/6">However, because of concerns about this issue I have asked officials to look at the case and confirm to me that procedures and accountabilities have been properly followed. This is under way and I will write again when investigations have been concluded.</p>

	<p pid=".1593W.2/1">Council Tax Benefit has lower capital limits above which benefits are reduced and upper limits above which benefits cannot be paid. When the present scheme was introduced in April 1988, the upper capital limit was set at &pound;6,000.

	<p pid=".1595W.2/1">We want all eligible pensioners to take up their entitlement and initiatives are in place to encourage them to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".1595W.2/2">We are currently in the main phase of our marketing campaign for pension credit and aim to have at least 3 million households in receipt of pension credit by 2006. By June 2004, we will have written to all pensioner households, to explain about the new entitlement. Direct mail is being supported by extensive TV and press advertising. From May, we intend to focus campaign activity on those pensioners who are likely to be entitled but who have not responded.</p>
	<p pid=".1595W.2/3">The Pension Service Local Service is playing a key role, particularly in encouraging pensioners who are less likely to take up their entitlement to apply. We continue to work closely with organisations such as Help the Aged and Age Concern/at both national and local level, and with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".1595W.2/4">Local authorities have a statutory duty to promote take up of housing benefit and council tax benefit. In order to encourage take up of council tax benefit, which has historically been lower than for other income-related benefits, we have launched a take-up campaign to help support local authorities in encouraging those who may be entitled to claim.</p>
	<p pid=".1595W.2/5">The introduction of pension credit also means around 320,000 pensioner households will be newly entitled to council tax benefit. To help facilitate take up of housing benefit and council tax benefit applicants for pension credit who also want to claim these benefits are sent a claim form to return to their local authority. We have also recently introduced a shortened version of this claim form for pensioners to make the process of claiming even easier.</p>
	<p pid=".1595W.2/6">Those pensioners who are entitled to the pension credit guarantee credit have linked entitlement to housing benefit and council tax benefit which can meet up to 100 per cent. of their rent and council tax liability. The Department is improving the take-up of attendance allowance in a targeted and well directed way. We have removed a major barrier to people claiming attendance allowance by introducing a new claim form that is much shorter, personalised and more responsive to customer needs. New information technology has been introduced throughout the organisation to speed up the decision making process and enable a better and more professional service.</p>
	<p pid=".1595W.2/7">We are also working closer with partners such as local authorities and welfare rights organisations who are able to advise people about disability benefits in a far more targeted way than would be possible through any mass disability awareness campaigns.</p>

	<p pid=".1596W.2/1">Our Pensions Green Paper 'Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement' reinforced our commitment to extend employment opportunities for older people, with a range of proposals including providing extra back-to-work help for over 50s, and a number of changes to tax and pension rules which will give individuals more choice and opportunity to stay in work longer. We have pledged to tackle age discrimination in the workplace, and we will be introducing age legislation covering employment, vocational training and guidance by 2006. We have also made it clear that in the forthcoming age legislation compulsory retirement ages are likely to be unlawful, unless employers can show they are objectively justified. Employers will therefore need to adopt more flexible approaches to retirement.</p>
	<p pid=".1596W.2/2">We are already encouraging employers to adopt non-ageist employment practices through our Age Positive Campaign. The campaign raises employers' awareness of the business benefits of an age diverse workforce and encourages a flexible approach to retirement to open up choice and opportunity for individuals to stay in work longer.</p>
	<p pid=".1596W.2/3">In 2002 we published an updated version of the Code of Practice 'Age Diversity at work: a practical guide for business'. This sets out the standards for non-ageist approaches to recruitment, training, promotion, redundancy and retirement. The code was first developed in 1999 with leading organisations including the CBI, TUC, the Employers Forum on Age and Age Concern. Evaluation shows that from 1999 to 2001 the number of companies using age in recruitment had already fallen from 27 per cent. to 13 per cent. and the number of companies having a policy against employing older workers had dropped from 14 per cent. to 7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".1596W.2/4">Since then we have continued to promote the business case for recruiting, training and retaining older workers through the Age Positive campaign and website, <a href="http://www.agepositive.gov.uk">www.agepositive.gov.uk</a>, and workshops for smaller businesses. Our research publications include 'Good Practice in the Recruitment and Retention of Older Workers' (December 2001), 'Flexible Retirement: A Snapshot of Large Employers' Initiatives' (June 2002), 'Working after State Pension Age' (2003) and 'Factors affecting the Labour Market Participation of Older Workers' (2004). Copies of these reports are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".1596W.2/5">From Spring 1997 to Spring 2003 our policies have helped increase the employment rate for people aged 50 to State Pension age from over 64 per cent. to over 70 per cent., with nearly 900,000 more people aged 50 and over in work. This increase has been faster than the increase in the overall employment rate. Under New Deal 50 plus over 98,000 people aged over 50 have moved off benefits and gone back to work from April 2000 to March 2003, claiming the programme's financial help. We will continue to build on this to further increase the employment rate of older workers, who have a wealth of skills and experience that can benefit individual businesses and the economy as a whole.</p>

	<p pid=".1600W.2/1">Income-related benefits are intended to target help on those with the least resources. It is a long established principle that substantial amounts of capital should not be ignored when deciding entitlement to a benefit based on need, and it is for this reason that all savings are counted as capital. Claimants are free to spend their capital as they wish, so it would be inappropriate to have different rules for the treatment of capital based simply on a declaration of its intended use.</p>
	<p pid=".1600W.2/2">However, there will not usually be a need for a person to have significant savings in order to lease or purchase a suitable vehicle through the Motability scheme. Generally, the cost of a suitable vehicle is met through the higher rate mobility component of their disability living allowance or war pensioners' mobility supplement. In some cases, where the cost of the chosen vehicle cannot be met from the weekly benefit payments, an advance payment must be made at the start of the relevant agreement. Motability has funds available to make discretionary payments to help meet the cost of an advance payment where Motability considers the extra cost is necessary to provide a vehicle to meet a person's basic mobility needs.</p>

	<p pid=".1601W.5/1">The Department for Work and Pensions was created in April 2001 from a merger of the former Department of Social Security and parts of the Department for Education and Employment. One of our key priorities is to make the best possible use of taxpayers' money. Around 1,100 Jobcentres and 400 social security offices inherited from the former Benefits Agency and Employment Service are being replaced with a network of around 1,000 integrated Jobcentre Plus offices. By bringing together two organisations we can derive a merger dividend because it is possible to upgrade services and teams such as HR, Finance and Management Support.</p>
	<p pid=".1601W.5/2">Moreover, The Jobcentre Plus service brings job-finding and benefit services together under one roof. These new integrated offices will eventually replace all the existing Jobcentres and social security offices and this process will enable us to rationalise our estate by closing offices that are unsuitable for delivering the new service or where there are two offices covering the same area. For example in Hampshire, Liphook Office has been closed and a new office opened in Bordon. Hon. Members in Hampshire were consulted in the service delivery plans for the district in September 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".1601W.5/3">The Pension Service is delivering a centralised service to pensioners supported by a local service and is closing its presence within sites shared with other parts of the organisation as work is migrated to pension centres.</p>

	<p pid=".1602W.2/1">Jobcentre Plus and The Pension Service are modernising the services we provide to our customers. Increased accessibility is one of our key objectives in modernising welfare delivery. Modernisation is helping us to deliver the commitment made in the Rural White paper to ensure access to 'high quality public services&mdash;services often delivered in new ways, and through new outlets'. We are committed to ensuring that everyone is able to access our services, whether they live in urban or rural areas. We are providing improved customer access through telephone centres, the internet and new, dedicated caller offices.</p>
	<p pid=".1602W.2/2">Decisions about where services are delivered by the Department are based upon consultation with our partners such as local authorities and Regional Development Agencies, and reflect local circumstances and most importantly, the needs of the local community. The consideration of rural issues is an integral part of the consultation process. The Rural Proofing checklist produced by the Countryside Agency forms part of the initial planning process and, where appropriate, the Countryside Agency itself is consulted as a stakeholder.</p>
	<p pid=".1602W.2/3">DWP produce an internal annual Rural Proofing Report for the Countryside Agency; this includes examples of how the Department has addressed service delivery issues in rural areas. DWP also regularly discusses policy development and implementation with DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) and the Countryside Agency. For example, DWP provided detailed information about development and delivery of our services for last year's rural-proofing report by the Countryside Agency. A copy of the Countryside Agency's Rural Proofing Report for 2002&ndash;3 can be found in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".1604W.0/1">We have introduced the state second pension (S2P) which reformed the state earnings-related pension scheme (SERPS) in April 2002. Compared to SERPS, S2P gives more help to employees on low or moderate earnings (&pound;4,004 to &pound;25,600 in 2003&ndash;04 terms). It also helps certain carers and disabled people whose annual earnings are below &pound;4,004, or have no earnings at all. So it will provide extra income in retirement for some part-time workers.</p>
	<p pid=".1604W.0/2">Since 1997, we have also made it possible for part-timers to make pension contributions at a relatively low cost, and on a flexible basis, with the introduction of stakeholder pensions.</p>
	<p pid=".1604W.0/3">We have also taken steps to improve access to occupational pension schemes for part-time workers. We have implemented the EU Directive 97/81/EC (the Part-time Work Directive) by introducing the Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (SI No. 1551/2000) which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2000-07-01">1 July 2000</phrase>. Under these regulations part-time workers have the right in principle not to be treated less favourably than full-time workers of the same employer who work under the same type of employment contract.</p>
	<p pid=".1604W.0/4">In addition, as a result of rulings by the courts, part time workers can claim backdated access to occupational pension schemes where their previous exclusion from the relevant scheme amounted to indirect sex discrimination. Claims can be backdated to <phrase class="date" code="1976-04-01">1 April 1976</phrase> or the start of employment, if later, subject to paying relevant contributions.</p>

	<p pid=".1608W.5/1">Workstep was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase> to replace the former Supported Employment Programme. Workstep provides in-work support for disabled people who have more complex barriers to finding and keeping a job, but who, with the right support, can work effectively and develop in their job. Where it is appropriate, individual supported employees may also progress to unsupported employment.</p>
	<p pid=".1608W.5/2">The programme is managed by Jobcentre Plus, which contracts with over 240 local authorities, voluntary organisations, Remploy Ltd. and private sector organisations. Supported employees work in mainstream employment with a range of organisations. In addition, some are employed in supported factories and businesses run as part of the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1608W.5/3">Since it started, the core funding allocated to Workstep has remained broadly constant at around &pound;60 million a year. An additional &pound;37.2 million over three years 2001 to 2004, was made available to expand the programme and to support providers to modernise and develop their delivery of the programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1608W.5/4">The available information on the number of people supported through Workstep is in the following tables:</p>
	<table>

	<p pid=".1611W.3/1">The best source of information on this topic are the large number of studies which have already been undertaken by international organisations such as the World Bank, IMF, UNCTAD and the OECD, and by charitable organisations such as Oxfam. The work of these organisations demonstrates through individual case studies the severe adverse effects which dumping of subsidised agricultural products on world markets can have on developing country economies. It remains, however, very difficult to make an accurate quantitative economic assessment of the overall impact of dumping of subsidised agricultural produce on developing country markets. The World Bank have, however, estimated that the comprehensive reform of all aspects of agricultural policies in developed countries could boost the income of developing countries by as much as $100 billion.</p>

Our role is to provide the framework which stimulates business voluntarily to raise their performance beyond minimum legal standards. Any government interventions need to be carefully considered, well-designed and targeted. On that basis we will consider opportunities to increase and incentives adoption and reporting of CSR, including best practice guidance, and, where appropriate, through intelligent regulation and fiscal incentives. I expect to receive next month a report from a working group chaired by Clive Mather, Chairman of Shell UK, on the promotion of CSR skills in the UK, including consideration of the proposal for a CSR academy.</p>

	<p pid=".1616W.0/2">ECGD claims payments resulting from sovereign default are generally recovered through the Paris Club of Official Creditors. Paris Club creditors act in concert to agree appropriate debt restructuring with countries in difficulty.</p>
	<p pid=".1616W.0/3">Through this route, ECGD usually receives between &pound;300 million and &pound;400 million per annum. As at <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-30">30 September 2003</phrase> there were agreements with 46 countries owing ECGD a total of &pound;10 billion. ECGD expects to recover the majority of this debt together with additional moratorium interest.</p>
	<p pid=".1616W.0/4">It is expected that the unsustainable debt of the heavily indebted poor countries still remaining will be written off over the next few years.</p>
	<p pid=".1616W.0/5">ECGD makes provisions against loss. In preparing statutory resource accounts ECGD estimates the recoverable element of outstanding paid claims based on sound valuation principles and assumption methodologies that conform to best practice as recognised and used by the major financial institutions in assessing similar risks.</p>
	<p pid=".1616W.0/6">For non-Paris Club debt ECGD similarly makes a regular assessment of the likely recoverability of debt where default has occurred. It then sets targets accordingly. ECGD uses a wide range of strategies to recover such debt, in line with best market practice and focuses its resources accordingly.</p>

There is now an appeal period until <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-23">23 February 2004</phrase> to submit further evidence on appeal against any vessels that have not accepted onto the list.

	<p pid=".1620W.12/1">The Department of Trade and Industry does not have any targets specific to women working in information and communication technology, but is working to increase the participation of women in this sector, as well s others through the work of a new dedicated Resource Centre for Women in science, engineering and technology (SET). The Resource Centre is part of the Government's Strategy, published in April 2003 as a response to Baroness Greenfield's SET Fair Report. The Government will look to the new Resource Centre to carry out specific tasks in support of its overarching objective to work with employers to improve the position of women in SET: recognition for good SET employers; the sharing of good employment practice; disseminating and sharing information; setting up and maintaining an expert women's database; maintaining and disseminating statistics; raising the profile of women in SET; pump-priming innovation through developing, with others, support for initiatives such as mentoring, networking, speaker's bursaries and mobility issues; supporting returners; and coordinating the work of women in science organisations. It will draw on the experience of women and women in science organisations to do this and co-ordinate their activity to achieve critical mass.</p>
	<p pid=".1620W.12/2">The JIVE Consortium has been chosen to run the resource centre. This is a consortium of Sheffield Hallam University, Bradford College, the Open University and Cambridge University through its WiSETI (Women in Science, Engineering and Technology) Project. Between them they have extensive knowledge of, and standing in, all the sectors of SET (including ITEC) and the built environment. The Government is providing funding of &pound;800,000 per annum to cover all the activities of the centre. Additional funding of &pound;500,000 is available to the resource centre for a returners' scheme, to gather feedback on existing schemes as soon as it can, and develop a strategic plan for the future investment of these additional funds. DfES will also contribute &pound;200,000 to the Resource Centre for schemes aimed at undergraduates. The Consortium members proposed to deliver a Resource Centre that represents all sectors in which there are high levels of occupational segregation for women in science, engineering, technology, and the built environment and intend to be relevant to all women whether working at professional, technician or craft level.</p>
	<p pid=".1620W.12/3">It will be important for the centre to work in partnership with professional SET bodies and others in the SET community, with organisations such as the CBI, the TUC, large and small employers, and the Sector Skills Councils (SSCs). The new centre will be expected to raise funds from other sources both private and public. It is expected that organisations that want partnership with an support from the resource centre will contribute resources, both to specific projects and to allow the centre to operate more widely, to maximise the leverage of the initial public finding to the centre.</p>
	<p pid=".1620W.12/4">To increase the number of women who can maintain their SET carers and are able to return after a career break, as well as achieve their potential through promotion and engagement in policy making circles, they need access to opportunities for self- development, and to meet people who can introduce them to these opportunities. Mentoring is acknowledged as a key tool in personal development and empowerment. The Promotion SET for Women Unit is funding a pilot three-year national mentoring scheme for women in SET. The Project is being delivered through two organisations&mdash;the Women's Engineering Society and the Association of Women in Science and Engineering. Four blue chip companies including Astra Zeneca, BAE Systems, Demag Delaval Industrial Turbomachinery Ltd. and Ford are also supporting the project. The pilot mentoring scheme will use industrial mentoring training programmes in order to train mentors and prepare mentees. They project is well under way and over 60 mentors and mentees have been matched, and mentoring has commenced.</p>

The Phoenix Development Fund is supporting over 90 projects testing out innovative approaches in providing business support for disadvantaged communities and under-represented groups. Up until the end of September 2003, the latest date for which figures are available, these projects had helped in the creation of some 7,700 new enterprises and assisted over 7,100 existing businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".1626W.5/2">Among other projects being funded is the work of 55 Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs) that provide finance to businesses unable to obtain it from other sources. Up until the end of December 2003, those CDFIs have made over 1,050 loans to the value of over &pound;6.5 million that have resulted in the creation of some 1,860 jobs in over 1,000 new and existing businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".1626W.5/3">The effectiveness of the Fund is currently being evaluated. An interim report of an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the Phoenix Development Fund is due to be published shortly. A final report will be published in the second half of 2004. An independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the first two rounds of support for CDFIs is currently underway and will report in April.</p>

	<p pid=".1632W.2/1">As at January 2004, 58 per cent. of our Challenger II Main Battle Tanks available for operations were classed as 'Fit'. Equipment is deemed to be 'Fit' if it meets the inspection criteria stated in the relevant Army Equipment Support Publication Inspections Standards for all operational and peacetime legal and safety requirements. Many of the tanks classified as not 'Fit' require only minor work in terms of spares or labour to rectify the problem, and many of these would be able to undertake their prescribed role in an operational environment.</p>

The Department has no requirement to record specifically information relating to makes, types and origins of aircraft chartered. The Department competes its charter business in accordance with European rules and often through a broker in order to achieve value for money. Safety is of paramount importance and the nationality of the aircraft is but one consideration in the assessment of suitability for task.</p>
	<p pid=".1634W.2/2">The decision that information on foreign aircraft chartered could be provided only at disproportionate cost was made by the Chief Executive of the DTMA. It was based on a calculation that the exercise would entail one member of DTMA being removed from normal duties to work only on this task for a minimum of five working days. This period would exceed the cost threshold of &pound;600 and have a detrimental effect on the daily work of air movements. DTMA would also have to contact all other parts of the Department, and re-engage with brokers, in order to identify all foreign charters. This would be at additional cost.</p>
	<p pid=".1634W.2/3">Some information on chartered aircraft has previously been provided in answers to Questions from hon. Members, where such information was available centrally and did not involve disproportionate cost to recover it.</p>

To date, in the Multinational Division (South-east) area of responsibility almost all of the ICDC's personnel and approaching half of the police have been trained. In addition 20 Armoured Brigade and the Royal Military Police each have embedded personnel in the respective Iraqi organisations as part of the mentoring process.</p>

We do not hold figures for the transition period that can be broken down by nationality or speciality, but we estimate that there were approximately 450 personnel in the Iraq Survey Group in early June. The United Kingdom contribution would have been Headquarters Staff, interviewers/interpreters and scientific and technical specialists.

	<p pid=".1642W.8/1">There is no universally accepted definition of the phrase &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot;, but it is generally held to refer to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.</p>
	<p pid=".1642W.8/2">Under the terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, China and Russia are recognised as nuclear weapon states, as defined in Article 9(3) of the Treaty. Additionally, India and Pakistan have tested nuclear devices. As set out in the Strategic Defence Review 1998, the UK has fewer than 200 operationally available nuclear warheads. None of the other states have publicly confirmed the size of their nuclear weapon stockpiles.</p>
	<p pid=".1642W.8/3">There are five States Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) (US, Russia, India, Albania and one other State Party) that have declared possession of chemical weapons. They are currently in the process of destroying them in accordance with their obligations under the Convention. The amount of chemical weapons originally declared is 69,869 metric tonnes, of which 27,773 metric tonnes is from the US, 40,000 metric tonnes from Russia, and 2,096 metric tonnes from the other states parties.</p>
	<p pid=".1642W.8/4">We welcome Libya's recent announcement that it is renouncing its WMD programmes. It has acceded to the CWC and the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention. It has announced its intention to sign an Additional Protocol with the IAEA and has undertaken to act in accordance with its provisions pending ratification.</p>
	<p pid=".1642W.8/5">We do not yet have a complete picture of Iraq's WMD programme related activities. The Iraq Survey Group's work is by no means completed. It remains our best means of discovering the truth about Iraq's WMD programmes. We have long had concerns about the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's development of WMD, especially their capability to produce and develop nuclear weapons. We are actively supporting the major diplomatic effort to try and resolve international concerns about North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. The UK remains concerned by the scope and scale of Iran's nuclear programme, and the state of its technical knowledge, which could assist in the production of both chemical and biological weapons. We are also aware of persistent reports that Syria is pursuing programmes to develop WMD and the means for their delivery.</p>
	<p pid=".1642W.8/6">We continue to encourage Israel to resolve international concerns about its nuclear status by acceding to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, as a non-nuclear weapons state.</p>

The Office of the Deputy Prime minister has issued statutory guidance that provides housing authorities with examples of indicators which might be taken into account in determining whether people are living in unsatisfactory housing conditions. These include children in flats or maisonettes above the ground floor. There is nothing to prevent housing authorities devising their own local indicators in addition, or in place of this.</p>

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Telecommunications Network (FTN) has now been successfully rolled out to 192 posts. Beyond the contracts for FTN and &quot;Prism&quot;, the only ICT project which has cost the FCO collectively in excess of &pound;20 million in the last ten years has been our global IT infrastructure, Firecrest. The Firecrest project was led by our principal internal service provider, FCO Services, and was completed in October 2003. The internal costs of the project are considerably greater than original 1997 estimates, reflecting the FCO's decision to expand Firecrest from a limited deployment to some 71 posts into a single, global IT platform for over 200 posts. The replanned project stages were completed on time and budgets were subject to proper internal approvals.</p>
	<p pid=".1654W.6/2">Technical issues have delayed the implementation of the Prism programme (providing financial and human resources systems) by some months. Final preparations are now under way to introduce elements of the programme in the coming weeks, with the full package being introduced at the start of the next financial year.</p>
	<p pid=".1654W.6/3">All systems have required some adaptation and thorough testing before being released, so no significant de-bugging has been required once the systems have been rolled out.</p>

	<p pid=".1662W.8/2">The figures allow a comparison of the mandatory European emission standards for new petrol and diesel vehicles in comparison with typical emissions from LPG and Natural Gas vehicles.</p>
	<p pid=".1662W.8/3">Several sources of uncertainty arise when assessing the performance of LPG vehicles. The level of emissions improvement in LPG cars depends heavily on the particular engines and conversions involved and on the standard of conversion. For these reasons, absolute comparison of LPG and conventional cars is not possible. The table gives an indication of the comparative figures.</p>

However this section of the M2 will shortly require resurfacing for maintenance reasons, using the quieter surfacing materials that will help reduce the traffic noise. The Highways Agency will aim to resurface this section of the M2 in the 2005&ndash;06 financial year, subject to funding being available.</p>

	<p pid=".1665W.5/2">These values, based on 2002 casualty data, were <i>(a)</i> fatal &pound;1,447,490, <i>(b)</i> serious &pound;168,260, <i>(c)</i> slight &pound;16,750. These amounts are the values to be used in cost benefit analysis. They take account of medical costs, lost production, human costs based on willingness to pay for reduction of risk, the costs of police and courts, insurance administration, and property damage. Included within these values are the cost to public funds for hospital and ambulance costs and the costs of police and courts. In 2002, these costs were &pound;6,860, &pound;11,900 and &pound;1,020 for fatal, serious and slight accidents respectively. The lost production element includes social security costs but these are not separately estimated. The equivalent estimates for 1994 for the avoidance of road accidents were <i>(a)</i> fatal &pound;913,140, <i>(b)</i> serious &pound;108,080, and <i>(c)</i> slight &pound;10,630.

	<p pid=".1666W.5/2">The Highways Agency has studied the feasibility of installing signals at the A249 Cowstead Corner junction. The Study concluded that the installation of traffic signals would increase queuing times during off peak periods and recommended that this scheme should not go ahead. However an improved roundabout junction at Cowstead Corner will be provided as part of the new A249 Iwade Bypass to Queenborough Scheme. Work is due to start in spring 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".1677W.6/1">It has been scientifically established that the strains of agent causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) are indistinguishable, and the most plausible explanation, although not yet proven, is that BSE transmitted to humans via contaminated meat or meat products. In 2002, the World Health Organisation published consumer information, which states that the consumption of contaminated meat and other food products from cattle with BSE is presumed to be the cause of vCJD in humans.</p>
	<p pid=".1677W.6/2">The United Kingdom has in place stringent controls to minimise the risk of the BSE agent getting into the food chain. These include a ban on mammalian and other processed animal proteins being fed to farmed livestock; the specified risk material (SRM) controls that prohibit from human consumption those parts of the animal that might harbour BSE; and the over 30 months rule that does not permit most older animals to enter the food chain. The Beef Assurance Scheme does allow a few older animals into the food chain, if reared from grass in beef herds, subject to special rules. All measures currently in place are rigorously enforced, for example by members of the Meat Hygiene Service supervising activity at abattoirs.</p>
	<p pid=".1677W.6/3">The Department of Health has taken a number of measures to reduce the risks of CJD infection arising from one person passing it on to another, in particular through blood and surgery.</p>

	<p pid=".1677W.9/1">An increase in deaths in the United Kingdom from sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) from about 10 per year in 1970 to about 40 a year in the 1990s has been reported. These rates are comparable to those observed elsewhere in the world, including countries free of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The increased numbers reported probably reflects improved diagnosis, particularly in elderly patients.</p>
	<p pid=".1677W.9/2">Recent examination of the possible causes of the increased rates of sporadic CJD in Switzerland concluded that there was no evidence that the Swiss patients developed the disease as a result of exposure to BSE.</p>
	<p pid=".1677W.9/3">A laboratory study in an animal model published in 2002 (Asante et al 2002. EMBO Journal vol 21) raised the possibility that BSE infection may be linked with disease pathology characteristic of sporadic CJD in humans. Copies are available in the Library. The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), the independent, international group of experts that advises the United Kingdom Government on all matters connected with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, considered this paper in February 2003 and acknowledged that it was plausible but considered that the new work did not provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis.</p>

	<p pid=".1678W.5/2">The Royal College of Physicians (RCP) published their report, &quot;Allergy&mdash;the unmet need: a blueprint for better patient care&quot;, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-25">25 June 2003</phrase>. We welcome the RCP report and believe it is a useful contribution to the debate on how to improve National Health Service allergy services. The report noted that allergies including asthma, rhinitis, eczema, food allergy and drug allergy are becoming increasingly common. It calls for improved NHS allergy services across the board and offered useful models about how this could be achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".1678W.5/3">A range of research projects on the epidemiology of allergies have recently been completed or are ongoing. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) was formed in 1991. Phase One measured the prevalence of childhood asthma, hayfever and atopic eczema for international comparisons. Phase Two began in 1998 and involves more intensive studies in a smaller number of countries. The Department of Health funded the UK contribution to Phase Two.</p>
	<p pid=".1678W.5/4">The Food Standards Agency funds research on food allergy and intolerance, with particular emphasis on severe allergies, how they occur and what causes them. A large programme of research on food intolerance and allergy, costing around &pound;1 million a year is ongoing. King's College London is leading a &pound;2.1 million European Commission (EC) funded prospective study of the incidence and prognosis of allergy, allergic disease and low lung function in adults living in Europe. Also, The University of Manchester is leading a &pound;1.2 million EC-funded investigation of the prevalence, pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of sun allergy across Europe. Sun-provoked skin reactions are one of the commonest forms of allergy.</p>

	<p pid=".1680W.5/1">The Government's policy is that appropriate services should be provided for children and adults with autism according to each individual's needs.</p>
	<p pid=".1680W.5/2">Most children with autism will need high quality support from health, education and social services. They should receive this through an integrated system. Our recently published Green Paper &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;, sets out proposals to integrate children's services through the development of children's trusts and the appointment of local authority directors of children's services.</p>
	<p pid=".1680W.5/3">We are also developing the children's national service framework (NSF), which will set new national standards for the national health service and social services. Services for disabled children will be a key part of the NSF, which will include care pathways/exemplar diagrams illustrating optimum approaches to delivering services in a number of different areas. We have already announced that autism will be used as an exemplar.</p>
	<p pid=".1680W.5/4">Children with autistic spectrum disorders are also benefiting from the programmes we are introducing to improve family support services for disabled children. The Quality Protects programme to improve children's social services has made disabled children a priority area. From 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04, &pound;60 million from the children's services special grant has been earmarked for services for disabled children and their families&mdash;&pound;15 million in 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 and &pound;30 million this year. Quality Protects management action plans show that more family support services are being provided, particularly home based respite care and sitting services.</p>
	<p pid=".1680W.5/5">Our White Paper, &quot;Valuing People&quot;, directly covers every adult with autism who also has a learning disability. Implementation guidance, issued in August 2001, makes clear that adults with Asperger's Syndrome or higher functioning autism are not precluded from using learning disability services, where appropriate, and may require an assessment of their social functioning and communication skills in order to establish their level of need. By bringing together a wide range of local statutory agencies, Valuing People gives us the scope to improve opportunities and services for people across the autistic spectrum.</p>
	<p pid=".1680W.5/6">People with autism are benefiting from funding of over &pound;250,000, which the Department made through the Section 64 Scheme of Grants to Voluntary Organisations between 1999&ndash;2000 and 2002&ndash;03. We are currently devoting further funds over three years to the National Autistic Society project, &quot;Independence and Autism: Good Practice for Service Providers&quot;. This will support the development of new services to enable adults with autism or Asperger's Syndrome to live independently.</p>
	<p pid=".1680W.5/7">People with autism will also gain, along with others, from the investment we are making to improve standards in health and social care services. In particular, they will benefit from the NHS Plan, the mental health NSF (which covers the mental health needs of adults with autism) and fair access to care services. We will continue to review what more needs to be done for all people affected by autistic spectrum disorders.</p>

Implementation of an efficient regulatory system will help new effective medicines for diseases such as cancer to reach the market more quickly whilst protecting subjects enrolling into clinical trials.</p>

	<p pid=".1688W.3/1">The Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC) was agreed by Member States in 2001.

Transposition of the Directive was delayed in the United Kingdom because of concerns expressed by the academic research community about the possible impact on academic research and because of the European Commission's delay in finalising two Commission Directives, one on Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and one on Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

	<p pid=".1690W.8/1">Both children and adults with profound and multiple learning disabilities have the same right of access to national health service treatment as everyone else. Our White Paper, &quot;Valuing People&mdash;a New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century&quot; (Cm 5086, paragraph 8.33), recognises that people with severe and profound learning disabilities often have other associated health problems such as physical disabilities, sensory impairments and epilepsy.</p>
	<p pid=".1690W.8/2">The White Paper says that specialist learning disability staff have important roles in enhancing the competence of other local services to support service users in their usual surroundings and in enabling them to access mainstream services. Good practice guidance on &quot;Valuing People&quot; proposals for health action plans and health facilitation devotes a full chapter to people with sensory impairments and/or profound and multiple learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".1690W.8/3">&quot;Valuing People&quot; made people with severe and profound learning disabilities a priority for Learning Disability Development Fund (LDDF) capital investment. When we wrote to chief executives of primary care trusts in February 2004, we asked them to take account of the needs of people with high support needs when deciding how best to use their 2004&ndash;05 LDDF revenue allocations.</p>
	<p pid=".1690W.8/4">We are also developing the children's national service framework (NSF), which will set new national standards for the NHS and social services. Services for disabled children will be a key part of the NSF, which will include care pathways/exemplar diagrams illustrating optimum approaches to delivering services in a number of different areas.</p>

The main strategy is supported also by a separate operational environment strategy and by the development of the Department's Environmental Management System. These have helped the Department meet the requirements of the Government's &quot;Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1697W.9/3">The NHS Estates Agency (NHSE) and the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (NHS PASA)&mdash;both Executive Agencies of the Department&mdash;have their own sustainable development/environmental strategies in place. The NHSE has issued a &quot;New Environmental Strategy for the NHS and Sustainable Development in the NHS&quot; as guidance for the NHS. NHS PASA has a sustainable development policy which it published in February 2003. This policy describes the framework within which NHS PASA will conduct its activities in order to contribute towards global pursuits of sustainable development.</p>

	<p pid=".1698W.2/1">The Department is currently co-funding a project at the University of Leeds to explore methods for the collection, storage and management of a national archive of human milk samples. The other funders are the Food Standards Agency (which leads), the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Health and Safety Executive. A human milk archive would provide a resource, which could be used to monitor levels of cumulative chemicals. This, in turn, will inform decisions by regulatory bodies on the need for strategies to reduce the use of cumulative chemicals and their levels in the environment and in food. The report of the project is expected later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".1699W.8/2">The primary purpose of the NHS Cancer Plan is to save more lives. Reducing waiting times is key to achieving this. For breast cancer, waiting times data is collected and published on: the two week outpatient waiting time standard from urgent general practitioner referral to seeing a specialist; and since 2001, a milestone of a maximum one month from diagnosis with breast cancer to first definitive treatment. From 2002 data has been collected on the further milestone of a maximum two months from urgent general practitioner referral with suspected breast cancer to first definitive treatment. We have made significant progress on both counts. Data on achievement of NHS Cancer Plan waiting times targets are published on the Department's website for strategic health authorities and trusts, at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/cancerwaits">http://www. dh.gov.uk/cancerwaits</a></p>

Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary is charged with examining and improving the efficiency of the Police Service in England and Wales, and the Audit Commission looks at how well local councils deliver their services under the Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA). Inspections of English district councils include community safety and community cohesion, and from 2005, the Audit Commission propose that this should also form part of the CPA for all councils where it will be covered under the councils' Corporate Assessment.</p>

	<p pid=".1709W.12/1">Information is not available centrally on local/police authorities that have failed to incorporate section 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. However, the Audit Commission looks at how well local councils deliver their services under the Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA). Inspections of English district councils, include community safety with a specific focus on section 17 compliance. From 2005 Safer and Stronger Communities with a similar focus on section 17 compliance will form part of the CPA for all top tier councils where it will be covered under the councils' Corporate Assessment.</p>
	<p pid=".1709W.12/2">Members of the public could lobby their elected council member (or MP) or appropriate chair of the Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership or the chair of the Police Authority if they believe their local authority or local police authority was failing to implement section 17.</p>
	<p pid=".1709W.12/3">They could also approach the Local Government Ombudsman if they have a specific complaint of maladministration.</p>
	<p pid=".1709W.12/4">They could ultimately undertake a judicial review action with a view to enforcing local/police authority compliance with section 17.</p>

	<p pid=".1710W.2/1">The Home Office does not presently hold information on the successful implementation of section 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 by local authorities. However, the Audit Commission's Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) will in future address compliance with section 17 across all local authorities. The CPA will therefore provide a clear indication of the level of section 17 compliance throughout England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".1710W.2/2">There are examples of good practice in implementing section 17 that have been identified in publications by Crime Concern, National Association of Care and Resettlement Offenders, the Local Government Association and Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary, Thematic Inspection on Crime and Disorder entitled &quot;Calling Time on Crime&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1710W.2/3">The Government recognises that section 17 has not been universally well implemented and is committed to further raising the profile of section 17 across all relevant stakeholders. We shall also be spreading good practice via the Crime Reduction Website during 2004. We are currently piloting training in section 17 compliance through the Crime Reduction Centre.</p>

If the value of the damage is above &pound;5,000 the offender will be tried in a Crown Court and be subject to a maximum of 10 years imprisonment or an unlimited fine.

In addition the funding for education and training for prisoners rose from &pound;57 million in 2001&ndash;02 to &pound;66 million in 2002&ndash;03 and &pound;97 million in 2003&ndash;04.</p>

	<p pid=".1717W.14/1">The Home Office is working on a value for money case for a replacement programme to create a new generation of larger prisons with the facilities needed to deliver effective programmes designed to reduce re-offending. New large prisons could also provide economies of scale, which would allow us to close some smaller prisons and redirect resources to community punishments. This case will be subject of discussion in the forthcoming Spending Review, the outcome of which will be published.</p>

	<p pid=".1722W.5/1">The Prison Service does not restrain prisoners in 'Solitary Confinement'. Prisoners and Young Offenders can either be subject to segregation procedures, or they can be held in 'Special Accommodation' (special cells or unfurnished cells).</p>
	<p pid=".1722W.5/2">The Prison Service does not centrally monitor the use of segregation.</p>
	<p pid=".1722W.5/3">The forms used to authorise the use of Special Accommodation are in the process of being reviewed, along with a general review of the policy on Use of Force. Unfortunately, the current forms require very little detail about individual incidents, and therefore there are no data for how long prisoners and young offenders have been held in special accommodation. However, very few prisoners are held in special accommodation for periods exceeding 24 hours.</p>
	<p pid=".1722W.5/4">The following table therefore shows the total number of young offenders who have been held in special accommodation for the years for which figures are currently available.</p>
