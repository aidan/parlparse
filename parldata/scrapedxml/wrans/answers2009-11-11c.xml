	<p pid="c.360W.3/1">Between M25 junction 2 and M25 junction 30, (which includes the Dartford Crossing) the estimated average delay per journey during the period March to August 2009 compared to the same months in 2008 decreased by 0.4 minutes northbound and increased by 0.7 minutes southbound.</p>
	<p pid="c.360W.3/2">The months of March to August have been used for comparison of average delays per journey before and after the revised charges came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-15">15 November 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.360W.3/3">The Department has made no specific estimates of the levels of carbon emissions resulting from the revision of the charges in November 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.360W.3/4">The Department for Transport and the Highways Agency are committed to improving the levels of service experienced by users of the Dartford Crossing.</p>
	<p pid="c.360W.3/5">In the short term the Highways Agency are in the process of implementing a package of measures, including the introduction of average speed cameras and further traffic management technology, to reduce the number of incidents at the Crossing, which will improve journey times.</p>
	<p pid="c.360W.3/6">Additionally, in April 2009, the Department published its initial analysis of the current and possible future capacity constraints at the Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing. On the basis of the findings and conclusions of the analysis, we announced further work to investigate what can be done in the short to medium term to improve the level of service provided by the existing Crossing.</p>
	<p pid="c.360W.3/7">The study recommended further work on two possible measures, recognising that each had the potential to generate some small benefits by increasing throughput while avoiding impacts on safety. The first set of measures could see changes to the configuration of the toll plaza, signing and promotion of DART-Tags to see whether this would improve traffic flows. The second set of measures could entail one-way tolling with the removal of the southbound plaza to allow a larger improved northbound plaza. This work is being taken forward and is expected to take 12 to 18 months to complete.</p>

	<p pid="c.372W.6/2">I receive frequent representations via parliamentary questions and correspondence from representatives of the nations and regions on business opportunities associated with the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games. My officials in the Government Olympic Executive support me in this. Additionally, I receive representations through my 2012 visits to the English regions and the devolved Administrations.</p>
	<p pid="c.372W.6/3">The Government are committed to ensuring businesses across the UK benefit from the Olympics. The London 2012 Business Network was established to ensure that businesses from across the UK have access to contracts in London 2012&#146;s supply chains, and any support they need to win them.</p>
	<p pid="c.372W.6/4">Since its creation in 2006, the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) has run an ongoing programme of visits across the nations and regions on the business benefits of London 2012. It runs a programme of regional visits in partnership with the nine English regions and the three devolved Administrations to raise awareness of current and future business opportunities generated by the ODA construction programme. London 2012 is planning more regional visits for 2010 to continue to engage businesses in the games.</p>
	<p pid="c.372W.6/5">The ODA has also held various business events and workshops, including events in London for Welsh businesses to be briefed by its procurement team and tier one contractors.</p>
	<p pid="c.372W.6/6">To source all other representations received by the ODA would incur a disproportionate cost, due to the large volume of engagement they have in this area. In all, London 2012 expects to directly procure &#163;6 billion worth of contracts, generating tens of thousands of supply chain opportunities which are benefiting businesses across the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.377W.0/1">Two knife amnesties were held in 2006 resulting in over 1,500 potentially lethal weapons being disposed of. Based on feedback from the agencies involved, and given the number of weapons disposed of, my assessment is that the amnesties have been very effective. In the period since I have focused on the development of an educational and preventative strategy including a knife awareness campaign, delivered through schools, on the dangers of carrying knives. In April along with the Department of Education, PSNI and Crimestoppers we delivered a series of drama workshops called 'Choices'. 54 schools, involving around 4,000 pupils took part and were able to use a knife crime information pack as part of the citizenship curriculum. A second programme is running in the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-09">9 November</phrase> aimed at year 12 pupils (15 to 16 years of age).</p>

The Digital Britain White Paper outlined the Government&#146;s proposals for a pilot scheme for news in the nations and regions, and Wales is one of the pilot areas.

	<p pid="c.390W.11/3">Possessing a pistol is illegal in the UK under the Firearms Act, therefore, no legacy specifically for pistol shooting is being planned.

	<p pid="c.390W.11/4">After the London games, there is the potential to relocate temporary ranges and assets from the shooting venue at Woolwich. The London Organising Committee of the Olympic games and Paralympic games, the Olympic Delivery Authority and Government are working with British Shooting to deliver the best possible legacy for the sport.</p>
	<p pid="c.390W.11/5">Through using the inspiration of London 2012 Sport England has recently invested &#163;750,000 in the development of grassroots target shooting as part of the Whole Sports Plans 2009-13. The plan will harness the interest in the sport created by the 2012 games and aims to increase participation levels.</p>

	<p pid="c.393W.12/1">The Department has a small team providing advice, guidance and training to members of staff who respond to requests for information. Some members of the team also spend part of their time advising on other legislation, such as the Data Protection Act (DPA) and the environmental information regulations (EIRs). In particular, the environmental information unit within the team provides guidance to members of the public and other public authorities. The team is flexible in how it handles its day-to-day work load across all its information rights duties, and the percentages of time spent on the various functions can vary considerably over time. The approximate staffing levels in full-time equivalents are therefore as follows:</p>

	<p pid="c.396W.7/34">The apparent unevenness in the distribution of deployments between the various units shown reflect the narrow parameters of the question. Over the period that the answer covers, the Army have been committed on operations in not only Afghanistan and Iraq, but also have deployed in the Balkans, Northern Ireland, Cyprus and the Falkland Islands. When determining which units to allocate to operations, a number of considerations apply, not least the particular capability they offer. For example, those units which have deployed to Afghanistan will predominantly be those that operate in a light role.</p>

Determining amputations related to action specifically in Helmand would be complex and would at the very least necessitate interrogation of individual records. Even this would not be definitive as wounded could arrive at any one of many field hospitals, potentially including those outside Helmand. At the same time, casualties evacuated from Helmand field hospitals could have been wounded elsewhere. Consequently, obtaining verified data would be problematic and any data provided could not be relied upon.</p>

	<p pid="c.400W.0/1">The use by our armed forces in Afghanistan of all equipment types is kept under constant review to ensure that they continue to meet operational requirements. This includes the use of Snatch vehicles. Operational commanders have repeatedly stressed the importance of having a range of vehicles from which they can select the most appropriate for specific tasks. This includes a lighter, smaller and more agile patrol vehicle, such as the Snatch 2A and Snatch Vixen Land Rover. But to ensure that our personnel have the best possible protection, a strengthened variant of the vehicle, Snatch Vixen-Plus, is being procured for delivery to Afghanistan next year. This will be followed shortly thereafter by the new lighter protected patrol vehicle.</p>

I will place in the Library of the House a spreadsheet showing a brief summary of the 573 requests, but it has proved impossible to list the exemptions that applied or provide a more detailed summary for all these cases as this could only be provided at disproportionate cost. This is because each record has to be individually retrieved from our management system and the information extracted. However, it has proved possible to provide the full information for 202 cases within the cost limit and this information is given within the spreadsheet.</p>
	<p pid="c.405W.6/12" class="indent">I also agreed to set out simplified reasons for those that have required more than 40 working days on top of the statutory 20 working day period. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to identify reasons for each individual case. There are many reasons why a response might be delayed. These include, for example, difficulties identifying the appropriate part of the Department to respond, difficulties identifying the relevant information, complex discussions about whether information can be released, resource constraints and consultation of third parties including other Government Departments, commercial partners and foreign governments.</p>

	<p pid="c.412W.3/4" class="indent">ONS publishes the number of people registered to vote in local, European and Parliamentary elections but does not hold data on the number who are eligible to register. The mid-year estimate of the resident population, aged 18 and over, provides an approximation to this although not everybody who is usually resident is entitled to vote. For example, foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth are not eligible.</p>
	<p pid="c.412W.3/5" class="indent">The definition of the usually resident population is closer to the eligibility criteria for the local and European electorate than to those for the parliamentary electorate because the latter exclude EU citizens and include UK citizens resident abroad.</p>

	<p pid="c.420W.8/2">An operational decision was taken to re-designate the Asylum Screening Unit (ASU) in Liverpool to a Further Submissions Unit (FSU). Failed asylum seekers who wish to submit any further submissions now have to do so in person instead of by post, as we believe it is appropriate to see individuals in person when they submit information about their asylum claim, as evidence suggests that the majority of further submissions are not accepted as a fresh claim. We think requiring people to make further submissions in person will discourage abuse and help us run a more efficient system so that people who are in need of our protection get it without delay.</p>
	<p pid="c.420W.8/3">We also believe that anyone seeking asylum should do so at the first available opportunity&#151;this means on arrival at a port of entry. So only those who have failed to claim on arrival will be required to travel to Croydon to make their asylum application. The decision to designate Croydon ASU as the single site for applicants to lodge a claim for asylum reflects this fact. It also reflects the fact that the impact on Croydon is not expected to be dramatic as Croydon ASU has the capacity and existing infrastructure to screen the limited numbers of applicants that are expected to lodge an asylum claim at ASU Croydon once ASU Liverpool is re-designated. Before the change Liverpool ASU were booking on average between five&#151;10 appointments a day. This is the number of extra people who will be expected now to make their claim in Croydon. It is therefore considered that the effects on Croydon would be minimal, particularly as a partial appointment system has been introduced which allows increased opportunity to manage the flow of intake into the ASU.</p>
	<p pid="c.420W.8/4">There are insufficient grounds to allocate Croydon borough council more funds as a very small proportion of those who claim asylum in Croydon will remain there. Those asylum applicants who are destitute will be accommodated away from London and the South East and there are transitional arrangements to take account of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children claiming in Liverpool. Once these transitional arrangements have ended, there should be minimal financial affect on Croydon borough council as the UK Border Agency fully funds the council on a per day basis for each UASC they are responsible for. Additionally, the numbers of additional UASC claiming asylum at Croydon ASU are not expected to be significant.</p>

	<p pid="c.430W.2/2">The Home Office has not recently estimated the cost of the theft of heavy plant and equipment. The plant and agricultural national intelligence unit of the Metropolitan police estimates that approximately &#163;1.5 million of construction and agricultural plant machinery is stolen in the UK every week.</p>
	<p pid="c.430W.2/3">I am aware that vehicle security experts Thatcham estimate the total cost to the UK of plant theft to be upwards of &#163;600 million per year.</p>
	<p pid="c.430W.2/4">The Home Office takes the theft of plant and equipment very seriously. That is why the Home Office scientific development branch (HOSDB) published the &#147;Security Guidance Document for Agricultural and Construction Plant&quot;, which was launched by Crime Reduction Minster Alan Campbell at the Construction Industry Theft Solutions Conference on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-03">3 November</phrase> this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.430W.2/5">The new guidance provides up to date advice and information for the agricultural and construction industries, helping them to protect themselves from theft. The guidance was first published in January 2008, and has been revised and updated in the light of technological developments and our most recent understanding of the methods used by criminals to steal agricultural and plant machinery.</p>
	<p pid="c.430W.2/6">I am grateful to the plant theft action group (PTAG), established by the Home Office but now operated by and for the plant industry, and to the plant and agricultural national intelligence unit of the Metropolitan police (PANIU) for their support in producing the updated guidance.</p>
	<p pid="c.430W.2/7">PTAG and PANIU are also continuing to make a significant contribution to the reduction of plant theft through developments such as the CESAR plant marking and registration scheme, and the publication of guidance on construction site security.</p>
	<p pid="c.430W.2/8">The availability of the HOSDB plant security guidance, the PANIU site security guidance and the CESAR scheme are together proving successful at reducing plant theft and increasing rates of recovery of stolen plant.</p>

Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <sup>(2)</sup><i> Primary diagnosis</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br/> The IC10 diagnosis code for pleural plaque is 392.<br/> <sup>(3)</sup><i> Primary Care Trust (PCT) of Responsibility</i><br/> A derived field providing the primary care trust responsible for the patient. Commissioning responsibility for individual patients rests with the PCT with whom the patient is registered. This means that patients with a GP in one PCT area may reside in a neighbouring or other area but remain the responsibility of the PCT with whom their GP of registration is associated. PCTs are also responsible for non-registered patients who are resident within their boundaries.<br/> <sup>(4)</sup><i> Strategic Health Authority (SHA) of Treatment</i><br/> This field is derived from the hospital provider code (procode). It indicates the SHA area within which the treatment took place.<br/> <i> Small numbers</i><br/> To protect patient confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &#147;*&#148; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.<br/> <i> Data quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.473W.2/1">The Ministry is taking steps to increase the number of job applicants from ethnic minorities with the aim of realising a work force profile that is representative of the communities it serves. The activities associated with these steps are aimed at promoting the Ministry to, and attracting applications from, ethnic minority (BME) candidates. These include:</p>
	<p pid="c.473W.2/2" class="indent">(a) Advertising all jobs through Jobcentre Plus and the Ministry's web site,</p>
	<p pid="c.473W.2/3" class="indent">(b) Adverting vacancies in ethnic minority magazines and papers,</p>
	<p pid="c.473W.2/4" class="indent">(c) Working in local employment partnerships in areas with a high proportion of people from ethnic minorities,</p>
	<p pid="c.473W.2/5" class="indent">(d) Attending job fairs to promote the Ministry,</p>
	<p pid="c.473W.2/6" class="indent">(e) Offering work experience opportunities and job shadowing opportunities throughout the Ministry,</p>
	<p pid="c.473W.2/7" class="indent">(f) For senior civil servant campaigns, using head hunters which have a good track record of attracting a diverse range of applicants,</p>
	<p pid="c.473W.2/8" class="indent">(g) Interaction with key community groups to inform and involve them in Criminal Justice System.</p>
	<p pid="c.473W.2/9">These activities have resulted in an increased level of applicants from BME backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="c.473W.2/10">The Ministry has a policy of actively seeking ways of improving its attractiveness to job applicants from ethnic minority communities. Analysis of applications received for Ministry (excluding NOMS) recruitment campaigns in the last two months showed that, of the applicants that voluntarily disclosed their ethnic background, 56 per cent. of applications for jobs in London were from ethnic minorities, 38 per cent. for jobs in Birmingham and 20 per cent. for jobs in Leeds.</p>

	<p pid="c.481W.0/24">The figures for 2001-02 to 2007-08 are the net operating costs recorded in the annual consolidated accounts of local probation boards. The figure for 2008-09 is provisional as the boards&#146; consolidated accounts have not yet been signed off, and is taken from the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) 2008-09 accounts, including probation trusts. Before 2001-02, local probation committees were financed partly by local government and the figures are based on the expenditure implied by the main grant cash limit plus an allowance for probation hostels; these figures include some estimates.</p>

	<p pid="c.482W.8/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-12">12 February 2007</phrase> the maximum custodial sentence for knife or offensive weapon possession offences is four years. Therefore the answer gives data from March 2007 to June 2009 (the most recent published data from the Knife Crime Sentencing Quarterly brief). Further information is available at:</p>

	<p pid="c.482W.8/3">According to data recorded by the police on the Police National Computer, during the period March 2007 to June 2009, six offences (committed by six offenders) of possession of a knife or offensive weapon received a four year custodial sentence in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="c.482W.8/4">Maximum penalties are set at a level to provide for the most serious conceivable case of a particular offence and therefore are rarely imposed.</p>
	<p pid="c.482W.8/5">More custodial sentences are being given for knife and offensive weapon possession and those that are sent to jail are serving longer sentences. The proportion of immediate custodial sentences given for possessing a knife or offensive weapon increased from 17 per cent. to 19 per cent. of all sentences between the second quarter of 2008 compared with the same period in 2009. The average sentence length in the second quarter 2009 was 194 days which is a 42 per cent. increase from the same quarter in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.482W.8/6">These figures have been drawn from the police&#146;s administrative IT system which, as with any large scale recording system, is subject to possible errors with data entry and processing.

	<p pid="c.484W.2/1">During the past five years all public sector prisons have had at least one change of governor in charge. It is the policy of the National Offender Management Service to move governors to different types of establishment to enhance their experience and for reasons of self development.

	<p pid="c.490W.0/1">Automatic release at the half way point of sentence was introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Prisoners who are sentenced to six months therefore normally serve three months in prison. Adult prisoners sentenced to less than 12 months are not subject to supervision by the probation service on release from custody. However, they are 'at risk' of return to custody by the courts, to serve the unexpired portion of the sentence, if they commit an imprisonable offence before the expiry date of the original sentence. Young offenders (those under the age of 22 released from a term of detention in a YOI) are subject to a minimum of three months supervision. Juvenile prisoners sentenced to a Detention and Training Order are supervised as part of the conditions of these sentences.</p>
	<p pid="c.490W.0/2">The actual amount of time served in prison, following sentence, will depend on a number of factors, including time spent as a remand prisoner or credit for time spent on tagged bail if directed by the court, any added days and release on either Home Detention Curfew or End of Custody Licence.</p>
	<p pid="c.490W.0/3">For those prisoners discharged in 2008 having been sentenced to six months, the amount of time served is shown in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="c.496W.6/1">In May 2009 NOMS' consulting engineers, as part of the due diligence process, produced an environmental report on the former Dynamex site in Caernarfon in order to assess potential liabilities and constraints associated with ground contamination. The exercise included a review of existing reports which were based on previous tests on the soil. This evidence formed the basis of the assessment rather than carrying out further soil tests.</p>

	<p pid="c.497W.2/1">In line with Government policy across the public sector, probation boards and trusts are expected to meet efficiency requirements in order to maximise the value for money that they provide. These are focused on reducing back office functions and management overheads and maintain the priority given to resourcing front-line delivery. Boards and trusts are being supported by a national programme of specifying probation work and of benchmarking performance and cost to set clear standards for delivery and remove unjustified variation in costs. This programme, together with the intelligent use of probation work load data, enables local areas to manage the demands placed on individual staff more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.497W.2/2">The Specification, Benchmarking and Costing Programme in NOMS has already identified a number of operational efficiencies. One such example is the change in balance between standard and fast delivery reports provided to courts. This process has supported areas in prioritising the delivery of front-line services while maintaining the excellent standard of work probation staff do to protect the public and reduce reoffending.</p>

We recognise that there is a lack of evidence of &#145;what works&#146; with young people which is why we have commissioned the Juvenile Cohort Study. This is designed to track some 10,000 young offenders from 30 different Youth Offending Teams over a period of approximately two years, between 2008 and 2010, to explore the experiences of different types of young offenders within the criminal justice system. The Juvenile Cohort Study will assess the impact of interventions and combination of interventions that are associated with a reduction in reoffending in different types of young offenders subject to the criminal justice system.</p>

	<p pid="c.503W.5/11">In 2007-08 Cookham Wood was re-rolled from female to male which partly explains the higher cost in 2007-08 relative to the other two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.5/12">The direct cost per place for 2008-09 is shown net of income from the Department of Health and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, whereas for earlier years it is gross. This partly explains the reduction in cost in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.5/13">Traditionally the HMPS annual accounts have published the cost per place using only costs met by establishments. For 2007-08 and 2008-09 a more comprehensive cost has been calculated which includes prison related costs met centrally by HMPS and NOMS, and these are shown in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="c.503W.5/22">Year on year comparisons can be difficult to make, for example because of changes in accounting treatment or of prison categories.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.5/23">The costs relate to establishments whose predominant category of prisoner is female. Income from the Youth Justice Board (YJB) in respect of services recharged to the YJB is excluded.</p>
	<p pid="c.503W.5/24">The overall average costs comprise the public sector establishments' direct resource expenditure, increased by an apportionment of costs borne centrally by HMPS and the National Offender Management Service; and the resource expenditure of contracted-out prisons also increased by certain costs borne centrally. This involves some estimation. The figures do not include prisoners held in police and court cells under Operation Safeguard, nor expenditure met by other Government Departments (e.g. for health and education). The prisoner escort service is included.</p>

	<p pid="c.514W.2/2">The Royal Society published a report on Geo-engineering in September 2009 which concluded that techniques such as biochar may be useful contributors to reducing greenhouse gases on a small scale, although the circumstances under which they are economically viable and socially and ecologically sustainable remain to be determined.</p>
	<p pid="c.514W.2/3">A review was commissioned recently by DEFRA and DECC to assess the potential benefits, costs and issues surrounding the addition of biochar to soil. The review will help us understand the potential use of biochar to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We expect that the review will be completed by the end of December 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.520W.2/1">Children's Services authorities have responsibility for meeting the needs of homeless children under 16 if they are a &#147;child in need&#148;. Children's Services authorities and housing authorities both have certain obligations towards homeless 16-year-old children. Under the homelessness legislation (Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) housing authorities must secure accommodation for applicants who are eligible for assistance, homeless through no fault of their own and who have a priority need for accommodation. Families with dependent children aged 16 have a priority need for accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.520W.2/2">Information about English local housing authorities' actions under the homelessness legislation is collected quarterly at local authority level. Data collected include the number of applicants accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty (to secure that suitable accommodation is available). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="c.520W.2/3">Information on the number of applicant households with dependent children (and expected children) in bed and breakfast hotels and other privately managed shared facility annexes (&#147;B&amp;B style temporary accommodation&#148;), who had been resident there for six weeks or more, is reported quarterly by local authorities as at the last day of each quarter. This figure will include applicant households with children under 16-years-old or dependent children aged 16 to 18, although the number of such dependent children within these households cannot be identified.</p>
	<p pid="c.520W.2/4">The number of applicant households with dependent children (or expected children) in B&amp;B style temporary accommodation in England, who had been resident in such accommodation for six weeks or more at the end of March in each of the last seven years is shown in the following table:</p>

Where such performance data has not been made available the default efficiency values listed in SAP 2009 will be used. The default values in SAP 2009 are the same as those listed in SAP 2005 and were derived in consultation with industry experts taking account of the field trial information available. The SAP methodology and default values will be informed by the procedure being developed with industry to determine actual seasonal performance values, for which supporting performance data is expected in early 2010, and the Energy Saving Trust's heat pump field trials.</p>

	<p pid="c.530W.3/1">The Homes and Communities Agency is working with local partners to establish the Cashes Green Community Land Trust. Following extensive public engagement and community consultation, the Homes and Communities Agency has recently obtained planning consent for the redevelopment of the derelict site identified for this pilot land trust. It is now in the process of securing a development partner, by way of a competitive OJEU process, to deliver the overall scheme. Officials in the Department maintain regular contact with counterparts in the Homes and Communities Agency on this matter.</p>

Alongside the in-perpetuity maintenance of these sites (grass cutting, litter picking and infrastructure replacement), the trust regularly engage the local communities, hold a wide range of events and most importantly, take on all the liabilities of those sites.</p>
	<p pid="c.531W.0/3">To date these six sites have delivered 3,350 health activities, 43 days of training, 816 educational activities with local schools and 378 volunteering days. It should be noted that three of these sites are still in the development process with restoration still being undertaken and so haven't achieved anywhere near their full potential as yet.</p>
	<p pid="c.531W.0/4">By allowing the trust to take on the ownership and management of these sites the HCA and CLG are protecting these spaces for future generations, ensuring that the cycle of dereliction is broken and future public sector funding.</p>

	<p pid="c.540W.0/2">A report prepared for the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) by Frontier Economics Ltd., in October 2006, entitled &quot;Independent Review of the impact of the Freedom of Information Act&quot; estimated a figure of &#163;254 for a central Government body to deal with an initial FOI request. Based on this figure, the FCO spent an estimated &#163;334,010 on initial FOI requests in 2005, &#163;261,620 in 2006, &#163;260,604 in 2007, &#163;258,826 in 2008 and &#163;232,410 to end October in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.549W.3/2">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is responsible for the child maintenance system. I have asked the Child Maintenance Commissioner to write to the hon. Member with the information requested and I have seen the response.</p>
	<p pid="c.549W.3/3" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="c.549W.3/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.549W.3/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many staff have been moved from the Child Support Agency to other posts within her Department its agencies and its non-departmental bodies since <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January 2008</phrase> or the nearest date to that for which figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="c.549W.3/6" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-01">1 November 2008</phrase> the Department for Work and Pensions transferred the functions of the Child Support Agency and its 10,524 people (9,319 full time equivalents) to the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission (the Commission).</p>
	<p pid="c.549W.3/7" class="indent">In January 2009 and in consultation with Jobcentre Plus the Commission brought forward a reorganisation to enable the transfer of people and estate to Jobcentre Plus. This contributed to the Department&#146;s plans to increase Jobcentre Plus staffing to reflect the increasing numbers of clients as a result of the economic downturn. A total of 636 people (551 full time equivalents) and eight sites were transferred to Jobcentre Plus. No other employees have been moved to any other part of the Department outside the Commission other than those individuals who have successfully applied for posts on level transfer or promotion.</p>
	<p pid="c.549W.3/8" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="c.552W.9/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-28">28 January 2009</phrase> Elektron Instruments notified Jobcentre Plus that they were planning to make 35 of their 136 employees in Torquay redundant. These were mainly semi-skilled print setters who had been with the company for a long time. They would be going in two &#145;waves&#146;, the first on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-27">27 February 2009</phrase> and the second on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-27">27 March 2009</phrase>. This number was later reduced to 25.</p>
	<p pid="c.552W.9/2">We contacted the company the same day, and offered to give redundancy talks to those employees affected under the Rapid Response Scheme. The talks would cover an overview of how to claim benefit, the work we do with partner organisations and help jobseekers find work. They also signpost the Learning and Skills Council provision and make information and leaflets available. The aim is to help minimise some of the apprehension and prepare people for their first contact with Jobcentre Plus, especially if they have not claimed benefit for some time.</p>
	<p pid="c.552W.9/3">The Rapid Response Manager arranged to talk to 11 employees on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-19">19 February 2009</phrase>, supported by the Jobcentre Manager and a financial adviser.</p>
	<p pid="c.552W.9/4">We have established an excellent relationship with the company. They have been reducing gradually over the year, and they have contacted us each time they have been planning on making further reductions in staff to ask for the Rapid Response Scheme talks for the employees affected.</p>
	<p pid="c.552W.9/5">The company last contacted us on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-26">26 October 2009</phrase> to notify that 12 more people had been put under notice.

	<p pid="c.554W.5/2">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive, Mel Groves. I have asked him to reply to the hon. member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.554W.5/3" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="c.554W.5/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about what recent guidance has been issued to staff at Jobcentre Plus on assisting people diagnosed with autism into work. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.554W.5/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus policy is to develop its staff in the skills required to support a range of customers and to respect their individual needs, including those related autism. This approach ensures that they are equipped to deal with a diverse set of circumstances whilst treating customers as individuals. Skilled employment advisors look at the interaction between the person, the job and the person&#146;s ability. Advisors ensure that job goals relate to the person&#146;s abilities and that relevant solutions are identified in order to overcome any barriers a customer might face in a particular job.</p>
	<p pid="c.554W.5/6" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus advisors are introduced to &#147;guide notes&#148; as part of their training, which include background information on a number of conditions, including autism, the implications for interviews and how to use questioning techniques in order to support customers. Disability Employment Advisors focus on customers that need more extensive support and receive further levels of skills training appropriate to their customers, including skills practice in interviewing an autistic person to drive home learning points.</p>
	<p pid="c.554W.5/7" class="indent">In May 2009, Jobcentre Plus advisors were issued with a reminder, specifically about the information on autism that is held on our intranet site, to help reinforce the learning they have already undertaken to assist people with autism into work. Advisors were also reminded that Access to Work may be able to support autistic customers who are starting a job, by providing a job coach for a short period, or autism awareness training to the customer&#146;s colleagues. We are currently reviewing how Access to Work support can be improved and any resulting changes will benefit autistic people.</p>
	<p pid="c.554W.5/8" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has also recently engaged with two autism telephone tutorials held by the Employers Forum on Disability. The events were publicised on our business intranet site. Staff were encouraged to participate and actively did so. Events such as these help to develop an even greater understanding of autism and the issues related to employment.</p>

	<p pid="c.555W.2/2">We are fully committed to supporting disabled people, including those diagnosed with autism, to find suitable, sustainable work.</p>
	<p pid="c.555W.2/3">Disability employment advisors can advise a customer about suitable job opportunities and specialised support available to disabled people. If necessary they can also advocate on a customer&#146;s behalf (by negotiating with employers), refer customers for an occupational health assessment, and use the professional expertise of work psychologists, who specialise in working with disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="c.555W.2/4">Disability employment advisors also have the discretion to use job introduction scheme funding in situations where a disabled applicant is considered suitable for a post, but the employer has genuine doubts about the individual&#146;s ability to cope with the proposed job or place of work. The job introduction scheme can provide a grant to the employer towards the employment costs incurred during the first weeks of employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.555W.2/5">Jobcentre Plus has a number of specialist programmes that help disabled people move into paid work, some of which are only accessible through disability employment advisors. These programmes include work preparation, residential training and Workstep (a programme of supported employment).</p>
	<p pid="c.555W.2/6">Disabled people going into paid work may also be able to benefit from access to work, which provides practical advice and support to disabled people and their employers to help overcome work related obstacles resulting from disability. Access to work provides a system of grants which contribute towards the cost of providing support, such as a job coach for a short period to help settle an autistic customer into work. Support can also be given to the customer in the form of awareness training on autism which can be delivered to the customer&#146;s colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="c.555W.2/7">Jobcentre Plus staff are also provided with training in the skills required to manage a range of behaviours demonstrated by customers, covering a variety of health conditions. This approach ensures that they are equipped to deal with diverse circumstances while treating customers as individuals. Advisors look at the interaction between the person, the job and an individual&#146;s ability and ensure that job goals relate to the customer&#146;s abilities and that work solutions are sought to overcome any challenges a customer might face in a particular job.</p>

	<p pid="c.560W.2/16">We did not include incapacity benefit in the published average actual clearance time target in 2009-10 because the introduction of the new employment and support allowance meant the volumes of new incapacity benefit claims represented a diminishing aspect of our business delivery.</p>
	<p pid="c.560W.2/17">We did not include employment and support allowance in the published average actual clearance time targets for 2009-10 because it is a new benefit with no historical management information that could be used to inform a target level.

	<p pid="c.561W.0/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.561W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="c.561W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking which Jobcentre Plus offices closed in each of the last six years are under consideration for reopening. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.561W.0/4" class="indent">I have provided this information at Annex A.</p>
	<p pid="c.561W.0/5" class="indent">Since April 2002, when Jobcentre Plus was created by the merger of the former Employment Service and Benefits Agency, Jobcentre Plus has continued to refocus and transform the way it delivers its services. These transformation programmes have improved the quality and breadth of customer service, as well as the environment in which it is delivered. Customers no longer have to go to two separate offices&#151;often on the same High Street&#151;to receive help with both benefits and jobsearch. This has allowed us to rationalise our estate to provide excellent High Street coverage and a single, integrated customer facing office, at the same time reducing cost to the tax payer.</p>
	<p pid="c.561W.0/6" class="indent">Our approach to closure of a customer-facing Jobcentre is one that takes into account a range of issues, for example, the impact closure may have on customer service, and whether the work and staff can be relocated. When we are looking to withdraw our services from a location we are committed to full consultation with our customers, partner organisations, Trade Unions, staff, and local Members of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.561W.0/7" class="indent">The great majority of our services (in common with most large, modern organisations) are now delivered through the telephone and internet. For example, to give customers more convenient access we have around half-a-million vacancies on-line at any time (our website receives close to one million job searches every working day), and new claims to benefit are predominantly taken by telephone with some taken on-line. However, Jobcentres continue to provide an essential service&#151;especially to those customers most in need of tailored help.</p>
	<p pid="c.561W.0/8" class="indent">In addition to our network of modernised Jobcentres, we aim to make our services accessible to customers by providing a range of support through outreach, often delivering advisory and other support on Partner's premises. That is particularly important in locations where maintaining a Jobcentre could not be justified. Typically, such services can be delivered in partnership with Children&#146;s Centres, or on Local Authority premises, or in conjunction with one of our Welfare to Work Providers.</p>
	<p pid="c.561W.0/9" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus Customer Service Directors have reviewed their existing service delivery arrangements in meeting the challenge of the current economic climate, taking into account the planned welfare reform changes for the next two to three years. This review took into account the latest known information on the expected increase in business and customer volumes. This exercise has identified that some Jobcentre Plus offices currently face capacity pressures. These pressures will be met through a range of solutions.</p>
	<p pid="c.561W.0/10" class="indent">We have embarked on a programme of converting or extending our existing buildings where necessary, and widening our network of outreach facilities to make our services more accessible to customers. We are supplementing these measures by operating extended opening hours in some locations where the need for this is identified locally. This includes some offices opening to the public on Saturday.</p>
	<p pid="c.561W.0/11" class="indent">This programme is primarily focused on those buildings where we provide a face to face service for members of the public, but we are also implementing solutions across our network of Benefit Delivery Centres and Contact Centres to ensure they are equipped to meet any capacity challenge.</p>
	<p pid="c.561W.0/12" class="indent">The vast majority of sites affected have sufficient internal space which could be made available to enable capacity increases. The work to be carried out is of a temporary nature to ensure Jobcentre Plus has the flexibility to review the estate requirement in future.</p>
	<p pid="c.561W.0/13" class="indent">We only acquire new temporary space where all other measures are insufficient and Jobcentre Plus presence in these buildings will be clearly badged as temporary facilities. The sites listed in Annex A are being considered for temporary reoccupation because no suitable alternatives exist.</p>

This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.562W.5/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is committed to supporting disabled people, including people with autism. To help staff understand and meet the needs of disabled customers, training is provided which promotes a whole team approach. Diversity and Equality Awareness for Excellent Customer Service is part of the foundation learning and provides staff with a general awareness of disability, disability issues and the responsibilities of Jobcentre Plus. It also provides an understanding of specialists such as Disability Employment Advisors, Incapacity Benefit Personal Advisors, Work Psychologists and Access to Work Advisors. This allows staff to access guidance and make appropriate referrals and also ensures customers receive a supportive, streamlined and professional service.</p>
	<p pid="c.562W.5/5" class="indent">The learning programme for Jobcentre Plus Advisors raises awareness of a customer's personal circumstances and the impact this may have on their ability to move into sustainable employment. Advisors are signposted to guidance which includes background information on a number of conditions, the implications for interviews and how to use questioning techniques in order to support customers. The performance of advisors is measured through the regular completion of the Quality Assessment Framework during interviews. Advisors explore the customer's situation and circumstances as they relate to the world of work, identify any specialist support required and, where appropriate, advocate on behalf of the customer or seek additional support from specialist colleagues or external partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.562W.5/6" class="indent">All Jobcentres have access to Disability Employment Advisors, who focus on customers who need more extensive support. They receive further training (which includes practice interviewing customers with autism), and can seek help from Work Psychologists to assist them in supporting customers.</p>
	<p pid="c.562W.5/7" class="indent">The Employers' Forum on Disability has been running telephone tutorials on autism and in order to encourage staff to take advantage of this learning opportunity these events were publicised on the Jobcentre Plus intranet site (the organisation's mainstream communication method). Such training helps staff develop an even greater understanding of autism and the issues related to employment.</p>

	<p pid="c.563W.2/2"><i> </i>Jobcentre Plus is equipped to offer advice to everyone who is looking for work. While most people find work relatively quickly and need only a little support from Jobcentre Plus others will require far more help. This is provided through a structured process of regular jobsearch reviews and support from our personal advisers on opportunities to help overcome things that may be making it harder to find work.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.2/3">As part of this, we have enhanced the package of support provided to people with extra support prior to redundancy, when they are newly unemployed, and at the six and 12 month points of their claim including a subsidy for employers, voluntary work and help to set up a business. For customers facing redundancy we have increased funding for the Rapid Response Service which is delivered in conjunction with partner organisations in Coventry and Warwickshire. This ensures that local resources are clearly targeted and includes areas such as skills assessments and short training as well as jobsearch programmes to help people move quickly into employment and training.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.2/4">To coincide with the national launch of &#147;Backing Young Britain&#148; in July this year Jobcentre Plus in Coventry engaged with 25 key local employers, partners and stakeholders to secure their personal commitment to offering jobs, apprenticeships, work trials, work experience, internships and mentoring advice. We have also launched the Future Jobs Fund, worth around &#163;1 billion, which aims to create at least 100,000 new jobs for those aged 18-24 nationally. A further 50,000 jobs will be created in areas of high unemployment and all customers, irrespective of their age, will be eligible.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.2/5">In Coventry 29 per cent. of jobseeker&#146;s allowance customers are aged between 18-24 years old. There have been a wide range of organisations from the public, private and voluntary sectors who have made successful bids. To date approximately 8,000 jobs have been identified in the West Midlands.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.2/6">In October 2009, we also introduced the flexible new deal. The flexible new deal is delivered by contracted service providers working in partnership with Jobcentre Plus. In Coventry and Warwickshire these are Serco and Pertemps.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.2/7">Within the 12 months of starting on flexible new deal, jobseekers will undertake a minimum of four weeks of either full-time employment or continuous mandatory full time work-related activity. Jobcentre Plus will deliver early stages of the regime (before customers are referred to a provider), pay benefits and maintain contact with the customer through fortnightly signing. The flexible new deal gives providers the flexibility to deliver a more personalised and tailored service to the individual employment and skills needs of long-term jobseekers.</p>
	<p pid="c.563W.2/8">Jobcentre Plus in Coventry is working closely with a range of employers in both the public and private sectors in securing local employment partnerships (LEPS). LEPs are a key tool in supporting people from disadvantaged communities back into work. Jobcentre Plus work closely with customers, employers and partners to tailor a programme to ensure that individuals are job ready. Coventry city council is one of the leading public sector LEP recruiters and the HSBC processing centre in Coventry recently won the West Midlands 2009 LEP &#147;Unlocking Talent&#148; award.</p>

	<p pid="c.566W.2/1">There are a number of ways in which someone receiving jobseeker&#146;s allowance can undertake work experience.</p>
	<p pid="c.566W.2/2">As part of the Backing Young Britain measures announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-29">29 July 2009</phrase>, we will be introducing arrangements early next year to make two-week work experience opportunities available to jobseekers aged 18 to 21 who have been on jobseeker&#146;s allowance for three months. They will remain entitled to jobseeker&#146;s allowance. We also committed as part of Backing Young Britain to increase the number of graduate and non-graduate internships available to young people, with 10,000 internship and work experience opportunities for non-graduates, and a total of 20,000 graduate internships.</p>
	<p pid="c.566W.2/3">The Budget announced a guaranteed offer of a job, work-focused training, or meaningful activity to all 18 to 24-year-olds before they have reached the 12 month stage of their claim to jobseeker&#146;s allowance. The substantial new work experience opportunity will be available through the introduction of the Community Task Force, in early 2010. Under the Six-Month Offer in place since April 2009 for all jobseekers reaching six months receipt of jobseeker&#146;s allowance there is a voluntary work placement option.</p>
	<p pid="c.566W.2/4">Under the mandatory New Deals and Flexible New Deal work experience is part of the activity that all jobseekers must undertake at the appointed stage of their claim. For those aged 18 to 24 entering New Deal for Young People mandatory work experience will begin after 10 months of unemployment. For those entering New Deal 25 Plus mandatory work experience commences after about 21 months. In Flexible New Deal there is no age distinction and work experience can begin at the outset of the provision as part of personalised support.</p>
	<p pid="c.566W.2/5">Jobseeker&#146;s allowance is normally payable to people aged 18 and over, up to state pension age. In exceptional circumstances, people aged 16 and 17 may receive jobseeker&#146;s allowance but along with other young people aged 16 to 19 they will usually be supported by Connexions in England and its equivalents in Scotland and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="c.566W.5/1">The preferred method for reporting on the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance is the Jobcentre Plus Administrative System, which provides the source for the official claimant count figures published by the Office for National Statistics each month in the Labour Market Statistical Bulletin. This shows that in September 2009 there were 490,800 18 to 24-year-olds claiming jobseeker's allowance in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.566W.5/2">Administrative records do not contain information on the claimants' employment history. The available information about those jobseeker's allowance claimants who have never worked is contained in the Labour Force Survey; the April-June 2009 survey shows that 30 per cent. of 16 to 23-year-olds claiming jobseeker's allowance had never had a paid job. Of these, a small number, about 3 per cent. were in full-time education.</p>
	<p pid="c.566W.5/3">In addition, further analysis shows that the majority of this group who have never worked are concentrated towards the younger ages within the range. Two-thirds of the 16 to 23-year-olds claiming JSA who have never had a paid job are 20-years-old or younger.</p>
	<p pid="c.566W.5/4">Information is not available on those who have never had a full-time job, or those who have not worked for more than six months since reaching the age of 18.</p>

	<p pid="c.566W.8/2">Through Local Employment Partnerships, over 330,000 people have moved into work with over 40,000 employers since September 2007. Local Employment Partnerships are agreements between the Government through Jobcentre Plus and its partners to work with employers to help all those disadvantaged in the labour market move from benefit into work. Jobcentre Plus uses specific initiatives to support disadvantaged people move into and stay in work including Age Positive for older workers and Access to Work for people with a health condition. We will shortly pilot extra support for problem drug users.</p>

	<p pid="c.567W.14/2">DWP has an ongoing programme of performance monitoring and improvement activity and in addition, the quality of services will be monitored through external inspection of the Flexible New Deal supplier (Ofsted in England, Estyn in Wales and HMIe in Scotland).

	<p pid="c.567W.14/3">In 10 of the 14 Flexible New Deal areas, two suppliers are contracted to deliver Flexible New Deal services to customers. From October 2010 customers will have the right to choose the supplier offering the service best suited to their needs, using information about the support available and performance ratings of the Flexible New Deal suppliers. From April 2011, better performing providers in customer choice areas could gain market share.</p>
	<p pid="c.567W.14/4">The funding system is performance based, with the majority of the contract value allocated for outcome payments to the supplier when a jobseeker enters work that lasts 13 weeks and then again at 26 weeks.

DWP believes that this provides the correct balance between supplier incentives and value for money. After a person has been employed for 26 out of the previous 30 weeks they are more likely to remain in a job in the longer term.</p>

	<p pid="c.568W.5/2">The Flexible New Deal service started in Phase One areas in October. To bridge the gap for existing jobseeker&#146;s allowance customers at April 2009, and take account of the former New Deal 25 Plus customers in these areas being referred to Flexible New Deal providers earlier, revised contractual arrangements were agreed with existing New Deal (including Private Sector-led) and Employment Zone providers.</p>
	<p pid="c.568W.5/3">Due to these changes some of the former New Deal 25 Plus customers in these areas who did not start with the New Deal provider will have been unemployed for more than 12 months by the time they are referred to the provider under the Flexible New Deal. However they will have also received more intensive support from Jobcentre Plus personal advisers for a period of six months.</p>
	<p pid="c.568W.5/4">All new jobseeker&#146;s allowance customers will be referred to the Flexible New Deal providers on reaching 12 months unemployment, or earlier in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.568W.5/5">For customers in Flexible New Deal Phase Two areas, existing New Deal and Employment Zone contracts will continue. They will have access to the additional support for jobseekers at six months. Some customers may also be able to access additional support under the Young Persons Guarantee provision. Customers over age 25 will receive support from Jobcentre Plus until they become eligible for the existing New Deal 25 Plus when they have been receiving jobseeker&#146;s allowance for 18 months.</p>

	<p pid="c.571W.5/1">Under the Six Month Offer, there are two elements to the help on offer to people who want to move into self-employment or start a business. To provide financial support during the early weeks of trading, customers can claim a self-employment credit paid at a rate of &#163;50 a week for up to 16 weeks. This is payable once the customer ceases claiming jobseeker's allowance and takes up self-employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.571W.5/2">We are also giving additional funds to Business Link Providers in England, Flexible Support for Business in Wales, and Training for Work in Scotland to provide intensive self-employment and business start-up support and advice for those who need it before they leave benefit. This help can extend into the first weeks of trading, if required.</p>
	<p pid="c.571W.5/3">The Six Month Offer does not provide capital grants to help with initial business start-up costs. However, as with any other person setting up a new business, those eligible for the Six Month Offer will be able to apply for the relevant grants that are available in each country. For example, in England, decisions about what business support is available in each region is decided by the regional development agencies. The full range of publicly funded support in England can be found in the Solutions for Business portfolio on the Business Link website.</p>

	<p pid="c.579W.2/1">Jobcentre Plus has recruited 140 new staff in Lanarkshire and East Dunbartonshire district on fixed term appointments to deal with the rising number of customers claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance and to support these customers back into work as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.579W.2/2">In addition, we have quadrupled the funds for the Rapid Response Service from &#163;3 million in 2008-09 to &#163;6 million and to &#163;12 million in 2009-10 and 2010-11, extending the service into all areas affected by large scale redundancies or cumulative redundancies.</p>
	<p pid="c.579W.2/3">Jobcentre Plus offers pre-unemployment assistance and Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) redundancy support. Lanarkshire has been heavily hit by redundancies and there have been numerous companies supported from February 2008 to date, including 16 companies in July and August alone.</p>
	<p pid="c.579W.2/4">For the newly unemployed, we have significantly increased funding to maintain and increase support through Jobcentre Plus. As well as help and advice to find a new job and access to thousands of vacancies, the newly unemployed now have access to help to meet expenses involved in finding work through the Adviser Discretionary Fund and help to find work through local employment partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="c.579W.2/5">Everyone reaching six months unemployed from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April</phrase> onwards will receive significant extra support from Jobcentre Plus employment advisers.</p>
	<p pid="c.579W.2/6">This new package of support will involve extended meetings every four weeks or so to discuss the best strategies for finding work, including access to recruitment subsidies, new training places, volunteering and help to take up self-employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.579W.2/7">The six-month-unemployed employer subsidy of &#163;1,000 is designed to help improve the job prospects of customers who have been claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance for six months or more. All eligible customers in the constituency area are being issued with the employer subsidy voucher to self-market at any interviews they may attend. Employers are being marketed extensively to alert them to the Recruitment Subsidy which, for eligible customers, attracts further funding for training.</p>
	<p pid="c.579W.2/8">Flexible new deal was launched in Lanarkshire and East Dunbartonshire on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-05">5 October</phrase>. Flexible new deal is designed to ensure a unified approach for all jobseekers, whatever their age, skills or barriers to work. At the 12 month stage of unemployment customers receive more flexible and personalised help, which is delivered by contracted providers, dependent on customer needs and local labour market requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.579W.2/9">The &#163;1 billion Future Jobs Fund, part of the Young Persons Guarantee announced in the Budget, will create new jobs for the long-term unemployed, particularly young adults and those in unemployment hotspots. This initiative will create 150,000 jobs of which 100,000 are targeted at young adults and 50,000 focused on unemployment hotspots.</p>
	<p pid="c.579W.2/10">While there are no specific bids to the fund for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill constituency, North Lanarkshire council was successful in a bid that will create 1,080 jobs, of which 390 jobs are being created between October 2009 and March 2010. This includes jobs in Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill constituency. National bids will also create additional jobs in this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.579W.2/11">In September we announced the Backing Young Britain campaign, &#163;40 million of funding for new internships and work placements for graduates and 10,000 places for non-graduates, a new mentoring network to help young people find their feet in a tough jobs market and more help from day one of unemployment through job clubs and one to one support. Business, charities and public sector employers are being called upon to join the 280 organisations already signed up to the Backing Young Britain campaign.</p>
	<p pid="c.579W.2/12">There are a wide range of training courses (including part time and evening study) available from Jobcentre Plus, local colleges and other providers. Training will be focussed to meet both the individual's work aspirations and the needs of the local job market.</p>

	<p pid="c.581W.2/1">In the Lanarkshire and East Dunbartonshire area we have received 200 applications for help from the Rapid Response Fund to provide additional training and education support by way of skills analysis and job focused training. Of these, 90 people have been helped since April 2009 and we are currently processing the remaining applications.</p>
	<p pid="c.581W.2/2">In Lanarkshire we expect to have approximately 110-150 vacancies each month in the first six months of the Future Jobs Fund. The Future Jobs Fund is a part of the Young Person&#146;s Guarantee and from early 2010, everyone between the ages of 18 and 24 who has been looking for work for a year will get an offer of a job, work experience, or training lasting at least six months. We are currently advertising 136 Future Jobs Fund vacancies across Lanarkshire to 18 to 24-year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="c.581W.2/3">In addition to helping young people, the Future Jobs Fund can also help in unemployment hotspots. In the first round of bids for Future Jobs Fund, North Lanarkshire council, which covers the constituency area and further, has guaranteed 440 jobs, 90 of which are targeted to unemployment hotspot areas and therefore are open to people in those areas aged 25 plus. Looking ahead to 2011, a further 119 jobs will be made available to unemployment hot spot areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.581W.2/4">Overall responsibility for adult training in Scotland rests with the Scottish Government and is delivered by Skills Development Scotland is ongoing under Work Focused Training with local colleges and Skills Development Scotland to develop job focused training relevant to the local labour market. Jobcentre Plus in Lanarkshire and East Dunbartonshire has an excellent working relationship with Skills Development Scotland. We work together to ensure that the budget for this operational year is focused on providing the right training to assist our customers to secure employment.</p>
	<p pid="c.581W.2/5">The Community Taskforce is due for launch early 2010. Tenders to deliver this work will be assessed in November. This will involve 13 week work placements for 18 to 24-year-olds, aimed at enhancing their skills and experience.</p>
	<p pid="c.581W.2/6">Excellent partnership arrangements have been set up across Lanarkshire through the group Routes to Inclusion. Members of the group include officials from the two local authorities, Jobcentre Plus, local colleges, NHS and Skills Development Scotland. Jobcentre Plus is chair of this group and the agenda is focused on helping people back to work and making the most of funding that is available.</p>

	<p pid="c.594W.9/1">Advantage West Midlands (AWM) has made a number of interventions to support the economy of Herefordshire in the short, medium and longer terms. The investment by AWM in land and property projects in Herefordshire to date has been &#163;34 million, which is expected to generate about &#163;476 million GVA over 10-years. Its investment in market towns and similar activity in the area over the last three years has been &#163;5.2 million, which is expected to generate about &#163;20 million GVA over three years. The impact of initiatives in a particular year is hard to assess since it takes time for projects realise their full effect. However based on these overall figures, AWM's support is expected to generate an additional &#163;54 million GVA for the Herefordshire economy in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.594W.9/2">Examples of investment activity in Herefordshire include:</p>
	<p pid="c.594W.9/3" class="indent">Supporting a comprehensive programme of employment land supply across the county including Leominster Enterprise Park; Rotherwas Industrial Estate; the development of Model Farm at Ross on Wye, and employment land at Tenbury, just outside the northern boundary of the county.</p>
	<p pid="c.594W.9/4" class="indent">Supporting the Edgar Street Grid initiative with a &#163;20 million investment to provide infrastructure to enable the redevelopment of this 40 hectare area just north of Hereford city centre. This is expected to deliver 1,400 net new jobs and 1,000 new homes.</p>
	<p pid="c.594W.9/5" class="indent">Supporting interventions that provide an immediate benefit to counter the impact of the recession including tailored support to the retail secto; further support to the Wheels to Work initiative to enable people to access work or training; support to Citizens Advice Bureaux; and funds to support events and festivals during the summer of 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.594W.9/6" class="indent">Funding for the Rural Regeneration Zone, which provides tailored support to business, communities and social enterprises, reflecting the unique character of Herefordshire.</p>

The estimate covers not only &#145;traditional&#146; environmental goods and service sectors and renewable energy technologies, but also emerging low-carbon areas such as carbon finance, alternative fuels, building technologies and energy management. This deliberately broad definition encompasses the far reaching nature of the sector and includes the associated supply chain activity.</p>

This can include work to improve processes to reduce or eliminate the creation of waste or to reduce costs through the use of recycled materials.
