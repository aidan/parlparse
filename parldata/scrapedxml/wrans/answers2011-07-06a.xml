	<p pid="a.1216W.3/1">The Office for Security and Counter Terrorism (OSCT) commissioned two evaluations of Prevent funded initiatives in 2008. One was of the processes and procedures of community intervention projects. This covered financial and business management, governance, methodology and activities. It was not an evaluation of the impact or the effectiveness of interventions in preventing radicalisation but the results were used to inform decision making about the continuation of funding to projects. The second was a process evaluation of Channel, undertaken on behalf of OSCT by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) The results of this evaluation contributed to the national Channel guidance published in March 2010.

We therefore have no plans to make any changes to the current arrangements that allow for the exportability and up-rating of UK State Pensions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1227W.8/1">We need to act quickly to reduce the increasing costs imposed on the state pension system by the increases in longevity. Since the 2004 based projections which the Pensions Commission used life expectancy projections for people reaching 65 have been revised upwards by a year and a half.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.8/2">It has not been possible to give a notice period similar to those given for previous increases in state pension age. Under the new timetable in the Pensions Bill, the increase from 63 to 65 in women's state pension age will not start until April 2016 and no one will have a state pension age of 66 until 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.1227W.8/3">If we were to give at least 15 years' notice as recommended by the Pensions Commission in their second report, &#8220;A New Pension Settlement for the Twenty-First Century&#8221;, this would mean not changing the state pension age until 2025.</p>

	<p pid="a.1237W.2/1">The Department for Transport has received a number of representations from one car rental company.</p>
	<p pid="a.1237W.2/2">Currently, if a vehicle has been parked on private land, and a contract has been created, that contract is between the driver at the time and the landowner (or their agent). The proposed provisions in the Protection of Freedoms Bill mean that the vehicle keeper should pay the parking-related charge if they were the driver at the time. If they were not the driver at the time they may give the name and address of the driver to the landowner or their agent for them to pursue payment from the driver. This would apply equally to any vehicle keeper, whether a car rental company or private owner.</p>

	<p pid="a.1249W.9/1">English Heritage has recently launched the National Heritage Protection Plan, which sets out why, what and how England's vulnerable historic environment is to be safeguarded in the next four years. Developed in consultation with a wide range of partners, it shows where the threats are the greatest and will help English Heritage to prioritise its work. It will also help other heritage professionals and volunteers to contribute to the business of managing England's heritage. This Department and English Heritage are also considering various measures to tackle the problem of buildings which have been on the Heritage At Risk Register for an extended period of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1249W.9/2">English Heritage offered over &#163;400,000 to projects in Kent in 2009-10 under its two main grant programmes. English Heritage grant-aid has helped preserve important heritage sites at Shurland Hall, Sheppey, the No 1 Smithery at Chatham Historic Dockyard and at Westenhanger Castle in Folkestone. Survey work on the Hoo Peninsula undertaken by English Heritage is extending understanding and protection to a little-studied landscape under considerable pressure for change. In Margate, Dover, Gravesend and the Medway towns, a number of heritage assets have been assessed for statutory designation in a series of Defined Area Surveys (some of which are ongoing), resulting in a number of newly listed buildings and scheduled monuments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1253W.0/1">No specific assessment has been made of the impact of allocating Band HE spectrum for local DAB on FM stations which occupy Band II. However, we note that the vast majority of FM stations are simulcast on local DAB, providing these stations with the potential for greater coverage and improved reception and functionality for listeners. In 2010 the Government launched the Digital Radio Action Plan to consider the case for a radio switchover which would, if implemented, allow for the re-allocation of much of the Band II spectrum currently used for radio for other purposes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1253W.4/1">Sunderland city council is responsible for the day to day cleanliness of its beaches. The Environment Agency (EA) and Sunderland city council have completed surveys of the beaches that found very little evidence of any significant pollution. Occasionally small amounts of sewage-related debris are found from storm sewage overflows. This is a minor problem and appropriate clean-ups are carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.1253W.4/2">The EA monitors the quality of bathing water throughout the bathing season from May to September. Since 1995, Sunderland's designated bathing waters have always met the &#8216;mandatory&#8217; bathing water quality standard under the Bathing Waters Directive. In eight of the last ten years they have also met the higher &#8216;excellent&#8217; standard. These are very good results for bathing waters so close to a large urban area, and demonstrate that the sewerage systems put in place to protect the water quality are performing well.</p>
	<p pid="a.1253W.4/3">The EA has compared the bathing water results to the tighter standards in the revised Bathing Water Directive, which comes into force in 2015. This predicts that designated bathing waters in the area will meet the &#8216;good&#8217; or &#8216;excellent&#8217; standards, which is over and above the &#8216;sufficient&#8217; standard required. The EA will continue to monitor to ensure that this remains the case.</p>

The information provided by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) today may include data on routine information requests that are not included in the Ministry of Justice's published statistics on Freedom of Information implementation in central Government, so there may be slight variations between the Ministry of Justice's figures on overall requests, and those of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>

However, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has checked its records and is able to provide figures for requests where the requestor has been readily identifiable as a Member of Parliament, or from the office of an MP or which have been sent by an MP on behalf of a constituent.

	<p pid="a.1273W.6/1">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) collects information on suspected side effects to vaccines and medicines via the Yellow Card Scheme. Since the Cervarix (human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine) immunisation programme began in September 2008, the MHRA has received 5,479 reports of suspected side effects up to <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-29">29 June 2011</phrase> (this includes reports in which the brand of HPV vaccine was not specified). This follows administration of more than five million doses of Cervarix across the United Kingdom to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.1273W.6/2">Yellow Card reports relate to &#8216;suspicions&#8217; that a side effect may have occurred. They may relate to true side effects, or they may be due to coincidental illness. As reports are not necessarily proof that a vaccine or medicine was a cause of the reported illness, the data cannot be used to estimate the true frequency of side effects to the vaccine. The frequency of known side effects from clinical trials is listed in the available product information.</p>
	<p pid="a.1273W.6/3">As with all vaccines and medicines, the MHRA keeps the safety of Cervarix under continual review. The benefits of Cervarix vaccine in protecting against cervical cancer far outweigh any known side effects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1273W.6/4">When the Cervarix immunisation programme began in the UK, the MHRA implemented proactive, real-time safety surveillance. This involved daily review of all suspected side effect reports and an epidemiological approach to detection and evaluation of any new safety &#8216;signals&#8217;. This included review of data from other countries using the vaccine. MHRA published weekly updates on this surveillance via its website as well as summaries in the Drug Safety Update bulletin April 2009, October 2009 and October 2010:</p>

	<p pid="a.1273W.6/6">After the second year of the immunisation programme, the MHRA sought independent expert advice from the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) on the safety experience. This followed administration of more than 4.5 million doses of vaccine in the UK up to July 2010. CHM advised that no serious new risks have been identified in association with Cervarix and the balance of risks and benefits of the vaccine remains positive. A detailed safety assessment was published on the MHRA website in October 2010 at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1275W.0/3">Following the provision of the NICE guidance on the treatment of depression in October 2009, the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme now offers five therapies for the treatment of depression at step three of the stepped care model (moderate to severe).

	<p pid="a.1275W.0/11">The NHS Choices website also provides the opportunity for patients and service users to provide comments and rate health services. This includes mental health services. Service users can provide an overall rating of care; specific ratings of issues including cleanliness, dignity and involvement in decisions; and free text comments. In addition patient comment providers such as Patient Opinion give patients the opportunity to comment through an independent route if they choose.</p>

	<p pid="a.1276W.5/1">Clinical trials submitted by the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) for Ritalin (methylphenidate) were evaluated at the time of licensing to ensure that it met appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy to support its use in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.5/2">Since the marketing of Ritalin, the independent scientific advisory committee, the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) and the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have kept its safety under close review. As new data have emerged, product information for prescribers and patients has been updated and advice has been issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.5/3">In June 2007, the MHRA led a European review of the risks and benefits of Ritalin and sought advice from the CHM and an expert working group whose membership included those with expertise in child and adolescent psychiatry. This European review was requested by the European Commission following concerns over the safety of methylphenidate, particularly the possible risk of cardiovascular disorders (problems affecting the heart and blood vessels) and cerebrovascular disorders (problems affecting the blood vessels in the brain).</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.5/4">The review considered the available data on efficacy and safety and concluded that the benefits of methylphenidate-containing medicines continue to outweigh their risks, when used in their approved indication for children aged six years or over and adolescents with ADHD, as part of a comprehensive treatment programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.5/5">The conclusions of this review were communicated to health care professionals in March 2009 through the MHRA's monthly drug safety bulletin, Drug Safety Update.</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.5/6">The product information of all methylphenidate-containing medicines authorised across Europe, including the patient information leaflets, has been updated to ensure it contains clear, comprehensive information about the effects of methylphenidate and the importance of monitoring children and adolescents throughout their treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.5/7">Following this, surveillance measures to review the safety of Ritalin continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.5/8">The MAH for Ritalin has been asked to conduct studies to further characterise the safety of methylphenidate, particularly the long-term safety. The information from the ongoing studies will be evaluated as soon as it becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1276W.5/9">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has also published a technology appraisal on methylphenidate, atomoxetine and dexamfetamine (2006) and are following up with recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD (2008).</p>

	<p pid="a.1279W.2/3">However, we recognise that badly-designed regulation and red tape can have a particularly damaging effect on our smallest businesses. In &#8216;The Plan for Growth&#8217;, published alongside the Budget 2011, as part of a package of measures to improve the UK's regulatory environment, the Government announced that micro-businesses (those with fewer than 10 employees) and start-ups would be exempt from all new domestic regulation for three years. We also decided not to extend the Right to Request Time to Train to SMEs, potentially saving SMEs approximately &#163;350 million and not to bring forward the Dual Discrimination provision, saving business up to &#163;3 million per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1279W.2/4">Last month, the Prime Minister launched the Red Tape Challenge website:</p>
	<p pid="a.1279W.2/5"><a href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk">www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="a.1279W.2/6">which asks the public and businesses to identify regulations that need to be amended or removed. Every few weeks regulations affecting one specific sector or industry will be published on the website. There is also the opportunity to comment on cross-cutting areas of regulation, such as employment law.</p>
	<p pid="a.1279W.2/7">I believe that businesses in the hon. Member&#8217;s constituency will feel the benefit of these policies in the months and years ahead, as our ambitious reducing regulation agenda makes a positive difference to the UK's business environment.</p>

To protect the viability of institutions at risk, and with the agreement of the Information Commissioner, HEFCE releases information on institutions assessed to be at higher risk three years after the assessment was made. The most recent available information relates to November 2007, when there were six institutions in HEFCE's &#8216;at higher risk&#8217; category. The Government accepts the Public Accounts Committee's recent recommendation that this approach should be reviewed and will do this in the context of its forthcoming consultation on the future role of HEFCE.</p>

	<p pid="a.1284W.8/1">It is part of the routine business of Headquarters Land Forces (HQ LF) to plan and manage unit moves. For example, in September 2010 the Army completed the move of HQ Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) and its supporting elements from the Rhine Garrison to Innsworth, Gloucestershire. This move and other scheduled activities were planned before we completed the Strategic Defence and Security Review. Consequently, there is already a team in HQ LF which is carrying out the necessary work. Once we have concluded the basing study, this team will work with the Defence Infrastructure Organisation, UK Support Command (Germany) and the German authorities to develop and implement the larger draw-down plan.</p>

These include strategic intelligence, the strategic nuclear deterrent, defence against direct threats to the UK and its overseas territories, counter-terrorism and military aid to the civil authorities.

This review will be coherent with Lord Levene's Defence Reform recommendations and my forthcoming White Paper which I expect to publish later this year.

	<p pid="a.1291W.2/2">Fire services employed on the Ministry of Defence (MOD) estate have established plans that identify the respective roles and responsibilities of the MOD fire services and the local authority fire services in the event of fire incidents at Defence establishments. In support of the mutual co-operation and interoperability that already exists between these organisations Joint training and exercises are regularly undertaken, as are liaison visits to review risks and to ensure emergency responders maintain familiarity with the sites' facilities, hazards and operational procedures. These arrangements are in place at all Defence sites where MOD fire services are established, including research and storage facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1291W.2/3">Several local authority fire and rescue services responded to the fire at Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) on <phrase class="date" code="2010-08-03">3 August 2010</phrase>, including Royal Berkshire, Hampshire and the London fire brigade, as well as the AWE fire and rescue service and the Defence Fire Risk Management Organisation (DFRMO). DFRMO has investigated the fire and rescue services' operational response to the fire. Their report, which was published on the MOD website on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-09">9 June</phrase>, identifies a number of learning points and provides recommendations to rectify those shortfalls identified in the fire services' response to the fire incident. The DFRMO report can be accessed via the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.1291W.2/5">I have also placed a copy of the report in the Library of the House, along with the DFRMO report on their investigation into the cause of the fire.</p>
	<p pid="a.1291W.2/6">There have been no meetings between MOD Ministers and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) concerning the latter's investigation into the fire at the Atomic Weapons Establishment and none have been needed, although MOD officials with regulatory responsibilities meet routinely with the HSE and other relevant bodies as part of their duties.</p>

The resulting financial saving was not a factor in this decision, however we do expect to save some tens of millions of pounds over the next 10 years. This contributes to the overall &#163;1.2 billion of savings on the deterrent programme identified in the strategic defence and security review.</p>

	<p pid="a.1295W.2/2">Horizon scan a programme of activity analysing the accounts of suppliers considered to be critical to Government delivery for signs of financial distress, and working with suppliers at risk of bankruptcy to turn situations around. There were two FTEs assigned to this work in the centre, with ad hoc support from senior commercial leaders. This work was stopped as it was overtaken by a new supplier management strategy;</p>
	<p pid="a.1295W.2/3">The Operational Efficiency Programme reporting: There was never a costing of this, however it incurred significant manpower costs for all the 100 plus organisations that completed it, from several man days for a small organisation to an estimate of several hundred man days for the largest completing organisation. This was stopped because it was considered highly inefficient to deliver poor quality data;</p>
	<p pid="a.1295W.2/4">The CAF supplier reporting: A six monthly statistical survey of our key IT suppliers, focusing on delivery quality, cost and efficacy; and of their customers. The manpower in the centre to support this was around two FTEs. A decision was taken to suspend the CAF process while consideration was given to recent work on the crown commercial portfolio, and launch of an alternative if necessary later in the year;</p>
	<p pid="a.1295W.2/5">The Government CPO has cancelled the programme of PSPES data survey on public sector procurement spend providing expenditure details by supply market category of every significant central Government organisation. There were two FTEs centrally leading this work. This was stopped as plans are under way to collect procurement spend data in a more efficient and timely manner as part of ERG's Centralising Commodity Procurement programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1295W.2/6">The Government are committed to reducing statistical data collections as a way of reducing burdens and cost on all involved. There would be a disproportionate cost to accurately calculating what has been saved by stopping the collection of these data sets as work spanned across not just the Cabinet Office but resources across all central Government Departments involved in the completion of these exercises.</p>
