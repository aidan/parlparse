	<p pid="b.182W.5/1">I will answer the three questions together. Due to the passage of time which has elapsed since the events in question, it has not been possible to establish when communications passed between the CPS and the Law Officers, or their officials, about the case of Lotfi Raissi in 2001-02. Given the high profile and sensitive nature of the case, the Law Officers would have been kept informed and told promptly of any significant developments. The Law Officers were informed in September 2008 of the contents of the CPS report.</p>

	<p pid="b.185W.2/1">Since the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) was introduced in 2005, the timing of payments to English farmers has improved year on year. That progress continued under the 2009 scheme when over 80 per cent. of farmers received payment on the opening two days of the regulatory seven month payment window.</p>
	<p pid="b.185W.2/2">Regrettably, some farmers are paid after the end of the payment window, but only under the 2005 scheme has the amount concerned exceeded the 4 per cent. 'franchise' in EU regulations that triggers late payment penalties. The 4 per cent. franchise exists in acknowledgment that some claims are particularly complex or involve legal issues, such as probate, which take additional time to resolve. Payments made after the end of the payment window may have an impact on individuals' financial position, but the Department is not aware of any data that would identify specifically related cases of debt. In order to minimise any such impacts, the Rural Payments Agency will continue its efforts to make outstanding payments as early as possible and pay interest in lieu of compensation, above a deminimis of &#163;50, in cases where this is not possible until after the end of the payment window.</p>

	<p pid="b.190W.5/1">In July 2003 DEFRA published the 'Review of Existing Private Sewers and Drains in England and Wales' consultation paper that sought views on a range of strategic options to deal with the problems of private sewers. The Government published a response to this consultation in October 2004. 81 per cent. of stakeholders favoured a change of ownership, and of these, 90 per cent. held the view that sewerage undertakers should take over responsibility. DEFRA acknowledged the strength of support for this solution and undertook to look at it in more depth.</p>
	<p pid="b.190W.5/2">Subsequently, representatives of 50 stakeholder groups were invited to a private sewers seminar in January 2005. This included a workshop looking at the potential impacts on small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.190W.5/3">Because of the drainage industry's fragmented nature and the fact that no national body specifically represents the views of smaller drainage companies it has been particularly difficult to seek contractors' views. However, following the workshop DEFRA undertook a telephone survey of over 130 contractors to identify the potential impacts of any transfer on them. DEFRA has also included the Society of British Water and Wastewater Industries and the National Sewerage Association, together with the Enterprise Directorate (formerly the Small Business Service), on a stakeholder steering group. These organisations have consistently made representations about the potential impact of transfer on smaller drainage businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.190W.5/4">In February 2007 the Government published their decision paper and committed to consult on options for the implementation of transfer. A consultation paper on implementation options was published in July 2007, and Hilary Benn announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-15">15 December 2008</phrase> the Government's decision to proceed with transfer from 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.190W.5/5">Copies of the 2003 and 2007 consultation papers and the Government's 2004 response to the review were placed in the Library of the House on publication. A Summary of Responses to the 2007 Consultation on Implementation Options was published in March 2008 and is available from DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid="b.190W.5/6">Further consultation on the content of regulations to implement transfer will be published this winter and DEFRA continues to work closely with a range of interested stakeholders in developing proposals for implementation.</p>

	<p pid="b.191W.2/1">Legislation to enable water and sewerage companies in England and Wales to operate concessionary schemes for community premises for the purpose of surface water drainage charges was included in the Flood and Water Management Bill. This was presented to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-19">19 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.191W.2/2">Currently four of the 10 water and sewerage companies in England and Wales have switched to site area charging for surface water drainage for non-household customers. Most of the problems originally occurred with United Utilities and it is currently looking at options to ensure that community groups do not face unaffordable surface water drainage charges ahead of the Government's legislation being in place.</p>

For example, Cumbria Tourism has set up a helpline to provide advice to visitors (01539 825070) and web pages to detail events going ahead. This will be supported by a pre-Christmas marketing campaign. English Heritage has ensured that one of their Historic Buildings advisors is free to provide specialist advice: it is still too early to know the full extent of the damage or the scale of response required, but this will become clearer over the coming weeks.</p>

It was announced that this would be supplemented with an additional &#163;100,000 to support the national marketing campaign, noted above, led by Cumbria Tourism. NWDA has also placed adverts in national papers promoting tourism businesses in the area and the NWDA tourism marketing team is pursuing similar lines to promote tourism in Cumbria. This activity is all in addition to the ongoing funding of Cumbria Tourism which will receive core funding of &#163;1.4 million from NWDA in 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="b.197W.5/1">The Government have stated their intention to realise &#163;16 billion in disposals over the period 2011-14 and will publish further details of opportunities to commercialise business assets in the coming weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.5/2">The Department for Transport is considering a number of opportunities for asset sales. However, the timing of any sale is subject to market conditions being right.</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.5/3">Details on value cannot be released due to the need to protect the Department's position in future sale negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.5/4">Two high profile examples are Dartford Crossing and the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (HS1).</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.5/5" class="italic"> Dartford Crossing</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.5/6">The A282 Dartford Crossing comprises the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, which provides four southbound lanes, while two tunnels under the Thames provide a four-lane northbound facility. Use of the crossing is subject to a congestion charge in both directions paid at a plaza located to the south of the Thames.</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.5/7">The Department is working with HM Treasury and the Shareholder Executive to consider the commercial options for realising value for the taxpayer from the Dartford Crossing. No estimate of the saleable value of the Dartford Crossing has been made. Any such valuation would depend on the nature of any commercial agreements for a sale, including, but not exclusively, the length of those arrangements, the level of future charges and forecast future traffic volumes. The Department is planning to provide initial views from the analysis on future capacity options in early 2010. This will provide a basis for deciding which commercialisation option to pursue.</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.5/8">It is not possible to say when a sale might be finalised.</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.5/9" class="italic"> Channel Tunnel Rail Link-High Speed 1 (HS1)</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.5/10">High Speed 1 (formerly known as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link) is the high speed line which operates between St. Pancras International Station and the Channel Tunnel. It is operated by HS1 Ltd which is owned by London and Continental Railways (LCR).</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.5/11">The Department is currently engaged in a restructuring of London and Continental Railways. Following this, it is the Department's intention, as market conditions allow, to sell a long-term concession for High Speed 1 in such a way as to maximise value for money for the taxpayer. The Government would not wish to publish its estimate of the expected proceeds at this stage; to do so might condition the competitive sale process and damage value.</p>
	<p pid="b.197W.5/12">It is not possible to say when a sale might be finalised.</p>

	<p pid="b.198W.2/1">The revised standard instrument departure (SID) routings at London City airport were implemented in accordance with the independent airspace change process under which it is for the airspace change sponsor to develop and consult upon proposals. It is then for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the independent airspace regulator, to assess the proposals against regulatory requirements and either approve or reject the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.198W.2/2">The Terminal Control North (TC North) proposals, of which the London City SID changes originally formed a part, are a package of measures designed to reduce delay whilst maintaining safety and improving environmental performance in one of the most complex areas of airspace in the world. Following the outcome of last year's public consultation, NATS decided to review the TC North design options. However, the London City airport SID change element was aimed at meeting already established International Civil Aviation Organisation design standards. In the circumstances, the London City SID changes were removed from the TC North proposals and progressed as a stand alone proposal. The CAA considered that further consultation on the London City airport SID changes were not needed as they had already been included in the full TC North consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.204W.3/1">Service family accommodation (SFA) is assessed by Standard for Condition (SfC), an objective assessment of the physical condition of the property. Properties are rated from S1fC (the highest) to S4fC (the lowest). The Ministry of Defence (MOD) no longer allocates properties at S4fC, and no family is required to live in properties at S4fC other than by personal choice.</p>
	<p pid="b.204W.3/2">Properties at S3fC are only allocated where no other property is available. The MOD aims to have all UK SFA at Standard 1 or 2 for Condition by 2013, and all properties at S1fC by 2020. It is not possible to provide the information in the format requested, however, current SfC data for Scotland are provided in the following table:</p>
	<table>

	<p pid="b.204W.3/13">In addition, SFA is assessed by Grade for Charge (GfC), an assessment that sets the level of charges that families pay. This assessment takes into account not only the physical condition of the property but also environmental factors, such as noise and proximity to local amenities. It is therefore possible for SFA to have a high SfC assessment but a low GfC. Again, it is not possible to provide the information in the format requested, however SFA in Scotland is at the following GfC:</p>

	<p pid="b.205W.5/2">The letter explains that many of the veterans view recognition as more important than substantial compensation.

However, I can say that genuine negotiations have taken place between the parties respective counsels and a settlement proposal was made by the Ministry of Defence (although I cannot disclose the amount). To date, no response has been received from the claimants' counsel or the law firm representing them (Rosenblatts). This is obviously disappointing, but we remain open to meaningful discussions. In the meantime, we have been left with no option but to proceed with our appeal for which the High Court judge has given us permission.

	<p pid="b.206W.9/26">The Equipment Failure Reporting System (EFRS) is the mandated system for equipment users to report failures, such as accidental damage, maintenance related failures and breakdowns, or the failure of an item fitted to the vehicle. It does not incorporate the results of subsequent investigations and therefore does not differentiate between what might later prove to have been a problem caused by operator error or damage sustained as a result of operations. Nor do these dates record the severity of a failure which might have no discernible impact on operational capability or safety.</p>

However, the evidence is inconclusive as to whether the introduction of a minimum unit price would reduce alcohol related crime and disorder. While there is evidence that cheap alcohol is linked to people drinking more and subsequent harm to their health, it is important that any Government interventions reduce harm without impacting unduly on the majority of responsible drinkers. We will look to develop further the evidence base in this area with a view to identifying concrete proposals for action which reduce irresponsible, harmful and/or binge drinking without impacting unduly on the majority of responsible drinkers.</p>

	<p pid="b.216W.6/1">The Home Office has collected data on knife and sharp instrument offences since April 2007 via a special additional data collection. Data are therefore only available for two years. The data are collected at force level only, so data for North East Cambridgeshire are not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.6/2">In 2007-08, the data collection covered the following offences: attempted murder, GBH and robbery. The total number of offences involving the use of a knife/sharp instrument recorded by the police in England in 2007-08 was close to 24,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.6/3">In 2008-09, the collection was expanded to include threats to kill, ABH, rape and sexual assaults. Therefore, the figures between the two years are not comparable. The total number of offences involving the use of a knife or sharp instrument recorded by the police in England in 2008-09 was close to 35,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.6/4">There is a further reason why the figures are not fully comparable. Some forces in 2007-08 included, for technical reasons, a number of 'unbroken' bottle offences, which is outside the defined scope of the collection. For 2008-09, the majority of forces within England could supply data excluding unbroken bottles, with four Home Office forces still unable to remove them from their returns.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.6/5">These figures do not include homicide, as these are collected from the separate Homicide Index. In 2007-08, there were 259 knife or sharp instrument homicides in England. Figures for 2008-09 are pre-announced to be published on the <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-21">21 January 2010</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.217W.2/1">The National DNA Database (NDNAD) is an intelligence database which matches DNA found at crime scenes with DNA profiles of individuals. It also provides police with potential leads on the identity of an offender. An individual may have their DNA profile loaded onto the NDNAD if they have been arrested for a recordable offence or if they have volunteered their DNA to assist in a criminal investigation and also provided separate written consent for the resulting profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.2/2">The NDNAD stores only limited personal information about the identity of those with a profile held on it. Only an individual's name, date of birth, gender and ethnic appearance are recorded. Details of occupation are not held therefore it is not possible to say how many Government Ministers, hon. Members, Members of the House of Lords or judges have a DNA profile held on the NDNAD.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.2/3">As with the other occupations listed in the question, it is not possible to give the number of police officers with a profile held on the NDNAD. A police officer may have voluntarily given a DNA sample for the NDNAD, or, like any other citizen, a police officer arrested for a recordable offence may have a DNA sample taken as a result.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.2/4">However, there is also a separate DNA database known as the Police Elimination Database (PED) which holds the DNA profiles of serving police officers, who are potentially capable of leaving DNA at a crime scene in the course of their duties. PED searches are carried out only if a senior investigating officer requests a comparison of DNA profiles from a specified officer or officers with a DNA profile from a specified crime, unlike NDNAD searches which compare all profiles from crime scenes with all profiles from known individuals. Since <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-01">1 August 2002</phrase>, all new recruits to the police service have been required to give a DNA sample as a condition of employment. As at <phrase class="date" code="2009-09-30">30 September 2009</phrase> there were 118,699 records held on the PED for England and Wales police forces. However, as the PED also holds the profiles of certain police staff such as scenes of crime officers and vehicle examiners and does not contain the details of people's professions, we are not able to state how many of these records relate to police officers.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.2/5">As the date of birth of an individual is recorded alongside their profile it is possible to provide information on the number of profiles belonging to children and over 65s held on the NDNAD. This information (for England and Wales police forces only) is provided in the table and reflects the individual's age on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-16">16 October 2009</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.2/6">The number of profiles is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because some of the profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, that is, an individual may have more than one profile held on the NDNAD. This may happen if, for example, an individual gives a different name on different arrest occasions. The existence of replicates does not affect the integrity or effectiveness of the NDNAD. The current replication rate across the entire NDNAD is 13.8 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.217W.2/7">The data presented are based on a snapshot of the NDNAD as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-16">16 October 2009</phrase>. The data on the NDNAD are constantly changing as records are added and removed, hence the figures are a snapshot of the records at a single point in time. The data are management information and have not been formally assessed for compliance with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.</p>

	<p pid="b.218W.2/1">There is no objective evidence to suggest that the police are arresting people for the purpose of obtaining their DNA. The taking of a person's liberty by arresting them is not undertaken lightly. That is why the power of arrest is subject to a test of necessity, set out in section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). Police officers are also required to have regard to the statutory guidance in the exercise of the power of arrest, which is set out in Code of Practice G, one of the codes of practice issued under PACE.</p>

	<p pid="b.218W.5/1">It is not possible at present to calculate accurately the proportion of members of ethnic groups in the population as a whole who are on the NDNAD. This is because the data held on the NDNAD are not directly comparable with census population data. The NDNAD does not hold self-reported ethnicity data on arrested persons who have a DNA sample taken, but on their 'ethnic appearance'. The ethnic appearance data is based on the judgment of the police officer and is recorded for police intelligence purposes to assist in subsequent identification. It uses six broad ethnic categories (plus 'unknown') whereas census data are based on 16 ethnic groups self-reported by individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.5/2">Estimates of the proportion of different ethnic groups on the NDNAD calculated by simply dividing the number of profiles by the population data will give an inaccurate estimate as a number of other factors also need to be taken into account. Examples of these factors are the number of profiles from persons of mixed race, the number of profiles of unknown ethnicity, the number of replicate profiles and the use of comparable up-to-date population data. The National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) is working to produce an estimate which is as accurate and robust as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.218W.5/3">Data are available on the number of DNA profiles from people with black, asian or white ethnic appearance aged between 18 and 35 years on the NDNAD. The following table displays the number of subject profiles retained on the NDNAD as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-16">16 October 2009</phrase> for males aged 18-35 inclusive (based on current age as at <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-16">16 October 2009</phrase>) for England and Wales police forces, including the British Transport Police (BTP).

	<p pid="b.225W.8/1">Detention is an essential component in maintaining an effective immigration control. It is usually appropriate in the following circumstances: initially, while a person's identity or basis of claim is being established; where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a person will fail to comply with the conditions attached to the grant of temporary admission or release; as part of a fast-track asylum process; or to effect removal.</p>
	<p pid="b.225W.8/2">The decision to detain is made on case by case basis taking account of the individual circumstances in each case. Imminence of removal and risk of harm to the public are factors, among others, considered in reaching a decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.225W.8/3">Detention is kept to the minimum period necessary for the purpose for which it was authorised and is not unduly prolonged. Individuals may prolong their own detention by, for example, refusing to cooperate with the redocumentation process or by frustrating lawful attempts at removal. Detention in each individual case is subject to review at increasingly senior levels within the UK Border Agency to ensure that it only lasts as long as it continues to be justified and necessary.</p>

Since September 2004, the Department for Children, Schools and Families has collected data on the number of parenting orders issued in England related to non-attendance of children at school and exclusion from school at local authority level.</p>
	<p pid="b.228W.2/3">The number of parenting orders relating to crime or antisocial behaviour and those related to education as reported to the YJB by YOT area are shown in table A.</p>
	<p pid="b.228W.2/4">Breach of a parenting order is a criminal offence. Information showing the number of persons proven at court to have breached a parenting order from 2003 to 2007 (latest available) is shown in table B.

	<p pid="b.228W.2/5">The statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>

	<p pid="b.236W.5/6">The book value for each property is usually based on open market value as assessed by independent chartered surveyors commissioned as part of our rolling programme of estate revaluations. In most cases, this gives the best indicator of anticipated revenue.</p>

	<p pid="b.240W.2/1">Over half the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) spend is in foreign currencies. Exchange rate pressures impact FCO in three main areas: overseas Posts' spending in foreign currencies; contributions to international organisations and peacekeeping; and spending in sterling on items affected by exchange rates. Until 2007, FCO and the Treasury used the Overseas Price Movements (OPM) mechanism to maintain the local purchasing power of our Posts (the first category) despite any movements in exchange rates and differential inflation rates. Recent OPM transfers between FCO and HM Treasury are:</p>

	<p pid="b.240W.2/13">The withdrawal of OPM became effective from April 2008. Since then, 190 of our Posts have faced exchange rate and inflationary pressures. In 2008-09 the exchange and inflation rate pressure on our Posts' budgets was &#163;59.2 million. In 2009-10 the exchange and inflation rate pressures on our Posts' budgets is expected to be &#163;80 million. I have placed details in the Library of the House. Additional exchange rate pressures have impacted our international organisations subscriptions, peacekeeping assessed contributions and some other budgets spent in sterling but impacted by exchange rate movements.</p>
	<p pid="b.240W.2/14">The FCO monitors the impact of foreign currency movements on budgets on a continuing basis. The FCO Board of Management has met frequently and offered me advice on how best to meet the estimated impact (including OPM) of over &#163;100 million in 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="b.240W.2/15">FCO's discretionary budget from which Posts are funded is &#163;830million (which includes FCO's contributions to UKTI, but excludes all our contributions to UN Peacekeeping and the costs of International Organisations subscriptions). Our Posts have responded impressively with a range of efficiency savings. Programme spend has also been reduced to meet the new budgets.</p>
	<p pid="b.240W.2/16">The foreign currency forward purchase programme to help manage our foreign exchange needs is carried out through our Strategic Treasury Team of three people, drawing on wider skills as and when necessary. A number of more senior staff, including the FCO's Finance Committee, have overseen the operation. HiFX Intelligent Financial Services also provide specialist support at the cost of &#163;41,400 per year.</p>

Other than the usual issues of travel around the West Bank and between the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which affect all Palestinians, the report did not focus on travel, housing, or residency.

	<p pid="b.258W.3/3">In September 2009 we launched the Cross-Government Hate Crime Action Plan which contains a number of action points designed to reduce numbers of crimes of violence across all five hate crime strands, including sexual orientation.

	<p pid="b.258W.3/4">There is also a range of activity taking place in the North West to combat hate crime targeted at lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals. For example, bar owners and door staff in and around the areas of Liverpool frequented by LGB communities have recently received hate crime awareness-raising training.</p>
	<p pid="b.258W.3/5">Further, Liverpool's Hate Crime Reduction Forum which brings stakeholders together from across Liverpool to address all strands of hate crime, funded the As One programme which was an educational awareness programme focused on youth centres in the Kensington area encompassing antisocial behaviour and diversity awareness.</p>

	<p pid="b.272W.5/1">The Government do not routinely collect or hold information about the number of Henry VIII provisions. However in response to an earlier question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase> on the number of Henry VIII powers that had been enacted up until that point in the 2008-09 Session, a detailed exercise was undertaken to collate the information.</p>
	<p pid="b.272W.5/2">The Minister of State, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)</phrase> wrote to the hon. Member for Eddisbury on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-10">10 November 2009</phrase> with the following information:</p>
	<p pid="b.272W.5/3" class="indent">As you know, a Henry VIII clause is a power in a Bill which enables primary legislation to be amended or repealed by secondary legislation. Such provisions are included in legislation for a variety of reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.272W.5/4" class="indent">Due to the diverse nature of this type of power, we cannot be sure that we have captured every instance. However we estimate that there are around 70 such powers contained within legislation enacted so far this Session. At least 10 of these powers are not new, but have been re-enacted this Session and at least 15 of the powers are provisions allowing for consequential amendments. The majority of the remaining powers are narrow in scope, applying in specific circumstances, including 18 powers in the Finance Act 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.272W.5/5" class="indent">15 of the 70 powers are contained in the Banking Act 2009, which was passed in response to the recent period of sustained disruption in global financial markets. The more substantive of these 15 powers are necessary to ensure that the special resolution regime can be used effectively to resolve a failing bank or building society, in order to protect depositors and maintain financial stability.</p>
	<p pid="b.272W.5/6" class="indent">Parliament has long-and rightly-been hostile to the principle of Henry VIII powers, and so have I and my colleagues. They are only used when there is substantial call for them; no practical alternative of dealing with the issue in the original legislation; and such powers are rarely wide-ranging. The exercise of any Henry VIII power will be subject to subsequent parliamentary approval, either by way of the negative resolution procedure (for example where the change is technical, consequential or minor) or, as in most cases, the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>
	<p pid="b.272W.5/7" class="indent">All of the powers themselves were subject to parliamentary scrutiny prior to their enactment and were accepted as necessary by Parliament having considered the views of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.272W.5/8">In order to answer this question fully, a similar exercise is being undertaken to take account of the Acts that have received Royal Assent since <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-10">10 November</phrase> and I will write to the hon. and learned Member as soon as this exercise is complete. A copy will be placed in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.275W.0/2">The National Offender Management Service takes very seriously the principle of confidential communications between prisoners and their legal representatives which is embodied in Prison Rule 39.

	<p pid="b.276W.8/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-12">12 February 2007</phrase> the maximum custodial sentence for knife or offensive weapon possession offences is 4 years. Therefore the answer gives data from March 2007 to June 2009 (the most recent published data from the Knife Crime Sentencing Quarterly brief). Further information is available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.276W.8/4">Maximum penalties are set at a level to provide for the most serious conceivable case of a particular offence and therefore are rarely imposed.</p>
	<p pid="b.276W.8/5">More custodial sentences are being given for knife and offensive weapon possession and those that are sent to jail are serving longer sentences. The proportion of immediate custodial sentences given for possessing a knife or offensive weapon increased from 17 per cent. to 19 per cent. of all sentences between the second quarter of 2008 compared with the same period in 2009. The average sentence length in the second quarter 2009 was 194 days which is a 42 per cent. increase from the same quarter in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.276W.8/6">These figures have been drawn from the police's administrative IT system which, as with any large scale recording system, is subject to possible errors with data entry and processing.

	<p pid="b.277W.2/1">Delivery for the completion of sex offender treatment programmes (SOTP) is scheduled against annual targets. Targets for the number of completions of SOTP have been negotiated and agreed locally between Probation Areas or Trusts and the NOMS regional (and Wales) offices since 2007-08. In 2006-07 there were no area-level targets for SOTP completions, only a national target. Monthly milestones for delivery throughout the year are also agreed locally. These targets cover the overall provision of SOTP and are not broken down by the programme type.</p>
	<p pid="b.277W.2/2">The targets are included in the Service Level Agreements (or contracts for Probation Trusts) setting out the agreed level of service delivery for each financial year and are signed off by the Regional Offender Manager or now the Director of Offender Management. Performance relative to targets and milestones is assessed quarterly through the Integrated Probation Performance Framework (IPPF), which provides the basis for the published provider ratings.</p>
	<p pid="b.277W.2/3">Sex offender treatment programmes are delivered as a requirement of either a community sentence or release on a post-custodial licence. They are delivered alongside a supervision requirement, which is overseen by an Offender Manager. Supervision commences as soon as the offender is sentenced or released from custody and involves assessment of risk and treatment needs in addition to sentence planning and preparing the offender to engage in treatment. Other measures designed to protect the public may also be put in place, such as Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA). Supervision requirements for sex offenders are usually longer (up to three years) in order to allow sufficient time for treatment to be completed.</p>

They will set their own criteria to determine whether families should be referred to a family group conference service (FGC). As part of their wider approach to supporting families to stay together, some local authorities have made it mandatory that an FGC is offered to the family before a child enters care or as soon as possible afterwards in the case of an emergency placement. Others have developed key trigger points within a local authority's involvement with a family where a decision about the child is required.</p>

	<p pid="b.317W.5/2">The Department's survey asked for information on whether schools contain asbestos-containing materials. It also asked questions about asbestos management in local authorities and schools. The Department did receive a response from Essex county council but we are not in a position to publish any of the local authority responses as this information may be required for legal purposes. The Health and Safety Executive is planning follow up investigations in 2010 in a number of local authorities to clarify the information provided.</p>

	<p pid="b.320W.9/1">The Department currently estimates that during the introductory phase of the CRC Energy Efficiency scheme, allowance sales could generate in the region of &#163;650 million each year in 2011 and 2012. An integral aspect of the scheme is that this sum is returned to participants six months after the main allocation of allowances, making the scheme broadly revenue neutral to the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="b.320W.9/2">It is important to emphasise that these are preliminary estimates made using significant assumptions that will not be known with more certainty until after the start of the scheme. The main assumptions are an estimate of the quantity of emissions covered by the scheme and the uptake of energy efficiency measures within the sector. Until participants have registered for the scheme during April to September 2010 and reported their emissions in July 2011 we will not know the CRC emissions coverage accurately.</p>
	<p pid="b.320W.9/3">The sum likely to be raised from the auctioning of allowances during the capped phases of the scheme from 2013 onwards is yet more uncertain. Until the Government have taken a decision on the appropriate level of the cap, taking into account advice from the Committee on Climate Change it is not possible to estimate accurately the likely revenues from the five years of the first capped phase.</p>

	<p pid="b.321W.5/2">The UK Government will negotiate as part of the EU in Copenhagen and as such cannot make a direct submission to the UNFCCC. It is important that the deal in Copenhagen will support the development, transfer, deployment and diffusion of technologies for adaptation and mitigation in developing countries. The UK and the EU recognise the important role of public policies and finance in creating an enabling environment to redirect and scale up private investments in safe and sustainable low greenhouse-gas-emitting technologies; believe that support for technologies in developing countries should be based on assessments of country needs as reflected in their low-carbon development strategies; and argue that we should establish national and regional centres of technological excellence to promote technology development and transfer, stimulate capacity-building and improve access to information.</p>
	<p pid="b.321W.5/3">We welcome the work of the International Telecommunications Union and believe it provides useful evidence of how the telecoms sector plans to respond to the need to shift to a low carbon economy to limit the effects of climate change. We have recommended that a member of the UK delegation attends the ITU joint Copenhagen summit side event on the 10 of December, if time and scheduling permits.</p>

	<p pid="b.336W.3/10" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Speed, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-08">8 December 2009</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.336W.3/11" class="indent">The Minister of State, for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) has asked me to reply to you directly in respect of your question what mechanisms are in place to ensure that staff who drive (a) a vehicle for which (i) his Department and (ii) one of its executive agencies is responsible have valid driving licences and (b) their own vehicles in the course of their official duties for (A) his Department and (B) one of its executive agency have valid driving licences and insurance; what guidance is issued to those staff in respect of road safety while carrying out official duties; what steps are taken to monitor compliance with that guidance; what requirements there are on such staff to report to their line managers accidents in which they are involved while driving in the course of their official duties; and whether such reports are investigated.</p>
	<p pid="b.336W.3/12" class="indent">For the purposes of travel on official Insolvency Service business in a vehicle for which the Service is responsible, it is the responsibility of line managers to ensure that staff hold a valid driving licence.</p>
	<p pid="b.336W.3/13" class="indent">For travel on official Service business in a privately owned motor vehicle, the staff guidance advises that the owner of the vehicle should ensure that the driver holds a current driving licence for the vehicle. Regarding insurance, the use of a private motor vehicle must satisfy certain insurance conditions. It is the employee's personal responsibility to ensure that these conditions are fulfilled. Staff must declare that they know and understand the insurance requirements, and that they are covered accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="b.336W.3/14" class="indent">There is no specific guidance regarding road safety but staff are advised that they must ensure that the private vehicle they drive has a current MOT and is in roadworthy condition. The monitoring of compliance with guidance is the responsibility of local line managers, and is not checked centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.336W.3/15" class="indent">Staff are required to report any motor vehicle accidents to their line-manager. Line managers must ensure that all accidents, incidents and near-miss events falling within their area of responsibility are reported and appropriately investigated, and remedies put in place to prevent re-occurrence. Near misses are not recorded unless they have resulted in some type of injury or distress to the individual that warrants recording under the above scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.336W.3/16" class="italic"> Letter from Sean Dennehey, dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-27">27 November 2009</phrase>:</p>

	<p pid="b.336W.3/18" class="indent">The Intellectual Property Office, an executive agency of BIS, requires staff who drive their own vehicle during the course of their duties to sign a declaration which confirms they have valid insurance.</p>
	<p pid="b.336W.3/19" class="indent">Hire cars are covered by Crown indemnity. Line managers are expected to check driving licences annually to ensure compliance with the requirements. If a hire vehicle is involved in an accident staff are required to notify the hire company and the line manager and full details of the incident submitted to the HR department.</p>
	<p pid="b.336W.3/20" class="indent">In respect of road safety we do not issue separate guidance: we expect staff to behave responsibly in all aspects of their official duties. It is made clear that the Office will not reimburse or accept any fines or penalties for motoring offences.</p>

	<p pid="b.336W.3/26" class="indent">Where a vehicle was used for official business National Measurement Office staff must declare, on each claim made, that a valid driving licence is held by the driver and that no endorsements were pending that could result in a ban. If relevant to the claim, the declaration also covers that the vehicle used has a current MOT and is in roadworthy condition. Managers are required to confirm that the claimant's driving licence and, where relevant, motor insurance policy and MOT are reviewed for validity for official business use.</p>
	<p pid="b.336W.3/27" class="indent">The National Measurement Office has issued staff guidance for driving for work. Drivers must report any accidents, in which they were involved, when on official business. Guidance covers the actions that staff must undertake in such circumstances. Staff must complete an accident form within 24 hours of any such accident. The content of this form is then considered under normal health and safety procedures.</p>

	<p pid="b.348W.2/1">Skills policy in England focuses on equipping the workforce with the skills needed to compete in a global marketplace and enable people and their families to live happier, healthier, more successful lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.348W.2/2">Government recognise the importance of traditional skills sets. Securing the right skills provision and attracting a new generation into these industries is key to preserving our heritage. Working across Government Departments and through English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund, we want to ensure that our heritage is cared for, protected and enhanced for current and future generations to enjoy.</p>
	<p pid="b.348W.2/3">Many of the UK's remote islands are not part of England. Skills policy in the UK is devolved and as such policy for those islands are a matter for the Scottish Executive, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
