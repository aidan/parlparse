	<p pid=".349W.5/1">The Government were disappointed with the position adopted by the European Council of Ministers on the proposed new Investment Services Directive. We believe that in several areas the Council text misses opportunities to create a competitive, integrated European financial market and instead will harm competition.</p>
	<p pid=".349W.5/2">An area of particular concern for the Government during negotiations was the treatment of &quot;execution-only&quot; business in the Directive. We believe that it is important to ensure that execution-only business is not compromised by unnecessary regulation. Such business can provide low-cost access to share trading, for example, for a wider range of investors.</p>
	<p pid=".349W.5/3">During negotiations, the Government successfully ensured that execution-only business will be exempt from full &quot;suitability testing&quot; obligations.</p>
	<p pid=".349W.5/4">The Government will work hard with the Financial Services Authority to ensure that the provision relating to execution-only business is not implemented in the UK in a way which restricts normal marketing activity or direct offer promotions.</p>
	<p pid=".349W.5/5">The Investment Services Directive is one of the topics discussed when Treasury Ministers meet members of the financial services industry.</p>
	<p pid=".349W.5/6">At official level, the Treasury has frequent contact with representatives of financial services businesses, trade associations and consumer groups. Recent contacts have involved discussions of the potential impact of the Directive on activities including on execution-only sales of financial instruments.</p>

	<p pid=".352W.0/4">The contract was extended to January 2007 to recognise new strategic business requirements and allow sufficient time for the CIPR (Customs Information Processing Requirement) procurement process. To date, there have been no cost overruns. The Inland Revenue has three IT contracts whose budgets exceed &pound;20 million. First, it has a strategic contract with EDS, which commenced on <phrase class="date" code="1994-07-01">1 July 1994</phrase>. This contract covers all IT services for Inland Revenue systems, their enhancement, day to day maintenance and new systems development. It is not a fixed price contract. Major systems are delivered within their own individual internal budgets, and the contract with EDS has supported the development and delivery of these systems since 1994.</p>
	<p pid=".352W.0/5">In 1998 the Inland Revenue inherited a contract from the Department of Social Security for the provision of the NIRS2 Services run by Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting). The system went live in July 1998 and has been stable since April 2000. The NIRS2 service was provided under a PFI contract which has since been adjusted to allow for the unprecedented level of change required of the system by new legislation. There were some well documented delays in introducing the NIRS system, involving extra development costs, paid for by Andersen Consulting. The Inland Revenue has also incurred business recovery costs, enabling the introduction of more modern and automated business processes.</p>
	<p pid=".352W.0/6">The E-IROS contract was awarded to Computacenter in June 2000 for the provision of desktop hardware, software and related services. This is not a fixed price contract and consequently the value of the contract depends on the annual demand for desktop services. It has, however, exceeded &pound;20 million in each of the last four years.</p>

	<p pid=".357W.2/14">A detailed breakdown of these numbers by the types of traffic signs contravened is not held centrally, but the figures include fixed penalties and prosecutions for traffic light offences detected by cameras. They accounted for a quarter of the fixed penalties and convictions for neglect of .traffic directions over the five years. Traffic light offences will not be subject to civil enforcement under the powers contained in the Traffic Management Bill.</p>

	<p pid=".357W.5/1">The Highways Agency and Association of Chief Police Officers &quot;Roles and Responsibilities Report&quot; identified plans that could free up the equivalent of about 540 full-time equivalent police officers. Based on figures from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary of 6,540 designated roads police in 2001&ndash;02, the report estimated that a transfer of non-core police activities to the Highways Agency enabled approximately 8&frac12; per cent. of police time to work on other key tasks. Resources will be freed up over a period of about three years as Highways Agency Traffic Officers are phased in across all motorways and some key trunk roads.</p>
	<p pid=".357W.5/2">Calculations for the number of police officers to be released by each police force were made at a national level and have not been translated into resources for individual police authorities. The manner in which resources are redeployed is a matter for the police and will depend on, among other things, the current resources available and policing priorities. This does not mean that police will stop patrolling the network, instead they will be able to spend more time dealing with vehicle, road and other crime.</p>

	<p pid=".360W.0/2">The UK ranks 91st internationally in the 2002 Environmental Sustainability Index compiled by the Global Leaders of Tomorrow Task Force of the World Economic Forum in association with the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy and Columbia University. The rankings of other EU member states are shown in the following table. However, the UK and other countries believe this index is profoundly flawed and therefore potentially misleading, for the following reasons. It is an aggregated indicator which aims to weight together many components into a single overall measure of 'environmental Sustainability', an approach which as yet is not scientifically robust. The choice of components, and the way in which they are weighted together, is largely subjective. A different choice of components or weights would give different results, amply illustrated by the fact that the previous edition of this index, based on a different selection of components, placed the UK 16th.</p>
	<p pid=".360W.0/3">Furthermore, there are still many areas where data are not sufficiently comparable between countries, or are simply not available. The values of many of the variables used to compile this index are imputed. It should also be noted that the variables used in this index tend to measure circumstances at a single point in time rather than trends or changes, therefore to the extent the index measures anything at all, it measures the environmental situation which a country faces rather than its progress or performance in improving environmental sustainability.</p>

The school and college performance tables will show combined results for General (GCE) and/or Vocational (VCE) A levels, Advanced Subsidiary (AS) qualifications and key skills at level 3. This practice recognises the qualifications as equal in worth and does not undermine the achievements in any particular qualification in any way. We are, though, currently consulting on future measures of success which will take account of the diverse curriculum offer in post 16 learning. &quot;Measuring success in the Learning and Skills Sector&quot; can be found at <a href="http://www.successforall.gov.uk">www.successforall.gov.uk</a>.

	<p pid=".364W.0/2">Following the Machinery of Government changed in June 2003 the DfES assumed lead responsibility in Whitehall for policy on children and the family. As a result of the changes, around 120 staff from the Home Office, the Department of Health and the Department for Constitutional Affairs, who were engaged in a range of work on children and family issues, transferred to DfES. To support its enhanced role, the Department created a new Directorate: Children, Young People and Families, drawing together all those who were employed in these areas to improve the coordination of policy development and service delivery. Around 600 staff in Schools Directorate working on Sure Start and children's issues were moved to the new Directorate, accounting for the significant change in staff numbers in Schools Directorate during the latter part of 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".364W.0/3">The increase in staff numbers in Lifelong Learning Directorate during the second half of 2003 resulted from the transfer of 200 staff from the former Youth Directorate. The majority of the remaining staff in Youth Directorate transferred to the Children, Young People and Families Directorate, while a small number moved to Strategy and Communications Directorate.</p>

	<p pid=".367W.2/1">The White Paper: The Future of Higher Education was published in January 2003. In this, the Government set out plans to increase participation in higher education towards 50 per cent. of those aged 18 to 30 by 2010.Although there are no numerical targets for expansion of student numbers in further education, funding will increase by &pound;1.2 billion between 2002&ndash;03 and 2005&ndash;06, a 19 per cent. real terms increase. This will help to support increased participation in further education.</p>

	<p pid=".371W.2/2">Mature students will be treated in the same way as younger students both as far as the proposed changes to tuition fees and to income contingent loans are concerned: where they are studying full time, up front fees would be abolished and they will be subject to variable fees of between &pound;0 and &pound;3,000 per year from 2006; re-payable following graduation and for any loans they take out with the Student Loans Company, they will benefit from the raising of the income threshold above which repayments are made from &pound;10,000 to &pound;15,000 from 2005. Part time students are already subject to variable fees: where they have taken out loans with the Student Loans Company, they too will benefit from the raising of the income threshold from &pound;10,000 to &pound;15,000 from 2005. We are introducing a new package of support for part time students in 2004/05, including a grant for fees of up to &pound;575 and a course grant, neither of which are repayable. Mature students are also particularly likely to benefit from the new HE Grant of &pound;1,000, being introduced from 2004/05. We expect around a third of all those getting the full grant of &pound;1,000 to be independent, despite such students making up only around 15 per cent of the total student population.</p>

	<p pid=".372W.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-29">29 October</phrase> my right hon. Friend announced proposals to restore stability to school funding. Amongst the package of measures, we are ensuring that for 2004&ndash;05 all schools will see a guaranteed minimum increase in their per pupil budget amounting to 4 per cent. per pupil where pupil numbers remain the same. In addition, we have ensured that schools will receive an increase in the amounts of Standards Fund, School Standards Grant and funding from the LSC for sixth forms in line with the minimum guarantee.</p>
	<p pid=".372W.3/2">We are increasing the School Formula Spending Share by a minimum of 5 per cent. per pupil&mdash;the City of York's increase is 6.8 per cent.

This is on top of the increases already announced in the provisional settlement. For almost all authorities the additional grant will reduce the pressure on services and council tax, and will make it easier for authorities to meet education passporting targets. In the case of the City of York the additional grant amounts to &pound;1.2 million.</p>

The maximum amount that the City of York might be able to bring forward in this way would be &pound;300,000.</p>

England's Regional Development Agencies are required to prepare and publish Corporate Plans with a three year planning horizon, which are revised every two years, to synchronise planning and funding horizons with the Spending Review process. The current Corporate Plans cover the period 2003&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".373W.6/2">The amount spent by RDAs in each of the last four years on printing and distribution of such plans is set out in the following table. The figures do not include the cost of staff resources in developing the detail of the plans where they are produced in-house, consulting stakeholders on the policies and activities reflected in the plans, nor the cost of departmental resources in approving them, which could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Expenditure also varies for many reasons such as the number of copies produced, whether consultants were used or whether the plans were only made available on the internet.</p>

	<p pid=".377W.5/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry published a consultation document on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-15">15 December 2003</phrase> seeking views on draft guidance which she proposes to issue on the consideration of media public interest cases under the Enterprise Act 2002 (as amended by the Communications Act 2003). The new regime is substantially deregulatory compared to the old, with a small number of narrowly defined public interest considerations approved by Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.5/3">In relation to the newspaper public interest considerations (accurate presentation of news, free expression of opinion and plurality of views), new legislation recognises that, for newspapers, there have historically been a small number of cases that have raised public interest issues beyond those that would have been considered as part of a competition assessment. It therefore allows the Secretary of State to intervene in certain newspaper mergers on these public interest grounds. The draft guidance sets out some indications of the general approach she expects to adopt in deciding whether or not to intervene in a particular newspaper case. However each case will be decided on its own facts.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.5/4">In relation to the scope of the broadcasting and cross-media public interest considerations, whilst in principle the Secretary of State .may intervene on these public interest grounds in any media merger case where these considerations are relevant, the draft guidance notes that as a matter of policy she expects thatintervention on these public interest grounds will normally only be considered in those areas where media ownership rules have been removed by the Communications Act.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.5/5">The assessment of newspaper and other media mergers on competition grounds will be the responsibility of the competition authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".377W.5/6">All of the procedures for all parts of the process will be transparent and impartial. Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the House Libraries.</p>

Thus where a number of villages or small communities adjoin each other or adjoin a larger town, and the aggregate population of the area exceeds 10,000, the model reflects that fact and classifies it as urban.</p>

	<p pid=".382W.0/1">The DTI is supporting the demonstration of photovoltaics (PV) in housing and large public buildings through the Domestic Field Trial (DFT) and Large Scale Field Trial (LSFT). A combined budget of &pound;10 million is supporting the installation and monitoring of PV systems in around 500 houses (30 projects) and 12&ndash;15 large-scale public buildings. The Field Trials aim to raise awareness of PV technology, create confidence in its applications, and provide opportunities for the UK photovoltaics industry.</p>
	<p pid=".382W.0/2">The Government is committed to a major initiative with industry and others to achieve a UK solar PV demonstration programme in line with our main competitors. The current programme, which started in April 2002 and is worth &pound;20 million over three years, is the first stage of this process. At the halfway stage, over half the funding has been allocated.</p>
	<p pid=".382W.0/3">The DTI is also putting effort into removing a number of barriers to the deployment of very small generators, such as PV. These include reduction of VAT to 5 per cent. for professionally installed systems, a new PV Annex to Planning Policy Guidance Note (PPG22), simplified connection agreements to the local network (G77 and G83/1) and Installer Training and Accreditation Schemes. In addition, the Government plans to amend the Renewables Obligation to enable very small generators like PV to accumulate their production over a year, rather than a month, so as to qualify for ROCs.</p>

	<p pid=".382W.7/1">Preliminary evidence, including hits on the DTI working parents website and requests for guidance, indicate that interest in the right to request flexible working by mothers, and fathers, is high. We recently published the top 10 questions asked by employees when calling the Acas helpline, and continue to gather evidence from a wide number of sources to build up a clear picture of the demand for, and uptake of, the new law.</p>
	<p pid=".382W.7/2">The Department undertook an employee Work-Life Balance survey in 2003 as a baseline for comparison with a repeat survey due in 2005. The results will contribute to the review of the law that the Government are committed to initiate in 2006. Preliminary employee findings are available on the internet, <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/er/emar/">www.dti.gov.uk/er/emar/</a>, and we are expecting to publish the full report soon.</p>
	<p pid=".382W.7/3">We are working with key intermediaries, such as Working Families and Maternity Alliance, who are collating data through member/supporter surveys. These organisations are due to report their findings to coincide with the first anniversary of the new law to request flexible working in April this year. We are also working with Prima Baby magazine which is carrying out a reader survey, and aims to publish the results in the March edition.</p>
	<p pid=".382W.7/4">The Department has also commissioned questions on flexible working which currently appear in the Office of National Statistics monthly Omnibus survey. The results of these can be made gender specific and will be available in spring 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".383W.5/1">Discrimination on the ground of pregnancy or maternity is a form of direct discrimination on the ground of sex. The courts have interpreted the Sex Discrimination Act as meaning that discrimination on the ground that a woman is, or might become, pregnant is unlawful. This is reinforced by the amended Equal Treatment Directive published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-05">5 October 2002</phrase> which says that less favourable treatment on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity within the meaning of the Pregnant Workers Directive constitutes sex discrimination.</p>
	<p pid=".383W.5/2">In 1999, the Government introduced specific protections to prevent women from suffering detriment and from being unfairly dismissed or selected for redundancy for reasons connected with their pregnancy, childbirth or maternity leave. We have also ensured a woman has a clear right to return to her job after maternity leave, on the same terms and conditions as if she had not been away.</p>

The Pensions Schemes Registry only records the present status of a scheme so only those winding up at the moment are captured. This is unlikely to bias the figures extensively as the winding up process can take many years to complete, particularly for large firms.</p>

	<p pid=".387W.0/26">1. The prescription information was obtained from the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) system and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispensed in the community, i.e. by community pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors, and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Total prescriptions include not only prescriptions originating from general medical practitioners in England but also from hospital doctors, nurses, and dentists, provided they were dispensed in the community. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospital or private prescriptions.</p>
	<p pid=".387W.0/27">2. Drugs for dementia are those defined in the British National Formulary (BNF) section 4.11.</p>
	<p pid=".387W.0/28">3. The Net Ingredient Cost refers to the cost (which the dispenser is reimbursed) of the drug before discounts and does not include any dispensing costs or fees. It does not include any adjustment for income obtained where a prescription charge is paid at the time the prescription is dispensed, or where the patient has purchased a pre-payment certificate.</p>
	<p pid=".387W.0/29">People in long-term care with Alzheimer's disease have the same access to drugs for dementia as people living elsewhere. If appropriate, those involved in their care will refer them as necessary for assessment by specialist mental health teams.</p>
	<p pid=".387W.0/30">In August 1999 the Department issued Health Service Circular 1999/176 which asks national health service bodies to continue with local arrangements for the managed introduction of new technologies where guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is not available. These arrangements should involve an assessment of all the available evidence. Funding for treatments, such as Ebixa, should not be withheld simply because of an absence of guidance from NICE.</p>

Between December 2002 and July 2003, the MRC held a series of four seminars to encourage the development of good quality applications for autism research funding. Topics covered in the seminars were gut and the developing child; brain and mind (neuropsychology and neuroimaging); autism in populations and outcome measures for interventions in children and adults. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-11">11 July 2003</phrase>, the MRC held the first of their annual fora for autism research &quot;Breaking barriers, building bridges&quot;, in conjunction with the National Autistic Society, to bring together ideas stimulated by the previous four seminars.</p>

	<p pid=".389W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-17">17 December 2002</phrase>, following thorough options analysis work and detailed market research, the Department purchased the largest remaining independent United States plasma collector Life Resources Incorporated. The objective was to secure long-term supplies of non-United Kingdom blood plasma to ensure that the global plasma shortage would not reduce the availability to National Health Service patients of life-saving plasma products such as immunoglobulins and clotting factors. Large volumes of plasma are required for medicinal product manufacture, especially immunoglobulm.</p>
	<p pid=".389W.0/2">The NHS has been using US-sourced plasma since 1998 because of the unknown and unquantifiable risk of transmission of vCJD through blood. At the time Life Resources Inc. was purchased, the US had no reported cases of BSE or CJD and was the only country able to supply the quality and quantity of plasma required. The US also has a well-established pool of donors, a well-regulated environment and a developed collection industry. The Government are aware of the one case of BSE reported in the US and considers this to be a negligible risk to the safety of the blood supply. This case is not in itself a reason to alter current arrangements but we will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>
	<p pid=".389W.0/3">It is standard in both the UK and the US that, in addition to screening donors for the major blood borne viruses of HIV, Hepatitis B and C, all blood products are heat treated or chemically treated to remove any viral contamination that may have escaped the screening process.</p>
	<p pid=".389W.0/4">In the UK, expert advice is that if vCJD is transmissible through blood, the infection is most likely to be contained in the white cells and plasma. As a precautionary measure, we instituted universal leucodepletion (removal of the white cells) of all blood for transfusion from <phrase class="date" code="1999-10-31">31 October 1999</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid=".389W.3/1">The National Blood Authority (NBA) undertakes a rigorous selection of blood donors as the first step in ensuring the safety of the blood supply. The questionnaire and accompanying interview of potential blood donors have been developed to elicit appropriate information relevant to donation. There are two important aims, which are to ensure as far as possible that the donated blood is safe for transfusion to patients and that blood donation is not detrimental to the donor's health.</p>
	<p pid=".389W.3/2">Donors are accepted or deferred on the basis of the information they give the NBA using the United Kingdom donor selection guidelines developed by the Joint UK Blood Transfusion Services and National Institute of Biological Standards and Control which are used throughout the UK. All donors are asked to read a blood safety leaflet, which outlines key lifestyle risk factors.</p>
	<p pid=".389W.3/3">The donor selection procedures and questions used in the UK are in line with the recommendations of the Council of Europe and will be in line with the proposed European Union Directive 2002/98/EC (Article 29) on setting standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components.</p>

	<p pid=".391W.5/3">Some of the drop in registration numbers is due to improved procedures at the Dental Practice Board in removing duplicate patient records.</p>

	<p pid=".391W.5/5">We recognise that dentists in some areas have reduced their NHS commitment and there has been considerable dissatisfaction since 1992 with remuneration system which is now seen as a disincentive to provide NHS dental care. Proposals in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 will underpin a modernised, high-quality primary dental service provided through contracts between primary care trusts and dental practices and properly integrated with the rest of the NHS providing better access to services and an improved patient experience.

With the clinical information given by hospital providers it is not possible to determine how many amputations due to diabetes could have been prevented. The national service framework for diabetes standards document noted that all people with diabetes should receive high-quality care throughout their lifetime, including support to optimise the control of blood glucose, blood pressure and other risk factors for developing the complications of diabetes. The standards document also noted that the impact of microvascular complications could be reduced if they are detected and treated at an early stage and states that all young people and adults with diabetes should receive regular surveillance for the long-term complications of diabetes.</p>

	<p pid=".395W.0/1">Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning enables highly sensitive and specific functional imaging of metabolic processes involved in oncology, cardiology and neurology. It holds particular promise for cancer services.</p>
	<p pid=".395W.0/2">In response to requests from National Health Service and research stakeholders the Department of Health will shortly publish a framework for PET scanning for consultation. This framework will enable the NHS to develop a clear national policy position which will set out, from the evidence, which tumour groups would benefit from PET scanning, likely future demand, and the optimal configuration and location of PET scanners. This would ensure that access to PET facilities was available to patients from all cancer networks and that high quality research could also be undertaken on the future applications of PET.</p>

	<p pid=".397W.5/1">Ritalin is indicated as a part of a comprehensive treatment programme for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children over six years of age where remedial measures alone prove insufficient. In October 2000 the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) published an appraisal of the use of the drug methylphenidate (main brand name Ritalin) in the treatment of childhood ADHD and issued clinical guidelines for its use, including the need for regular monitoring of children receiving this therapy. NICE recommended long-term follow-up of adverse effects and the potential for misuse of the drug in assessing long-term benefits and health gain into adulthood.</p>
	<p pid=".397W.5/2">As with all medicines, the safety of methylphenidate is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the independent advisory body the Committee on the Safety of Medicines. Comprehensive information on the use of methylphenidate, including possible side effects, contraindications and precautions is contained in the summary of product characteristics produced by the manufacturer and approved by the licensing authority.</p>

Assemblies would also have influence&mdash;through consultation with, and making appointments to specified bodies&mdash;over budgets totalling &pound;1,600 million in the North West, &pound;600 million in the North East and &pound;1,100 million in Yorkshire and the Humber.</p>

In 2001&ndash;02, the existing local fire and rescue authorities spent around &pound;238 million in the North West, &pound;103 million in the North East and &pound;159 million in Yorkshire and Humberside. These are the latest figures available. Broadly speaking, three quarters of the Fire and Rescue Service's overall budget spending is met by revenue support grant and national non- domestic rates and the balance from council tax.</p>

	<p pid=".401W.11/1">The key partnership in any area is the Local Strategic Partnership (LSP). A survey in summer 2002, as part of the Government's research into LSPs, showed that the vast majority of areas, at county and district local authority level, either had an LSP in place or were in the process of forming one. There are now approximately 365 LSPs across England.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.11/2">LSPs must include representatives from and reflect an appropriate balance between the public sector including local authorities and other public services, and private, voluntary and community sectors. LSPs will operate by consensus, in order to reflect and retain the buy-in of partners.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.11/3">The Government guidance, published in March 2001, states that it will be for local partners to decide the full range of work of their LSP. However, it does set out four core tasks.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.11/4" class="indent">Prepare and implement a community strategy for the area</p>
	<p pid=".401W.11/5" class="indent">Bring together local plans, partnerships and initiatives to provide a forum through which mainstream public service providers work effectively together to meet local needs and priorities</p>
	<p pid=".401W.11/6" class="indent">Work with local authorities that are developing a local public service agreement to help devise and then meet suitable targets</p>
	<p pid=".401W.11/7" class="indent">Develop and deliver a local neighbourhood renewal strategy (in the 88 districts receiving Neighbourhood Renewal Fund).</p>
	<p pid=".401W.11/8">LSPs are not statutory bodies and as such do not receive funding directly. However the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF) enables the 88 most deprived authorities, in collaboration with their Local Strategic Partnership (LSP), to improve services, narrowing the gap between deprived areas and the rest of England. &pound;1,875,000 has been allocated for the period 2001 to 2006 and a full breakdown by local authority district is available.</p>
	<p pid=".401W.11/9">More generally LSPs will work collaboratively with and through partners to access sources of funding to meet local needs.</p>

	<p pid=".403W.5/1">Each Government Department assesses ways and means of delivering its objectives, and appraises the relevant options in line with the guidance in &quot;The Green Book&mdash;Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government&quot;&mdash;including the costs of implementation. If, for example, a Department wishes to secure sustainability objectives, and in order to do so, has to dispose of assets, the disposal should be done in such a way that meets the requirements of Government Accounting chapter 24. This should ensure that overall value for money is achieved and that the disposal is effectively and properly done. Overall value for money goes beyond maximising proceeds by including the impact of effective public service delivery. Disposal of land by local authorities is governed by section 123 of the Local Government Act 1972. Local authorities may dispose of land in any manner they wish: my right hon. Friend The Deputy Prime Minister's only involvement is to grant or withhold consent where authorities wish to dispose of land at less than the best consideration reasonably obtainable and the proposed disposal falls outside the scope of the General Consent in The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Circular 06/2003. The rules on disposal do not, therefore, directly address issues of sustainability. These would be considered as part of the project appraisal or reasons for disposing of the land.</p>

	<p pid=".404W.6/1">The sites referred to as <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> are the same site designated under the Statutory Instrument 1997/2536, known as the Salcombe Cannon Site. The reference to the suspected Barbary pirate ship has arisen after research has shown that Barbary pirates were active around the period of the ship wreck in the area of Salcombe. Since designation the Secretary of State has issued licences to survey, surface recover and excavate the site. At the time of writing there are no current licences on this site, as there has been no application made to the Secretary of State. The issuing of licences since 1997 has enabled continued investigation of this site by vocationally based teams backed up by professional archaeological advice. Over the last 18 months this system has been supported by English Heritage. The Government's contractor for archaeological services in support of the 1973 Act has also visited this site and others in South Devon this summer, managed by English Heritage and fully involving the divers licensed to investigate the sites.</p>

	<p pid=".405W.12/1">South Africa is not dependent on financial transfers from international donors&mdash;aid from all donors represents less than 1 per cent. of the country's annual budget. Donors' contribution to development in South Africa is in the form of technical assistance to build capacity to develop and implement pro-poor policies. DFID has contributed more than &pound;200 million in technical assistance to South Africa in the 10 years since the democratic transition there. Figures for annual spending since 1998&ndash;99 and plans up to 2005&ndash;06 are shown as follows. As shown, and in line with our overall strategy on assistance to middle income countries, we are planning a reduction in planned expenditure for the year beginning April 2005. We are discussing with the South African government how to manage this. We will continue to maintain a substantial programme there in recognition of the poverty problems inherited from the apartheid period, the growing spread of HIV/AIDS, and the critical importance of successful transition in South Africa for the prospects of sub-Saharan Africa as a whole.</p>

	<p pid=".413W.8/1">In the last five years the SA80 has been subject to a major modification programme to improve its reliability by either replacing or reengineering components. Work began in 2001 and is scheduled to be completed by May 2006. Approximately 93,000 modified weapons have been issued to date. The basic design and concept of the modified SA80&mdash;the SA80 A2&mdash;remains the same, but there are significant engineering improvements to the internal gas systems, firing pin, bolt, hammer and barrel. The cocking lever has been redesigned to deflect spent cases and reduce the chance of stoppages, and the new magazine is more reliable and robust. Work has also been undertaken on the safety catch/plunger, and following successful trials of a revised safety plunger during Op TELIC, a contract will be let shortly to procure a sufficient quantity to modify all weapons.</p>
	<p pid=".413W.8/2">The modification programme also includes enhanced ancillaries. An Operational Cleaning Kit has been developed which enables the user to undertake an operational clean without dismantling the weapon. This is being issued to all troops deployed on Op TELIC in the infantry role.</p>

	<p pid=".415W.2/2">Statutory guidance, &quot;No secrets&quot;, issued by the Home Office and the Department of Health in 2000 defines abuse of vulnerable adults as a violation of an individual's human and civil rights by any other person or persons. It goes on to say that abuse may consist of a single act or repeated acts and can manifest itself as physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, financial or material abuse, neglect and acts of omission, and discriminatory abuse.</p>

	<p pid=".415W.8/1">Anyone who has lodged a formal application for asylum in the United Kingdom is entitled to access health services. Health assessments are offered in induction centres to allow early identification of health care needs and in the event that an asylum seeker is dispersed, they will take with them a patient handheld record which health professionals can access. Asylum seekers housed in emergency accommodation pending dispersal also have access to health services. If an individual case is referred to and accepted by the Medical Foundation then they will normally be able to remain in London to access the specialist care that only the Foundation can provide.</p>

In the case of a pregnant woman she will be given appropriate ante-natal care by the local Primary Care Trust. She will also be entitled to access those services which are generally available to women who have been raped. NASS's policy of dispersal according to language seeks to ensure that individuals are not isolated without any support from their community. We also encourage the active participation of asylum seekers in community life through, for example, our Purposeful Activities Scheme and through volunteer and mentoring schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".415W.8/3">People who arrive in the United Kingdom alone and are under 18 will be treated as unaccompanied asylum seeking children and will be cared for by local social services departments.

She would also be offered access to available victim support and counselling services to deal with the consequences of an assault, such as trauma and pregnancy.</p>

	<p pid=".416W.2/1">This Government are determined to tackle domestic violence. As part of our overall strategy we have introduced the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill which will ensure an effective police response when victims report domestic violence, and make sure that the civil and criminal law offer the maximum protection to all victims to stop the violence recurring.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.2/2">The main measures relating to domestic violence in the Bill are: making breach of a non-molestation order a criminal offence; making common assault an arrestable offence; enabling courts to impose restraining orders when sentencing for any offence, and on acquittal for any offence if the courts consider it necessary to protect the victim; extending access to non-molestation and occupation orders to same-sex couples and couples who have never cohabited or been married; and issuing guidance to agencies on holding multi-agency reviews following domestic violence homicides.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.2/3">We recognise that legislation alone cannot deliver improvements to services that victims need. The Inter-Ministerial Group on Domestic Violence will, over the next two years and beyond, oversee a programme of work which focuses on prevention, protection and justice, and support. Among other things, we will be looking at education and tackling risk factors, improving the police and CPS handling of domestic violence cases, delivering new refuge places and providing help and advice to those victims who wish to stay in their own homes. Further details can be found in the Summary of Responses to &quot;Safety and Justice: the Government's Proposals on Domestic Violence&quot;, copies of which can be found in the House of Commons Library.</p>

	<p pid=".417W.5/1">The allocation of Young Adult Offenders (YAOs) aged 18&ndash;20, into Gloucester prison forms part of the ongoing programme to adjust the population mix of adult and young prisoners at a number of establishments. This is in response to the requirements of the Youth Justice Board for juvenile places and to increasing demand for spaces for adult male prisoners. This will be achieved through careful monitoring of population changes and the allocation of prisoners to establishments appropriate to their needs. It will also ensure maximum use of all available spaces in the prison estate, while minimising the distance of remand prisoners from the courts. This will enable the Prison Service to maintain its service to the courts despite the population pressures.</p>
	<p pid=".417W.5/2">Ashfield prison is not being closed, but will instead only hold young prisoners, aged 15&ndash;17. Gloucester and other prisons in the area will hold remand and sentenced YAOs. Sentenced YAOs returning from court will be held at Gloucester for the minimum time possible before being transferred on to other establishments with YAO regimes.</p>

	<p pid=".421W.5/2">In 2003 (to <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-31">31 October</phrase>), 176 prisoners in England and Wales have been resuscitated following acts of self-harm, which reflect a considerable amount of staff effort and expertise. Many more prisoners are supported through periods of crisis with the help of numerous agencies and support mechanisms available to them in custody. All prisons offer access to the Samaritans, and most prisons operate peer support schemes, most commonly the Samaritans Listener Scheme. Further avenues of support include counselling and help with a range of issues including: substance misuse, healthcare, mental health problems and contact with home.</p>
