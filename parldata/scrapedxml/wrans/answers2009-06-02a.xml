DFID officials have spoken to the fund's Secretariat about this, including recently at the Global Fund's Executive Board (5-<phrase class="date" code="2009-05-06">6 May 2009</phrase>). Formally, the UK supported a resolution made at the board meeting which obliges the fund's Secretariat to address this issue urgently, to report on whether its existing procedures are adequate, and to propose solutions which would minimise the risks of disruptions to treatment both in the short term and on an ongoing basis. In developing countries such as Zimbabwe, DFID is also assisting, where possible, in the provision of drugs while problems in Global Fund supported programmes are being addressed.</p>

	<p pid="a.333W.9/1">In April 2009 we initiated a national Flood Rescue Enhancement Project involving all the key organisations in the UK associated with search and rescue, and flood rescue in particular. The project has prepared a draft national register of flood rescue assets. Work is in hand to validate the information held on the register to ensure it is kept up-to-date&mdash;we envisage that it will be a 'live' dataset to track the availability of flood rescue assets (and trained rescue personnel) across a range of organisations operating in the UK. As it will be a dataset of assets owned by a multitude of organisations, publication of a snapshot of the register, once completed, would be a matter for collective agreement by all of the organisations involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.9/2">The review of existing assets and the ongoing work during the summer to determine flood rescue capability requirements will provide a much clearer indication of any gaps in existing capability. We will then be in a position to target investment in order to bring existing assets (and trained rescue personnel) that are not yet declared on the national register up to an agreed operational standard.</p>

The maps of Areas Susceptible to Surface Water were compared with those of the 15 Integrated Urban Drainage pilot projects and models already held by the independent consultants.</p>
	<p pid="a.337W.0/2">The information on the maps is still under development and is currently only considered suitable for emergency planning purposes. The maps give an indication of the broad areas likely to be susceptible to surface water flooding based upon an extreme summer rainfall event with no drainage systems working. The information is not sufficiently accurate to use for individual properties as the current version excludes, for example, the impact of buildings and kerb heights on surface water flows, which at the local level can be significant. There will be properties at risk from surface water flooding that will not be included within the outline areas on the maps, and possibly other individual properties within the areas outlined that are not at risk because of particular local features that the mapping process did not reflect.</p>

	<p pid="a.339W.5/1">As previously stated BERR's Export Control Organisation has identified 67 licences that have been issued since March 1999 for munitions that, like white phosphorous munitions, are designed to create illumination or act as an incendiary. Because the export licence application does not require the exporter to provide the chemical composition of munitions to be exported, it is not possible to say how many&mdash;if any&mdash;of those 67 related to the export of military devices containing white phosphorous.</p>

Encouraging results have been seen so far from the first three months in 2009, including some excellent partnership working between industry, police, local authorities and other Government Departments. More tangible results from management information have included the recovery of quantities of stolen copper cable from Network Rail and BT (including one find worth over &pound;10,000), recovery of other stolen metals including lead, 46 lengths of rail, base plates, rail clips, and boilers, stolen kegs, and also the detection of red diesel. There have also been five arrests, three Environment Agency prosecutions and the identification of three cases of benefit fraud.</p>

	<p pid="a.359W.5/1">The National DNA Database (NDNAD) is designed to match DNA taken from crime scenes with that taken from individuals. It does not hold information on whether those with records on it have convictions, as this is not necessary for this purpose. It is therefore not possible to provide information on the number and proportion of people on the NDNAD who were recorded as having a conviction on the Police National Computer (PNC) in each of the last 10 years. Some data on whether those on the NDNAD have convictions are available from PNC, but not as part of its routine functions and not within the cost limit for parliamentary questions. However, the National Policing Improvement Agency does obtain this information periodically.</p>

Before the phased introduction of the Points Based System in 2008, foreign national doctors and nurses who were qualified to practice in the UK were required to apply for entry clearance as work permit holders.

	<p pid="a.366W.6/1">The Home Office is committed to making the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games safe and secure. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-25">25 February</phrase> the Government approved a 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Safety and Security Strategy and accompanying 2012 National Concept of Operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.366W.6/2">Delivering the strategy will require the deployment of substantial numbers of police officers additional to normal day to day requirements. We are working with police forces and the Association of Chief Police Officers to refine this requirement. We cannot give a definitive estimate at this stage in the planning, which will always also need to remain flexible to changes in the risks the games face. At peak times of the games we currently anticipate deployment to be broadly similar to events such as the Notting Hill Carnival, which last year involved some 11,000 tours of duty by Metropolitan Police officers over the bank holiday weekend.</p>
	<p pid="a.366W.6/3">Planning decisions on police numbers will need to take into account both the operational requirement and the need to demonstrate affordability and value for money within the overall &pound;600 million funding envelope. These decisions will be consistent with the risk-based and intelligence-led approach set out in our strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.369W.8/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) operates to a set of published service standards (PSS) which include issuing 90 per cent. of Standard Disclosures within 10 days and 90 per cent. of Enhanced Disclosures within 28 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.369W.8/2">Data concerning the average time taken to complete a Disclosure are not a performance target and are not collated by the CRB. Average figures do not give an accurate indication of performance, since any force's performance can be affected by a number of factors, including the volume of cases sent to a force to process in any given month, the number of staff available to process the checks and the IT resources on hand to forces. With these variables, performance can fluctuate within individual forces from one month to the next.</p>
	<p pid="a.369W.8/3">Between April 2008 and March 2009 the CRB issued 396,000 Standard Disclosures and 3,459,000 Enhanced Disclosures. During this period the CRB exceeded its targets for Standard Disclosures with a cumulative total of 99.1 per cent. issued within 10 days but did not meet PSS for Enhanced Disclosures, issuing 88.6 per cent. within 28 days. The principal reason for this has been the high volume of Disclosures that have been presented for processing. This has put a great deal of pressure on the police Disclosure Units involved in the processing of Enhanced Disclosures.</p>
	<p pid="a.369W.8/4">An improvement plan has been initiated aimed at reducing the volume of outstanding work at police forces and number of aged cases, which are those applications that have been outstanding for longer than 25 days. This improvement plan has contributed towards a steady decline in the number of these cases over recent months.</p>
	<p pid="a.369W.8/5">There are a number of other factors which can affect the timely completion of checks, including but not restricted to the length of time it can take for an employer to deal with the initial application; the accurate completion of the Disclosure application form; the clarity of the information provided and the existence of conviction or non-conviction information.</p>
	<p pid="a.369W.8/6">To explain further, Enhanced Disclosures must include any local police force information which, in the chief officer's opinion, might be relevant to the application and ought to be included in the Disclosure. Such decisions must balance the need to protect a person's right to privacy with the need to protect the public from potential harm and therefore require careful consideration. Consequently, some applications can take longer to deal with.</p>

	<p pid="a.374W.5/1">With UK and international support, significant developments have been made in strengthening Afghan democracy since 2001. Our funding has been used to help strengthen institutions, finance the electoral process and build Afghan civil society and political participation. Notable achievements since 2001 include nationwide democratic presidential and parliamentary elections and the ratification of a new constitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.374W.5/2">We have already given &pound;16.5 million to support the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to prepare for the presidential and provincial council elections that will be held on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-20">20 August 2009</phrase>. Parliamentary and district council elections are due in 2010. International funding and support for the 2009-10 elections is being co-ordinated by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) as part of its Enhancing Legal and Electoral Capacity for Tomorrow (ELECT) project.</p>
	<p pid="a.374W.5/3">UK financial support is complemented by ongoing political engagement by British Ministers and embassy officials&mdash;encouraging change; raising concerns with the Afghan Government; lobbying internationally for support; and working through the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's International Security Assistance Force to support thorough Afghan-led security for the elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.374W.5/4">Voter registration, which started in October 2008, has now been completed by the IEC across Afghanistan. We are pleased the process went according to plan, with over 4 million new names being added to the existing voter registry. The fact that the insurgents failed to disrupt the process is a credit to all involved, particularly the Afghan National Security Forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.374W.5/5">Candidate registration for Afghanistan's 2009 presidential elections closed on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-08">8 May 2009</phrase>. 44 candidates registered in total, including two women. The next stage involves the Afghan Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) investigating any challenges to these candidates. The ECC will receive complaints between 16 and <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-21">21 May 2009</phrase>, and after making their investigations, they will notify the IEC if any candidates have been disqualified.</p>

	<p pid="a.375W.5/1">Each of the five Caribbean overseas territories (OTs) and Bermuda has at least one prison, with Bermuda and Cayman also having completely separate prisons for females. The majority of the prisons were built in the last 10-15 years (in most cases with Government assistance) to replace outdated facilities not fit for purpose. A senior manager, seconded from HM Prison Service, is based in the region to advise and support local officials on prison management and wider criminal justice issues. In addition, each prison has an independent and voluntary monitoring body working within it in order to monitor and report on conditions, and to raise any issues of concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.5/2">The OT prison services are moving towards a focus on rehabilitation, with the recruitment of specialists to support that approach. With smaller prison and local populations, the early indicators are that these efforts are having more success than larger prison systems elsewhere are able to achieve.</p>

	<p pid="a.380W.9/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-19">19 May 2009</phrase>, the Sri Lankan President announced that military forces had retaken all the territory once held by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and that they had captured or killed the senior leadership of that organisation. Our primary concern remains the immediate humanitarian crisis affecting the civilians displaced by the fighting and the long-term political and economic peace and stability of Sri Lanka. We continue to work with the UN, EU, the Sri Lankan Government and key international partners to try to alleviate the humanitarian situation and to press for progress on a political solution that is based on equality, consent and rule of law.</p>

We fully supported the visits by senior UN staff to Sri Lanka, including John Holmes (UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs) and Vijay Nambiar, (UN Secretary-General's Chief of Staff) and, in the face of some opposition from others; we supported their subsequent briefings to the Security Council. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister discussed Sri Lanka with the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-19">19 May 2009</phrase>. These actions at the UN have been important, not least in keeping the spotlight of international concern on Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.9/3">We have urged the Government of Sri Lanka to use the opportunity of the visits by Mr. Nambiar and the UN Secretary-General himself, to recognise that the UN has a central role to play, both in the delivery of humanitarian aid and in encouraging the process of political reconciliation that must be an integral part of rebuilding Sri Lanka's civil society.</p>

	<p pid="a.386W.0/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Mel Groves. I have asked him to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.386W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from<i> Mel Groves</i> :</p>
	<p pid="a.386W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking how many jobcentres were opened, relocated and closed in each of the last 12 months; under what circumstances jobcentres are opened, relocated and closed; and, what the address and date of opening was of each jobcentre in England and Wales. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.386W.0/4" class="indent">The information requested has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.386W.0/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus Customer Service Directors regularly review their service delivery plans to ensure optimum provision of service for all customers, for every Jobcentre Plus District. Our approach to closure of a customer-facing Jobcentre takes into account any impact on customer service and the relocation of the work and staff of the closing office. When considering site closures we are committed to full consultation with our customers, partner organisations, Trade Unions, staff, and local Members of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.386W.0/6" class="indent">In light of the emerging economic downturn pressures we decided to suspend the planned closure of 25 Jobcentres. This decision was announced in November 2008. There has been a further closure of three small sites in London during March 2009. These had been announced last summer prior to the decision to suspend future closures. There will be no new Jobcentre closures while the current economic conditions persist.</p>
	<p pid="a.386W.0/7" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus inherited around 1,500 offices from the merger of the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service in 2002. We have modernised our Jobcentre network to improve customer service, rationalising our estate to provide excellent high street coverage and a single, integrated customer facing office, at the same time reducing cost to the tax payer. We remain the largest office network in Government with 741 modern Jobcentres. This high street presence is supported by 31 modern contact centres and 79 main benefit processing centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.386W.0/8" class="indent">In addition to our network of modernised Jobcentres we aim to make our services accessible to customers by providing a range of support through outreach, often delivering advisory and other support at our partners' premises. That is particularly important in locations where maintaining a Jobcentre could not be justified. Typically such services can be delivered in partnership with Children's Centres or on Local Authority premises or in conjunction with one of our Welfare to Work Providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.386W.0/9" class="indent">The great majority of our services (in common with most large, modern organisations) are now also delivered through the telephone and internet. For example, to give customers more convenient access, we have around half a million vacancies on-line at any time (our website receives close to one million job searches every working day), and new claims to benefit are predominantly taken by telephone with some taken on-line. This has brought our customer facing services together in a more coherent and integrated network and I believe Jobcentre Plus is well-placed to respond to the full range of economic conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.386W.0/10" class="italic"> Letter from Mel Groves:</p>
	<p pid="a.386W.0/11" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what roles we expect the planned additional 6,000 Jobcentre Plus staff to fill. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.386W.0/12" class="indent">Whilst Jobcentre Plus will have an additional 6,000 staff in the next operational year we do not yet have the detailed plans on their deployment as these are still being worked on. However, it is anticipated that more than half of these will be Personal Advisers and others will be in customer intervention and support roles within our customer service operations.</p>

The volumes are displayed as a cumulative figure for each of the time bands except over 22 days. So for example, those claims between 1-5 days are included in the column for 6-10 days and so on. The percentage figures are not cumulative and are subject to rounding. This data has been available since 2006. Therefore I have provided you with the yearly total for 2006/07 and 2007/08.

	<p pid="a.388W.5/1">Local housing allowance was rolled out nationally in April 2008 for customers in the deregulated private rented sector who make a new claim for housing benefit, and for existing customers who move address. It is a way of calculating the rent element of housing benefit based on the area in which a customer lives and their household size. Local housing allowance is paid to the tenant rather than the landlord in most circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.5/2">We believe that local housing allowance is a much fairer, simpler and more transparent way of calculating housing benefit. One of the key features of local housing allowance is that where possible the benefit will be paid to the customer, so that they can take more personal responsibility for their housing, helping to prepare for when they move into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.5/3">We accept that it is not possible in every case to make the payment to the tenant and, once the local authority has determined a maximum rent in accordance with the relevant regulations, payments are therefore made to the landlord in the following circumstances:</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.5/4" class="indent">when the tenant is unlikely to pay (for example, where the local authority knows from past experience that the tenant is likely to abscond with the rent payment); or</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.5/5" class="indent">when the tenant is likely to have difficulty in managing their rent payments; for example, due to an alcohol/gambling/drug dependency or because of a serious medical condition such as Alzheimer's disease; or</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.5/6" class="indent">when the tenant is in arrears of eight weeks or more.</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.5/7">Local authorities may make payments to the landlord where they consider that the claimant is likely to have difficulty in paying their rent and it is in the interest of the claimant to do so. We therefore encourage landlords not to wait for the eight-week period to be reached but to contact the local authority as soon as a payment is missed so that they can begin gathering the evidence required to make a decision on direct payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.5/8">We are satisfied that these safeguards will ensure that vulnerable customers do not fall into unmanageable difficulties and that their rental payments will be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.5/9">Local housing allowance was introduced in nine pathfinder authorities in 2003-04 and was subject to extensive and independent evaluation. A further nine authorities implemented the scheme in 2005 to test operational readiness.</p>
	<p pid="a.388W.5/10">Despite landlords' initial fears, there is overwhelming evidence that customers have responded extremely well to the responsibility of managing their rent payments. Evidence from the evaluation has shown that customers regard paying the rent as a matter of prime importance and that most would prioritise this above all other payments. 84 per cent. of tenants are successfully managing their own housing benefit. Of the remaining 16 per cent. only a third are having their housing benefit paid to the landlord because they have fallen into arrears of eight weeks or more. Two-thirds are having their benefit paid to the landlords because the local authority, working together with landlords, has identified that they might not be able manage their rent payments. The local housing allowance evaluation reports are available on the DWP website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.388W.5/12">We are closely monitoring how the local housing allowance scheme is working in practice and will undertake a review during the first two years of operation following national rollout.</p>

	<p pid="a.391W.0/1">The Department does not have data on the incidence of Alzheimer's disease. However the national Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) records the number of people recorded on practice disease registers with a diagnosis of dementia. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 50 to 75 per cent. of cases of dementia so the prevalence of patients with dementia gives an indication of the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. This prevalence figure is available only for the two latest releases of QOF, covering 2006-07 and 2007-08 (financial years). However, these numbers are likely to be an underestimate of the true position. The Dementia UK report, published in 2007 by the Alzheimer's Society estimated that two-thirds of the people with dementia never receive a formal diagnosis.</p>

The Department has awarded &pound;86,000 for this work between 2008 and 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.391W.3/3" class="indent">&pound;76,500 was awarded to MKC Trust over a three-year period from 2009-2012, to raise awareness of breast cancer among south Asian communities, and provide support to south Asian women with breast cancer and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.391W.3/4" class="indent">In addition, over &pound;1.8 million has been awarded over the last 12 months to organisations supporting cancer patients in general, for the period 2009-12.</p>
	<p pid="a.391W.3/5">Funding awarded more than 12 months ago also continues to be used to raise awareness of cancer and provide support for patients.

	<p pid="a.395W.2/1">GP Systems of Choice began in August 2007, to run initially for two years, with the expectation that contracts awarded under the initiative would be extended for a further two years if the initiative proved successful. The assumption at the outset was that, by the end of the four-year period, national programme for information technology local service providers (LSPs) would have delivered their integrated general practice solutions. Depending on the rate of take up of the integrated solutions, the Department will determine in due course whether the contracts should be re-tendered to ensure continuity of service.</p>
	<p pid="a.395W.2/2">LSP general practitioner (GP) solutions have already been deployed to over 900 practices, with more practices migrating to TPP SystmOne, provided by CSC, than any other available GP system.</p>

	<p pid="a.401W.6/2">The Department has provided service planners, commissioners and providers with guidance, expert advice and support to help them to deliver the NSF's quality requirements. However, in line with devolving responsibility to local organisations, we are moving to new phase with much greater emphasis on local health and social care communities and the third sector taking responsibility for driving forward service change and improvement. This also recognises that the NSF is not a stand alone priority but that it needs to be closely aligned and integrated into mainstream NHS and Social Services activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.402W.5/1">All pharmacy and general practitioner (GP) system suppliers have to follow a rigorous assurance process prior to being given authority from Connecting for Health to nationally deploy their Release 2 services.

	<p pid="a.402W.5/2">Currently, one GP system and one pharmacy system are completing the final stages of clinical safety testing prior to deploying to the first GP and pharmacy sites. The exact start date of initial implementation is dependant on how quickly these systems progress through the final stages of testing. Based on current supplier plans, it is hoped that initial implementation will begin in the summer. The outcomes of the initial implementation stage will be used to finalise plans for wider rollout of Release 2 across the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.408W.3/1">The increase to &euro;50 billion in May 2009 will further ensure that the EU is able to act to support the needs of all EU member states, and protect the functioning of the EU common market. There are no EC budgetary implications or impact on the UK of this increase to the ceiling of the facility. Other technical changes will have an impact on those countries receiving medium-term financial assistance under this facility; the EC budget and all member states would take on a larger contingent liability as a result of any increased lending.</p>

The Government introduced tax-free ISAs in 1999, and announced increases to the ISA limits at Budgets 2007 and 2009. Over 18 million people now have an ISA. The Child Trust Fund was introduced in 2005, and the Saving Gateway will be introduced in 2010 to encourage saving amongst working-age people on lower incomes. The Government have also legislated for reforms to the private pensions system that will encourage and enable more people to save for their retirement.</p>

In their response, the Government said that they would develop a check-list to help local responders to establish and assess the effectiveness of emergency facilities. This was done in December last year with publication of Parts One and Two of the &quot;Expectation and Indicators of Good Practice Set for Category 1 and 2 Responders&quot; which gives guidance on what is expected of responders in implementing the Civil Contingencies Act and wider capability building activity.</p>

This measure was the subject of Pitt Review recommendation 36, the Government's response to which indicated that the necessary hardware and training will be in place during 2009 to make relevant flood visualisation data held in electronic map format available to Gold and Silver Commands. Progress in meeting this recommendation will be reported as part of the Government's next six-monthly progress report in June.</p>

	<p pid="a.431W.5/1">The Department takes any allegations of abuse very seriously indeed. The Government commissioned two major reviews into historical abuse&mdash;Sir William Utting's report 'People Like Us' (1997) and Sir Ronald Waterhouse's report 'Lost in Care' (2000). Kendall House closed in the 1980s, but since then tighter controls have been put in place which address all the issues raised by the allegations about Kendall House. The Government changed the regulatory framework and brought in the Care Standards Act 2000, which focuses on safeguarding children and promoting their welfare.</p>
	<p pid="a.431W.5/2">Providers and managers of children's homes must now be registered with Ofsted and comply with the Children's Homes Regulations 2001 and National Minimum Standards. These regulations are much more extensive than those which applied in the mid 80s and include specific standards on the control and issuing of medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.431W.5/3">There is no evidence that the allegations made about inappropriate use of drugs at Kendall House were a widespread problem. Kendall House was inspected prior to the homes closure and the use of drugs in the home was part of that inspection. Allegations about Kendall House were also subject to investigation by the police and local government ombudsmen in 1994.</p>
	<p pid="a.431W.5/4">The Secretary of State has had no representations from the Church of England, Kent police or Kent county council on Kendall House. The Secretary of State wrote on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-30">30 April</phrase> to the Secretary of State for Health about this matter. The Secretary of State has also asked the Permanent Secretary to look into this matter and on his advice has concluded that, on balance there is not sufficient justification for a further inquiry on public interest grounds at this point.</p>

	<p pid="a.438W.2/1">The recent review of sex and relationships education (SRE) in schools reported that the provision of SRE was patchy and that many young people were not receiving the support they need to make safe and responsible choices about sex and relationships.</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.2/2">As a consequence, we have taken the decision, subject to public consultation, to make Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education (including SRE) statutory. This will raise the priority of PSHE education in schools and ensure a more consistent offer to all young people. In addition, we are taking action to address the key delivery challenges identified during the SRE review, which includes improving the skills and confidence of those who deliver PSHE.</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.2/3">Teenage pregnancy rates are influenced by a range of factors. Increased risk of teenage pregnancy is strongly associated with poverty and poor educational attainment.</p>
	<p pid="a.438W.2/4">In addition, teenage pregnancy rates are influenced by: the quality of SRE young people receive; their access to contraceptive and sexual health (CASH) advice services when they become sexually active; and the extent to which parents talk to their children about sex and relationships. International evidence, as well as evidence from local areas that have made most progress in reducing under-18 conception rates since the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy was launched, shows that comprehensive, age-appropriate SRE, alongside easy access to CASH services, brings down rates.</p>

	<p pid="a.440W.2/2">To provide for growth in pupil numbers the Department has allocated over &pound;1.2 billion capital funding to fund extra school places between 2008-09 and 2010-11. Because primary pupil numbers are rising faster in some areas than previously anticipated, the Department are currently considering what additional support it can offer those authorities in greatest need.</p>
	<p pid="a.440W.2/3">School revenue funding to local authorities is based on actual pupil numbers recorded in the January School Census. For 2009-10, an authority's funding will be based on pupil numbers from January 2009. As a result, increases in pupil numbers up to that point will be reflected in authorities' revenue funding. In addition, authorities that have significant increases in pupils between April and September of each year may be eligible for an exceptional circumstances grant. For each authority experiencing an increase in overall pupil numbers above 2.5 per cent. between the January and autumn censuses, the grant will be an amount equal to 7/12 of their Guaranteed Unit of Funding per pupil for each pupil above the 2.5 per cent. threshold.</p>

	<p pid="a.442W.3/1">The Department has recently undertaken a review of its field forces working with local authorities (LAs) and children's trusts. The term field force has been used in a wide sense to cover all advisers funded or jointly funded by DCSF to work directly with LAs and children's trust partners. This includes NDPB staff where relevant, directly contracted groups of advisers, advisers who are co-located with the Government Office Children and Learner Teams and sections of DCSF Head Office directly supporting LAs e.g. Youth Task Force. In 2008-09, the costs of these advisers were around &pound;90 million. Comparable information for every year since 1997 is not available.</p>

Thanks to the &pound;655 million funding announcement in the Budget, we will be able to deliver this and more, and fund learning for an additional 54,500 young people this year and next. The funding is split &pound;251 million in 2009-10 and &pound;404 million in 2010-11 and will fund an additional 54,500 learners each year. This will mean that we have funding for at least 1,550,000 for 2009/10 and 2010/11.</p>
	<p pid="a.443W.2/3">This will mean we have quickly reassured school and college leaders who had previously feared their financial allocations would not fund their growth in the number of young people wanting to continue learning.

	<p pid="a.444W.5/1">Lord Laming's report &quot;The Protection of Children in England&quot; identified a number of concerns in relation to the Integrated Children's System. Lord Laming recommended that the Government should, in consultation with social workers and their managers, take steps to improve the utility of the system to support them in their role and to ensure appropriate transfer of essential information across organisational boundaries. Lord Laming also recommended that the DCSF should undertake a feasibility study with a view to rolling out a single national Integrated Children's System better able to address the concerns his report identifies, or find alternative ways to assert stronger leadership over local systems and their providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.444W.5/2">In immediate response to Lord Laming's report, the DCSF asked the Social Work Task Force to accelerate its advice in relation to the Integrated Children's System and to advise how Lord Laming's recommendations in should be taken forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.444W.5/3">The task force's advice was informed by consultation with practitioners, managers and IT implementation staff at events around the country, by a number of visits to local authorities and by 649 submissions of on line evidence from individual practitioners and managers, and local authorities. It was set out in the task force's first report on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-05">5 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.444W.5/4">As set out in &quot;The Protection of Children of England: action plan&quot;, the DCSF has accepted the task force's recommendations in relation to steps it can take immediate to improve usability of the system and to support greater local leadership. We will shortly be writing to local authorities to set out detailed next steps, including explaining the arrangements and time scales for usability reviews of each local system.</p>
	<p pid="a.444W.5/5">The Government have also accepted the task force's advice that the future model for the Integrated Children's System should be locally owned and locally led, within a strong and simplified national framework which reflects the statutory requirements for children's social care, rather than a single national system.</p>
	<p pid="a.444W.5/6">In line with Lord Laming's recommendations, we are also taking forward a national study into issues relating to interoperability of ICS with other IT systems and how this can best be supported.</p>
	<p pid="a.444W.5/7">We expect the task force to make more detailed recommendations to us, in October, about the reforms necessary to support high quality social work practice. The Government will consider any further improvements to the Integrated Children's System as part of the comprehensive programme of reform for social work which we have committed to bringing forward in the autumn.</p>

Similarly, the approach to planning for economic development is intended to build upon the existing policy approach in PPG4 &quot;Industrial, Commercial Development and Small Firms&quot; by reinforcing messages and emphasising certain aspects of the approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.463W.0/1">Government planning policy, contained in PPS1 Planning and Climate Change, requires planning authorities to set out percentage targets for low carbon/renewable energy sources in new developments. Performance against target is monitored through annual monitoring reports.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/2">Part L of the building regulations sets minimum energy efficiency standards for new buildings and when certain categories of building work are carried out on existing buildings e.g. extensions, conversions, renovations, replacement windows and boilers. The Government have announced that they intend to seek progressive improvements in part L standards and has set targets for all new homes to be net zero carbon from 2016 and has similar stretching ambitions for new non-domestic buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/3">In addition, all new affordable housing receiving social housing grant through the Homes and Communities Agency must be built to at least Code for Sustainable Homes level 3 standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.463W.0/4">As part of the new Government performance framework, Camden is required to report against National Indicator 185&mdash;CO2 reduction from local authority operations and National Indicator 186&mdash;per capita reduction in CO2 emissions in the local authority area. In addition, Camden has selected National Indicator 186 as a stretch target and action under this indicator is critical to achieving the Government's climate change objectives. Performance will be monitored by the Audit Commission under the comprehensive area assessment (CAA) which will look at how well Camden's services are working together to improve the quality of life for local people. CAA will be a catalyst for better local outcomes, more responsive services and better value for money and an independent evidence base for central Government on progress against national priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.464W.6/2">It says that regional planning bodies and local planning authorities should work together, and with key stakeholders, to undertake assessments to ensure a joined-up and robust approach. Assessments should preferably be carried out at the sub-regional level, for separate housing market areas, by housing market partnerships (where established). Housing market partnerships should include key stakeholders such as house builders, social landlords, local property agents, local communities and other agencies, such as English Partnerships (now the Homes and Communities Agency) where they have a recognised interest in an area.</p>
	<p pid="a.464W.6/3">Key stakeholders should be involved at the outset of the assessment, so that they can help shape the approach to be taken. In particular, house builders and local property agents should provide expertise and knowledge to help the partnership to take a view on the deliverability and developability of sites, and how market conditions may affect economic viability. Key stakeholders should also be involved in updating the assessment from time to time.</p>

	<p pid="a.466W.8/1">There are two independent sources of data on actual numbers of mortgage possessions: The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) and the Financial Services Authority (FSA). However both are only available for the United Kingdom as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.8/2">The Council of Mortgage Lenders latest press release on this is on their website at:</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.8/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.cml.org.uk/cml/media/press/2262">http://www.cml.org.uk/cml/media/press/2262</a></p>
	<p pid="a.466W.8/4">The CML data on repossessions are no longer freely available from their website. For detailed time series information members of the public can request to subscribe to CML to obtain access to a restricted website.</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.8/5">The Financial Services Authority data are available on their website at</p>
	<p pid="a.466W.8/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/Doing/Regulated/Returns/IRR/statistics/">http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/Doing/Regulated/Returns/IRR/statistics/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.466W.8/7">The CML and FSA release slightly different figures. The CML data is for repossessions on first-charge mortgages only, including Buy-to-Let mortgages, as issued by their members. CML estimate that their lenders currently account for 98 per cent. of mortgage lending. The FSA data, as well as covering possessions on first-charge mortgages, cover possessions on second-charge loans by Regulated firms (many second charge lenders are not regulated) but do not cover possessions as comprehensively on Buy-to-Let mortgages, as some of these are from unregulated firms. The overall effect of the differences is that the FSA's statistics on possessions are slightly higher.</p>
