	<p pid="c.435W.6/1">DFID has raised this matter with the UN Development Programme (UNDP). UNDP has carried out an investigation which failed to reveal any evidence to support that allegation. Subsequently, UNDP invited all its staff in Burma to complete a detailed confidential questionnaire on transparency, accountability and conflict of interest issues. UNDP is currently analysing the responses.</p>
	<p pid="c.435W.6/2">UNDP take incidents and allegations of misconduct extremely seriously, and continue to seek ways to ensure that transparency and accountability are a priority of their programme in Burma. UNDP has reviewed the operational procedures of their programmes and have begun to put in place additional safeguards to ensure the efficient, effective and appropriate use of resources. An internal oversight unit is now being established and a more robust grievance mechanism set up to deal with issues raised by staff, beneficiaries, various other stakeholders and the general public. A code of conduct training for all UN staff in Burma is due to begin soon, focusing on, among other things, transparency, accountability, conflict of interest, abuse of authority and harassment.</p>

We also paid for the British leader of the UN's disaster assessment and coordination team. Our assessment of the people affected by the earthquake showed that funding in this way was the best way for DFID to support those most in need. We will monitor progress.</p>
	<p pid="c.438W.5/2">The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (UN CERF) has allocated US $9.6 million. The United Kingdom is the largest donor to the UN CERF, contributing 25 per cent. of its budget this year based on current calculations (the UK has provided $83.7 million of $329 million so far contributed).</p>
	<p pid="c.438W.5/3">The European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) provided &euro;8 million. DFID's share via ECHO was approximately &pound;970,000&mdash;17.4 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.440W.3/1">We now have over 1,400 children's centres up and running providing services to, predominantly, the most disadvantaged communities. The National Evaluation of Sure Start (NESS) findings on the early impact of 150 of the first Sure Start Local Programmes (SSLPs) (November 2005) identified that of those families in the most disadvantaged areas served by SSLPs, 86 per cent. of the parents in the sample were benefiting from Sure Start. However, this evaluation also found that some of the most socially excluded groups could not be shown to be benefiting from living in a SSLP area. Although the NESS methodology could not identify whether any of the children in the sample had actually attended a Sure Start centre or not, we have taken a number of steps to ensure that the most excluded partners benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.440W.3/2" class="indent">In November 2005 the Department issued 'Practice Guidance' to encourage greater use of outreach and home-visiting services by children's centres to reach the most disadvantaged families, which we then updated in November 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.440W.3/3" class="indent">To encourage better monitoring and a more systematic approach we issued Planning and Performance Management Guidance in November 2006 which contains a framework for centres to assess their progress in reaching excluded groups in their area.</p>
	<p pid="c.440W.3/4" class="indent">We also commissioned Together for Children (TfC) to produce a toolkit, issued in December 2006, to complement our Practice Guidance and support centres in gathering information about their area and recording how they engage with excluded groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.440W.3/5" class="indent">In August, we announced significant additional funds for children's centres for 2008-11 including funding to enable local authorities to add two outreach workers to centres serving the most disadvantaged communities, with a particular emphasis on reaching out to and supporting more fathers.</p>
	<p pid="c.440W.3/6">Research evidence shows that the impact a father's early involvement has on their child is long-lasting. Our revised Practice Guidance therefore emphasises the crucial role fathers have to play in giving their children the best start in life. It provides advice about how children's centres can tailor their services to meet the needs of fathers, including non-resident parents, how staff should be encouraged to engage proactively with fathers and specific areas where fathers may require additional support. The Planning and Performance Management guidance recommends that children's centres assess how well they engage with fathers and the TfC toolkit includes advice on working with fathers.</p>
	<p pid="c.440W.3/7">We have not made an assessment of how well children's centres work with organisations from the community sector. However, an early survey of Phase 1 children's centres showed that 82 per cent. of children's centres had contracts with the voluntary sector for services. The Practice Guidance makes clear that local authorities must work with those organisations that have a track record of understanding local needs and delivering services that improve children's outcomes. In addition, we require local authorities to consult and consider using all private, voluntary and community sector organisations in the area when planning and developing children's centres services. In 2008, local authorities must review all centres developed in 2003-06 to ensure that maximum use has been made of good quality local private, voluntary and community sector suppliers and repeat this exercise every two years. We expect local authorities to keep evidence that they have carried out the required reviews.</p>

It is for primary care trusts in partnership with local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, outlined in the national service frameworks, and to commission services accordingly.

The review will report by summer 2008 and will build on the investment and improvements to SLT and resources in the last 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.443W.3/4">Information about waiting times for SLT provided by the national health service (NHS) are not collected centrally. The Department of Health collects waiting times information by consultant led specialties. SLT is not a consultant led speciality.

	<p pid="c.445W.9/1">The hon. Member's questions appear to concern the dredging of marine minerals (the extraction of sand and gravel from the seabed to be landed for use in construction or beach maintenance) rather than dredging more generally. I will therefore confine my answer to this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.445W.9/2">The Crown Estate, as landowner up to 12 miles offshore and the owner of the rights to non-energy minerals within the UK continental shelf and beyond, issues licences to dredge for marine minerals. Thirteen licences were issued in the last 10 years. The numbers issued in each year are set out in Table 1. No licences were issued for dredging off the coast of the East Riding of Yorkshire in this period and no marine minerals dredging is currently licensed there. The closest that any such dredging currently takes place to this coast is to the south of Spurn Head and some 10 kilometres off the coast of Lincolnshire which the Crown Estate refers to as the Humber region for administrative purposes. Two licences were issued in this area, in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="c.445W.9/3">No licences were refused during this period. Licence proposals that were likely to be refused were either abandoned by the prospective applicant before submission as applications, or withdrawn before any formal decision was made.</p>

This work supports the Government's increasingly sophisticated management of aggregate extraction integrated with the protection of resources of conservation and heritage significance. We are not aware of any scientific evidence to indicate that marine minerals dredging, as controlled by the Government since 1968, has had any effect on the coast or significantly affected the marine environment.

	<p pid="c.450W.0/2">The drainage systems of laboratories licensed by the Department to handle specified animal pathogens under the Specified Animal Pathogens Order (SAPO) 1998 are not routinely inspected. The responsibility for the integrity of the buildings and infrastructure rests with the licensee and the owners of the site. No specific concerns that would have suggested that the integrity of the effluent pipe system at Pirbright was at risk, were raised with DEFRA as licensor and regulator. DEFRA was not asked by the Institute for Animal Health (IAH) for money to replace or renew the drainage system because of concerns about the risk of effluent leakage. Any issues relating to funding of the effluent drainage system, whether remedial or replacement, would be a matter for the IAH and Merial (as the occupants of the Pirbright site), the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (which owns the land and buildings on the Pirbright site) and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) (as the IAH's and BBSRC's sponsoring Department).</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.0/3">Until the investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) into potential biosecurity breaches at Pirbright was under way, there was no indication that there was a risk of effluent escaping from the drainage system; although there had been some concerns over the possibility of water leaking into the drains via the manhole covers, that was brought to DEFRA's attention. However, it had been recognised that the system was old. The HSE informed DEFRA Ministers, on <phrase class="date" code="">17 August</phrase>, that leaks could have occurred from the system. On the same day, DEFRA contacted the IAH, which that afternoon put into effect a plan controlling access and strengthening biosecurity measures for movement of people and vehicles. The report from the HSE investigation contains a detailed inspection of the drainage system, and is available from the DEFRA website and the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.450W.3/2">DEFRA is the licensor and regulator of the Institute for Animal Health (IAH) under the Specified Animal Pathogens Order (SAPO) 1998. Prior to the Health and Safety Executive's advice in August 2007, neither the IAH, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), as owners of the site, nor anyone else raised concerns with DEFRA about possible biosecurity issues relating to the effluent drainage system.</p>
	<p pid="c.450W.3/3">Any issues relating to funding of the effluent drainage system, whether remedial or replacement, would be a matter for the IAH and Merial (as the occupants of the Pirbright site), BBSRC (as the IAH's funding body) and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) (as the IAH's and BBSRC's sponsoring Department). In its role as licensor and regulator, DEFRA was consulted about the requirements and specifications of a replacement effluent drainage system to meet extra capacity demand and to address concerns about water getting into the drains via the manhole covers, and was kept informed of progress in relation to instigation of the work. At no stage was any indication given to DEFRA, that there might be possible implications for biosecurity resulting from delays in agreeing funding between the parties concerned.</p>

	<p pid="c.451W.2/2">The amount a customer is paying for their energy is one of the key determinants of whether such a household might be in fuel poverty, and we acknowledged in the Energy White Paper that the gap between direct debit and other payment methods has been increasing. I am encouraged by the work of Ofgem to highlight the savings prepayment customers can make by switching to a cheaper supplier. However, use of prepayment meters is not wholly synonymous with fuel poverty, and the majority of fuel poor customers pay for their gas and electricity by direct debit or standard credit. We will publish shortly our annual Fuel Poverty Progress Report which will include the latest data and projections on fuel poverty levels and a full examination of the factors driving the levels of fuel poverty, including energy market issues.</p>

	<p pid="c.463W.3/3">We are determined that local authorities should have the resources they need to fulfil the statutory duty to secure, so far as is reasonably practicable, sufficient childcare to meet the needs of working parents. Accordingly, from April 2008 the Sure Start, Early Years and Childcare Grant will include an appropriate allocation. Successive sufficiency assessments conducted by local authorities will indicate their success in closing gaps in provision; and the Government offices for the regions will also monitor authorities' progress in securing sufficiency. It will be open to anyone who believes they have been the victim of maladministration by local authorities in relation to the sufficiency duty to seek redress through various means, including the Local Government Ombudsman.</p>
	<p pid="c.463W.3/4">The Government do not consider that it would be appropriate to introduce a system of financial rewards and penalties in relation to fulfilment of this statutory duty.</p>

	<p pid="c.464W.2/1">The latest figures based on the position at <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase> are that 6,854 staff across the department have declared that they are disabled. As a proportion of staff who have declared a disability status of 115,525, this equates to 5.93 per cent. of staff. Individual agency figures are contained in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="c.464W.2/2">The figures are based on the proportion of staff who have voluntarily declared themselves as being disabled. However, we are aware that not all disabled staff declare their disability for departmental records, and the true figure may be higher than the figures shown. For example, the 2006 DWP Staff Survey (which is completed anonymously), showed that 13 per cent. of respondents considered themselves to have a long standing health condition or disability.</p>
	<p pid="c.464W.2/3">The roll out of a new computer system by the end of April has meant a more accurate assessment of the numbers of disabled people working within the Department. As we roll out we are asking each member of staff to check the personal information we hold about them and to declare whether they consider themselves to be disabled. A further joint communications exercise with departmental trade unions to highlight the importance of individuals providing this information is also planned.</p>

	<p pid="c.466W.5/26">The error arose because the method used to select the data was incorrect in that complete work histories were looked at instead of the national insurance record at the specific ages.

	<p pid="c.468W.2/2">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.2/3" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie dated, <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.2/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about applications for benefits and emergency Crisis Loans by telephone. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.2/5" class="indent">Contact Centres were introduced partly in response to the Government's desire to offer a modernised service and partly to respond to customer feedback that Jobcentre Plus services should be handled by phone.</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.2/6" class="indent">Contact Centres:</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.2/7" class="indent">are generally more convenient for customers to access (i.e. removes the need to visit a local office);</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.2/8" class="indent">can offer services over longer opening hours more cost effectively; and</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.2/9" class="indent">can deliver services more efficiently (e.g. through the more efficient use of space and the better utilisation of staff time).</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.2/10" class="indent">We take new claims over the telephone as this ensures that we have all the necessary information to complete the claim, therefore minimising any potential delay. However, customers who have difficulty using the telephone for whatever reason can request a face-to-face interview or, where appropriate, a home visit. They can also choose to claim using a clerical claim form.</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.2/11" class="indent">Customers are not currently permitted to use customer access phones in Jobcentres to make claims for crisis loans. This decision is being reviewed following a request from the Work and Pensions Select Committee and because it is appropriate to keep under review the risks associated with customer reaction to negative decisions. Consultation with relevant parties is underway with specific attention being paid to the issue of access to customers, particularly those who only have the use of mobile phones.</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.2/12" class="indent">Information is not available regarding the type of telephone used by customers to contact us, as we cannot identify and do not record whether the customer is using a mobile (pay-as-you-go or other) or landline.</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.2/13" class="indent">We have recently introduced management information to assess disconnected calls during the automated menu options. The months with complete data are June and July 2007 when we received in total 1,197,960 calls to the First Contact Interactive Voice Response. Of these, 155,466 have been disconnected by the customer before being transferred to the queue. Indications for this point to the fact that customers do not have all the information required to make a claim when going through the Interactive Voice Response.</p>
	<p pid="c.468W.2/14" class="indent">Information is not available on how often customer service agents offer alternative means to claim benefits. However, staff have clear guidance on the circumstances in which customers should be offered different options.</p>

	<p pid="c.472W.5/1">The use of animals in experiments and other scientific procedures is regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, which puts into effect, and in some ways exceeds, European Union Directive 86/609/EEC. The 1986 Act provides a strong regulatory framework balancing the need to protect animals from unnecessary suffering with the legitimate requirements of the scientific community, and the public, for medical and other essential research and testing.</p>
	<p pid="c.472W.5/2">The operation of the 1986 Act has been regularly reviewed since it first came into force. Full-scale reviews have been carried out by the Animal Procedures Committee which published its 10 year review of the operation of the Act in 1998, and by the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures which reported in July 2002. In addition, specific aspects of the operation of the 1986 Act have been reviewed at various times by the Animal Procedures Committee, which is required under section 20 of the Act to advise the Secretary of State on matters concerned with Act and her functions under it. The Animal Procedures Committee has, for example, in the last five years, reviewed the use and acquisition of non-human primates, the cost benefit assessment of the use of animals in research, the Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals published under section 21 of the Act, modular training for licence applicants and schedule 1 to the Act dealing with appropriate methods of humane killing</p>
	<p pid="c.472W.5/3">In due course, the current revision of Directive 86/609 will provide a further opportunity to review the regulation of animal experiments.</p>

Changes to the offence coverage in 1998, the detections guidance in 1999 and the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in 2002 mean that data for 1997 are not directly comparable with that for 2006-07.

If there is a match the police are notified and make further inquiries. The NDNAD holds the person's name, date of birth, ethnic appearance, gender, a link to any record on the police national computer, and information about the police force which took the sample. This is sufficient for the police to be able to contact the person if required. It is not necessary for the NDNAD itself to hold the person's postal address.</p>
	<p pid="c.477W.0/2">The address someone is living at when a DNA sample is taken from them will of course become outdated when they move, so adding this address would impose extra work on the police for the sake of information which in many cases would soon become out of date. In order to keep address information accurate, it would be necessary to monitor changes of address of the 4 million people on the database. This would be expensive and intrusive without adding anything useful to police operations.</p>

Regular discussions, however, are held with EU counterparts, both at ministerial and official level, about a range of judicial cooperation issues including, from time to time, about bringing to justice alleged genocidaires from Rwanda. No one fleeing prosecution in that country should expect to find safe haven or to enjoy impunity within the EU. That is why the Government have entered into special extradition arrangements with Rwanda in respect of four cases currently before the courts.</p>

	<p pid="c.479W.8/1">It is important that pay arrangements for the police are both fair and affordable, for the taxpayer as well as the police service. This is why the Government asked Sir Clive Booth to conduct a review of police pay. His recommendations were published in a written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-21">21 February 2007</phrase>, and they recommended an interim index linking increases in police officer pay to increases in the public sector. This was the basis of the 2007 pay offer to police officers. The Government made clear in their ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="">21 February</phrase> that Sir Clive Booth's recommendations would be taken forward through the Police Negotiation Board (PNB). We are disappointed that the PNB failed to reach agreement. The matter has now been referred to the Police Arbitration Tribunal. Before my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary makes her decision on the police pay award for 2007, she will consider very carefully the recommendations that result from this process.</p>

	<p pid="c.480W.8/1">In spring 2007, the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) carried out a review of its use of stop and search powers under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000. One of the recommendations was to continue to apply appropriately for the authority. Another recommendation was to raise public awareness about the powers. As part of that commendation, the MPS are publishing stop and search figures for each London borough on a monthly basis. Lord Carlile of Berriew also assesses the use of section 44 in his capacity as Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.480W.8/2">National guidance for the police on the use of section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 was published in July 2006 by the National Centre for Policing Excellence. One of the key aims of the guidance was to set out a framework for the use of section 44 powers to ensure that they are used appropriately by officers on the ground. In August 2006, the Home Office produced a circular for the police on the use of section 44. This included a requirement for the authorising officer to provide details of the community impact assessment made prior to authorising the powers.</p>

	<p pid="c.482W.6/2">HM Revenue and Customs publishes a regional breakdown for trade in goods going back to 2000. Their figure for 2000 for exports of goods from Yorkshire and the Humber was &pound;8.8 billion compared with &pound;12.7 billion in 2006; the 2006 figure may have been affected by transactions associated with missing trader VAT fraud. In 2000 this was about 14.5 per cent. of regional gross value added; regional GVA figures for 2006 are not yet available, but the comparable figure is likely to be about 15.4 per cent. For imports of goods, equivalent figures are &pound;10.7 billion and 17.6 per cent. in 2000, and &pound;14.1 billion and 17.1 per cent. in 2006. Similar data for regional trade in services are not available.</p>

	<p pid="c.484W.2/2">BBC Trust appointments are among those regulated by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. We believe the scrutiny afforded by existing arrangements, which include the involvement of an OCPA trained independent assessor throughout, is sufficient. We do not therefore plan to consider introducing pre-appointment parliamentary scrutiny or confirmation hearings for future appointments to the BBC Trust.</p>
	<p pid="c.484W.2/3">This is consistent with proposals set out in the Government Green Paper &quot;The Governance of Britain&quot; (July 2007), which accepts there are a number of positions in which Parliament has a particularly strong interest because the office holder exercises statutory or other powers in relation to protecting the public's rights and interests. The Government believe that Parliament, through its Select Committees, may play a valuable role where such appointments are not subject to oversight by the Commissioner for Public Appointments or other form of independent scrutiny.</p>

Although we do not have information on coverage for individual constituencies, Ofcom estimates that around 97 per cent. of households in the STV North region and around 99.4 per cent. in STV Central region will be capable of receiving a high quality and robust signal after digital switchover.

	<p pid="c.489W.9/14">Provisional figures suggest that the total quantity of biofuel released for consumption over the first eight months of 2007 amounted to some 318 million litres, or around 1 per cent. of total road transport fuel sales. The Government do not hold precise data on the origin of these fuels, and information on the carbon savings associated with them is not available. All of the bioethanol over the period in question was imported, whereas a significant amount of the biodiesel was produced in the UK. During 2006 and 2007, however, imports of biodiesel rose sharply.</p>
	<p pid="c.489W.9/15">The Government are due to introduce a Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) in April 2008. This should create a demand for around 1 billion litres of biofuel in 2008, rising to around 1.75 billion litres in 2009 and 2.5 billion litres in 2010. We anticipate that this demand will be met by both imported and domestically produced biofuels. The carbon savings will depend on a number of factors, including the carbon intensity of the biofuels transport fuel suppliers choose to source. The RTFO's reporting requirements are designed to provide a strong incentive for transport fuel suppliers to source sustainable, low-carbon biofuels.</p>
	<p pid="c.489W.9/16">The Government have also announced that from 2010-11 they aim to reward biofuels under the RTFO according to the amount of carbon they save. This should provide greater certainty over the level of carbon savings that the biofuels should deliver. Further details are set out in an informal policy paper which is available via this Department's website at</p>

	<p pid="c.496W.11/1">The national collision statistical reporting form (commonly known as STATS19) is used to collect standard information, when a personal injury road accident is reported to the police. The information is collected by the police at the scene of the accident or in a minority of cases it is reported on by a member of the public at a police station. Some 50 data items are collected for each accident, including the time, location and circumstances of the accident, the vehicles involved and some information on each casualty. After processing this information is then forwarded by each police force (via local processing authorities in the case of some forces) to the Department electronically and entered into a database. The data are checked, analysed and detailed results published annually in &quot;Road Casualties Great Britain&quot;. In addition quarterly estimates of casualties are published, based on provisional data returns.</p>
	<p pid="c.496W.11/2">The current data collection system was set up in 1979 following a wide ranging review. The statistics are used to inform public debate on matters of road safety and to provide the basis for determining and monitoring road safety policy at the local and national level. National and local government and local police forces work closely to achieve an agreed national reporting standard. The form is subject to quinquennial reviews which consider any amendments that may be required. Changes are agreed by the Steering Committee on Road Accidents Statistics (SCRAS) which was set up in 1977 to oversee the process for road accident data collection. The membership of the committee is drawn from a wide range of bodies and includes representatives of central government, local government and the police.</p>
	<p pid="c.496W.11/3">A copy of the current form used by the police (introduced January 2005) can be found on page 173 in &quot;Road Casualties Great Britain: 2006 annual report&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-27">27 September 2007</phrase>.

	<p pid="c.500W.9/1">The casualty reporting and notification process has been co-ordinated by the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (JCCC) at RAF Innsworth since 2005 and all information is routed through it. Casualty reporting from Afghanistan and Iraq has been further streamlined by the introduction of the Joint Personnel Administration system into these theatres in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.500W.9/2">Casualty figures for Afghanistan and Iraq are now published twice-monthly a fortnight in arrears (previously monthly a month in arrears) and, in conjunction with JCCC, the Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA) has conducted an exercise to validate historical operational casualty data from January 2001 onwards. The results of their analysis, together with current Aeromedical Evacuation and hospital patient data, have been published on the internet at:</p>

	<p pid="c.500W.9/6">Furthermore, as I announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-25">25 July 2007</phrase>, MOD has moved from a system of recording and reporting mental health statistics relating solely to Operation TELIC (Iraq) to a new system covering all in-service personnel assessed with a mental health disorder at our out-patient Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMH). The report also includes a return for new in-patient admissions under the MOD's contract with the Priory Group. These are published quarterly by the Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA), and the first report, for the period January&mdash;March 2007, is available on their website at:</p>

These standards set out, among other things, the minimum level for residential accommodation for care homes regulated by the CSCI.</p>

	<p pid="c.512W.6/3">For those people entering residential care, the Government have taken steps to help people avoid selling their homes to pay for residential care. Since October 2001, councils have been able to enter into deferred payments agreements with residents. Under this, the council place a legal charge on the resident's former home which is not collected until the end of the contract. This gives people more options for meeting care home fees.</p>

	<p pid="c.525W.2/1">Data on capacity for medium secure services are not routinely collected by the Department. The Department works to support local commissioners, as it is the responsibility of local commissioners to assess service needs in their area and plan accordingly. A capacity review of high and medium secure services was completed in January 2006 in order to inform policy on this issue and to help support commissioners. This capacity review took into consideration historical utilisation, changing legislation (e.g. draft Mental Health Bill and public protection orders), court sentencing trends, prison transfers and the needs of different patient groups (e.g. women, learning disabled men, patients with dangerous and severe personality disorder and deaf patients).</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.2/2">The review concluded that the need for medium secure capacity was gradually rising and robust local commissioning plans were necessary to ensure that there was strategic planning on a regional basis to deliver additional medium secure capacity in a co-ordinated way and to ensure that commissioning delivered good value for money. As at January 2006 when the review took place, there were 29 national health service medium secure units providing around 1,972 beds, with a further 1,500 beds provided by the independent sector. This has now increased and there are 32 NHS medium secure units.</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.2/3">The capacity review set out three projections for increases in medium secure capacity, based on variations in trends. The low projections were the lowest capacity increase likely and the high projections were the highest capacity increase likely. The medium projections were the most likely and, in subsequent discussions with stakeholders, the medium projections were thought to be reasonable. An extract from the review with a breakdown of capacity and projections by catchment areas is shown in the following tables. In total, the medium projections in the capacity review predicted an increase in capacity of 614 beds for men and 85 beds for women between 2005-06 and 2010-11, so a total of 699 beds. The NHS is on course to exceed this projected increase in capacity in medium secure services, as long as outlined local plans are followed.</p>
	<p pid="c.525W.2/4">The NHS have been working on local commissioning plans to ensure strategic planning on a regional basis. These local commissioning plans are under constant review by local commissioners and are updated to take account of changing local circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="c.527W.3/2">2005 under-18 conception rate data&mdash;published by the Office for National Statistics in February 2007&mdash;showed that since the 1998 baseline year, the under-18 conception rate in England fell by 11.8 per cent., to its lowest level for over 20 years. The under-16 rate fell by 12.1 per cent. over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="c.527W.3/3">Notwithstanding these achievements, we need to see faster progress in order to achieve the challenging target of halving the under-18 conception rate by 2010. Consequently, we have issued guidance to local authorities and primary care trusts, setting out the key features of local strategies in areas where teenage conception rates have fallen fastest. All areas have been asked to review their strategies against this guidance, with a view to raising all areas' performance to the levels of the best. If all areas had performed as well as the top quartile, the national reduction would be 26 per cent.&mdash;more than twice the 11.8 per cent. reduction that has actually been achieved.</p>

Government investment in hospital based funding has helped increase donor rates and an organ donor taskforce will report to Ministers in autumn 2007 on how organ donor rates can be further improved. Following the publication of the Chief Medical Officer's annual report in July, the taskforce will also examine the potential impact on organ donation of introducing an opt out or presumed consent scheme.</p>

The NHS Information Centre has investigated with North West Strategic Health Authority and North Cheshire Hospitals NHS Trust the reason for the reported decrease in the number of FCEs with an operation. The main cause of this decrease is that between 2002-03 and 2004-05 the trust stopped recoding certain procedures as being performed in a day case setting and started recording them as being performed in outpatients. Information is not available centrally on total procedures performed in outpatients. Data reclassification issues are being picked up by the Information Centre and the Audit Commission. From April 2007 onwards the trust will revert to counting this activity as a day case.<br/>  2. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)<br/>  An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br/>  3. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE) with an Operation<br/>  A count of FCEs with an operation is the number of episodes with at least one coded procedure field. Please note that more procedures are carried out than finished consultant episodes with an operation. For example, patients under going a cataract operation would tend to have at least two procedures&mdash;removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one&mdash;counted in a single finished consultant episode.<br/>  4. Data Quality<br/>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS Trusts and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 5. Ungrossed data<br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.529W.2/1">The Prime Minister launched the Transforming Community Equipment and Wheelchair Services Programme in June 2006 to work collaboratively with stakeholders to develop a radical new model for delivery of community equipment and wheelchair services in England, which has users and carers at its heart. The intention was to look at the two services in parallel, but this has not been feasible.</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.2/2">Two potential models were developed for wheelchair services. However, without robust data it was not possible to make recommendations for the way forward. This is of particular concern in view of the successive reports over the last 20 years which have consistently argued for modernisation and investment in the wheelchair services. A further data gathering exercise was agreed, this will report back to the Ministers in December 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.2/3">The programme has engaged with users, carers and organisations that represent them since the beginning. This continues through the user representative group and a user and carer questionnaire.</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.2/4">We have been working with individual wheelchair users and carers of people who use wheelchairs as well as representatives of:</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.2/5" class="indent">Action for Kids;</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.2/6" class="indent">Muscular Dystrophy Campaign;</p>

	<p pid="c.529W.2/13" class="indent">Motor Neurone Disease Association.</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.2/14">The questionnaire offers users and carers an opportunity to comment on the chairs they currently have and make suggestions for change. It is available on the CSED website at:</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.2/15" class="indent"><a href="http://www.csed.csip.org.uk/workstreams/transforming-community-equipment-wheelchair-services/wheelchair-services/wheelchair-services-user-questionnaire.html">www.csed.csip.org.uk/workstreams/transforming-community-equipment-wheelchair-services/wheelchair-services/wheelchair-services-user-questionnaire.html</a></p>
	<p pid="c.529W.2/16">and through the third sector organisations both through their publications and websites. Wheelchair services are also helping reach those users and carers who are unable to access the web.</p>
	<p pid="c.529W.2/17">The analysis of the questionnaires will continue until the end of November and the results will feed into the development of the business case.</p>

	<p pid="c.535W.2/1">The Government do not carry out independent assessments of the heroin and poppy production in Afghanistan. Poppy cultivation figures are measured by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The figures do not take into account the control of land on which poppy is cultivated. Nor has there been a study defining locations of heroin laboratories on land inside or outside of government control. But there is a clear link between poppy cultivation and insecurity, shown by the fact that over 75 per cent. cultivation takes place in the least secure southern provinces. In the more secure central and northern regions, cultivation generally appears to be decreasing or stabilising. The number of &quot;poppy free provinces&quot; has increased from six in 2006 to 13 in 2007, demonstrating that where the integrated approach set out in the government of Afghanistan's national drug control strategy can be brought to bear, it is delivering results.</p>

	<p pid="c.538W.2/1">Gross domestic product (GDP) per head calculations rely on information about economic activity (GDP) and population. All GDP calculations are made by the overseas territories (OTs), who employ either specialised statisticians or analysts. The accuracy of GDP depends on the analytical input that such small offices are able to devote to calculating it. Population data are based on a census, which is usually carried out every few years, as in the United Kingdom. Population estimates have to be made for intermediate years.</p>
	<p pid="c.538W.2/2">Therefore GDP per capita figures will vary in accuracy, and it is not unusual for estimates to be revised after they have been published. The varying populations of the OTs compound this&mdash;a small change in population can have a bigger effect on GDP per capita.</p>

	<p pid="c.546W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has not made representations about Papua to the Government of Indonesia.</p>
	<p pid="c.546W.2/2">Our embassy in Jakarta regularly discusses Papua with the Indonesian authorities and pushes for greater EU engagement on human rights issues including those related to Papua. The human rights situation in Indonesia has improved considerably in recent years and we assess that President Yudhoyono is sincere in his attempts to push through reforms, including in the security sector. The current peace process in Aceh is an indication of his willingness to be flexible in trying to address some of the long-running conflicts in Indonesia, and success here will make it easier for him to address the Papuan question effectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.546W.2/3">We believe that the best way to resolve the complex issues in Papua is through promoting peaceful dialogue between Papuan groups and the Indonesian government. We are in contact with Papuan activist groups in the UK and encourage dialogue between them and the Government of Indonesia.</p>
	<p pid="c.546W.2/4">We are not aware of any specific issues concerning environmental activists in Papua.</p>
	<p pid="c.546W.2/5">Officials from our embassy in Jakarta have raised the cases of Filip Karma and Yusak Pakage with the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Their defence lawyer told embassy officials that prison conditions were adequate and the two men were treated reasonably.</p>
	<p pid="c.546W.2/6">We have urged the Government of Indonesia to uphold the rights guaranteed through the International Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ratified by Indonesia in September 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.546W.2/7">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary is aware of the visit to Indonesia by UN Special Representative, Hina Jilani, but has had no direct discussion with her on the issue of Papua. Ms Jilani has received no reports from the UK Mission to the UN following her visit.</p>
	<p pid="c.546W.2/8">The UK, with our EU partners, is working towards greater engagement with the Indonesian government in support of human rights defenders. The EU presidency is in the process of discussing the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders with the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and hopes to work with them on this important issue in the near future.</p>

We do so through our embassy in Pyongyang and through contact with the North Korean embassy in London, as well as through the EU and UN.</p>
	<p pid="c.547W.2/2">We and EU partners have also been instrumental in creating&mdash;and retaining&mdash;the position of UN Special Rapporteur on Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) human rights, and have sponsored a number of UN resolutions calling on the North Korean government to honour its UN commitments on human rights. The UN has also lobbied the government on specific individuals' cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.547W.2/3">The Government will continue to press the North Korean authorities on human rights abuses at every opportunity, urging them in particular to cooperate with UN mechanisms and to allow international monitors access to the country to verify or disprove reports of human rights abuses. It is deeply frustrating that the DPRK government has not responded to these requests.</p>

	<p pid="c.553W.8/1">The Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement does not include any provisions on wealth sharing between Khartoum and the eastern states, although it has established a Reconstruction and Development Fund for Eastern Sudan.</p>
	<p pid="c.553W.8/2">Fiscal relations between the federal and state governments in Sudan are covered in the Wealth Sharing Protocol of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). The UK monitors the implementation of the Protocol, and the activities of the Fiscal and Financial Allocation and Monitoring Commission (FFAMC) set up to carry this out, through its participation in the Wealth Sharing Group of the CPA Assessment and Evaluation Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.553W.8/3">The FFAMC proposed a revised formula for the allocation of revenue which was adopted for the 2007 federal budget. This new formula should result in the more equitable allocation of resources, although evidence to date shows that there are still some discrepancies between budgeted and actual transfers.</p>
	<p pid="c.553W.8/4">The UK continues to monitor the new arrangements for wealth sharing and to work with others, including the World Bank, to bring about fiscal reform across Sudan.</p>

	<p pid="c.583W.3/1">The UK supports an open, transparent and meritocratic process for the selection of the Managing Director of the IMF, with the best candidate for the job selected regardless of nationality.

	<p pid="c.583W.3/2">In selecting the successor to Rodrigo de Rato, the IMF's Executive Board put in place for the first time a selection process designed to deliver the UK's preferred objectives.

All of these steps were followed and by the close of nominations on <phrase class="date" code="">31 August</phrase> two highly credible candidates had been put forward: Dominique Strauss-Kahn of France and Josef Tosovsky of the Czech Republic.</p>
	<p pid="c.583W.3/3">Before determining which of the two candidates to support, the UK compared their qualifications and experience to the job description set out by the Executive Board, available on the IMF website at <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2007/pr07159.htm">www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2007/pr07159.htm</a> and concluded that Dominique Strauss-Kahn would be best able to succeed in pushing forward significant reform at the Fund.
