	<p pid="b.967W.9/1">Currently the Warm Front scheme in England provides support to private housing tenures, including the private rented sector. In addition, the carbon emissions reduction target, which was extended to December 2012, sets new requirements on suppliers to increase the proportion of benefits (energy efficiency measures like insulation) going to the most vulnerable low income, family, pensioner and disabled households.</p>
	<p pid="b.967W.9/2">From late 2012, the Green Deal, the Government will help to improve the energy efficiency of all households, including those in fuel poverty in the private rented sector. The Green Deal will be supported by the energy company obligation (ECO). As well as driving carbon savings, the ECO will have a significant focus on providing &#8216;Affordable Warmth&#8217; to support the lowest income and most vulnerable, contributing to the Government's efforts to alleviate fuel poverty. We will be consulting shortly on eligibility for this element of the ECO, taking into account evidence on fuel poverty in different tenures, as part of our wider consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.967W.9/3">Furthermore, provisions in the Energy Bill will further target the private rented sector by making it unlawful for landlords to rent out properties that do not reach a minimum standard energy efficiency from 2018. In addition, from 2016, all tenants should not be unreasonably refused consent from their landlords to make reasonable energy efficiency improvements.</p>
	<p pid="b.967W.9/4">We continue to engage across Government on this issue.</p>

We are also considering what, if any, retraining existing slaughterhouse staff will be required to undertake before being given a certificate of competence under the new regulation.

	<p pid="b.978W.0/2">On tapeworm controls (Echinococus Multilocularis), following representations made by the UK, the European Commission has come forward with a proposal that would enable us to retain tapeworm controls (applying the treatment one to five days before travel). We have decided that the evidence doesn't justify taxpayer funded maintenance of tick controls (although pet owners could choose to do so if they wish as part of wider animal welfare considerations) and we are working with veterinary and welfare organisations to ensure that those travelling with their pets are provided with the necessary advice.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.0/3">Other non-endemic parasites posing a serious threat to public health (e.g. Leishmaniasis) are transmitted by insect vectors such as some species of sandfly which are not established in the UK. As such, there is negligible risk of the disease becoming established in the UK and there is no evidence to suggest we should introduce controls now.</p>

AHLVA is responsible for checking imports of shell eggs from third countries. This is done at the point of entry.</p>

	<p pid="b.979W.5/2">AHVLA are in the process of obtaining approval for them from DEFRA. AHVLA intend to retain laboratory services workgroups at eight sites compared to 14 at present.

	<p pid="b.981W.3/3">As the Chapel is primarily a place of worship, services, rehearsals and other authorised events should not be disrupted by visitors. Similarly individuals who use the chapel for private prayer and contemplation should not be unduly disturbed by tours.</p>

	<p pid="b.981W.3/5">The size and number of visiting groups should be regulated in accordance with safety considerations to take account of the narrow access, layout of the chapel and lack of emergency exits (when the Chapel is not being used for an event).</p>

	<p pid="b.986W.2/1">Decisions about in-service training for school staff are matters for schools, taken in light of the training needs of the schools. The Department has previously provided in-service training materials on autism and is currently funding the Autism Education Trust to develop a competency framework for staff working with children with autism and to provide training for some 5,000 staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.986W.2/2">The Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) has provided units on autism within a comprehensive training pack for the providers of initial teacher training and induction. These are freely available. The TDA is currently developing materials for advanced-level continuous professional development, including materials on autism. The special educational needs (SEN) and disability Green Paper made a commitment to help local networks of schools to develop teachers with specialist skills and knowledge, including specialist autism skills, who can be deployed across local clusters of schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.986W.2/3">The SEN Code of Practice, which schools must take into account when they are providing for children with SEN, advises schools, with the informed consent of and involvement of the child's parents, to consult the school health service or the child's general practitioner about whether a medical condition may be contributing to the child's difficulties in school.</p>
	<p pid="b.986W.2/4">The National Scholarship Fund for Teachers is seeking applications from serving teachers by <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-30">30 September</phrase>. We anticipate that around half of the estimated 600 Scholarships in the first round will be awarded for qualifications in special educational needs, which could include studies in autism. In the Green Paper we announce that we would be launching an additional fund, open to the most able teaching assistants and other support staff, to enable them to build on their special educational needs support roles and develop their careers further. We will be working with the Training and Development Agency for Schools on the development of such scholarships.</p>

	<p pid="b.986W.5/2">Local authorities have a duty (under section 6 of the Childcare Act 2006) to ensure that there is sufficient child care locally to meet the needs of working parents and particularly families with disabled children. We want to improve the way in which local authorities keep parents informed about what they are doing to deliver this duty. The Government announced in the &#8220;Families in the Foundation Years&#8221; statement, published in July 2011, the intention to bring forward proposals that local authorities should report annually on their section 6 sufficiency duty, and in particular how they are supporting families of children with disabilities to access child care, available at:</p>
	<p pid="b.986W.5/3"><a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/earlylearningandchildcare/early">http://www.education.gov.uk/childrenandyoungpeople/earlylearningandchildcare/early</a></p>
	<p pid="b.986W.5/4">Local authorities have told us that the requirement (under section 11 of the Childcare Act 2006) to publish nationally prescribed sufficiency assessments every three years is burdensome. The Government consider that a local annual report would be a more effective way of enabling parents to hold their local authority to account. The Government have therefore also decided to consult on bringing forward legislation to repeal the section 11 duty. This consultation will be published on the Department for Education&#8217;s website later in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.986W.5/5">Although there is no specific funding allocated to local authorities for the provision of holiday child care, there is enough flexibility in the early intervention grant for local authorities to fund these requirements, if they consider there is sufficient demand.</p>

	<p pid="b.991W.2/1">The Department for Transport does not currently collect data on people undertaking paid or unpaid work experience. However, as part of the civil service wide 'Get Britain Working' programme, the Department has made a pledge to offer 1,000 Work Placements over the coming year. These will take place across all agencies and the central Department. Each placement will be two weeks in length and will be offered to jobseeker&#8217;s allowance customers aged 18 to 24. Eligible individuals will be those whose limited experience of work is acting as a barrier to employment. Although these placements will be unpaid in terms of departmental funds, candidates will still be in receipt of their benefits while in post. Any additional travel required as part of the candidate's placement (e.g. to and from the Business Skills Workshops) will be organised and paid for by the Department.

In these circumstances, we have also taken into account the Department for Transport's substantial wider presence in Swansea with both the DVLA and our Shared Services Centre located there and we have concluded that it is more appropriate to retain the Coastguard centre and Coastguard jobs at Milford Haven.</p>

Consequently the Department included requirements for financing which, while including the ROSCOs as a potential source of funds, allowed a wider funding group to participate in the Thameslink competition.

	<p pid="b.1000W.8/1">The Government have made clear that all those committing human rights abuses and atrocities in Libya must be brought to justice. The UK led the drive for referral of the situation in Libya to the International Criminal Court in UN Security Council Resolution 1970 and called for a special session of the Human Rights Council which set up the Commission of Inquiry into Libya. The Commission reported systematic abuse of civilians, including evidence of excessive use of force, a pattern of enforced disappearances, and deliberate destruction and attacks on medical transports and facilities by Gaddafi forces. These are clear demonstrations of the former Gaddafi regime's disregard for international law.</p>
	<p pid="b.1000W.8/2">The UN Human Rights Council's Commission of Inquiry first report in June 2011 also found that there were some instances of human right abuses levelled against the then opposition fighters, although it concluded that these were not part of a widespread or systematic attack against civilians.</p>
	<p pid="b.1000W.8/3">Since then, the National Transitional Council (NTC) has continued to voice its commitment to International Humanitarian and Human Rights law, and has stated its intent to fully implement the Commission's report recommendations. Articles 7 &amp; 8 of the Draft Constitutional Declaration clearly outline the NTC's plan to join international and regional declarations and charters that protect human rights and basic freedoms. The NTC has also taken action. It produced and reissued a frontline manual instructing Libyan civilians on the fundamental rules that must be adhered to in conflict and has conducted an investigation into reports of mistreatment of prisoners. We welcome this emphasis and their commitment, and will continue to raise these issues with them.</p>

Our understanding is that the situation was quiet on the Gaza-Israel border on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-04">4 July 2011</phrase> and no rockets were fired into Israel that day.</p>
	<p pid="b.1001W.2/2">More recently, from 18-<phrase class="date" code="2011-08-21">21 August</phrase>, we witnessed once again an alarming escalation in violence. I issued a statement making clear our concerns about the violence in Gaza and southern Israel. Nine Israelis were killed and many more were injured. In Gaza, at least 15 people were reported killed, including three children. We strongly condemned this appalling violence. The announcement of a ceasefire is welcome.</p>

	<p pid="b.1004W.6/6">(ii) what assessment he has made of recent trends in temporary employment; what estimate he has made of the number of people working as temporary employees in the quarter to June 2011; what estimate he has made of the number of such employees who are seeking a permanent job; what assessment he has made of the effects of recent trends in the number of temporary employees on the economy (70035);</p>
	<p pid="b.1004W.6/7">For the period April-June 2011 there were an estimated 6.678 million employees in the UK working part-time (seasonally adjusted). On a non-seasonally adjusted basis there were 6.681 million part-time employees, of which 1.097 million reported that they had taken part-time employment because they had not been able to find a full-time job.</p>
	<p pid="b.1004W.6/8">For the same period there were an estimated 1.608 million people working as temporary employees, of which 0.601 million reported that they had taken a temporary job because they had not been able to find a permanent job (both figures seasonally adjusted).</p>
	<p pid="b.1004W.6/9">The ONS does not publish estimates of trends in these statistics. Nor does it assess the effects of temporary and part-time working on the economy. However, time series for the statistics requested are published among the tables associated with the monthly Labour Market Statistical Bulletin.</p>
	<p pid="b.1004W.6/10">The estimates are derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). As with any sample survey, estimates from the LFS are subject to a margin of uncertainty. Indications of the sampling variability of LFS aggregate estimates are provided in the Statistical Bulletin.</p>

	<p pid="b.1005W.5/1">The new enterprise allowance (NEA) provides help to unemployed people to start their own business. It is available to people who have been claiming jobseeker's allowance for six months or more. It provides access to business mentoring and offers financial support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1005W.5/2">Jobseeker's allowance claimants who participate in the new enterprise allowance work with a volunteer business mentor who will provide them with guidance and support as they develop their business idea, and through the early stages of trading. To be eligible to receive the financial support, the claimant has to demonstrate that their business idea is viable and has growth potential. The financial support consists of a weekly allowance payable over 26 weeks worth up to &#163;1,274&#8212;allowing them to establish their business and cash flow&#8212;and if they need start-up capital they may also apply for an unsecured loan of up to &#163;1,000 to help them with start-up costs such as buying their initial equipment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1005W.5/3">The new enterprise allowance is now available throughout Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1005W.5/4">We are also supporting the development of local Enterprise Clubs, helping people make the most of local knowledge and resources to support unemployed people in their communities who are interested in becoming self-employed. Enterprise Clubs provide unemployed people interested in self-employment with a place to meet and exchange skills, make contacts, share experiences, receive support and encourage each other to work through their business ideas. Jobcentre Plus advisers signpost claimants interested in self-employment to their local Enterprise Club where one is available.</p>

	<p pid="b.1007W.3/1">As recognised by the Committee of Public Accounts Forty-Third report of Session 2010-12, the chain by which military operations, such as those in Afghanistan, are supplied with essential equipment and supplies would be much more efficient if directed by a modern information system supported by appropriate skills and procedures. A comprehensive programme is under way to replace the current ageing and obsolete logistics information systems with new capabilities including the Future Logistics Information Services project (which will replace the base inventory systems), the Management of the Joint Deployed Inventory (MJDI) system (for deployed assets) and the Joint Asset Management Engineering Solution (JAMES) (to improve the management of land equipment).</p>
	<p pid="b.1007W.3/2">MJDI and JAMES are currently being rolled out. These will contribute to improved materiel accounting and early increments of MJDI are already in service within some units within Afghanistan, with the programme due to deliver the full MJDI and JAMES capabilities in 2014.</p>
	<p pid="b.1007W.3/3">In addition, the new single tri-service base inventory and warehousing system, to replace the individual systems used in all three services, will also be delivered incrementally. This will see a major step change in the support chain and materiel accounting, with a rationalised modern base inventory and warehouse service with easier reconciliation with the Ministry of Defence's finance systems.</p>

	<p pid="b.1008W.9/1">Resettlement assistance is offered to all early service leavers, regardless of their age. This includes a briefing at unit level on all the services and organisations that are in a position to help them in their transition to civilian life and guidance on accessing the services available through the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) to which, as ex-service personnel, they have early access. DWP services include an interview by trained consultants, access to online job search facilities, practical guidance on creating and updating CVs, identifying transferrable skills and training opportunities, professional help in completing job applications and development of interview skills with the aid of expert staff. Advice is also given on housing issues, pensions and the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1008W.9/2">From November 2011, we are enhancing the resettlement package for all early service leavers, regardless of their age, through trialling best practice industry solutions. The aim of the trials is to improve employment outcomes for those who leave early through the offer of a more personalised and sophisticated level of resettlement. Under these trials we also aim to offer greater support for any who leave early and are vulnerable to social exclusion, again, regardless of their age.</p>
	<p pid="b.1008W.9/3">Personnel who leave early as a result of being medically discharged are entitled to the most comprehensive resettlement package through the Career Transition Partnership. This consists of a range of transition services and concessions in time, money and training opportunities.</p>

I also discussed these issues with a number of Sudanese Ministers during my visit to Sudan in May. DFID does not route any funding directly through the Government of Sudan. We currently provide most of our funding through large multi-donor pooled funds managed by UN agencies. DFID officials in Khartoum work with the relevant ministries within Government of Sudan to help them identify and address the development needs of the country. On my visit in May, I also discussed UK aid with ministers from the then Government of Southern Sudan, including President Kiir, now President of the independent Republic of South Sudan.</p>

	<p pid="b.1017W.6/1">We are greatly concerned at the humanitarian situation in Sudan. This is particularly acute in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile State where recent conflict has broken out and where humanitarian access is very limited. There are also significant ongoing humanitarian needs in Abyei and Darfur. We are working closely with the UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations to press for greater access to those that need help the most and for the protection of civilians.</p>

We expect this to help deliver the following results, among others:</p>

	<p pid="b.1019W.7/1">As part of our package of reforms to civil litigation funding and costs, alongside the removal of recoverability of conditional fee agreements, success fees and after the event insurance premiums, there are a number of reforms to assist claimants in the new regime. There will be an increase of 10% in damages for non-pecuniary loss such as pain, suffering and loss of amenity. In personal injury cases, including clinical negligence, there will be a cap on the amount of damages that may be taken as a success fee. The cap will be set at 25% of the damages awarded other than those for future care loss. This will help protect claimants' damages, and is particularly important in clinical negligence claims, where the damages for future care and loss can sometimes run into many millions of pounds. Qualified one way costs shifting, which is to be introduced in personal injury including clinical negligence, will protect the vast majority of claimants from having to pay the defendant's costs if they lose.</p>
	<p pid="b.1019W.7/2">We have listened to particular concerns about the funding of expert reports in clinical negligence cases. Such reports are important to establish whether there is a case for bringing proceedings; but they can be expensive. We are discussing with the NHS Litigation Authority and other stakeholders how the commissioning of reports can be improved. In addition, the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill includes a tightly drawn power to allow the recoverability of the ATE insurance premiums in clinical negligence cases only. The details will be set out in regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1019W.7/3">As part of the legal aid reforms the Government recognise that there may be clinical negligence cases, such as obstetrics cases, with high disbursement costs, which are currently funded by legal aid but for which it may be difficult to secure a conditional fee agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1019W.7/4">We have proposed an &#8216;exceptional funding&#8217; scheme, which would ensure that individual cases of this type continue to receive legal aid where failure to do so would be likely to result in a breach of the individual's rights to legal aid under the Human Rights Act 1998 or EU law. In considering whether exceptional funding should be granted we will take into account the ability of the client to present their own case, the complexity of the matter, the importance of the issues at stake, and all other relevant circumstances.</p>

Establishments are categorised in these tables by their main role as at the end of 2009-10. Establishments that have more than one role have been placed in the category that represents the primary or dominant function of the prison. For this reason, performance of prisons within a category cannot necessarily be compared on a like for like basis. 3. There are two unit cost measurements. The &#8216;direct resource expenditure&#8217; includes costs met locally by the establishments. The &#8216;overall cost&#8217; includes prison-related overheads met centrally by NOMS, for example, property costs (including depreciation and cost of capital), major maintenance, prisoner escort and custody service (relates to transporting prisoners) and central HQ overheads. 4. YOI refers to young offender institutions. 5. Data for Elmley, Standford Hill and Swaleside are reported under the Sheppey cluster. Similarly, data for Blakenhurst, Brockhill and Hewell Grange is reported together as a cluster. Data for Parkhurst, Camp Hill and Albany are reported under the Isle of Wight cluster. 6. Cookham Wood changed from a female closed prison to a male juvenile prison in October 2007. Data for 2009-10 is shown under the category male juvenile. 7. Dover and Haslar are not included as they are immigration removal centres operating under Detention Centre Rules 2001. 8. Lindholme includes Lindholme IDC. It is a split site, part category C training prison and part immigration detention centre. 9. The following expenditure is not included: A one-off impairment charge of &#163;525.05 million as a result of the revaluation of land and buildings. Operation Safeguard (use of police cells). Cost of capital on assets in the course of construction (&#163;22.47 million). Project, operating and commissioning costs totalling &#163;2.71 million at HMPYOI Isis, as the establishment was not opened during the course of year. 10. Private prisons and public prisons are included. The unit costs are not directly comparable because of different methods of financing. 11. For certain prisons the unit cost is not typical, because they are in the process of change (e.g. Bure was building up capacity during the year).</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1030W.2/1">Employability skills are essential to ensure that employers can recruit the talent they need to enable sustainable economic growth, social mobility and to help build the big society. Employability skills vary by the age of a person, the point at which they leave the education system and the requirements of employers in different sectors. There are a number of Government programmes to support employability. As part of our skills strategy, aimed mainly at those aged 19 and over, the Government are funding literacy and numeracy courses for those adults who lack these basic skills. We plan to maximise the economic and personal returns of this training following a review of basic skills provision currently under way, and we will be taking the necessary steps to make it more effective. Functional skills qualifications in English, mathematics and information and communications technology will become mandatory components of all apprenticeships frameworks by September 2012 replacing key skills as part of the programme. Unemployed people on active benefits can access skills training fully funded by the Skills Funding Agency to improve relevant labour market skills, including their employability skills, where this is appropriate to help them get sustainable employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1030W.2/2">The recent Higher Education White Paper outlined proposals that will deliver a new focus on graduate employability. All universities have now set out in employability statements the range of support they provide to help students prepare for employment. We are also considering how wider employability skills can be further addressed through the Education and Skills Growth Review.</p>

	<p pid="b.1032W.5/1">Applications for registration as the owner of land on the basis of adverse possession can be divided into two types. First, there are those where the land concerned is unregistered and the application is to register the squatter as the first &#8220;registered proprietor&#8221; (in other words, the first registered owner). Secondly, those where the land has already been registered and the application is to register the squatter as the new registered proprietor.</p>
	<p pid="b.1032W.5/2">Land Registry does not have reliable statistics for the first type of application. One of the main reasons for this is that it is not unusual for these &#8220;first registration applications&#8221; to be made on more than one basis. For example, the title deeds may not be entirely clear, and so, while Land Registry is satisfied that the applicant can properly be registered as proprietor and completes the application, it might not be clear whether he or she has a &#8220;documentary title&#8221; (the land involved falling within the extent covered by the title deeds) or a &#8220;possessory title&#8221; (the land falling outside the title deeds but the applicant having acquired title by virtue of adverse possession). Such an application may well not be recorded as being an adverse possession application.</p>
	<p pid="b.1032W.5/3">Land Registry does have statistics for the second type of application for the financial years 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11: these show that the number of successful applications of this type in these years were 1,111, 1,059 and 868 respectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.1036W.8/1">There have been no recent failures in the HM Revenue and Customs' online service for filing Company Tax Returns. There is, however, a live issue in that the service will not be updated until October 2011 to take account of the rate reductions that took effect when the Finance Act received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-19">19 July 2011</phrase>. This is to avoid the risk of service disruption from implementing a large number of changes to HM Revenue and Customs' online systems at the same time. The Department is working, as a matter of high priority, to reduce the level of risk so that any future changes can be implemented without unnecessary delay for companies that want to file their Company Tax Returns early.</p>

Because of this, it was not possible to consult more widely.</p>

The Department made &#163;286 million additional funding available to help implement the strategy over 2009-10 and 2010-11. Hospices were in a good position to work with the NHS to secure some of this funding to deliver many of the initiatives recommended in the strategy.

	<p pid="b.1051W.3/2">As part of the development of the strategy, a review was undertaken of specialist palliative care spend by primary care trusts (PCTs).

This exercise has been' repeated for 2010-11, and will be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1051W.3/3">We have made a commitment to review payment systems to support end of life care, including exploring options for per-patient funding to meet the commitment in the coalition agreement. This work has been taken forward by the independent Palliative Care Funding Review, which reported on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-01">1 July</phrase>. The recommendations of the review will influence decisions on future funding policies for dedicated palliative care services, whoever provides them.

	<p pid="b.1053W.5/2">From 2001-02 to 2007-08, the Department collected annual data from national health service trusts on car parking provision and any associated charges, through the Estates Returns Information Collection. In 2004-05, the collection of these data was moved from a mandatory to a voluntary basis. In order to lessen the burden on the NHS to provide central returns, the collection of voluntary data items ceased after the 2007-08 period and therefore the collection of data on car parking was discontinued after the 2007-08 collection period. The Department does not hold data on this subject after that period.</p>

	<p pid="b.1053W.5/18">The provision of hospital car parking and any associated charges are decided locally by individual trusts to help cover the cost of running, maintaining and securing a car park. All NHS trusts should have exemption and concessionary schemes in place to ensure that patients and carers who visit hospital regularly are not disadvantaged. They should also have sustainable public transport plans in place for staff and visitors. Local policies should include fair concessions for all patients whose health care needs require extended or frequent access to hospital. Patients on low incomes are entitled to recover travel costs, including car parking charges, under the Hospital Travel Costs Scheme.</p>
