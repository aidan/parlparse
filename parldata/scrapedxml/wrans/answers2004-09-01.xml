We were encouraged that the Prosecutor-General persistently sought judicial review of early judgements in the case, reflecting the authorities' concern that justice be done.

This includes the M6 Toll, which opened in December 2003. A further 12 strategic road schemes are currently under construction, including widening of the M25 between Junctions 12 to 15 around Heathrow. The London congestion charge has delivered significant benefits. Traffic Officers are already being deployed on the motorway network starting in the West Midlands, to improve the clearing of incidents, and new technologies are being introduced to help improve traffic flow. The Traffic Management Act gives new powers to the Traffic Officers, and to local authorities to improve the management of local roads.</p>

For these roads the Department only make decisions about schemes over &pound;5 million which are approved individually through the LTP process. Smaller schemes are funded by the local authorities out of their block allocations and the Department does not hold records of how that funding was used. We do not have records on major scheme starts before the new LTP system was introduced in 1999&ndash;2000 and getting it would be difficult, particularly since there have been changes to local authority structures. Trying to find the information would take time and be at a disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".696W.2/1">The Department sets the Highways Agency an indicator to measure its performance in maintaining the network in a safe and serviceable condition. A new way of measuring the performance was introduced in the 2004&ndash;05 Highways Agency Business Plan, with a target to &quot;achieve a road surface condition index score of 100l&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".696W.2/2">In consultation with the Department the Agency has developed an index that measures road surface condition. This is a major improvement on the previous indicator that was based on the percentage of the network that required investigation. The measure of road surface condition is based on a wider range of surveys covering rutting, unevenness, cracking and skid resistance. The target takes account of the fact that it is not practical or sustainable to maintain the whole road network in an as-new condition. The condition of the network is established, using the principles of minimising whole life costs taking into account disruption to road users. The condition at which the road network is to be maintained has been equated to a road surface condition index score of 100 and is the target level at which the road network will be maintained year-on-year. To allow for variability/uncertainty in annual condition scores, a tolerance of 1 is allowed in the target.</p>
	<p pid=".696W.2/3">We estimate that the level at <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> was within the parameters set out i.e. an index of 1001. The actual figure will be calculated and the result audited during 2004&ndash;05.</p>

	<p pid=".703W.3/2">The Positive Activities for Young People (PAYP) programme was launched in spring 2003 offering diversionary activities aimed at young people most at risk of social exclusion, truancy and committing crime. The programme is being delivered across England from May 2003 to March 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".703W.3/3">In 2003&ndash;04 PAYP funding of &pound;25 million was provided by the Department for Education and Skills, the Big Lottery Fund and the Home Office to deliver a minimum of 22,000 full-time places during all school holiday periods. In addition to the activities, one-to-one support was made available for the most &quot;at risk&quot; young people. Baselines for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 have yet to be finalised following this year's Spending Review.</p>

However, due to leave and instructor training, the number of training teams that are available for training purposes at any one time is 13.

	<p pid=".706W.2/1">The Defence Information Infrastructure (DII) programme is not a privatisation of IT infrastructure. Under the terms of the Public Private Partnership arrangement, the MOD will continue to own the infrastructure but the delivery of the service will be the responsibility of the chosen commercial Delivery Partner.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/2">A significant proportion of the Department's IT provision has been outsourced in recent years as part of wider initiatives to make greater use of the private sector in the provision of public services. The Department's policy is that when services already delivered under outsourcing arrangements are re-competed or rationalised, in-house bids should not normally be invited because the associated requirement for substantial reinvestment in management, training and support systems makes it unlikely that an in-house option would represent value for money. Where no in-house bid is invited, an estimate of the costs of a public sector option would normally be made, in order to provide a value for money benchmark.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/3">In the case of the DII project, the Public Sector Comparator (PSC) is currently being developed with the Trades Unions and reflects the &quot;fallback' option that the MOD would pursue if the commercial bids for DII failed. The PSC assumes the continuation of the current mix of in-house and commercial arrangements including some internal efficiencies and a capability uplift. It will be used within the DII Future Main Gate Business Case as a Value for Money comparator against which to assess the commercial bids. The Trades Unions have been briefed on the current scope of the first increment of DII Future and the related PSC. They have been given the opportunity to comment on the robustness of the PSC and associated risks by <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-30">30 July 2004</phrase>. They have also been invited to submit alternative proposals in the context of the PSC.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/4">It has also been agreed that the Trades Unions will be involved in the development of the Intelligent Customer Function (ICF) as it progresses. Work on the definition of the Intelligent Customer Function for DII is being taken forward under three main headings:</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/5" class="indent">The MOD wide responsibilities for the ICF</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/6" class="indent">The responsibilities of the ICF to be undertaken by the Defence Communications Services Agency (DCSA)</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/7" class="indent">The ICF functions to be undertaken by the DII Integrated Project Team.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/8">The elements of the ICF which are currently being explored include:</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/9" class="indent">Customer and Account Management</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/10" class="indent">Business and Financial Management</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/11" class="indent">Service Development and Technical Assurance</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/12" class="indent">Programme Delivery, including Project Assurance and Benefits</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/13" class="indent">Management Commercial, Contract and Supplier Management</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/14" class="indent">Service Assurance</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/15">Formal meetings between MOD staff and the Council of Civil Service Unions (CCSU) have been taking place since the beginning of 2003. We have provided the Trades Unions with access to the same information that has been provided to the two remaining bidders for DII Future. Some examples of the information provided include:</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/16" class="indent">The DII Business Prospectus provides a comprehensive description of the intended scope of the programme and was made available to the TUs on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-03">3 April 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/17" class="indent">A copy of the Procurement Strategy Review Note was made available to the TUs on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-03">3 April</phrase>. At the request of the CCSU, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-13">13 February 2004</phrase>, a copy of comments provided by HM Treasury on the Review Note was also provided.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/18" class="indent">A copy of the report produced at the end of the Personnel Impact Study was made available to TUs on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-24">24 June 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/19" class="indent">The current scope of DII(F) Increment 1 for which bids have been invited was provided to the TUs on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-18">18 June 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/20" class="indent">A copy of the draft Public Sector Comparator (PSC) was passed to the TUs on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-28">28 June 2004</phrase> and also access was given to the IPT risk register.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/21">Formal meetings will continue between officials and the Trades Unions according to an agreed timetable of engagement. This includes a workshop held with them on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-02">2 July 2004</phrase> when the current scope of Increment 1 and the PSC was briefed to them.</p>
	<p pid=".706W.2/22">Information relating to the track record of the two remaining bidders for the DII contract will not be placed in the Library of the House. This information is commercially sensitive and I am withholding it under Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. However, track record is one of a number of factors included in the evaluation of bids. The Department's Supplier Relations Group has conducted research of bidding consortium members' performance both in Defence and across Government. In addition, the project has taken up references, by telephone and through visits, from existing customers of the key companies in the bidding consortia. Further reference visits will be conducted during the final phase of the procurement, targeting customers in receipt of a similar volume and range of services.</p>

	<p pid=".708W.2/2">The Defence Information Infrastructure (DII) programme Integrated Project Team (IPT) is currently in negotiation with two potential commercial Delivery Partners (DP) for the provision of Information Systems services for Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.2/3">The DII programme is not a privatisation of IT infrastructure. Under the terms of the proposed Public Private Partnership arrangement, MOD will continue to own the infrastructure but the delivery of support services will be the responsibility of the commercial Delivery Partner.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.2/4">Risk management is a key feature of the business of any IPT and its associated Senior Responsible Owner (SRO). DII programme risks are managed on an on-going basis through a risk register; each risk has its own mitigation plan. The IPT also manages a joint risk register with each of the two bidders for the DII contract; each is therefore specific to the particular bidder's proposed solution. These registers are, by their nature, commercially sensitive, and cannot therefore be placed in the Library of the House without the on-going competition being prejudiced.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.2/5">As part of the concept phase of the Smart Procurement process, the Initial Gate Business Case (IGBC) for the DII programme outlined the headline risks identified at that stage of the programme. The IGBC was approved in September 2002; the risks identified at that stage will be placed in the Library of the House. A copy of the DII Business Prospectus has already been placed in the Library. The Business Prospectus details why DII is necessary for MOD and how it will be procured.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.2/6">The Main Gate Business Case, which is due to be presented to the Investment Approvals Board later this year will provide a current assessment of DII risks and their mitigation plans associated with the procurement. This Business Case will contain commercially sensitive information from the two bidders for the DII contract and therefore cannot be made publicly available.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.2/7">Over the planned three main increments of the DII programme, it is estimated that up to 1,500 civilian staff fall within the full scope of the project, including both staff supporting current systems and those presently within the IPT. It has been necessary in some cases to supplement the skills of the civilian and military staff employed in the IPT by more specific expertise from the commercial sector.</p>
	<p pid=".708W.2/8">There are currently 13 contractors occupying established civil service posts within the IPT.</p>

	<p pid=".713W.5/1">Amnesty International's <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-23">23 July 2003</phrase> Report, &quot;Iraq&mdash;Memorandum on concerns relating to law and order&quot;, made reference inter alia to the use of &quot;prolonged hooding&quot; by coalition forces and stated that this and other measures would amount to &quot;torture or inhuman treatment&quot;. This was consistent with Amnesty's longstanding view that hooding is unacceptable in all circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.5/2">Although, hooding has been prohibited by the United Kingdom in the context of interrogations since the 1972 Heath Ruling, we consider that there are circumstances in which the temporary obscuring of a detainees vision is justified. For example, it may be necessary during the arrest and transit of prisoners to prevent them viewing sensitive information. Although the UK armed forces are currently under direction not to hood detainees in any circumstances, the use of hooding has not been ruled out in future conflicts.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.5/3">As I said in my response to a question from the hon. Member on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-15">15 May 2004</phrase>, Official Report, column 1235W, the practice of hooding was stopped in Iraq as a result of concerns that the inappropriate use of hooding could be dangerous.</p>

	<p pid=".716W.0/2">In Iraq, 341 Prisoners of War were handed over to the United States in April 2003, all but three were subsequently released by the US. Two, classed as high value detainees, have now been arraigned before an Iraqi judge and transferred to Iraqi custody and one was reclassified as a security internee and his case is under consideration by the Central Criminal Court of Iraq. We have also detained around 2,000 security internees since the end of the conflict. Between April 2003 and December 2003, these were held by the US. All but one of those individuals were either returned to United Kingdom custody or released. Under the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding we put in place with the US, which covered the transfer of detainees, the US are required to seek permission from the UK to remove from Iraq UK captured persons in their detention. No such requests have been made.</p>
	<p pid=".716W.0/3">The UK has fulfilled all its obligations towards such individuals in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. Between May and December 2003 almost all UK detainees, both Prisoners of War and security internees, were held by US Forces at Camp Bucca in Southern Iraq. During this period there was a continuous UK presence at the Camp in the shape of a UK Prisoner of War Registration Unit and a Prisoner Monitoring Team. The monitoring team regularly inspected prisoner conditions and monitored family visits and the release of UK prisoners. The majority of early detainees were released during this period. The remainder were transferred to the UK custody with the opening of the UK's Divisional Temporary Detention Facility at Shaibah in December 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".716W.0/4">The two UK prisoners of war, classed as high value detainees, were held by US forces at a different site. Although the UK did not maintain a permanent presence at the internment facility where they were held, reports were obtained on their conditions.</p>

For UK air operations, the targeting process has a hierarchical approvals system and includes stringent controls. At each level, UK Commanders, with legal advisors present, applied the relevant articles of the 1977 Geneva Protocol 1 to the Geneva Conventions (1949) which applies to targeting. In each case when attacks were approved, the UK Commander will have determined that legal requirements of necessity and distinction were met, and that estimated civilian casualties or damage were not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage that the attack was expected to produce.</p>

	<p pid=".719W.14/1">In common with other government departments, the Ministry of Defence does not seek to restrict unnecessarily the shareholders in Private Finance Initiative (PFI) and Public Private Partnerships (PPP) projects from transferring or selling their equity stakes to another commercial entity. Such restrictions would constrain the availability of capital for such projects and therefore adversely affect value for money. Exceptions to this can be made during the construction/introduction to service phase when some restrictions may be placed on sales or transfers of equity from shareholders who are also key subcontractors, as these might have an adverse impact on the success of the project. Additionally, provisions are usually included in MOD PFI and PPP contracts which place an obligation on the service provider and its shareholders to obtain the MOD's consent to any sale or transfer. This is to prevent any transfer that might be prejudicial to the national interest, e.g. for reasons of national security.</p>

	<p pid=".723W.0/1">A Royal Navy ship, together with a royal fleet auxiliary support tanker, is allocated to the Atlantic Patrol Task (North) (APT(N)). The APT(N) duty ship provides a tangible presence in the Caribbean area of responsibility including throughout the hurricane season (May to November). For the remainder of the year they remain within 14 days sailing. APT(N) provides security to United Kingdom overseas territories including support to humanitarian operations and disaster relief. APT(N) also makes a major contribution as one element of HMG's broader counter-drugs activity and promotes UK interests in the region, supporting defence relations and military training assistance and the wider defence diplomacy effort through a series of high-profile port visits.</p>
	<p pid=".723W.0/2">After six months as APT(N) ship, five of which were within the Caribbean AOR, HMS Monmouth handed over duties to HMS Richmond on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-12">12 July</phrase> and is currently en route home. During her deployment HMS Monmouth made two successful interdictions of suspected drug smugglers using &quot;go fast&quot; boats. While the contraband was jettisoned by the smugglers before being apprehended, it is thought that 150&ndash;200 kg of cocaine was removed from circulation in each operation.</p>

But, DFID has the flexibility to retain members of the Senior Civil Service beyond age 60 if it is judged to be in the public interest and are satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties. Members of the Senior Appointments Selection Committee (SASC) Group retire at age 60 and DFID must obtain approval from the Cabinet Office before retaining staff in the SASC Group beyond this age.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.0/2">DFID welcomes job applications from people of all ages. However, applicants are expected to be able to give DFID several years' service, or complete a substantial amount of any fixed term appointment, before retirement. There is no upper age limit for consultants. Consultants have to be suitably qualified, experienced and in a suitable physical condition to ensure that they can comply with all of their obligations under the contract.</p>

	<p pid=".734W.6/1">A large amount of information and guidance on HIV and AIDS is produced by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), other international bodies, other donors and researchers. The task is to ensure our staff are guided by the best possible information which already exists. DFID has therefore been developing an extensive web portal that will enable us to bring together a comprehensive and up to date range of information, for the use of DFID teams globally. This will be available to all UK staff in DFID, FCO and other government departments as well as our key partners in developing country governments and NGOs. It will be launched in August.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.6/2">DFID has been working with experts to develop new internal guidance on a range of areas. The areas where there is the greatest need&mdash;notably treatment and care&mdash;are also the most hotly debated issues among experts. In order to ensure a balanced response DFID has worked hard to articulate the most appropriate, evidence-based policy. Inevitably this has taken time and has been adapted as new initiatives evolve (such as the UNAIDS and WHO &quot;3x5&quot; target). DFID is therefore delighted that over the last few weeks the Department has published four new strategy and position papers: &quot;Taking Action: The UK's Strategy for Tackling HIV and AIDS in the Developing World&quot;, &quot;HIV and AIDS Treatment and Care Policy&quot;, &quot;Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights&mdash;a position paper&quot;, and &quot;Increasing Access To Essential Medicines in the Developing World&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".735W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) recognises that many of the poorest countries and the poorest people are highly dependent on natural resources for economic development and livelihoods. However, powerful groups sometimes deny poor people such access and revenues from natural resources&mdash;both renewable and non-renewable&mdash;have often fuelled conflict, corruption and exacerbated poverty. How natural resources are governed can fundamentally affect the contribution they make towards poverty reduction and sustainable development.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.2/2">The Prime Minister launched the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, September 2002. Its aim is to improve governance and accountability in countries with a high reliance on oil, gas and minerals by increasing transparency of payments by companies to governments, and transparency of revenues received by those governments. EITI is now being implemented in Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Ghana and the Kyrgyz Republic, with discussions taking place on implementation in a number of other countries including several in Africa and South America.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.2/3">DFID's assessment of the importance of natural resource governance in developing countries is carried out on a country-by-country basis, usually through poverty reduction strategies. DFID has supported work on natural resource governance in Cambodia, Cameroon, Ghana, Indonesia and a number of other countries through the Governance Learning Group.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.2/4">Some recent examples of governance programmes supported by DFID in the renewable natural resource sector include:</p>
	<p pid=".735W.2/5" class="indent">support to regional forest law enforcement and governance (FLEG) processes in East Asia and Africa that help build awareness of governance problems, in particular illegal logging, and generate commitment to tackle them;</p>
	<p pid=".735W.2/6" class="indent">an active role within the EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) process. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-19">19 July</phrase> the College of Commissioners adopted a package of proposals that includes a draft Regulation to control imports of illegally harvested timber into the single market;</p>
	<p pid=".735W.2/7" class="indent">support to Global Witness to analyse and publish trends concerning the governance of natural resource extraction&mdash;in particular the forestry sector&mdash;in the Democratic Republic of Congo;</p>
	<p pid=".735W.2/8" class="indent">support to the Overseas Development Institute to examine governance and poverty impacts of the illegal timber trade in Central America, with the aim of catalysing institutional and policy change by building awareness, dialogue and 'coalitions for change' among political institutions, government agencies, donors and civil society; and</p>
	<p pid=".735W.2/9" class="indent">pathways for Environmental Action in Kenya (PEAK), a programme to enable local communities to better understand their rights and economic opportunities under new environment legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.2/10">On the question of natural resource governance and armed conflict, responsibilities fall across Whitehall. DFID, the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence collaborate on African conflict issues through a joint strategy called the Africa Conflict Pool. This has considered a range of natural resource and conflict issues within its work drawing on academic literature, the work of groups such as Global Witness and the work of various United Nations bodies.</p>

A carbon price of &euro;5 is estimated to lead to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of around IMtC in 2010. A carbon price of &euro;10 may lead to more than double this level of reduction. These results are sensitive to assumed fossil fuel prices and the fuel mix in generation in 2010.</p>

	<p pid=".759W.0/1">This Government have always recognised that late payment of debts can have serious effects on the cash flow of smaller companies, which is why we had a manifesto commitment to introduce a Late Payment Act to allow small businesses to:</p>
	<p pid=".759W.0/2" class="indent">claim interest on late payment from other business or public sector bodies;</p>
	<p pid=".759W.0/3" class="indent">allow creditors to claim a fixed sum of compensation to cover debt recovery costs should late payment happen.</p>
	<p pid=".759W.0/4">The Government also established the Better Payment Practice Group whose website lists the payment record of companies.</p>
	<p pid=".759W.0/5">The package of measures has had a positive effect on payment times. The Grant Thornton European Business Survey showed that the average time taken in the UK to settle accounts in 1997 was 49 days. By 2002 this had fallen to 41 days. By comparison, the average settlement time in our European neighbours was 50 days. A recent survey by the REL Consultancy Group looked at average days payable outstanding (DPO) and concluded that UK companies' payment performance is 33.6 days against 42.4 days for Europe as a whole.</p>
	<p pid=".759W.0/6">Because of concerns that suppliers would not utilise the legislation for fear of reprisals or boycotts, I have also undertaken as Minister to write, in cases where invoices are not disputed, on behalf of small businesses to the managing directors of companies to convey their complaint and seek an explanation and appropriate action. I urge all Members of Parliament to do the same on behalf of constituents.</p>

	<p pid=".767W.8/1">We attach a high priority to helping schools prevent and combat bullying: it is a serious problem which puts the emotional well-being and educational achievement of pupils at risk. Our guidance pack &quot;Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;, the anti-bullying Charter for Action and the anti-bullying website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying">www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying</a> offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying.</p>
	<p pid=".767W.8/2">In November 2003 I launched our anti-bullying Charter for schools, which schools are now signing. It is accompanied by a summary of effective practice to help schools review and enhance their anti-bullying policies. The Charter was launched at the first of the Make The Difference series of regional conferences. The programme of conferences began in November 2003 and culminated with a final event on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-14">14 June</phrase>. These conferences, the West Midlands one of which was well attended by Staffordshire head teachers, offered an opportunity for schools and other partners to share good practice on this issue and to learn at first hand about what has worked elsewhere. Details of the conferences can be accessed online at <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/antibullying">www.teachernet.gov.uk/antibullying</a>. Our new public information film, 'Tell Someone', also encourages children and young people to tell someone if they are being bullied.</p>
	<p pid=".767W.8/3">Last week, we announced funding of &pound;570,000 for the Anti Bullying Alliance; an umbrella group of over 50 voluntary sector organisations, professional associations and leading local authorities. The Alliance will work to support schools in addressing bullying behaviour and lead on preparations for the first national anti-bullying week in November. Schools in Staffordshire will have access to an anti-bullying coordinator based in the West Midlands region, and working with the National Strategies, who can provide practical help, advice and support in tackling all forms of bullying in schools.</p>

	<p pid=".788W.5/1">As part of a package of changes to the Teachers' Pension Scheme (TPS) relating to the increase in the normal pension age (NPA) from 60 to 65, consideration is being given to a number of changes that will improve scheme benefits, increase flexibility and offer greater retirement options for teachers. Suggestions for change to the TPS are included on the TeacherNet website <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/pensions">www.teachernet.gov.uk/pensions</a> which will form the basis of a consultation planned to take place during the Autumn term 2004. One of the priorities that has been recognised is the introduction of pension benefits for unmarried partners. It is expected that the introduction of NPA of 65 will enable this improvement to be introduced without an increase in the contribution to the TPS made by individual teachers.</p>

	<p pid=".789W.2/1">Information on the total amount of debt on leaving higher education, including private sector debt, is not collected annually, although we do estimate it in successive student income and expenditure surveys. It will depend on a wide range of factors, including: whether an individual takes out a Government student loan; how much student loan they are eligible for; how many years they spend in HE over which to amass their debt; whether they take out any commercial debt or build up overdrafts; and whether they have any loans from family or friends. The latest 2002/3 Student Income and Expenditure Survey showed that students graduating in 2003 anticipated leaving with an average total debt of &pound;8,666. During the passage of the Higher Education Act through Parliament we estimated that this might rise to an average debt of about &pound;15,000, once students paying variable fees have graduated. The 2004/5 Student Income and Expenditure Survey&mdash;which is expected to report in early 2005&mdash;will provide an estimate of total debt on leaving HE for those graduating in 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".789W.2/2">Individuals with government student loans leaving higher education in 2004&mdash;whether on course completion or withdrawal&mdash;will enter repayment status in April 2005. The average income-contingent student loan debt to government, for full-time students entering repayment status in April 2005, is estimated at around &pound;7,700. Estimates for those entering repayment in April 2006 and 2007 are, respectively, around &pound;8,000 and &pound;9,000. Figures are reported in nominal prices including inflation.</p>

Information on the non-completion rates of these students is not yet available, but the latest figures from HEFCE (based on students entering in 2000/01) indicate that 16 per cent. of full-time first degree students in the UK did not complete their studies.</p>

	<p pid=".795W.2/1">I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-19">19 July 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/2">The new Dutch Presidency presented its work programme for the next six months. Key themes will be sustainable agriculture and its public responsibilities, and initiatives to reduce the administrative burden on the industry.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/3">The Presidency and Commission presented plans for greater member state co-operation on agricultural research in order to maximise value for the money spent. The UK Government strongly supports this initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/4">The Commission reported on negotiations with Russia to renew certification arrangements covering animal and animal product imports from the EU. The negotiations are currently deadlocked and the Presidency indicated that it was planning an intervention at political level in an attempt to unblock them.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/5">Member states were asked whether their views had changed with regard to a Commission proposal to authorise the marketing of a variety of GM maize which had failed to get qualified majority support in the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. The UK has supported this approval on the basis of the safety assessments carried out and our position remained unchanged. Member states failed to give the proposal majority support, but if the Council fails to act within three months the Commission will have the authority to proceed with its approval.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/6">The Commission presented its proposal for a European Fisheries Fund to replace the existing Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG). The main focus will be to eliminate excess fishing capacity and use structural measures to reinforce stock recovery plans.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/7">The Council held a public debate on the Commission's new proposals for changes to the Rural Development Regulation. I stressed the need for more flexibility and better value, for a greater transfer of resources from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy, for more emphasis on environmental schemes and for a fairer allocation of rural development resources. There will now be detailed negotiation at official level which will extend over a number of months.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/8">The Council also debated a new Commission communication on its preferred option for reform of the CAP sugar regime. The proposal calls for significant cuts in EU price support with a further review of the regime in 2008. I gave a general welcome to the proposals as a step in the right direction, while urging a swifter end to quotas and emphasising the need to address urgently the impacts on those developing countries which currently enjoy preferential access to the EU market. Again, the proposal will now be remitted for detailed consideration at official level.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/9">The Council was asked to vote on proposals to change the import tariffs for rice which the Commission has been negotiating with India, Pakistan, Thailand and the United States. The Commission had failed to get agreement with the last two countries which felt that the proposals increased tariffs to a degree that breached WTO rules. While welcoming the agreement with India and Pakistan, I voted against the proposal on the grounds that the Commission was seeking to implement the changes on a basis which was contested by some of the parties and that they should instead continue negotiations. The Council, however, voted by qualified majority to adopt the proposal although a number of those voting in favour urged the Commission to continue negotiating with the United States and Thailand with a view to reaching an agreed conclusion.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/10">The Presidency urged the Commission to come forward soon with proposals to address the illegal timber trade. I endorsed this call.</p>
	<p pid=".795W.2/11">In an informal exchange of views after the Council had ended, the Commission updated Ministers on the latest developments in the current round of WTO negotiations. I supported the Commission's efforts towards securing a framework agreement at the WTO General Council on 27 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July</phrase>.</p>

Officials and experts from the UK are now engaged in a process led by the European Environment Agency to develop and test these indicators using the data which are currently available.

	<p pid=".798W.0/1">TB testing was all but suspended during the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in 2001 and did not fully recover to pre-FMD levels until February 2002. The effect of this suspension of testing on the underlying trends in TB incidence for 2001 and subsequent years is hard to gauge, for the following reasons:</p>
	<p pid=".798W.0/2" class="indent">The TB testing effort in 2002 was initially aimed at high-risk herds.</p>
	<p pid=".798W.0/3" class="indent">Disease would have had more time to spread in herds where normally it might have been detected more quickly.</p>
	<p pid=".798W.0/4" class="indent">Restocking of herds after FMD led to the disease being spread to areas it had not been found for some time.</p>
	<p pid=".798W.0/5" class="indent">The level of testing in 2002 and 2003 required to clear the backlog was much higher than normal (the backlog was reduced to pre-FMD level by spring 2003).</p>
	<p pid=".798W.0/6">The trends seen in TB herd incidence and number of reactors slaughtered in 2001 and 2002 should, therefore, be treated with caution and are probably not comparable with those of earlier years. TB incidence rates and testing patterns for 2003 and 2004 appear to have settled down enough to make valid comparisons with pre-FMD trends.</p>

Improving biosecurity provides a range of benefits for many diseases. The measures that are taken should be based on a risk assessment approach and the costs of any specific measure balanced against its likely benefits. Complete separation of wildlife and farmed livestock may not be either practical or cost effective, but farmers should consider what measures they can take to reduce the interaction of wildlife with their animals.</p>

The trial will provide some information on badger numbers within the triplet areas, which could be related to cattle herd breakdown rates. However, badger density estimates may not be very reliable even in trial areas (they would be based on trapping returns and field survey information). This year, an additional limited survey of badgers found dead in Cumbria is being undertaken.</p>

CERRIE held its last formal meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-24">24 June</phrase>, and its report is currently being finalised by the Committee members, who anticipate that it will be ready for publication in the autumn. It is regrettable that members of the Committee have chosen to pre-empt publication by issuing a statement critical of the report and of other members of the Committee. We will welcome an informed debate on the scientific issues in the CERRIE report, once it is published. In the meantime, I have asked officials to consider with the Committee Chairman whether there are any lessons to be learned from the experiences with the CERRIE Committee that should be taken into account in the future.</p>

A set of detailed terms and conditions, including strict bio security conditions, will apply to all those wishing to collect fallen stock under the scheme. Operators' premises are already subject to approval and inspection by the State Veterinary Service under the Animal By-Products Regulations, but for those premises which join the scheme additional checks on compliance with scheme rules will also apply. The scheme has no legislative basis so the question of prosecutions does not arise. However, operators found not to be in compliance with scheme rules will be subject to exclusion from the scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".811W.3/1">If there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health, European Community legislation allows us to take appropriate safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of meat from all, or parts, of that country. At the time of the outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal, it was not deemed necessary to take safeguard action since the South African authorities had prohibited the issue of export certificates for fresh meat from the area in which the outbreak had occurred. This meant that exports from South Africa could not take place.</p>
	<p pid=".811W.3/2">On 7&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2000-11-08">8 November 2000</phrase> the European Commission informed the Standing Veterinary Committee (SVC) (now known as the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health) of the outcome of an inspection and indicated that safeguard measures may be necessary. On <phrase class="date" code="">25 November</phrase> the Commission published legislation prohibiting imports into the Community of fresh meat from 16 districts in the province of KwaZulu-Natal.</p>
	<p pid=".811W.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-05">5 January</phrase> the Government issued a Declaration under Regulation 35 of the Products of Animal Origin (Import and Export) Regulations 1996, prohibiting imports into England and Wales of meat from all of South Africa. Similar action was taken in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".811W.3/4">The outbreak in Mpumalanga was confirmed on <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase>. The Commission took action in February 2001 to extend EU restrictions on imports of meat in respect of Mpumalanga. By that time, the UK had already banned imports of meat from the whole country, so no further action was necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".817W.5/1">For a waste to be classified as &quot;hazardous&quot;, it must normally be listed as such in the European Waste Catalogue. Nappies, incontinence pads and cat litter are not listed as hazardous. It is open to Member States to determine that other wastes are hazardous where these display one or more of the hazardous properties specified in the Hazardous Waste Directive at above the thresholds the Directive specifies. Waste such as used disposable nappies and incontinence pads would be considered under property H9 (infectious). However, to be considered hazardous there would need to be a high risk that infectious substances were present in the waste at a concentration above that naturally encountered. Since the source population for household waste is healthy, the risk of infection is very low and nappies and incontinence pads do not therefore meet the criteria necessary for a &quot;hazardous&quot; classification. Where an individual is being treated by a health professional in their own home, it is for the health professional to make a clinical decision on whether or not the nature of the patient's illness would render the patient's hygiene waste infectious.</p>
	<p pid=".817W.5/2">Small amounts of animal waste arising in households, such as cat litter, can be placed in the bin, if suitably wrapped, and dealt with as municipal household waste.</p>
	<p pid=".817W.5/3">Defra is working with stakeholders to issue guidance for local authorities on dealing with hazardous household waste which will be issued prior to new hazardous waste regulations coming into force in July 2005.</p>

The Government are totally committed to this aim, as well as believing that landfilling waste is a lost opportunity to obtain economic value from discarded materials. While there is no doubt that one consequence of the Landfill Directive is to increase costs, it is true to say that in the past, the cost of landfill has not reflected its adverse environmental impact. In the many meetings with the non-ferrous metal industry, the Government have been encouraging it to reduce as far as possible the waste output from its operations, look at alternative treatments to landfill, see how the industry can still dispose of waste to landfill when there is no alternative disposal option currently available and encourage it to come forward with research proposals to achieve those above aims that may be able to draw on landfill tax funding.</p>

	<p pid=".822W.6/1">The Magpie is known to take songbirds although the available evidence suggests that this does not have a significant adverse effect on their population levels. Defra issues a general licence allowing year round control of Magpies, and a small number of other species, to conserve wild birds. This licence may be used by authorised persons only and the landowners' permission must be obtained. This licence is among a number of general licences relating to birds that is currently the subject of a consultation exercise.</p>
	<p pid=".822W.6/2">The decline in farmland birds has come to prominence during the last 10 years, but long term data on bird numbers indicates that many of these declines began over 25 years ago. The precise reason for the declines in different species varies, but in the majority of cases can be attributed to an intensification of farming practices during recent decades. This is demonstrated by the fact that population declines have been more marked in intensively managed arable farmland habitats compared with other habitats. The population status of songbird and farmland bird species are monitored and Defra is aware of declines in certain species.</p>

	<p pid=".823W.2/1">There are three Marine Nature Reserves (MNRs)&mdash;Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland (165 km <sup>2</sup> ), Lundy in England (13.9 km <sup>2</sup> ) and Skomer in Wales (13.24 km <sup>2</sup> ). Data from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee's &quot;Offshore Nature Project&quot; gives the total area of UK territorial waters as 161,200 km <sup>2</sup> . The three MNRs together cover 0.12 per cent. of territorial waters.</p>
	<p pid=".823W.2/2">Of the three MNRs, only one, Lundy, includes an area within it which is closed to fishing covering 3.3 km <sup>2</sup> . The remaining MNRs are closed only to certain types of fishing: Skomer MNR is closed to beam trawling, dredging and scallop fishing by any means; Strangford Lough MNR has a temporary ban in place on fishing with mobile gear. In addition there are small areas closed to fishing as a result of oil and gas explorations and defence activities.</p>
	<p pid=".823W.2/3">There are also a number of areas where restrictions on certain types of fishing are in place to protect both habitats and species. These include: the Darwin Mounds cold water coral reefs where bottom trawling is prohibited in an area covering 1,381 km <sup>2</sup> ; the Mackerel Box, a large area in the Western Channel and the Cornish peninsular where mainstream mackerel fishing is prohibited; the Sandeel Box, off the north-east coast of the UK where industrial fishing is banned to protect the food source of a range of predators including sea-birds; and, 37 bass nursery areas around the coast of England and Wales. Data on inshore and offshore restricted areas is not collated centrally to enable calculation to be made of the percentage of UK territorial waters encompassed by these areas.</p>

	<p pid=".828W.2/1">The Government have introduced a number of measures to increase the recycling of paper. For example, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is developing markets for waste paper as one of it's priority materials, and has been allocated &pound;30 million over three years to increase awareness of waste issues, and particularly recycling, amongst householders. The Government have also set statutory weight-based recycling targets, for every local authority. Measures taken to help authorities meet their targets include a Performance Reward Grant (PRG). This will be funded by &pound;45 million in 2005&ndash;06, rising to &pound;90 million in subsequent years; and will replace the Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund that has been contributing to improving local authorities performance over the past three years.</p>
	<p pid=".828W.2/2">Regulations implementing the Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste (2004/12/EC) have set targets for recycling paper packaging waste, peaking at 70 per cent. in 2008. Voluntary agreements are in place with the Newspaper Publishers Association and the Direct Marketing Association (DMA). These will increase the recycled content of newsprint to 70 per cent. in 2006 and of DMA literature to 70 per cent. in 2013. Targets set so far have been exceeded. Government are negotiating a similar agreement with the Periodical Publishers Association, to increase the recycling of post consumer magazines. In addition, under the Household Waste Recycling Act 2003, local authorities will have to collect at least two recyclable materials separate from other household waste by 2010.</p>

	<p pid=".828W.5/3">I understand however that the highways authority consulted the National Rivers Authority (the Environment Agency's predecessor) over proposed surface water discharges from the A13 improvements during the early 1990s. Consultation at that time would have involved both specific and general technical assessments of existing surface water drainage capacities within the surrounding area. One of the options considered would have been attenuation of increased flow from the A13 improvement works.</p>

	<p pid=".831W.0/1">For the purposes of this answer, &quot;inappropriate development&quot; is taken to mean development that is causing the unfavourable condition <sup>1</sup> of a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). To provide this information since 1997 would involve disproportionate cost. Factors adversely affecting sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) are continually updated according to the latest condition assessment completed by English Nature conservation officers. All SSSIs are assessed on a rolling basis at least once every six years. English Nature carried out the first round of condition assessments on the complete SSSI series in England between 1997&ndash;2003.</p>
	<p pid=".831W.0/2">According to the latest condition assessments <sup>2</sup> for each unit, 1,052 hectares of SSSI land <sup>3</sup> , on 55 different SSSIs, were in unfavourable condition due to activities authorised by development or mineral planning permission, excluding peat permissions. This is equivalent to 0.1 per cent. of the total SSSI area in England. The SSSI name, county and unit area adversely affected are detailed in the following table.</p>

It would involve both price and quota cuts in an initial phase, followed by a further review in 2008. This approach, which the Government welcomes as an important step in the right direction, should help to make sugar beet itself more competitive with other sources of biomass and biofuels, as well as promoting diversification among existing growers.</p>

	<p pid=".833W.8/2">The Government believes that the generation of electricity from wind farms can make a major contribution to achieving the 2010 targets for renewable energy. It is estimated that, if global warning continues as at present, 25 species of bird in Britain will be extinct by 2050.</p>
	<p pid=".833W.8/3">The Department for Trade and Industry works closely with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (which, like the DTI, has regulatory functions for offshore wind farm developments), the statutory nature conservation and other organisations as appropriate, to ensure that decisions on whether to grant consent for wind farm developments are considered in the light of the best available information about impacts on the environment and on birds in particular.</p>
	<p pid=".833W.8/4">One of the outcomes of this close working is that applicants for consents for those offshore wind farm developments proposed under Round 2 of Crown Estate leasing, will be required to provide two years of bird survey data as part of the environmental reports that are submitted with consent applications.</p>

	<p pid=".836W.0/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) were informed of our programme of enforced returns to Somalia and we keep in close contact with these Departments at official and ministerial level on the situation in Somalia. The Home Office's Country Information and Policy Unity (CIPU) produce country information materials that are used as the background against which asylum applications are considered. The FCO are consulted about these country information materials, prior to the publication of the documents in order to ensure that this material is accurate and comprehensive.</p>
	<p pid=".836W.0/2">Caseworkers also have access at all times to senior caseworkers with specific country knowledge, as well as to CIPU which provides up-to-date and specific information on request, drawing on a range of reliable sources, including the FCO, with which CIPU maintains regular contact. If, on the basis of the available information, a Somali asylum applicant is found not to be in need of protection by the Home Office and by the independent Immigration Appellate Authority, then it is considered safe for that person to be returned to Somalia, and they will be considered for removal. We do not routinely monitor the conditions of failed asylum seekers once they have been returned to their country, having been found to have no protection needs.</p>
	<p pid=".836W.0/3">It is also worth noting that according to the UNHCR's 2003 Global Refugee Report, 9,543 Somali refugees were assisted to return to North West Somalia (Somaliland) from Ethiopia and Djibouti, while 680 returned to North-west Somalia (Puntland) and four to Mogadishu, bringing the total number of assisted Somali returnees to 10,227 last year.</p>

	<p pid=".836W.3/14">Single Additional Payments were introduced when financial assistance was paid by way of vouchers. Now that support is provided entirely in cash, asylum seekers are no longer limited to where they can shop and can get better value for their money. Moreover, as applications are being processed more quickly, with 80 per cent. of initial claims processed within two months, the justification for one-off payments every six months is reduced.</p>
	<p pid=".836W.3/15">Asylum seekers can still apply for a &pound;300 maternity payment and since March 2003 additional support for pregnant women and children under three has meant that the level of asylum support has increased overall for these more vulnerable groups.</p>

The manner in which forces deal with the 999s from that point varies depending on whether the Force Control takes ownership or whether they have a centralised control/communication centres and they take ownership or whether they pass command and control to their Divisions, Basic Command Units or OCUs.</p>
	<p pid=".839W.3/2">At the present time there are about 32 forces who have a centralised function in one form or another and most other forces are in the planning stages to go down that route. However, information on how each force deals with the calls locally is not collated centrally.</p>

	<p pid=".845W.5/2">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) received application No. 4881924 on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-07">7 May 2004</phrase>. Following initial checks, the application was sent to Essex Constabulary in mid-May and it was returned to the bureau on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-19">19 July</phrase>. The Disclosure was completed and issued to your constituent on this date and I trust that it has now been received. I apologise for any inconvenience caused by its delay.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.5/3">The Criminal Records Bureau aims to complete 90 per cent. of all Enhanced Disclosures within four weeks and has been regularly meeting these targets since June 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.5/4">Factors such as the volume of applications, the number and availability of staff, the number and type of police data bases searched and the existence of any relevant intelligence on Disclosure applicants can affect processing time scales at any police force, including Essex Constabulary. The estimated despatch time for returning applications can therefore fluctuate, depending upon variations of these factors.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.5/5">In recent months, and due to a combination of these factors, checks undertaken by Essex Constabulary have been taking longer to complete and a backlog of cases has built up.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.5/6">Although this work is the responsibility of the constabulary, the CRB has been working closely with them to manage the backlog of cases and to minimise any disruption and inconvenience to Disclosure applicants.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.5/7">The CRB has in fact seconded a number of its staff in recent months to Essex and will shortly be sending more staff to help clear the outstanding work. This work is expected to be finished during the next two-three months and the backlog eliminated.</p>

	<p pid=".846W.2/1">The Home Office Departmental Report 2004 (Cm 6208) is the main vehicle by which the Home Office explains its aims and performance for 2003&ndash;04, and how it organised itself to deliver. As such it plays an important part in maintaining accountability to both Parliament and the public. It also provides key external stakeholders with an overview of the Department's activities as a whole.</p>

	<p pid=".846W.2/3">The report's publication was handled by the Stationery Office Ltd. (TSO). Under the terms of the contract with TSO that company generally meets the costs of printing and publication and uses its commercial judgement as to the number of copies which it prints and the sale price.</p>
	<p pid=".846W.2/4">The direct costs of production borne by the Home Office and the printing costs of those copies ordered by the Department came to &pound;65,282 excluding VAT and &pound;72,210 including VAT. This excludes the costs of staff time within the Department, obtaining estimates of which would involve disproportionate cost. 1,150 copies were purchased by the Department for distribution within its headquarters (to directors, board members and on request to other members of the Senior Civil Service) and to senior managers in key delivery partners such as probation areas, police forces, and Government offices. Copies were also made available to Parliament and the press. The report is also available without charge on the Department's website.</p>

	<p pid=".847W.8/2">A decision on whether or not to proceed with a case and press charges is a matter for the CPS, having received a file of evidence from the police. Decisions will be made on the appropriate level of charge once the two tests in the code for Crown Prosecutors have been passed. These are firstly whether there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and secondly that of the public interest. Victims' views are taken into consideration as part of the public interest test. The two tests must be passed before any criminal case can proceed. The procedure is the same regardless of gender or sexuality.</p>

	<p pid=".857W.5/4">Five action points have been agreed between the insurance industry, the voluntary and community sector (VCS) and Government:</p>
	<p pid=".857W.5/5" class="indent">1. The Home Office Minister responsible for communities will champion the cause of insurance for the voluntary and community sector.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.5/6" class="indent">2. Government work on employers' liability insurance, legal costs and full cost recovery, will be taken forward by The Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Home Office Active Communities Directorate, ensuring that the interests of the voluntary and community sector are taken into account.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.5/7" class="indent">3. Sources of practical advice and expertise on the required needs of the insurance industry will be brought together by providing access to relevant information on the Home Office, Association of British Insurers, and various voluntary and community sector organisation's websites, in order to increase the capacity of the sector to deal with insurance issues.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.5/8" class="indent">4. Better practical arrangements for working with local government will be investigated by the Home Office, working with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Local Government Association.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.5/9" class="indent">5. There will be an on-going dialogue between the voluntary and community sector, the insurance industry and government, facilitated by the Home Office through the Insurance Cover Working Group (ICWG) meeting to discuss progress and on-going issues, as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.5/10">Implementation of the plan has already started and will continue over the coming months as parcels of work are completed. The ICWG will be an &quot;honest broker&quot; between the VCS, the insurance industry and other key players, highlighting and discussing specific issues of concern to the VCS. I will champion this insurance issue for the VCS.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.5/11">The actions we are taking are practical measures to empower the VCS. For example, by encouraging greater understanding of the issues facing the VCS within the insurance industry, by facilitating greater dialogue, encouraging the principle of &quot;full cost recovery&quot; across Government and providing better and more accessible information regarding such things as risk management/bulk purchasing schemes/and basic details to do with the provision of insurance cover, all adding up to practical help for the VCS. However, these are just the first steps in an area where there can be no overnight changes. Therefore, the Government and their partners are committed to making a difference over the long term.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.5/12">In tandem with this longer term commitment, I have now set in motion a process for the delivery of a policy framework designed to address the increasing insurance burden and other concerns in the voluntary and community sector, particularly those parts of the sector that undertake activities with a greater element of risk. From this process we expect guidance to emerge on risk and its management as well as the development of a document similar to &quot;Making the Market Work&quot;, an initiative the Association of British Insurers (ABI) developed for the assessment of Trade Associations Health and Safety schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.5/13">This work will undoubtedly draw on the Working Group's report and benefit from the group's input. Copies of the paper &quot;Programme of Action&quot;, can be viewed and downloaded from the Home Office website: <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/comrace/active/developing/icwg.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/comrace/active/developing/ icwg.html</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".868W.8/15">The figures for the planned number of officer posts prior to 2004 are not an accurate reflection of the operational staffing requirement. These figures, based on forecast planned posts, included staff nominally identified for special units within prisons that were used infrequently and were staffed using additional supplementary hours from existing staff; and the staffing requirements for new accommodation that had not yet opened. The Prison Service introduced new arrangements for the collection of workforce data earlier this year to eliminate these anomalies and to reflect more accurately the operational staffing requirement. Before April 2001 the figures were collected as part of a general planning process and were not specifically designed for workforce planning purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".868W.8/16">A contract supplementary hours scheme has been in operation since April 2001, which allows governors to deploy existing staff on pre-arranged, additional hours contracts, to meet any shortfall in actual staffing availability. In April 2004 this scheme contributed the equivalent of 373 full-time officers. As a result, actual staffing availability at April 2004 (full-time equivalent staff in post plus the use of contracted supplementary hours) was (24,325) compared to the operational staffing requirement of (24,709). This represents a gap of 1.6 per cent, which the Director General considers to be an acceptable operating margin.</p>

The target was carried forward in the 2002 Public Service Agreement, with a new baseline of 2000. Latest published figures, for 1999, show that 3.2 per cent. fewer offenders were reconvicted than predicted. The Home Office also committed itself to maintaining the (then) current low number of escapes, including Category A escapes. There has been no escape of a Category A prisoner since 1995.

	<p pid=".870W.5/2">The requirements for Prison Service catering&mdash;for all types of establishment&mdash;are set out in the Prison Service Catering Manual (Prison Service Order 5000). Chapter 3 of the manual sets out the mandatory provisions required to produce nutritional meals. These include ensuring that:</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/3" class="indent">Catering management systems deliver a high standard of menus economically</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/4" class="indent">There is a multi-choice, pre-select menu that includes healthy options and reflects prisoners' preferences</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/5" class="indent">Prisons maintain high standards in the presentation and serving of food to prisoners</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/6" class="indent">There are regular independent inspections of food production and servery arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/7">All Prison Service establishments have the objective of offering a range of foods that enable prisoners to make healthy eating choices. All establishments must offer at least one lower fat/high fibre/lower sugar or lower salt item on each menu and there must be a clearly marked healthy eating option included on all menus. In particular prisons are required to offer a wide range of interesting fresh fruits, vegetables and salads. As well as being monitored during the cooking process nutrition is also monitored in food specifications via purchasing. Prison Service caterers are required to look objectively at menu selection and continually seek to modify their recipes, cooking methods and service towards more healthy guidelines.</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/8">Catering staff are provided with training information and the skills required to produce healthy food&mdash;this includes guidelines on how to cook food so as to retain as high a range of vitamins and minerals as possible. The Prison Service runs nutrition training courses at intermediate level for prison caterers&mdash;these lead to a formal qualification from the Royal Institute of Public Health. Some establishments involve the local hospital dietician in their menu planning and some have obtained Healthy Eating Awards (Heartbeat) from their local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/9">Increasingly&mdash;and through a partnership between prisons catering, education and PE departments&mdash;the Prison Service is encouraging individual prisoners to eat more healthily by:</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/10" class="indent">Reduction of fat intake, especially saturated fats which are thought to raise cholesterol levels in the blood</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/11" class="indent">Promotion of starchy, fibre-rich foods such as wholemeal bread, potatoes, pasta and rice together with fruit and vegetables</p>

	<p pid=".874W.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-19">19 July</phrase>, the Home Office published its strategic plan &quot;Confident Communities in a Secure Britain&quot;, setting out how it will cut crime in the next five years, including its goal of reducing re-offending through the rehabilitation of offenders.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.0/3">Some of the key elements include:</p>
	<p pid=".874W.0/4" class="indent">The development of a new strategy to target the most prolific offenders in our communities. Local areas have been asked to focus on the individuals who, in their judgement, are the most prolific, most persistently antisocial and who pose the greatest threat to the safety and confidence of their local communities. All local areas will be expected to have a scheme in place to tackle these offenders by <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-06">6 September 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.0/5" class="indent">More work with the parents of young offenders and greater use of supervised community programmes, including using electronic tagging and tracking.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.0/6" class="indent">The parallel publication of a National Action Plan to reduce re-offending through greater strategic direction and collaborative working. Over 60 action points have been agreed across Government within the main areas to support the rehabilitation of offenders. A complementary approach is being developed in Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.0/7" class="indent">The Action Plan has been set within our proposals for improving the management of offenders, with the establishment of a National Offender Management Service, providing better targeted interventions and clearer accountability for reducing re-offending.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.0/8" class="indent">Finally, because drug use contributes to an enormous proportion of re-offending, directing drug-using offenders into treatment is fundamental to our strategy. The development of through-care and after-care provisions are at the heart of the Criminal Justice Interventions Programme addressing the need and bridging the gap particularly for those drug misusing offenders leaving the criminal justice system and treatment.</p>

	<p pid=".875W.0/2">The cost of the Security Industry Authority (SIA) licence, which is valid for three years, reflects the licence application process and includes the current cost of a Criminal Records Bureau Standard Disclosure (28). It also funds the associated activities undertaken to secure the future of the private security industry. These include compliance with and enforcement of the licensing scheme, raising awareness, accommodation, personnel, and research costs. The licence fee is tax deductible.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.0/3">The private security industry contains a number of sectors each requiring their own skills and competencies. The SIA has worked closely with the industry to both identify and tailor training for these sector specific competencies. The nature of the sectors will mean that some training and competencies require sector specific licences. However, wherever possible, when competencies overlap between sectors, the SIA has exploited opportunities for one licence to be valid across a range of licensable activities.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.0/4">The manned guarding sector is expected to commence rollout in January 2005. The industry has been supporting the SIA by working in partnership to find a mutually beneficial approach to the transition to licensing and developing the most appropriate process. The 12 months between commencement and legal requirement will allow business to spread their employees' training requirements and applications over a mutually agreeable time frame that meets both the commercial needs of the industry and the implementation of regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".875W.0/5">The Government's White Paper published in 1999 envisaged that in-house staff employed on manned guarding duties would be covered by licensing arrangements. However, it was subsequently decided that, in light of differences in needs and circumstances between in-house provision and that under external contract, licensing requirements under the Act should not extend to in-house staff. More recently, the SIA has commissioned a detailed examination of in-house security provision, and a report is expected towards the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid=".877W.8/4">The Home Office has formed the Stop and Search Action Team to take work forward to ensure that stop and search as a police power is used fairly and as effectively as possible in the prevention and detection of crime. We have also published guidance for police forces on the authorisation of powers under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which emphasises the need to consider as wide a range of factors as possible when authorising the use of these powers.</p>
	<p pid=".877W.8/5">The powers within the Terrorism Act are aimed at terrorists, whatever their background or section of society they may come from. They are not aimed at a particular race, religion, or any other social group. In using them, the police have regard to the threat we face in this country from terrorism. That threat is mainly, but not exclusively, from international terrorism in connection with Al Qaida and its associated networks.</p>

As part of this initiative staff are encouraged to apply for up to five days Special Annual Leave per year, with pay, to undertake voluntary work. The initiative encourages volunteering and enables staff to see Home Office policies being delivered at the front line.</p>

	<p pid=".881W.6/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is aware of concerns about trade in products which appear to be raw unprocessed meat but which have been injected with excess added water, in some cases as high as 50 per cent., and moisture retaining ingredients. While there are no food safety concerns the FSA's view is that this practice is unacceptable. It is therefore pressing for stronger legislative controls at European Union level to prohibit use of moisture retaining ingredients, introduce limits on addition of water and improve labelling.</p>
	<p pid=".881W.6/2">The FSA is aware of concerns about the labelling of some pork products with lower levels of added water which are sold in United Kingdom supermarkets. A stakeholder meeting held earlier this year concluded that label declarations of added water on these products should be sufficiently prominent that consumers can make informed choices about the products they buy. The FSA is currently drawing up best practice guidelines to encourage clearer labelling.</p>

	<p pid=".887W.2/2">The campaign started on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June</phrase> and will continue throughout August in some monthly titles. The effectiveness of the campaign will be judged by the numbers of calls to the response line and by applications to join the &quot;Keeping in Touch&quot; scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".887W.8/1">This information is not held centrally but, in its report, &quot;The private dentistry market in the UK&quot;, the Office of Fair Trading estimated that the private dentistry market was valued at over &pound;1 billion in 2001, with 7 million people regularly receiving private dental treatment. We accept that the difficulties people have in accessing national health service dentistry in some areas has contributed to the growth in private dentistry. To address this problem, we are undertaking the most significant reform of NHS dentistry since the inception of the NHS. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-16">16 July</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, announced that an extra &pound;368 million has been allocated to recruiting 1,000 more dentists, funding an extra 170 training places for undergraduates in dental schools and increasing the overall expenditure on primary care NHS dental services by 19 per cent. Commissioning of these services is to be devolved from the Department so that, from October 2005, each primary care trust will have a duty to provide and secure the dental care it considers necessary to meet all reasonable requirements of its population.</p>

	<p pid=".894W.5/1">The national quality standards, which all providers of out-of-hours services must meet, include specific requirements that there is rapid and effective transmission of patient data between general practitioner practices and out-of-hours services, a system for transmitting information on patients with special needs from the practice to the provider, and all providers must be able to supply full clinical details of all consultations to the patient's GP practice by the next working day.</p>

In Nottingham local providers and practices are establishing systems for sharing patient information.

This is being extended and access to this is being enabled for other emergency care providers.</p>

	<p pid=".905W.2/1">The patient environment action team (PEAT) process for measuring hospital cleanliness was redesigned for the 2004 inspection round, following discussions with a number of representative bodies. The number of areas assessed this year was increased from 18 to 24.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.2/2">This has significantly extended the information available to hospitals about their performance. A new rating system was designed around a five-point scale and introduced an &quot;excellent&quot; category. The scoring process continues to be weighted in relation to cleanliness issues in wards and accident and emergency departments.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.2/3">The new national healthcare standards, published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase>, include cleanliness and performance against them will be rated in the Healthcare Commission's annual assessments of national health service bodies in England. The Commission will undertake a review of hospital cleanliness and infection control shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".906W.9/1">All authorised insulins, whether human (synthetic) insulin or animal insulin, have been demonstrated to be efficacious in people with diabetes mellitus. As part of the licensing approval process for any medicinal product, including insulins, the applicant has to provide evidence that the product meets appropriate standards of quality, safety and efficacy. These standards are set out in European Guidance documents, including, for example, &quot;Notes for Guidance on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus&quot; (CPMP/EWP/1080/00). This will include clinical trial data of appropriate duration in patients with diabetes as set out in the guidance document. The primary purpose of the confirmatory studies involving the assessed insulin is to demonstrate a favourable effect on blood glucose control (this is considered clinically relevant in terms of risk reduction of diabetic complications).</p>
	<p pid=".906W.9/2">Data on mortality rates, development of diabetic complications and quality of life are not necessarily required for the licensing process. Additionally, there are no requirements for comparative studies between animal and synthetic insulins as part of the licensing process. Therefore, the licensing process has not compared mortality rates, development of diabetic complications or the quality of life of patients using animal and synthetic insulins. After licensing, all drugs, including insulins, are continually monitored for safety. The decision to use one or other of the insulins rests with the physician in consultation with the patient.</p>
	<p pid=".906W.9/3">The committee on safety of medicines and its sub-committee on pharmacovigilance (SCOP) have kept the safety of synthetic (human) insulins under close review and have considered the available data on a number of occasions. Most recently in 2002, the SCOP considered the findings of an independent review of controlled clinical trial data by the Cochrane collaboration. The conclusions of the Cochrane review were that there is no difference in blood glucose control or the incidence of adverse events between patients on synthetic insulin compared with patients on animal insulins. The SCOP confirmed its previous advice that there is no clear evidence of a safety problem specific to human insulin.</p>

	<p pid=".908W.5/2">Section 4(1) of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 provides that a national health service trust may make an application to the independent regulator for authorisation to become a NHS foundation trust, if the application is supported by the Secretary of State. Section 4(4)<i>(a)</i> provides that once a NHS trust has made this application, the provisions of the trust's proposed constitution will have effect for the purpose of establishing an initial membership, electing a board of governors and appointing a board of directors, and enabling boards to make preparations for the performance of their functions. Applicant trusts are expected to implement their governance arrangements while the independent regulator considers their application.</p>
	<p pid=".908W.5/3">The independent regulator has deferred consideration of the application made by King's College Hospital NHS Trust for authorisation on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July</phrase>. The chairman of the independent regulator has asked the trust to submit further evidence by the end of the year, against which he will consider the application for authorisation. Therefore, prospective NHS foundation trust functions arising from that application continue to exist.</p>

There is also financial support for childcare, travel and books. The chief nursing officer has contacted former midwives by letter to encourage them to return to the NHS. To support this, the Department allocated &pound;750,000 to workforce development confederations in 2003&ndash;04 to fund 500 return to practice places for midwives. To encourage returners, a new NHS careers return to practice guide for midwives was published in January 2004. Copies are available in the Library. In addition, the Department has funded the Royal College of Midwives, in collaboration with Open University, to design a flexible return to practice open learning programme.</p>

Friend, the Secretary of State has delegated these income generating powers to all national health service trusts, including ambulance and mental health trusts, primary care trusts and strategic health authorities. Guidance, clearly setting out under what circumstances income generation powers can be used, was issued to the NHS in November 2001. A copy of the guidance is available in the Library.</p>

	<p pid=".915W.2/2">Due to an increase in call volumes and the success of the pilot NHS Direct service for Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, the existing premises at Highcroft in Winchester, which had been the location of the initial call centre since March 1999, were considered to be unsuitable for the growth of the service. In February 2001, the NHS Direct management team within the Department, in consultation with external estates advisers and NHS Estates, decided to locate a new call centre at Berrywood Business Village, Hedge End. The selection criteria used for deciding the location of the new call centre included access by public and private transport and security for staff attending and leaving work. The new call centre was opened in September 2001. Other locations considered were Silver Hill in Winchester, Link 414 in Chandlers Ford, Easton Lane in Winchester and Belbins Business Park in Romsey.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/3">The cost of furnishing and equipping the premises was &pound;1.6 million. Current accommodation costs and capital charges are &pound;750,000 per year.</p>
	<p pid=".915W.2/4">There are currently 136 whole time equivalent (wte) staff employed by the NHS Direct special health authority at the call centre. 58 of the staff are nurses (G grade), 47 are health information advisers (administrative and clerical 5) and the rest are managers or support staff. Staffing costs for the current financial year are &pound;4.53 million. Staff numbers in previous years were 125 (wte) in 2001&ndash;02, 140 (wte) in 2002&ndash;03 and 140 (wte) in 2003&ndash;04.</p>

	<p pid=".918W.0/1">NHS Professionals was operating through various national health service bodies until <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-01">1 January 2004</phrase>, when it was established as a special health authority (SHA) in shadow form. From <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> it became a fully established SHA. The Department was NHS Professionals' main source of funding in 2003&ndash;04. Anticipated investment was &pound;22 million in the financial year 2003&ndash;04. NHS Professionals will be audited by the National Audit Office for 2003&ndash;04 and accounts for the period it was in shadow form in 2003&ndash;04 will be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".918W.0/2">The NHS Purchasing and Supplies Agency will audit NHS Professionals' compliance with the standards laid down in the agency framework agreements in exactly the same way that it audits compliance by commercial agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".918W.0/3">The Department has set up formal performance review arrangements with NHS Professionals. The benefits from the establishment of NHS Professionals will be achieved by reduced costs and higher standards in the recruitment and development of temporary staff. NHS trusts have already seen a reduction in temporary staffing costs and improvement in bank fill rates due to NHS Professionals. Local agency agreements have also saved an estimated &pound;50 million over the past year.</p>
