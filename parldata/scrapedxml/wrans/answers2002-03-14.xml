	<p pid=".1179W.3/1">The Ministry of Defence has funded extensive research into DU munitions over many years. This work has been complemented by studies on the health and environmental consequences of the testing, development and battlefield use of DU munitions carried out by a range of governmental and non-governmental bodies in the UK and overseas. These studies, and the Royal Society's report, all indicate that the health risks associated with the battlefield use of DU are minimal, other than in a small number of very specific circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".1179W.3/2">Nevertheless, there are a number of areas where we believe that further research is desirable to enhance the database on which to make judgments weighing the potential loss of life arising from not using DU munitions in battle against any potential longer term impact on human health and the environment resulting from its use. Some research will aid MOD in any future test-range decommissioning.</p>
	<p pid=".1179W.3/3">We therefore propose to carry out a programme of further research, which has been reviewed by the Royal Society, the Medical Research Council and the Natural Environment Research Council. We have given veterans' representatives early sight of the programme. The full details of our proposals have been placed in the Library of the House. They have also been published on the MOD's website.</p>
	<p pid=".1179W.3/4">Much of the work is in line with the recommendations of the Royal Society's report. In particular, we propose to conduct an epidemiological study to identify any links between exposure to DU and ill health, and a critical review of literature relating to the effects of DU inhalation on the pulmonary lymph nodes. We also intend to study the ways in which DU is transported from the point of introduction into the environment to the point at which it has the potential to affect the health of plant, animal or human life. Furthermore, we have already begun research into the corrosion and dissolution rates of DU in typical corrosion environments and in controlled laboratory studies. We intend to consider a range of soil types and profiles and marine environments in this work.</p>
	<p pid=".1179W.3/5">In addition, we propose to carry out research into the operational role of DU munitions and consider alternative penetrator materials. We aim to conduct a radiochemical analysis of DU rounds and examine contamination in the barrels used to fire DU round. Further to this, we aim to review and address work being conducted by others on biokinetic modelling related to uranic materials.</p>
	<p pid=".1179W.3/6">These research activities are in addition to work that MOD is already undertaking. We have set up the independent Depleted Uranium Oversight Board, which includes independent members of the scientific community and veterans' representatives as well as MOD staff and is now overseeing the programme of work to devise a valid test for uranium isotopes in urine and a methodology for a voluntary DU screening programme for Balkans and Gulf veterans. We are developing our policy of biological monitoring for DU for troops on operations. We are also collecting data on the levels of DU in environmental samples in Kosovo. Annual surveys are already in progress at UK ranges where DU has been fired.</p>
	<p pid=".1179W.3/7">It will be necessary to set priorities for funding each of the proposals, and re-assess their relevance and content as the research progresses.</p>

	<p pid=".1189W.11/1">Comprehensive data on mortality rates in internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in Afghanistan are not available. However, as access has improved in Afghanistan, agencies have been able to provide better- targeted assistance and to monitor the situation more effectively. For example, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has reported a significant decrease in mortality rates at Maslakh camp outside Herat. An estimated 180,000 displaced persons, mostly from Ghor and Badghis provinces, have been living in Maslakh camp since September 2000. By December 2001, the crude mortality rate was 0.47 per 10,000 people: a death rate of approximately 50 persons per week. This figure has now halved to approximately 0.2 per 10,000.</p>
	<p pid=".1189W.11/2">The Immediate and Transitional Assistance Programme for the Afghan People, prepared by the UN in consultation with the Afghan Interim Authority, sets out priorities and objectives for the population of Afghanistan in the period up to December 2002. One of the key activities in the health sector is to strengthen the population and health statistical data system in Afghanistan. This will help build national capacity to collect and compile urgently needed data on the health needs of the Afghan population, and monitor mortality rates across the country.</p>

Sporadic fighting in some areas, continuing lawlessness, as well as the presence of mines and unexploded ordnance, continue to prevent unhindered access to parts of Afghanistan. Because of the precarious security situation in some parts of Afghanistan, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is cautioning Afghans against spontaneously returning to certain areas.

	<p pid=".1191W.5/1">There are two child specific Millennium Development Goals, reducing the under five mortality rate and ensuring that children of both sexes will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling. However all the MDGs clearly have significant impacts on child poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".1191W.5/2">The contribution of the UK to making progress towards these targets is outlined in DFID's public service agreement. The results of our efforts so far will be published next month in our departmental report.</p>
	<p pid=".1191W.5/3">Global progress towards the goals is set out in the joint UN and World Bank report 'A Better World For All.' The report indicates that significant progress has been made towards halving the proportion of people whose income is less than a dollar a day, a target that will greatly impact on child poverty. Progress has also been made on a more limited basis, on reducing child mortality rates and increasing in the numbers of boys and girls enrolled in primary school.</p>
	<p pid=".1191W.5/4">The UN General Assembly has agreed to produce annual reports on progress in reaching the MDGs. This information should serve to motivate the international community and strengthen and better target the efforts made to support progress towards the MDGs. We are currently working with other donor partners, the UN, World Bank and Development Assistance Committee to increase the capacity of developing countries to monitor statistics on a country basis, to support international monitoring of the MDGs, and to enable developing countries to develop national strategies for poverty reduction and sustainable development on the basis of accurate and current information.</p>

	<p pid=".1193W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and I represented the UK at the Council. The GAC adopted the &quot;A&quot; points listed in document 6220/02. It also noted the resolutions, decisions and opinions adopted by the European Parliament listed in document 5079/02 PE-RE 5. Copies of these documents have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. No formal votes were taken. Conclusions were reached by consensus on a number of issues, as follows.</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/2" class="italic">Zimbabwe</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/3">The Council heard a report from the head of the EU election observation mission, whom the Government of Zimbabwe had refused to accredit. Ambassador Schori's report confirmed that the conditions did not exist for the EU to mount a credible mission. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-28">28 January</phrase>, the Council had agreed that the consultations with Zimbabwe under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement would be closed and targeted sanctions implemented if the Government of Zimbabwe prevented the deployment of an EU election observation mission, or if it prevented the mission from operating effectively, or prevented the international media from having free access to cover the election, or if there was a serious deterioration in the situation on the ground, or if the election was assessed as not being free and fair.</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/4">At the February GAC, the Council concluded that the principles enshrined in Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement had not been respected despite all efforts made by the European Union through Article 8 dialogue and later, Article 96 consultations. Consequently, and in the light of its January agreement, the Council decided to close Article 96 consultations and take appropriate measures. Furthermore, the Council decided to implement targeted sanctions in the form of an embargo on the sale, supply or transfer of arms and technical advice, assistance or training related to military activities and an embargo on the sale or supply of equipment which could be used for internal repression in Zimbabwe, as well as a travel ban on persons who engage in serious violations of human rights and of the freedom of opinion, of association and of peaceful assembly in Zimbabwe and a freezing of their funds, other financial assets or economic resources. The Council also decided to withdraw without delay all EU electoral observers still present in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/5" class="italic">Work in other Council formations</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/6">The Council took stock of a presidency report on work on the most important issues currently under discussion in other Council configurations, including topics being considered in the ECOFIN, Agriculture, Justice and Home Affairs and Education Councils. The Council noted that a number of these issues were of particular relevance in the run-up to the spring European Council in Barcelona. The Council also agreed to monitor the work of the Convention on the future of the European Union. <i>Barcelona European Council</i></p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/7">The presidency outlined plans for practical organisation of the Barcelona European Council, noting that the GAC on 11&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-03-12">12 March</phrase> would focus on substantive preparations. The Council agreed that the Barcelona European Council should take a number of concrete steps on priority actions to be taken to ensure delivery of the EU's economic reform strategy set at the Lisbon European Council in 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/8">The Council noted that separate meetings with Heads of State or Government, Foreign Ministers and Finance Ministers from the candidate countries would be held during the Barcelona Council. The Council was informed that a summit with social partners would take place on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-14">14 March</phrase> with the participation of the President of the European Council, the President of the Commission, the Prime Ministers of Denmark and Greece, as well as their respective Employment Ministers.</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/9" class="italic">Enlargement</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/10">The Council noted a Commission presentation on financial aspects of the enlargement negotiations, following recent discussions by Foreign and Finance Ministers. The Council invited the Commission to submit draft common positions for the negotiating chapters on Financial and Budgetary Provisions, Agriculture and Regional Policy and Co-ordination of Structural Instruments as soon as possible, taking into account the Council's deliberations. The Council recalled that timely production of these draft common positions was essential in order to keep to the road map laid down by the Nice European Council and the timetable for concluding negotiations agreed by the European Councils in Goteborg and Laeken. The Council reaffirmed that the negotiations will be based on the present acquis and on the financial framework ceilings decided by the European Council in Berlin in 1999.</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/11" class="italic">Economic and social cohesion report</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/12">The Council heard a Commission presentation of the update to the second report on economic and social cohesion. The report updates the data presented in January 2001, analyses potential disparities in a Union of 25 and summarises the debate on future cohesion policy after enlargement. The Council instructed the Permanent Representatives Committee to examine this report with a view to further work by the Council in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/13" class="italic">Debate on the effectiveness of the EU's external actions</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/14">The Council held a policy debate on ways for the Union to achieve more effective and comprehensive external action on the basis of a presidency paper and report by the Commission. Ministers addressed the relationship between development and foreign policy objectives; the need for improved flexibility and responsiveness; and the need for speedy delivery of external assistance and the quality of such assistance. The presidency suggested in particular that the Secretary-General/High Representative and the Commission looked further at specific areas of work for improving effectiveness, including the use of case studies, improved co-ordination in the field, better use of decentralisation and improving inter-pillar co-ordination. The outcome of this work should be submitted to the May GAC, at which an initial review could be undertaken with a possible further review in the autumn. <i>Middle East Peace Process</i></p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/15">The Foreign Secretary and the German Foreign Minister both briefed partners on their visits to the middle east. The GAC reaffirmed the EU's view, as set out in the Laeken European Council declaration, that a political perspective must be established if there is to be sustained progress. It was accepted that an improved security situation was an essential first step and this required determined action by the Palestinian Authority. The importance of close EU-US co-ordination was stressed. High Representative Solana was asked to return to the region.</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/16" class="italic">UN Financing for Development conference</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/17">The Commission presented proposals for increasing the quantity and quality of official development assistance (ODA). The Council invited the Permanent Representatives Committee to examine the Commission's proposals before the March General Affairs Council so that the Union can make an important contribution to the success of the UN conference, to be held that month in Mexico, through the adoption of positive initiatives.</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/18" class="italic">Western Balkans</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/19">High Representative Solana briefed Ministers on developments in Montenegro. On Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), High Representative Petritsch outlined the recent achievements and the likely future challenges. He confirmed that he would step down by the end of May, to be succeeded by Lord Ashdown. The Council expressed its willingness to appoint Lord Ashdown as the EU Special Representative in BiH (EUSR) when he becomes High Representative. The Council announced the EU's readiness to ensure the follow-on to the UN International Police Task Force (IPTF) in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/20" class="italic">Relations with third countries on combating terrorism</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/21">There was a brief discussion on the basis of a presidency paper on options for including counter- terrorism co-operation in future EU/third country agreements. Officials were invited to continue work, on the basis that there should be rapid progress to incorporate the EU's commitment to counter-terrorism into future agreements.</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/22" class="italic">Meetings of EU Defence Ministers</p>
	<p pid=".1193W.0/23">The Council endorsed a presidency proposal that Defence Ministers should be able to meet under the aegis of the GAC, for discussion of military/capabilities aspects of ESDP.</p>

	<p pid=".1196W.9/1">After 36 years' service the VC10s were withdrawn from their ministerial transport role at the end of 2001. The royal family had ceased using the VC10 nine years ago. The Government considered a number of options for future long-range royal and ministerial air travel. These included chartering commercial aircraft, adapting an existing RAF aircraft, and procuring a new aircraft.</p>
	<p pid=".1196W.9/2">The Government have decided that when a dedicated aircraft is needed it will charter a commercial aircraft. In line with current practice, any accompanying business- people or press will usually be asked to pay their share of costs. Where there are security concerns RAF planes will be used. We assess that this approach is likely to be the most cost-effective. In many cases a dedicated aircraft is not necessary and Ministers and members of the royal family will continue to travel on scheduled flights.</p>
	<p pid=".1196W.9/3">For the longer-term the Ministry of Defence will consider whether cost-effective provision of royal and ministerial air transport might be incorporated within the contract for the RAF's future strategic tanker aircraft, due to enter service towards the end of this decade.</p>

	<p pid=".1204W.0/1">The Secretary of State confirmed in February 2002 that following placement of an objection to de-trunking of the A46/A36 by the South West Regional Assembly a further study into the management of the route and the traffic problems related to the route in Bath would be commissioned shortly. Formal appointment of a consultant to undertake the work is progressing with interviews of those firms shortlisted taking place soon. Not until this study had been completed, December 2002 in the current programme, would Bath and North East Somerset Council agree to continue with de-trunking negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".1204W.0/2">There are four other local authorities involved in taking over sections of the route on satisfactory completion of de-trunking negotiations. No serious obstacles to completing negotiations successfully with these remaining four authorities have been identified. Although this might suggest that a piecemeal de-trunking of the route is possible this would not be in the public interest nor would this course of action answer the Regional Assembly's objection.</p>

	<p pid=".1207W.6/1">I fully recognise the need to improve the reliability of remote access services for hon. Members' constituency staff. As a short-term measure, the Parliamentary Communications Directorate has tested an upgrade to the existing remote access software (Citrix) and plans to make it available shortly to all hon. Members. It is expected that this upgrade will improve the performance of the remote access service, within the limitations of the Citrix product.</p>
	<p pid=".1207W.6/2">The question of remote access for constituency staff is a matter for the President of the Council and is being pursued in the context of the changes to hon. Members' allowances which were agreed by the House on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-05">5 July 2001</phrase>. I understand that the House is in the final stages of placing a contract to provide Members with improved access to the Internet and to the Parliamentary Data and Video Network (PDVN) via a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP). Once the necessary administrative, financial and technical elements are in place, Members' constituency offices will be able to connect directly to the PDVN using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), which will allow broadband access (such as ADSL where available) as well as ISDN and dial-up services. It is hoped that a pilot of the new service will take place in July 2002, and I am optimistic that this long-term solution will provide considerable benefits for hon. Members and their staff.</p>

	<p pid=".1215W.0/1">The National Curriculum is gender-free, requiring equality of opportunity for girls and boys between the ages of five and 16. Pupils study an equal balance of biology, physics and chemistry together with aspects of earth science and astronomy. Results in primary science are excellent; in 2001, 87 per cent. of pupils achieved level 4, the standard expected for their age, or above, a 25 per cent. increase since 1996. Building on the achievements at primary level, we are piloting a science strategy designed to raise standards for all 11 to 14-year-olds and a national programme will be introduced in all schools in September. In recognition of its importance in preparing young people for adult and working life, we are proposing the retention of science as a core subject for 14 to 16-year-olds in our consultation document: &quot;14&ndash;19 extending opportunities, raising standards&quot;.</p>

However, in the light of the improvement in quality shown in the 2001 RAE, my Department has made available an extra &pound;30 million in 2002&ndash;03 to allow the Higher Education Funding Council for England better to support high quality research in higher education.

	<p pid=".1221W.3/20"><sup>(8)</sup> From 1997, figures relate to applications rather than appellants.</p>
	<p pid=".1221W.3/21">It is not possible to tell from these figures exactly how many prisoners were released from prison in each of the last 10 years as a result of their convictions being quashed. This is because not all of those who have successfully appealed against conviction will be in custody at the time their convictions are overturned; the outcome of the re-trials ordered is not available; and the table does not take any account of summary convictions quashed by the Crown court, or of convictions quashed by the House of Lords (figures for which are not available). In addition, the table's figures for appeal outcomes from 1997 onward are for the number of applications heard (each of which could have involved more than one appellant). As to <i>(b)</i>, it is only appellate courts which have the power to quash a conviction.</p>

	<p pid=".1222W.0/1">The air conditioning central chiller plant in 50 Queen Anne's Gate was replaced last year, because the old plant contained Chlorofluorocarbons, which were banned from <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-31">31 December 2000</phrase>. This project did not form part of a larger refurbishment.</p>
	<p pid=".1222W.0/2">The procurement of the replacement chillers was handled using the standard procurement procedures for works contracts below the value of &pound;3.6 million. Consultant engineers, Torpy Management (now known as Halcrow) and the Facilities Management Contractors, Johnson Controls, were asked to select five firms established in this particular field to tender. Anot<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/929" name="John Gummer">her firm chaired by the right hon. Member for Suffolk Coastal (Mr. Gummer)</phrase> offering an innovative environmentally friendly solution approached our consultants. This firm was seriously considered, but was not invited to tender, because our consultants considered that the alternative offered would have increased the cost and project risk unacceptably. The building work required in an occupied building would have been more extensive. In making this decision, the consultants took advice from the then Property Advisers to the Civil Estate (now part of the Office of Government Commerce) and experts within their own organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".1222W.0/3">The consultants were aware of the Home Office's Greening Operations Policy, which advised that environmentally friendly alternatives to Hydrofluorocarbons should be used where feasible. It was their view that a safe, technically feasible and cost-effective environmentally preferable solution did not exist in this particular case, taking into account that the building is in need of a major overall refurbishment and the Department's plans to relocate to 2 Marsham Street in three to four years' time. However, the firms that were asked to tender were invited to offer environmentally innovative solutions&mdash;none did so and the contract was awarded in October 2000 to a firm using a standard environmentally compliant refrigerant containing Hydrofluorocarbons.</p>

	<p pid=".1226W.0/1">The Sex Offenders Act 1997 requires offenders cautioned for, convicted of, or found not guilty by reason of insanity of an offence specified in Schedule One to the Act to provide certain details to the police. There is, however, no &quot;register&quot; of sex offenders, as such; nor are sex offenders subject to the requirements of the Act separately identified as such in criminal statistics.</p>
	<p pid=".1226W.0/2">Until recently, data on the number of sex offenders subject to the requirements of the Act were collated biannually on a national basis from the police national computer. However, this arrangement has been overtaken following guidance issued by the Home Office in respect of the provisions in section 67 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000. The guidance requires information about the number of sex offenders subject to the Act's requirements in each police area to be published on an annual basis starting in 2002 and local systems are being put in place to deliver this. Until these systems are in place information on numbers of sex offenders subject to the Act's requirements could be obtained only by a specific exercise by the particular police force concerned. We have no plans to require publication by constituency or to break down published figures further.</p>

However, WSP South Ltd. have designed the environmental services to provide a comfortable environment with minimal use of comfort cooling ie air-conditioning by adopting a mixed mode strategy. Full comfort cooling is provided only in areas where this strategy is impractical due to high heat gains eg computer rooms, printing rooms etc.</p>

	<p pid=".1236W.5/1">Since its inception, the Serious Fraud Office has identified some common obstacles to securing prosecutions of major fraud cases and these can arise at either the investigative stage or during the trial. During the investigation these can include:</p>
	<p pid=".1236W.5/2" class="indent">Dearth of police resource and expertise. This is addressed in the recent report of the Interdepartmental Working Party, chaired by the SFO, which has recommended the establishment of a national Police Fraud Squad or increased resources for the SFO to enable them to use more civilian investigators.</p>
	<p pid=".1236W.5/3" class="indent">Sheer weight of documentary and computer-generated material which has to be sifted, analysed and organised often under constraints of time.</p>
	<p pid=".1236W.5/4" class="indent">Most cases of major fraud have an international association as either the evidence, the witnesses or defendants are outside the jurisdiction of the courts.</p>
	<p pid=".1236W.5/5">Obstacles at the trial stage include:</p>
	<p pid=".1236W.5/6" class="indent">Lack of a single substantive offence of &quot;fraud&quot;, which obliges the prosecutor to charge theft or deception offences.</p>
	<p pid=".1236W.5/7" class="indent">Demonstrating where dishonesty lies in unfamiliar commercial and financial transactions where the forum is unfamiliar with the context or the financial instruments involved.</p>
	<p pid=".1236W.5/8" class="indent">Attempting to simplify what are, in many cases, essentially very complex commercial transactions in specialist financial markets can detract from the ability to demonstrate the &quot;whole picture&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1236W.5/9" class="indent">Availability of trained judges with experience of serious fraud cases. This is an issue currently being addressed by the senior presiding judge.</p>

	<p pid=".1237W.0/1">The Serious Fraud Office investigates and prosecutes offences involving serious or complex fraud. It also pursues related laundering offences. It is investigating or has prosecuted seven cases involving money laundering offences (under the Criminal Justice Act 1988) in the last five years. the Serious Fraud Office also assists foreign competent judicial authorities with requests for information and the gathering of evidence via the UK Central Authority thus serving as an important part of the global deterrent against money laundering.</p>
	<p pid=".1237W.0/2">In many cases, financial gains are illusory or have long since been dissipated but whenever it is appropriate and practicable, the SFO will pursue proceeds during the investigation and these may be confiscated by the trial judge for distribution to creditors and investors.

	<p pid=".1240W.9/2">Rates of benefit are reviewed each year taking into consideration the change in the general level of prices in the September prior to the April in which the new rates are to come into force. Generally, contributory and non-contributory benefits are uprated by the Retail Prices Index and income-related benefits by the Rossi index (RPI less housing costs). However, there is discretion to increase rates other than in line with the rate of inflation, for example, the minimum income guarantee was increased by more than inflation to help combat pensioner poverty.</p>

Decisions on fitness for work are made on an individual basis depending upon the overall status of the applicant and their ability to perform their duties without risk to themselves or others.</p>

	<p pid=".1248W.2/2">We recognise that the standard of cleanliness in our hospitals is important to patients, their relatives, staff and the public. The investment we have made since the publication of the NHS Plan has seen standards raised across the board. The implementation of the Patient Environment Action Team programme has ensured that this issue remains high on trusts' agendas and a further round of unannounced inspections is currently under way to ensure that the progress made has been maintained and, where necessary, built upon.</p>
	<p pid=".1248W.2/3">As announced in the NHS Plan, there is now a national standard of cleanliness for the NHS which all trusts with in-patient beds are required to report against as part of the performance assessment framework. This means that for the first time there is a comprehensive standard for the whole NHS which is outcome-based and measures what is, or is not, clean. NHS trusts will need to employ sufficient staff to ensure that these standards are met, or to adjust cleaning contracts accordingly.</p>
	<p pid=".1248W.2/4">The responsibility for ensuring wards are clean has been restored to ward sisters, with the support of modern matrons, and they have also been given the authority to withhold payment where the required standards are not met.</p>
	<p pid=".1248W.2/5">The NHS Plan also set a target for ward-housekeepers to be in place in 50 per cent. of hospitals by 2004. The duties of the ward house-keeper will include working alongside cleaning staff, who may be directly or indirectly employed, to ensure that ward environments are clean, tidy and well maintained and they will report to ward sisters. Already 41 per cent. of trusts have started to introduce ward-housekeepers.</p>
	<p pid=".1248W.2/6">Attracting staff to work in the NHS requires there to be career opportunities and pathways which are attractive and flexible. The introduction of the ward-housekeeper role provides a further pathway for staff, who may enter the NHS as cleaners, to develop their skills and continue their career in the NHS.</p>
