	<p pid="c.839W.3/1">Desalination not been previously used as an option for water supply in the UK. Costs and emissions will be determined by the particulars of the operation concerned, for example, each will depend on whether brackish or sea water is involved; the source of energy used; and whether or not the plant is used continuously or to meet peak demands.</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.3/2">Projections from South East Water, who are constructing a small desalination plant on the Southcoast, point to an energy consumption around 4.5&ndash;4.7 kWh per cubic metre of water produced, using energy from a combined heat and power plant. The company has also estimated, in its business plan for the Periodic Review of water prices in 2004, that the cost will be around 47 p per cubic metre.</p>

	<p pid="c.839W.6/2">Defra has policy responsibility for flood risk management in England, funds most of the Environment Agency's flood related work and grant aids individual projects undertaken by local authorities and internal drainage boards. The programme to manage risk is driven by the operating authorities; Defra does not build defences, nor direct the authorities on which specific projects to undertake.</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.6/3">Funding is allocated to different priorities within the full range of Departmental responsibilities from the overall allocation for the Department set in the Government's regular Spending Reviews. The 2004 Review set spending limits for 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08. The Government's Comprehensive Spending Review in 2007 will set allocations for 2008&ndash;09 to 2010&ndash;11. The level of spending on flood risk management is being considered as part of this, as is the level of the Department's spend across all areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.839W.6/4">We are committed to the effective management of flood and coastal erosion risk and have increased funding significantly in recent years. In cash terms funding from central and local government has doubled from &pound;307 million in 1996&ndash;97 to an estimated outturn of &pound;600 million in 2005&ndash;06, a real terms increase of 40 per cent. after inflation.</p>

	<p pid="c.840W.5/1">The Environment Agency's improvement programme for the Suffolk coast is shown as follows. The Agency considers some projects will be exempt from DEFRA's priority scoring requirement because of the Government's legal obligation to protect environmental sites of international importance. The need for such works has to be agreed with English Nature (Natural England) for individual cases. Felixstowe Ferry Sea Defences and Bawdsey Sea Defences are being promoted with levy funding from local authorities rather than DEFRA grant in aid and are not therefore subject to DEFRA's priority scoring requirement.</p>

	<p pid="c.844W.0/1">It is for the individual water companies concerned to consider the need for increasing provision of water in fulfilment of their statutory duties to maintain adequate supplies of water. They have 25 year water resource plans which seek to reconcile supply with anticipated demand. This forward planning framework exists to take account of factors such as the water supplyand disposal infrastructure required to service significant new housing developments such as that proposed under the Sustainable Communities Plan. Water resources plans will become a statutory requirement under the provisions of the Water Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.844W.0/2">ODPM and Defra jointly commissioned a major research project, 'A Sustainability Impact Study of Additional Housing Scenarios in England', to consider the environmental, social and economic impacts of additional housing supply proposed by the Barker Review. As part of the project a nine-region model was developed to examine the relationship between housing supply and various environmental impacts, including land take, waste production, water use and energy use. The research indicated that the reaching the Government's ambition of 200,000 additional new houses would result in an additional demand of 12 million litres per day in 2016 above the 12,728 million litres/day in the baseline.</p>

Subject to those rights it is for water companies to decide in which circumstances to base their charges on metering and in which circumstances on another basis.

Most non-household customers pay a charge calculated via a volumetric rate. Most water and sewerage undertakers also levy a fixed charge on their non-household customers according to the size of the meter that the customer has. This fixed charge varies from company to company.</p>

	<p pid="c.848W.15/1">The building works are progressing satisfactorily and the Hall is currently on programme to re-open in early October at the end of the summer recess period as originally planned. The Hall has been closed since the beginning of the year to allow the reconstruction of the steps at the south end of the Hall to take place. General enabling works took place beneath the steps (to remove asbestos and secure building services) out of sight of visitors. Work has now commenced inside the Hall including removal of the steps, flooring slabs and archaeological exploratory operations. The works may be viewed through windows inserted in the safety hoarding across the top of the steps at St. Stephens entrance.</p>

The forecasts supporting bids for funding are scrutinised carefully by the Department. Those which do not follow the Department's guidelines or which appear to be biased are routinely challenged, leading to revisions in the analysis before funding is agreed.</p>

The UK played a lead role formulating a politically binding UN instrument on the marking and tracing of SALW that was finally adopted in June 2005. We continue to work towards making this instrument legally binding. The UK is fully compliant with strict EU marking and tracing standards.</p>

However, in 2004, the DTI in conjunction with Ofgem and National Grid established the Electricity Systems Technical Issues Steering Group to investigate the performance of the electricity networks given likely longer term changes in the UK generation portfolio and to ensure that any technical issues that might arise were recognised in good time. The group published an interim report, which can be found at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/renewables/publications_pdfs/estiginterimreportfinal.pdf">www.dti.gov.uk/renewables/publications_pdfs/estiginterimreportfinal.pdf</a> and is currently working with National Grid to undertake more detailed studies that should be completed late summer 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.867W.9/1">The International Narcotics Control Board consider that the global supply of medicinal opiates, including diamorphine (heroin) is at levels well in excess of use. There are, however, constraints to demand which are related to countries' own policy restrictions in the use of such drugs. At present diamorphine is subject to tight restrictions on supply and use due to widespread abuse and the capacity to induce dependency. It is not on the WHO Essential Drug list although alternative drugs such as morphine, which are as effective, are included in the list and meet the need for a drug for alleviation of severe pain, particularly in palliative care. This does not preclude counties from procuring and using the drug.</p>
	<p pid="c.867W.9/2">Countries look to the World Health Organization for guidance on the use of such drugs. A number of WHO expert groups will meet in coming months to address issues around improving palliative care, dealing with drug dependency and to revise the essential drug list. The outcome of their deliberations may influence the availability and use of diamorphine for medicinal purposes in developing countries.</p>

They must now begin to make progress through the initiative by the end of 2006 in order to continue to be eligible.</p>
	<p pid="c.868W.5/2">There are two requirements to be eligible for HIPC status:</p>
	<p pid="c.868W.5/3" class="indent">1.Countries must be eligible to receive assistance only from the most concessional lending arm of the World Bank and the International Development Association (IDA). IDA countries are defined as having a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $965 or less.</p>
	<p pid="c.868W.5/4" class="indent">2.A country's debt burden must be considered unsustainable in comparison to its revenue and exports.</p>
	<p pid="c.868W.5/5">Lesotho is an IDA only borrower, but does not meet the criteria defining unsustainable debt.</p>
	<p pid="c.868W.5/6">Lesotho could however qualify for the UK's multilateral debt relief initiative (MDRI) providing debt relief to both HIPC and low-income countries (LIC). Under this initiative, the UK pays its share (10 per cent.) of the debt service costs to the World Bank (IDA loans) and African Development Fund debt, of non-HIPC, low-income countries like Lesotho. To qualify for reliefunder this initiative, countries are required to demonstrate robust public financial management systems to ensure the savings are used for poverty reduction. We are using poverty reduction support credits (PRSC) as a proxy measure of this.</p>
	<p pid="c.868W.5/7">Lesotho is discussing the possibility of a PRSC with the World Bank. DFID is also providing support to Lesotho to improve its financial management systems in order to help it qualify for MDRI.</p>
	<p pid="c.868W.5/8">Lesotho will benefit indirectly from the G8 multilateral debt relief initiative (MDRI). The G8 MDRI will result in HIPCs receiving full debt cancellation of remaining debts to the World Bank (IDA loans), the African Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Donor support for this will be allocated by these institutions to all poor countries (including non-HIPCs), and therefore Lesotho.</p>

	<p pid="c.869W.5/1">We have monitored the distribution of DFID aid to those affected by the December 2004 tsunami. We did learn of some problems in India, where there was some reluctance by the authorities to allow aid to reach certain castes. This was overcome through representations made to the authorities. More recently, however, we have seen the January 2006 report of a five-country study by a group of international charities reporting internal discrimination. Although we manage and monitor DFID humanitarian aid very closely and have found no evidence of discrimination in the distribution of DFID aid in tsunami-affected countries, we take such reporting seriously and are prepared both to discuss this with the international charities and to intervene again, if necessary, with the national authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.869W.5/2">DFID has provided &pound;1.5 million to the North East Provincial Council Secretariat (NEPC) in partnership with the Governments of Germany and Sri Lanka to improve its capacity to deliver aid and to help ensure that Tamil areas received improved access to development assistance. DFID also channelled &pound;3 million through the United Nations Development Programme for the 'UN Recovery Framework for Post-Tsunami Rehabilitation and Reconstruction' which is helping to ensure that the needs of socially-excluded groups are met during recovery.</p>
	<p pid="c.869W.5/3">A group of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), jointly funded by DFID and International NGOs, initiated a Social Equity Audit process in response to claims that some Dalits in India and other groups were being excluded from some post tsunami humanitarian efforts. A group of independent auditors have been trained by experts identified by the International NGOs. The International NGOs will submit their programmes to these auditors to assess how inclusive their post tsunami activities have been in order to improve their programmes and identify ways to make their humanitarian efforts more inclusive in the future. TheUnited Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Children's Fund have signed up to the initiative and a Social Equity auditing manual is likely to be produced which DFID will disseminate to NGOs and agencies.</p>

The aim of the Defence Review is to make the Uganda People's Defence Force more professional and accountable within the resources available for defence expenditure.

	<p pid="c.876W.6/16" class="indent">I write with in response to your recent Parliamentary Question, regarding Adult Learning.</p>
	<p pid="c.876W.6/17" class="indent">First-step learning is designed to introduce, or re-introduce adults back into learning and to provide them with the necessary foundation to progress, where appropriate, to a first full level 2. As such first-step learning may be regarded as all learning activity (including skills for life) at pre-entry and national qualification framework (or equivalent) entry level and level 1.</p>
	<p pid="c.876W.6/18" class="indent">However, individuals engage in learning at these levels for a variety of reasons, not just for reasons of first-step activity. The following table therefore identifies only the percentage of LSC adult programme spend on learning below level 2 (in the academic years 2003/04 and 2004/05) since the LSC does not collect data on learning intention.</p>

	<p pid="c.876W.6/28" class="indent">I understand that Liz Davis, Executive Director of the LSC in Cheshire and Warrington, has extended a number of invitations over the past year or so to meet with her. While I understand that you are extremely busy may I strongly recommend that you meet with Liz at your earliest convenience to discuss these issues and some of the specific initiatives that are taking place within your constituency?</p>
	<p pid="c.876W.6/29" class="indent">I understand from Liz that the LSC and Warrington Borough Council are working together to develop a strategic vision for adult provision across Warrington and to ensure joint planning for the future.</p>

To assist them, in 2001 the Department published guidance entitled 'Commercial activities in schools: Best Practice Principles'. This was aimed at parents, teachers, school governing bodies, LEAs and businesses. Its principal aim was not only to safeguard children from commercial marketing, but to identify best practice and to ensure that commercial objectives were consistent with genuine educational benefits. We plan to review the guidance, with partner organisations, later this year.</p>

	<p pid="c.881W.0/1">Information is not collected centrally on: how many children's centres have in place an accessibility plan; how many children as defined by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, aged under five years attending children's centres have a statement of special educational needs and are on early years action plans; or how many people employed in children's centres meet the Special Educational Needs Standard set by the Training and Development Agency for Schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.881W.0/2">Guidance for early years providers setting out their duties under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 is already available and DfES is working with the Council for Disabled Children to produce additional resources for children's centres that will include information about the 2005 duty to promote disability equality. The resources will be available later this year. The DfES Code of Practice on the Provision of Nursery Education Places for Three- and Four-Year Olds&quot;, published in February, drew attention to the Disability Rights Commission's Codes of Practice, one of which gives guidance on the new duty.</p>
	<p pid="c.881W.0/3">Children's centres do not have a duty to have an access plan, but Sure Start has published good practice and training materials on the internet for the early years sector on providing inclusive and accessible services.</p>
	<p pid="c.881W.0/4">We expect children's centres to offer inclusive services for all young children and their families. Disabled children, alongside all other children under 5 will be able to access the range of services provided through their local centre according to their needs. We issued guidance in November 2005 (Sure Start Children's Centres: Practice Guidance) which describes effective ways of working with disabled children and their families and emphasises the importance of outreach services including Portage.</p>

	<p pid="c.886W.2/1">To encourage employers to participate in training, we have established an employer-led training infrastructure that puts their needs centre stage. This is reflected in the design and delivery arrangements of, for example, the new national employer training programme Train To Gain. In Further Education we will be looking at the recommendations of the Foster Report on FE Colleges' responsiveness to local and regional employer needs and will be announcing our plans for the next stage of reform in the spring. Responsibility for the planning and funding of post-16 learning outside Higher Education, however, is the responsibility of the Learning and Skills Council and Mark Haysom, the council's chief executive has written to my hon. Friend with further detailed information and a copy of his letter has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.886W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.886W.2/3" class="indent">I am writing in response to your recent Parliamentary Question about employers involved in post 16 education in Wakefield and Normanton.</p>
	<p pid="c.886W.2/4" class="indent">Before going into detail may I say a word about the LSC's policy in relation to meeting the learning and skills needs of employers, and how we work on this in partnership with others.</p>
	<p pid="c.886W.2/5" class="indent">At the end of 2005 we published the LSC's Statement of Priorities for 2006/07, a copy of which I enclose. As you will see one of our six priorities is to make learning truly demand-led so that it better meets the needs of employers, young people and adults. This lies at the very heart of your question.</p>
	<p pid="c.886W.2/6" class="indent">As you will see from pages 12 and 13 of the booklet we have a number of initiatives designed to support employers and learners, and I would like to highlight two in particular.</p>
	<p pid="c.886W.2/7" class="indent">First, we are building on the success of the Employer Training Pilots (ETP) and from April 2006 we shall roll-out Train to Gain nationally to deliver a range of high quality training for employers with an emphasis on level 2 qualifications and skills for life. A key element of Train to Gain will be a network of skills brokers giving advice to companies on their training needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.886W.2/8" class="indent">As you will know West Yorkshire is a pilot area for ETP and of the total number of employers engaged in ETP in West Yorkshire, 12.2% (180) are in Wakefield. This is slightly lower than its proportionate share of employers in West Yorkshire, but provides a good platform for a successful launch of Train to Gain. Unfortunately we do not have figures for Normanton.</p>
	<p pid="c.886W.2/9" class="indent">The second initiative is agenda for change which will radically transform the post 16 learning and skills sector, especially in colleges which are key partners in meeting employer needs. Agenda for change is based on extensive consultation with college principals and involves a genuine partnership between the LSC and the further education sector. Again, full details are given in the booklet.</p>
	<p pid="c.886W.2/10" class="indent">Turning to the information you have requested, I'm afraid we do not hold it in a way that enables me to answer your question precisely, but I hope the information on the chart I have enclosed is helpful.</p>
	<p pid="c.886W.2/11" class="indent">Finally, I know that Margaret Coleman, the LSC Regional Director for Yorkshire and the Humber would be very happy to discuss this in more detail, either in your constituency or at the House, for a meeting to be arranged please contact her office directly either via e-mail margaret.coleman@lsc.gov.uk or via telephone 01274 44 4100.</p>

	<p pid="c.887W.2/2">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) agrees plans with most further education (FE) colleges which they guarantee to fund. The guarantee that college plans will be fully funded has been widely welcomed by the sector as ensuring stability and providing confidence for colleges to make commitments for the year based on assured levels of funding. The guarantee means that colleges recruiting above agreed plans cannot expect to receive additional funding above the level agreed with the LSC. However, there is an expectation that where colleges have delivered higher volumes in priority areas then this should be reflected in their planning for the following year.</p>
	<p pid="c.887W.2/3">It is only possible to determine the amount of learning delivered above agreed planned levels following detailed analysis of the actual level of delivery in the academic year compared to the agreed planned levels. It is not possible to complete this analysis for 2005/06 until we have full academic year data on delivery, which will not be available until later this year. For 2004/05 the LSC estimate that colleges delivered 9,624 16 to19 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) learner numbers above the planned levels agreed with the LSC. Mark Haysom, the LSC's Chief Executive, has written to the hon. Member and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.888W.5/1">Admissions legislation already gives parents the right of appeal to an independent appeal panel, against an admission authority's decision refusing their child admission to a school. The appeal process already allows parents the opportunity to appear in person and make oral representations themselves, or be accompanied, or represented, by a friend. Legal representation will not usually be necessary, but parents are free to have such representation if they wish.</p>

	<p pid="c.890W.3/2">It will not be open to any organisation to set up a school trust. It will be for the governing bodies of individual schools to decide whether to form partnerships with trusts, following consultation with parents and other stakeholders. All such trusts will be charities and the consultation will need to set out who the members of the charity will be. In deciding whether to acquire a particular trust, governing bodies will need to take account of the impact of the trust on driving up standards and promoting the well-being of pupils and the wider community. The school would be inspected against the contribution it makes to the five outcomes, including being healthy&quot;. As part of this, inspectors would assess the school's success in promoting healthy eating. Where there are concerns about the nature of a proposed trust, the local authority will be able to refer the case to the schools adjudicator for determination.</p>

	<p pid="c.898W.0/1">There are two student loans schemes. Mortgage-style loans were introduced in 1990. Income-contingent loans were introduced for new students from 1998, while continuing students remained eligible for mortgage-style loans.</p>
	<p pid="c.898W.0/2">The first cohort of students on three year courses with income-contingent loans entered repayment status in April 2002. However, borrowers only make repayments when they are earning over &pound;15,000 and those earning less are not required to make any repayments.

	<p pid="c.902W.11/2">HMS Torbay is due to commence a routine pre-planned Revalidation and Assisted Maintenance Period (RAMP) in early 2007. Although such work is normally undertaken at a submarine's home port, which in Torbay's case is Devonport, the decision to move her RAMP to Faslane was made because of the heavy programme of work at Devonport and a relatively light loading at Faslane during the same time period. This is consistent with the Department's drive to improve submarine availability, reduce costs and improve co-operation between key suppliers.</p>
	<p pid="c.902W.11/3">Nuclear submarine refit and refuelling work will continue to be carried out at Devonport Dockyard, which has the only facilities in the UK capable of undertaking such work.</p>

The latest figures available at police force area level are for 2004&ndash;05. The design of the BCS means that data for individual months is not available. The measure of antisocial behaviour used is based on a scale constructed from seven questions on problems due to noisy neighbours or loud parties, teenagers and young people hanging around, rubbish and litter, vandalism, people using or dealing drugs, people being drunk or rowdy and abandoned cars. In the 2004&ndash;05 BCS 14 per cent. of people in South Wales perceived there to be high levels of antisocial behaviour in their local area, compared with 17 per cent. of people nationally. Between 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 there was no change in the proportion of people perceiving high levels of antisocial behaviour in South Wales.</p>

	<p pid="c.906W.2/52">The performance of the Metropolitan Police Service (MRS), West Midlands, Hampshire, Merseyside and Gwent has impacted on the CRB's overall service standard for Enhanced Disclosures. Although the performance of Greater Manchester Police (GMP), South Wales, Staffordshire and Cambridgeshire has been below the SLA target the impact of their failure has been lessened by faster handover of cases to forces by the CRB during this period.</p>
	<p pid="c.906W.2/53">From April 2006 a revised service level agreement (SLA) will come into effect between the CRB and the 43 police forces of England and Wales. This new agreement, which has been agreed by the association of Chief of Police Officers (ACPO) will place additional focus on delivery and the responsibility of Chief Officers and ACPO to ensure that the obligations within the SLA are met.</p>

	<p pid="c.909W.8/1">All published material, including violent pornography, is subject to the Obscene Publications Act 1959, which makes illegal the publication of an article whose effect, taken as a whole, is to tend to deprave and corrupt those likely to read, see or hear it. The responsibility for the prevention of the physical importation of obscene material lies with HM Revenue and Customs under section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act 1876 and section 170(2) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979.</p>
	<p pid="c.909W.8/2">The Obscene Publications Act applies equally to material published over the internet, though the overwhelming majority of potentially obscene material published on the internet originates abroad and beyond our jurisdiction. This raises a challenge to our controls on obscene material. The Government therefore recently undertook a consultation on proposals to make illegal the possession of a limited category of extreme pornographic material. The responses to this consultation are currently being considered.</p>

	<p pid="c.913W.0/1">The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation and production in Afghanistan. UNODC figures for 2005 show that the level of opium cultivation decreased over 2001 figures in Kabul, Logar and Paktya provinces. However, comparing current levels of cultivation with 2001 figures does not represent an accurate picture of total progress to date. This is because the base year coincided with the Taliban's prohibition on opium cultivation. While the ban was effective in reducing the area of land under poppy cultivation in 2001, the Taliban did nothing to provide alternatives to poppy farmers who consequently suffered considerable hardship. Furthermore, the ban did not apply to trafficking or processing activities and the Taliban regime manipulated the drug trade to benefit from the rise in prices, which resulted from the reduction in cultivation.</p>
	<p pid="c.913W.0/2">Since the fall of the Taliban, the Government of Afghanistan has, with the support of the international community, made considerable progress in fighting narcotics. Last year UNODC reported a 21 per cent. reduction in poppy cultivation from 131,000 hectares (ha) in 2003&ndash;04 to 104,000 ha in 2004&ndash;05, with decreases recorded in a total of 19 provinces. More recently, the Government of Afghanistan has updated its National Drug Control Strategy to ensure the downward trend is sustained over time and that progress is also made in targeting the trafficker, developing legal rural livelihoods, reducing domestic demand and developing strong and effective institutions. Sustainable drug elimination strategies take time, but I believe that the National Drug Control Strategy represents the best means of making a sustainable impact on the trade in the medium term.</p>

	<p pid="c.913W.6/1">Although much progress has been made since the fall of the Taliban, the human rights situation in Afghanistan remains challenging. The Afghan Constitution provides for the protection of human rights and Article 2 provides for freedom of religion. The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission monitors respect for human rights and protects them. Afghanistan has acceded to the six main International Human Rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which guarantees freedom of religion. We take cases of religious persecution seriously and make known our concerns to the Government of Afghanistan (GoA), both bilaterally and through the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.913W.6/2">In 2005, the GoA adopted the National Action Plan on Peace, Reconciliation and Justice, which sets out a three-year comprehensive strategy on transitional justice and endorsed a strategic framework for justice sector reform entitled Justice for All&quot;. The latter framework is divided into five areas of activity: law reform, institution-building, access to justice programs, traditional justice and co-ordination.</p>

	<p pid="c.916W.2/1">Encouraging respect for human rights and political freedoms is a key element of our approach towards Iran. We do not take sides in Iran's internal political debates&mdash;these are for Iranians themselves to resolve&mdash;but seek to promote the internationally recognised principles to which many Iranians aspire including freedom of speech and transparent, genuinely democratic and accountable government.</p>
	<p pid="c.916W.2/2">In line with long-standing EU policy, we are committed to supporting political reform. We continue to support the development of governmental and non-governmental organisations where opportunities arise. We do not publicise the details without the consent of our Iranian partners. The EU has allocated around &pound;4.4 million to projects in Iran under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights. Three projects, to which the EU has allocated a total of &pound;2.9 million, are implemented by United Nations agencies. A further lm project was launched in January 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.916W.2/3">Remedying the deficiencies in the democratic process will be a long-term process. In our private dialogue and public statements we continue to press the Iranian authorities on the need for reform. As I made clear in my speech to the International Institute of Strategic Studies on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-13">13 March</phrase>, this is an area where I believe the UK and EU should become more active.</p>

	<p pid="c.917W.3/2">There are no official figures on the level of British investment in Libya, neither are there figures for invisible exports to the country. However, over 50 UK-based companies have established branch offices in Libya in order to pursue their trade and investment interests. Visible exports from Britain were worth over &pound;210 million in 2005, a slight fall on the figure of &pound;216 million recorded in 2004. British trade and investment is focused primarily on Libya's rapidly developing oil and gas sector, in which Shell has a major stake. In May 2005, Shell reached agreement on a major gas exploration and development deal with Libya's National Oil Company, which will involve a minimum investment of around US $300 million, by far the biggest investment in Libya by a British company.</p>

We have been regularly encouraging the Government of the Maldives to quickly put in place a clear, time-bound framework with objectives and milestones for further progress. We hope the road-map that President Gayoom referred to at the official opening of the Maldivian Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-23">23 February</phrase> will provide this.

Agreement on and implementation of further major democratic and constitutional changes will require an inclusive process reflecting the views of political parties, civil society and the general public in the Maldives.

We continue to urge the Government to do all in their power to remove potential obstacles to dialogue, including addressing the issue of legal actions which are seen to be politically motivated. Officials did so when they met the Maldivian Foreign Minister Dr.Ahmed Shaheed in London on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-21">21 March</phrase>.

	<p pid="c.924W.5/1">The terms picocell, microcell and macrocell are industry terms to distinguish different types of radio base stations. However, there is no industry standard or agreement on the specific types of base station to which each term applies and therefore these terms are not helpful for determining whether planning permission is required or not.</p>
	<p pid="c.924W.5/2">In general terms a picocell is typically smaller than a microcell, although the distinction is not always clear. Picocell base stations are usually used to extend coverage to indoor areas where outdoor signals do not reach well, or to add network capacity in areas with very dense phone usage, such as train stations. The planning system cannot extend to changes inside a building unless there are internal features which have been listed. Other picocells antenna and small microcell antenna might be considered de minimis&quot;, i.e. it does not have a material effect on the external appearance of the building or structure on which it is installed and therefore will not require planning permission.</p>
	<p pid="c.924W.5/3">Otherwise all electronic communications development will require planning permission unless it is development permitted by Part 24 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995&quot;, as amended. Whether planning permission is required to upgrade an existing mobile phone mast to a 3G mobile phone mast will need to be determined on a case by case basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.924W.5/4">It should be noted that simply because small developments may not need planning permission it does not mean that there is no public consultation. The code of best practice that was produced jointly by central and local government and the mobile phone industry is clear that every potential site is rated using the Traffic Light Model. This model determines the level of public consultation that will be required if the site is selected for the installation.</p>

	<p pid="c.929W.2/1">The precise data that the hon. Member has requested is not available. The Valuation and Lands Agency does, however, focus on the critical time period for ratepayers: the gap between the date of occupation and the date of valuation assessment and billing. The Agency, recognising the ratepayer's desire to avoid substantial demands for backdated rates, has for many years targeted its performance on this time period, striving to improve the overall outcome.</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.2/2">The current target is to issue at least 90 per cent. of all those rating revision cases (excluding domestic alterations), which are subject to retrospective backdating, within 12 months of the revision date. The out-turn for this key target over the last five years is as follows.</p>

	<p pid="c.929W.2/15"><sup>(41)</sup>This was the year following the publication of the 2003 non-domestic revaluation when backdating was limited by statute to <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.2/16">Conscious of the importance of achieving early and accurate valuation and billing for all stakeholders&mdash;ratepayers, local authorities and Government&mdash;the Agency has sought not merely to improve on these figures but to achieve a step change&quot; in performance. To this end the Agency, in April 2005, entered into a joint project with Belfast city council (building control) for the timely provision by the council of full survey details on all changes to properties (including new builds).</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.2/17">In Belfast this project has significantly reduced the average time involvement by the Agency and increased productivity almost threefold. No comparable backdating&quot; figures are yet available, but a substantial improvement is anticipated.</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.2/18">We are currently in the process of extending the project to include Derry and Lisburn city councils later in 2006 and eventually, by agreement, to all councils.</p>

	<p pid="c.929W.5/1">The chief executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-28">28 March 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.929W.5/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding what assessment has been made of the effect of changes in the roads maintenance budget on the construction and aggregates industry.</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.5/4" class="indent">I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.5/5" class="indent">In doing so I should perhaps explain that in the last 3 years a total of some &pound;735m has been spent on developing and maintaining the road network in Northern Ireland. Some &pound;495m has been invested in revenue activities, including maintenance, with a further &pound;240m on capital. Over the next 10 years the Investment Strategy for Northern Ireland envisages that some &pound;1.9 billion will be invested in road improvements subject to the availability of resources in future budget rounds, economic appraisals and statutory approvals.</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.5/6" class="indent">Expenditure this year, coupled with the Revised Budget allocations, suggests that about &pound;170m will be invested in roads' structural maintenance in the three years to 2007/08. When assessing budget figures, a single year's allocation is of course important, but it is also important to see these figures over a cycle.</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.5/7" class="indent">You may be aware that the Minister for Regional Development, Shaun Woodward MP recently met with your colleague Margaret Ritchie MLA and members of the local Quarry Products Association (QPA) to discuss the outcome of the Budget and Priorities 2006&ndash;2008 and the impact on the structural maintenance budget. In addition senior officials from Roads Service have also held a number of meetings with the QPA.</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.5/8" class="indent">I fully appreciate the concerns of the road building industry about the funding for structural maintenance and can assure you that Roads Service will be making a strong case for an increase in the structural maintenance budget to the Department of Finance and Personnel as part of the input to the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.5/9" class="indent">In the interim, we will continue to make the best use of our resources to develop and maintain the road network.</p>
	<p pid="c.929W.5/10" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="c.934W.2/1">We have undertaken a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent.</p>
	<p pid="c.934W.2/2">Since 2001, the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Islington South and Finsbury will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly, families with severely disabled three and four-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government's decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, while older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.934W.2/3">In 2004&ndash;05 we estimate there were over 10 million disabled people (around 9.7 million adults and 0.7 million children) in Great Britain. All of these people would meet the definition of disability in the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA).</p>
	<p pid="c.934W.2/4">The figures can be broken down to regional level which show that 15 per cent. of adults and 5 per cent. of children in London are disabled.</p>
	<p pid="c.934W.2/5">Information on the numbers of customers in Islington South and Finsbury who are in receipt of disability living allowance (DLA) and attendance allowance (AA) is in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="c.934W.2/24">Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. Since 1997 the number of people claiming as unemployed in Islington South and Finsbury has fallen by 47 per cent. and the number of long-term unemployed by 81 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.934W.2/25">Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Nationally over 1.5 million people have been helped into work by the new deals, with over 3,000 in Islington South and Finsbury alone.</p>
	<p pid="c.934W.2/26">Significant progress has been made in tackling child poverty. Since 1998&ndash;99 the number of children in relative low-income households fell by 700,000 from 3.1 million to 2.4 million on a Before Housing Costs (BHC) basis and 700,000 from 4.1 million to 3.4 million on an After Housing Costs (AHC) basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.934W.2/27">Since 2001&ndash;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. Child rates in income support and jobseeker's allowance have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&ndash;02, increasing above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 4,100 families in Islington South and Finsbury.</p>
	<p pid="c.934W.2/28">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country and our first priority has been to help the least well off pensioners. The Government will be spending over &pound;10 billion extra in 2006&ndash;07 on pensioners as a result of measures introduced since 1997. Almost half of this spending going to the least well off third of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="c.934W.2/29">Our reforms include the state second pension, which helps more future pensioners build up better pensions, especially carers. Pension credit, introduced from October 2003, provides a contribution to a guaranteed minimum income for those aged 60 and over and, for the first time, rewards people aged 65 and over who have made modest provision for their retirement. As of August 2005, around 4,500 pensioners in Islington South and Finsbury are receiving pension credit, with an average award of &pound;62.27 per week.</p>
	<p pid="c.934W.2/30">We know that older people, who are often on fixed incomes, value timely help with fuel costs. This winter (2005&ndash;06) we have again made available a winter fuel payment of &pound;200 for each eligible household with someone aged 60 or over and &pound;300 if the household includes someone aged 80 or over to help with their fuel bills. In 2004&ndash;05, around 11,200 people in Islington South and Finsbury received a winter fuel payment. We expect the numbers to be similar for winter 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid="c.934W.2/31">Additionally, for 2005&ndash;06, eligible households with someone aged 65 or over, not receiving the guarantee credit element of pension credit received a one-off payment of &pound;200 to help with their council tax bills. Pensioner households with someone aged 70 and over in receipt of the guarantee credit received a one-off payment of &pound;50 to help with living expenses.</p>
	<p pid="c.934W.2/32">Since 1997 pensioners have seen a real terms increase in their basic state pension of 7 per cent. As at August 2005, around 9,800 pensioners in Islington South and Finsbury have benefited from this increase.</p>

	<p pid="c.937W.2/105">A review, available on the internet, into the differences in income values between the two surveys concluded that the differences in monetary value estimates across surveys were too large to justify publishing direct comparisons. Furthermore, large fluctuations in the difference between surveys for overlapping years mean that, in many cases, an adjusted, or a spliced time series may be no more accurate than the unadjusted series.</p>

	<p pid="c.939W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what Internet sites operated by Jobcentre Plus are available to jobseekers and how their existence is publicised. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.939W.2/4" class="indent">The Jobcentre Plus website (<a href="http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk">www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk</a>) is our Internet service for jobseekers. The site allows users to search our extensive database of some 400,000 vacancies. In addition, the site provides job hunting advice and information on programmes such as New Deal to help people back into work. The site currently receives around 1.5 million visitors each week.</p>
	<p pid="c.939W.2/5" class="indent">The website is publicised to customers in a variety of ways. Every piece of correspondence to customers on pre-printed letter headed paper shows the Jobcentre Plus website address and many of our computer generated letters&mdash;which are usually about specific benefit issues&mdash;also give the web address. All of our centrally produced customer information leaflets feature the website address predominantly across the centre of the back cover, and often they also show the website address in the main text. These leaflets are available in all Jobcentre Plus offices and in a variety of our partners' premises, such as Citizens' Advice Bureaux and GPs' surgeries.</p>
	<p pid="c.939W.2/6" class="indent">As far as specific promotional campaigns are concerned, in January 2004 Jobcentre Plus ran a series of national television advertisements aimed at people looking for work. These were primarily to promote our telephone job finding service, Jobseeker Direct, but also publicised our website as an alternative method for accessing our job search facilities. During 2004 we also distributed a leaflet to over 6.7 million residential households to promote Jobcentre Plus services, including our website.</p>

	<p pid="c.940W.2/2">Many of those who did not enter employment will have undertaken education and training, or participated in other new deal options like the Environmental Task Force or voluntary sector options, all of which will have improved their job readiness and employability.

	<p pid="c.945W.2/1">We estimate that the gross average annual cost of restoring pensions in full to all those covered by the Parliamentary Ombudsman's report would be &pound;250 million in cash terms over some 60 years. Annual costs would vary over time peaking at &pound;400 million around the year 2030.</p>
	<p pid="c.945W.2/2">I will provide estimates shortly of the net annual costs, taking account of any estimated reduction as a consequence of taxation and reduced payments of means-tested benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.945W.2/3">We estimate that extending the financial assistance scheme to cover all members of final salary pension schemes which started winding-up without sufficient funds to cover all its pension liabilities between April 1997 and April 2005, if the FAS benefit levels were retained, would cost on average &pound;125 million per annum in cash terms over the first 40 years. It is likely that further costs would occur after that period.</p>
	<p pid="c.945W.2/4">The costs of the Ombudsman's proposals have been estimated using data collected for the financial assistance scheme (FAS). The data was obtained from schemes potentially eligible for FAS, the pensions regulator and the pensions industry. The data has been fed into an actuarial model to generate time profiles of costs. Mortality estimates were taken from the continuous mortality investigation.</p>

	<p pid="c.952W.8/1">The Department has not carried out a general review of the possible link between cancer and organochlorines in infants and young adults. The committee on carcinogenicity of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment reviewed thecarcinogenicity of dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls in 2001. It concluded that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin should be regarded as a probable human carcinogen but commented that any increased risk of cancer at background levels of exposure is likely to be extremely small and not detectable by current epidemiological methods. The committee also recently reviewed the overall evidence for chemical causes of childhood cancer, particularly for those cancers that are increasing in incidence. It concluded that there is little evidence for chemical causation of these cancers. The committee's reviews is available on its website at <a href="http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/coc/index.htm">www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/coc/index.htm</a> or in its annual reports.</p>

	<p pid="c.952W.14/1">Mental health services are not currently included in patient choice at referral under the choose and book service. The national choice consultation in autumn 2003 highlighted the choices which mental health service users feel would most enhance their user experience, these focused on choice of treatment rather than choice of service provider. These findings informed the detailed work carried out to formulate the Government's choice at referral policy and led to the decision to exclude mental health services from choice at referral In the light of the national choice consultation's findings, the Department commissioned the choice in mental health programme, which is being run by the National Institute of Mental Health in England. This programme aims to extend the scope, range and equity of treatment choices available across service user pathways.</p>

They regulate the conduct of clinical trials in the UK and implement the provisions of the EU directive on clinical trials (directive 2001/20/EC). Clinical trials are a fundamental part of the development process for new drugs or for establishing new uses for existing drugs. The overall aim of the clinical trials regulatory system is to ensure that the rights, safety and well-being of those participating in clinical trials are protected. Those conducting clinical trials are responsible for designing, conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials according to internationally recognised principles of good clinical practice. The information collected from the clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of the drug supports the application for a marketing authorisation for the drug. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is responsible for authorising all clinical trials that take place in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.957W.2/4">From April 2005, the 164 National Hearing Service audiology departments have been able to routinely assess for and fit digital hearing aids. It is for primary care trusts to ensure their local population benefits from the modernised services.</p>

	<p pid="c.964W.2/2">The Department does not collect or hold any information internally as regards to how many pharmaceutical employees have contacted them or other Government departments to report concerns about misconduct within the pharmaceutical sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.964W.2/3">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) does not hold a central record of approaches made since the implementation of the Act as there is no legal requirement to do so. However, the MHRA has received disclosures, some justified as well as some bogus allegations. Some have led to administrative/criminal investigations. Others have led to no further action being taken. The MHRA has no obligation to remind or advise professional associations or other employers in the sector of their obligations under the Act and therefore has had no discussions with General Medical Council or any other professional associations about their obligations under the Act.</p>

	<p pid="c.967W.3/2">The calculation is based on the information, supplied by stakeholders, that the cost of independently investigating a complaint of a complex nature such as a clinical negligence case is on average approximately &pound;2,500. At present, the number of claims settled for under &pound;20,000 represents approximately 75 per cent. of settled claims. We expect a similar proportion to be covered by the new scheme. Exact numbers are hard to predict. However, as the scheme aims to make seeking redress more straightforward we expect more people to come forward. Modelling work within the Department, based on patient survey data, suggests that improved access to justice under the scheme may cause claims to rise by anything from 2,200 to 19,500 a year. In total, therefore, we expect the number of cases falling within the scheme to range between 5,800 and 16,600 in year one. If each case was subject to independent investigation, this would result in a total cost of between &pound;14.5 to &pound;41 million in year one.</p>

	<p pid="c.969W.2/1">Sexual health was identified as a key priority in the public health White Paper, Choosing Health&quot;, backed by major new investment of &pound;300 million over three years and improved performance management to ensure delivery at local level. In particular, we are monitoring the progress towards targets to reduce the level of new infections of gonorrhoea, as a marker for all sexually transmitted infections, to ensure patients have access to genito-urinary medicine clinics within 48 hours by 2008 and numbers of screens undertaken in the chlamydia screening programme. These improved performance measures, should significantly strengthen the incentive for local investment and service modernisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.969W.2/2">In addition, the Operating Framework for 2006/7 for the NHS in England&quot; was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-26">26 January</phrase>. This sets out six specific service priorities for 2006&ndash;07 on which there will be a particular focus and are identified as a priority for action. One of the six is sexual health and access to genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics: to deliver the 2006&ndash;07 local delivery plan trajectories so that by 2008 everyone referred to a GUM clinic should have an appointment within 48 hours. This sends a clear message about the need to invest in GUM access and sexual health more broadly, and will support service re-engineering and modernisation.</p>

	<p pid="c.971W.0/1">In 1994, the committee on medical aspects of food policy (COMA) reviewed the evidence on the adverse effects of trans unsaturated fatty acids (TFA) on coronary heart disease risk and recommended that average intakes should not exceed 2 per cent. total energy. In 1986&ndash;87 average intakes were 2 per cent. total energy and by 2000&ndash;01 this had reduced to an average intake of 1.1 per cent. total energy. Intakes of saturated fat, however, at 13.4 per cent. are higher than the COMA recommendation of 11 per cent. The Government's priority therefore is to reduce saturated fat intake, and action to encourage reductions is under way. Opportunities to reduce TFA intakes are being considered in this wider context.</p>
	<p pid="c.971W.0/2">No assessment has been made of the feasibility, costs or health benefits related to placing a legal maximum on the occurrence of TFA in foods, and there are currently no plans to make such assessments. Some manufacturers and retailers have taken steps to eliminate, or reduce, hydrogenated vegetable oils, which contain TFA, in their products. Government have no data on the associated costs of these activities.</p>

For these reasons there is a small discontinuity between ASHE and NES estimates provided.</p>

	<p pid="c.975W.2/1">All central Government unitary charge payments made under the private finance initiative are included in Departmental Expenditure Limits. Further, revenue support grants to local authorities, which fund a proportion of local government unitary charge payments, are also in Departmental Expenditure Limits. The devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland receive block budgets. Changes in these budgets and revisions to Departmental Expenditure Limits feed through to devolved Administrations through the Barnett Formula. The devolved Administrations allocate their block budgets to services in accordance with local needs and priorities and it is a matter for the devolved Administrations to decide whether to purchase services through direct spending or via PFI schemes. Therefore all unitary charge payments from PFI projects signed by the devolved Administrations are paid for from the budgets of those administrations, as would be the case for an English Department.</p>
