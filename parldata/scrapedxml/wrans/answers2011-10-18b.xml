It is based on the indicative settlement payments published by the Department in February 2011 and assumes that the whole amount would be borrowed from the Public Works Loan Board. Settlement payments are calculated on a whole authority basis, so it is not possible to attribute savings to particular areas within a local authority. These savings would accrue every year of a long-term loan, in nominal cash terms.</p>

	<p pid="b.804W.2/2">The Prime Minister pledged to make this the greenest Government ever and announced earlier this year that carbon emissions from Government HQs and offices have been cut by nearly 14% in just one year. Following this, he committed the Government to go further by reducing emissions by 25% by 2015. We are also supporting greater energy efficiency across the economy by introducing the Green Deal, revolutionising the way heat is generated and used through the Renewable Heat Incentive, and rolling-out smart meters and a smart grid will build on this progress. Moreover, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-12">12 July 2011</phrase> the Government published 'Planning our electric future: a White Paper for secure, affordable and low-carbon electricity'. The White Paper sets out key reforms to the electricity market to attract investment, reduce the impact on consumer bills, and create a secure mix of low-carbon electricity sources including renewables, new nuclear and carbon capture and storage.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/3">Emissions projections, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-13">13 October 2011</phrase>, show that the UK is on track, on central forecasts, to meet our first three carbon budgets and our 2020 target to reduce emissions by at least 34% against the 1990 baseline. Emissions have already been reduced by over 26%, taking into account the effects of emissions trading.</p>
	<p pid="b.804W.2/4">We have also set in legislation the level of the fourth carbon budget for the period 2023-27 which equates to more than a 50% reduction in emissions. This autumn Government will be publishing a comprehensive strategy which will set out how the fourth carbon budget might be met, pathways to our 2050 target as well as a set of milestones which will set out shorter-term actions the Government commits to undertake to keep us on track to delivering our ambitious climate change goals.</p>

However, initial estimates based on data collected by British Transport Police, local police forces and centrally collected police recorded crime data indicate that there may have been between 80,000 and 100,000 metal theft offences in England and Wales in 2010-11.

	<p pid="b.818W.12/4">From the 2011-12 academic year, where English language skills have been identified as a barrier to entering employment, full Government funding is provided for English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) qualifications delivered to unemployed people in receipt of Jobseekers' Allowance or in the Employment and Support Allowance (Work-Related Activity) Group. Further education colleges and training organisations also have local discretion to provide fully subsidised courses for people on a wider range of benefits where the training is to help them enter employment. Learners are expected to share the costs of publicly funded ESOL courses with Government where full fee remission is not applicable. The Government will no longer fund ESOL courses delivered in the workplace.

Holding reviews more frequently will reduce inequalities arising as a result of population movement, and will help ensure votes have more equal weight than at present.</p>

Every eligible elector will be asked in 2014 to register under the new system: this will include personal invites to people on the register, enquiries to households where no one is registered or people have moved, reminder letters and face to face doorstep canvassers. There will also be a publicity campaign run by the Electoral Commission and we are testing data matching to identify people missing from the register and looking at how we can increase the choices people have over how to register&#8212;including greater use of online registration.</p>

	<p pid="b.826W.9/2">One of the potential areas identified for the NHS to achieve this is for patients with long term conditions. A national workstream has been set up to support them to achieve this, and is centred on a generic model of care based on key principles of risk-profiling, neighbourhood care teams and self care/shared decision making. Teams based within local health economies participating in this workstream are applying these principles in line with local need.</p>
	<p pid="b.826W.9/3">By embedding these key principles in local health economies across the country this workstream aims to support the NHS to significantly reduce the number of unscheduled admissions and length of stay for people with LTCs.

	<p pid="b.831W.2/3">The CMO wrote to the NHS again on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-25">25 May</phrase> outlining arrangements for the 2011 flu vaccination season, specifying the risk groups and the staff groups that should be vaccinated.</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.2/4">Copies of both letters have already been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.2/5">Most PCTs run localised activity with their general practitioners (GPs) to ensure that eligible patients are called up for their annual vaccination. The Department supports local activity through information provision and targeted messaging. The Department has produced an information leaflet in PDF format for the public, NHS organisations and GP practices to download for local patient information and will run reminder messages on pharmacy bags to encourage people in at-risk groups to be vaccinated against seasonal flu.</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.2/6">Messages will appear on pharmacy bags across 2,225 pharmacies in England and run for four weeks from <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-24">24 October</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-20">20 November</phrase>. Pharmacy bags will support local campaigns as they target people in at-risk groups in a relevant setting, i.e. when they are collecting their prescription from their pharmacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.831W.2/7">Additionally, the Department is working with relevant partner organisations, such as charities working for people with long-term conditions, to communicate seasonal flu messages via their channels.</p>

Under legislation, all providers including national health service foundation trusts (NHSFTs), NHS trusts and independent sector providers, must register with the CQC and meet a set of essential requirements of safety and quality.

Regulation identifies actual and potential financial and governance issues.

	<p pid="b.838W.2/2">There are a number of systems available, including the preferred priorities for care (PPC), which enable patients to record their preferences for care at the end of life and the choices they would like to make, including saying where, if possible, they would want to be when they die.</p>
	<p pid="b.838W.2/3">The Department has recently completed a series of pilots for electronic palliative care coordination systems (locality registers), which have the potential to improve communication, coordination, planning and delivery of end of life care, ensuring that a person's wishes and expressed preferences for care are taken into account. The national health service is beginning to adopt these systems. The core dataset tested by the pilots included information about advance decisions.</p>

In order to improve data quality, continual refinements have been made to the programme budgeting data calculation methodology since the first collection in 2003-04. The underlying data which support programme budgeting data are also subject to yearly changes. Caution is therefore advised when using programme budgeting data to draw conclusions on changes in spending patterns between years. 4. From 2003-04 to 2005-06, expenditure on sexually transmitted infections was included within the Genito Urinary system problems category and was therefore not separately identified. Expenditure on HIV and AIDS is not included in expenditure on sexually transmitted infections but has been separately identified as a subcategory of Infectious diseases since 2006-07. 5. Disease specific expenditure do not include expenditure on prevention, or health promotion and programmes such as the National Chlamydia Screening Programme or general practitioner expenditure, but do include prescribing expenditure. 6.

	<p pid="b.846W.11/1">The Health Protection Agency (HPA) advises the Government in relation to the protection of communities from radiation hazards, including those associated with exposure to non-ionising radiation such as the radio waves from wireless communication systems. The HPA has concluded that there is no consistent evidence to date that exposure to radio signals from wi-fi and wireless local area networks adversely affects the health of the general population. The signals are very low power, typically 0.1 watt (100 milliwatts) in both the computer and the router (access point), and the results so far show exposures are well within the internationally-accepted guidelines from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. The HPA also considers it sensible, as with any new technology, to adopt a precautionary approach, and keeps the situation under review.</p>
	<p pid="b.846W.11/2">The HPA's independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR) reviewed health effects in relation to radio waves in 2003 for the then National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB). See documents of the NRPB, volume 14, number 2, which is available on the HPA website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.846W.11/4">AGNIR is currently updating this review and is due to publish its findings, in 2012. In between the publication of formal review reports, HPA monitors emerging scientific studies and keeps its advice under review.</p>

The Government intends to work together with other member states to improve the directive and if the concerns we have are taken into account during the process of negotiation, we will consider applying to opt in once the instrument has been adopted.</p>

	<p pid="b.859W.9/1">The Treasury Solicitor's Department (TSol) adheres to Cabinet Office guidance which requires consultancy contracts of &#163;20,000 and above to receive appropriate departmental approval, and Cabinet Office and HM Treasury approval where:</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.9/2">Contracts are expected to last longer than nine months</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.9/3">Pre-existing contracts are extended to take the total life of the contract beyond 9 months, or:</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.9/4">In the case of procurement-related consultancy, the cost is over &#163;20,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.9/5">Internally, all funding applications are submitted to the finance director for preliminary checks to ensure that the requirement is of operational necessity; it cannot be met by in-house resources; and the commercial proposal represents value for money with a demonstrable return on investment and does not exceed advice on prices and rates provided by the Efficiency Reform Group. Subject to these criteria being met a request for approval is put to TSol's Performance &amp; Investment Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.9/6">In the event that the use of consultants is approved, the procurement will be undertaken using, preferably, an existing framework arrangement or through an open competition advertised on the approved Contracts Finder site. TSol is also mindful that, should tendered prices exceed approved rate card maxima, it may be necessary to re-submit the business case for appropriate approvals.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.9/7">If the Department were to require consultancy services above the threshold of &#163;20,000, the Department would formally re-consider the need for the services every three months and, should the need appear likely to continue beyond a nine month period, seek Cabinet Office approval to prolong the contract.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.9/8">In parallel with its formal procedures, TSol seeks to secure value for money and knowledge transfer from consultants as part of its on-going management of resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.9/9">The Attorney-General's Office and HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate are covered by the same arrangements used by TSol.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.9/10">The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) follows the same central Government Procurement guidelines for engaging external consultants as with any other procurement process. Guidance is provided to SFO staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.9/11">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) defines consultancy services in line with the Office of Government Commerce's Consultancy Value programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.9/12">In May 2010, the CPS adopted a new approval process for all consultancy engagements. The process involves the preparation of a business case which contains as a minimum: a description of the requirement; anticipated length of engagement; and confirmation that the required skills are not available in-house.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.9/13">All business cases are referred to the finance director and chief executive officer (CEO) for approval. Those expected to exceed &#163;20,000 in value are referred for ministerial level approval. Any extensions to approved engagements must follow the same process.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.9/14">Contracts for approved engagements are let via collaborative government framework agreements for consultancy services. Only in exceptional circumstances, where the required skills are not available via such agreements, would consideration be given to contracting with a firm or individual outside of a collaborative government framework agreement.</p>

	<p pid="b.870W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence (MOD)'s policy changed in April 2011 to recognise that use of pre-qualification questionnaires is generally unnecessary for low risk procurement valued below &#163;100,000. For small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, this has provided easier access to Government contracts. Nevertheless, there will still be a small number of exceptional cases where the specific risks make pre-qualification questionnaires necessary, for instance where there is a need to ensure a minimum capability to protect highly classified information.</p>

	<p pid="b.876W.2/1">Following the strategic defence and security review (SDSR), we announced the decision to withdraw Sentinel R.1 from service once it is no longer required for operations in Afghanistan. This decision is assumed for planning purposes to save approximately &#163;320 million in cash resource DEL and &#163;190 million in capital DEL over the next 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.876W.2/2">The Department has no current plans to take Shadow R1 or Reaper into permanent RAF service, and therefore no savings would result.</p>
	<p pid="b.876W.2/3">A number of changes were made to the Joint Combat Aircraft programme during the SDSR and planning round 2010-11, including the change of variant from the F-35B to the F-35C and the decision to introduce it into service in time to enable the delivery of a Carrier Strike capability in around 2020. We expect savings to arise from the delayed in-service date and from the lower unit price acquisition costs and through-life support costs of the F-35C compared with the F-35B. The precise value of these savings remains subject to further work.</p>
	<p pid="b.876W.2/4">The Department has no plans to cap the number of Typhoon aircraft in service at 107 between 2015 and 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.876W.2/5">None of these measures are expected to have a direct impact on the Department's annually managed expenditure.</p>

It is too early at present to say precisely how the sites will be used. Detailed planning work will now be undertaken, led by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation in conjunction with the Army and Royal Air Force. This work will involve the appropriate and necessary engagement with other Government Departments, the Devolved Administrations and local authorities. Work will involve a comprehensive assessment of issues such as impact on schools, health care, etc and the broader local economy and environment.</p>

	<p pid="b.877W.8/2">Until the more detailed work arising from the basing review is complete, it is too soon to be able to assess any such resultant effects. However, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) is represented at the Scottish Service Children Stakeholders' Network (SCSN), a forum led by the Scottish Directorate for Learning and supported by local authorities, schools, the services, schools inspectorate, and the independent sector. We recognise this as a potential issue and are in a position to highlight any issues or concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.877W.8/3">I can confirm that QVS is currently undergoing an internal review, working closely with Her Majesty's Commissioners at the school and the Service Children's Education Agency to ensure that the school remains viable and continues to play a part in providing support for the families of service personnel. The work will include looking at the infrastructure of the school, ensuring adequate provision of educational support and also reviewing the administrative function within the MOD to benefit the school. This will take into account the changes within the Defence environment in Scotland.</p>

All commercial guards employed at Defence sites must be licensed in accordance with Security Industry Association regulations.

	<p pid="b.882W.8/2">Following the comprehensive spending review and the strategic defence and security review, consideration has been given to a range of options that will determine the Department's future requirement for the services and capabilities provided by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) Police. These resources will focus on those areas where civil policing powers can best mitigate the crime and security risks faced by the MOD. These options are currently the subject of formal consultation with the relevant staff associations and trades unions, and as such it would be inappropriate to go into specific detail at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="b.893W.11/1">The costs to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of employing civil servants to undertake procurement in the years 2008-09 and 2009-10 can be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.893W.11/2">In 2010-11 the cost of civil servants in a formal procurement role was &#163;1.16 million. Our current estimate of the cost of full-time civil servants in the current financial year is &#163;1.41 million. While this indicates an increase in costs, this is as a result of moving distributed procurement expertise from other parts of the business to provide a more centralised procurement department to improve efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="b.893W.11/3">We estimate that the cost of consultancy services engaged on procurement in 2011-12 will be &#163;90,000. This reflects a decrease in the use of procurement consultancy specialists who now have to be approved by the Efficiency and Reform Group (ERG) as part of the Government-wide consultancy approval process.</p>

	<p pid="b.894W.5/2">The Government have set out a very clear ambition for the UK's trade and investment agenda. Trade and inward investment was one of the themes in the first phase of the Growth Review.</p>
	<p pid="b.894W.5/3">Working with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) is the Government Department that helps UK based businesses succeed in the global economy and assists overseas companies to bring their high-quality investment to the UK. UKTI's strategy, &#8216;Britain Open for Business&#8217;, launched in May 2011, sets out plans to provide practical support to exporters and inward investors over the next five years. Its purpose is to help our economy grow by boosting exports and encouraging foreign companies to invest in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.894W.5/4">At the same time, and complementary to UKTI's strategy, the FCO launched its Charter for Business. This sets out seven commitments that the FCO will make, as a part of its core activity, to support UK business overseas and to attract investors to the UK. Further details can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="b.894W.5/5"><a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">www.fco.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.894W.5/6">UKTI uses its network of staff across the globe to showcase UK strengths in sectors where we have world-beating capability and this can pay big commercial dividends, particularly in the more challenging emerging markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.894W.5/7">According to independent research, UK companies attributed &#163;6 billion worth of additional profits due directly to the assistance of UKTI during 2010-11. That is an additional &#163;22 of profit for every &#163;1 spent on export promotion. In addition, in 2010-11 assisted more foreign direct investment projects than ever before&#8212;849 of 1,434 projects entering the UK (59%).</p>

	<p pid="b.900W.2/1">A review of the grant-aided work of Keep Britain Tidy (then known as ENCAMS, an abbreviation of Environmental Campaigns) was conducted in 2007. It concluded that overall the organisation was efficient, well-run and delivering good work towards DEFRA's local environment quality aims.</p>
	<p pid="b.900W.2/2">A copy of the review will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.900W.2/3">Keep Britain Tidy has long been a trusted adviser and partner for the Government on litter and other local environment quality issues. Its work has been central to the development of the Love Where You Live campaign, which uses funds from business to raise awareness of the litter problem and change attitudes and behaviour. The Government will continue to work with Keep Britain Tidy across the spending review period on these issues that matter greatly to everyone.</p>

	<p pid="b.903W.7/1">The only information held centrally on numbers of deaths and injuries caused by the failure of freestanding or retaining walls is that held by the Health and Safety Executive arising from statutory duties to report certain work-related injuries under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995. Information on the failure of these types of walls in other situations, such where a domestic owner occupier's wall collapses through neglect and injures a passer-by is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.903W.7/2">However, my Department, under the last Administration, previously evaluated the potential of bringing freestanding and retaining boundary walls under building regulations control. This work identified that over a 10-year period between 1985 and 1995 that there were about 1,000 injuries per year sustained from the collapse or partial collapse of freestanding walls and on average less than one death per year. While we have not been able to establish a case for bringing such walls under the scope of building regulations, my Department has published guidance in a leaflet on wall design, construction and maintenance, &#8220;Your Garden Walls&#8212;Better to be Safe than Sorry&#8221;, which is available on the planning portal.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" name="Theresa May">the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)</phrase>, launched a new Prevent strategy in June, following the independent review overseen by Lord Carlile of Berriew. This new strategy defines far more strongly than before the proper scope of Prevent as an integral part of counter-terrorism strategy. There is now a clear separation between Prevent&#8212;led by the Home Office, and broader integration work&#8212;led by the Department for Communities and Local Government. Of course, we continue to work closely with Home Office colleagues particularly in the area of extremism and intolerance.</p>

	<p pid="b.904W.8/2">To support local authorities in tackling empty homes in England we have introduced a number of measures, to ensure that the right incentives and tools are in place to enable them to work with the owners of empty properties.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.8/3">We have included empty homes in the &#8216;New Homes Bonus&#8217; to provide a strong financial incentive for local authorities to tackle empty homes in their area. The bonus means that the Government will match fund the council tax, using the national average in each band, on new homes and long-term empty properties (dwellings which are empty for six months or more) brought back into use, for six years, with an additional amount being provided for affordable homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.8/4">Redditch, for example, received &#163;164,263 in year one of new homes bonus as a result of increasing their housing supply, including through bringing empty homes back into use, and will receive &#163;985,578 over the next six years following year one delivery.</p>

	<p pid="b.904W.8/7">In addition, the Department has allocated &#163;100 million through the &#8216;Affordable Homes Programme&#8217; to help get empty homes back into productive use. We will shortly be launching the bidding guidance for this funding, which will be available to registered providers of social housing, including local authorities and community, voluntary and self-help groups across England.</p>

	<p pid="b.905W.2/3">They are based on the Office for National Statistics (ONS) 2008-based population projections. The number of households in England is projected to grow to 27.5 million in 2033, an increase of 5.8 million (27%) over 2008, or 232,000 households per annum.</p>
	<p pid="b.905W.2/4">Population growth accounts for around 70% of household growth, with the other factors including age structure, marital status and the propensity to form households.</p>
	<p pid="b.905W.2/5">Variant household projections using different assumptions such as ONS variant population projections can indicate the effect of various demographic factors. This is complicated as effects overlap, for example, increased longevity also contributes to smaller households.</p>
	<p pid="b.905W.2/6">Comparison with the principal household projection of 232,000 per annum shows:</p>
	<p pid="b.905W.2/7"><i>(a)</i> Longevity&#8212;average household growth of 170,000 per annum based on the ONS population projection assuming no improvement in life expectancy.</p>

	<p pid="b.910W.9/1">By promoting development, the UK's aid programme, should over the long term, help to reduce the dependency of developing countries on aid. Improving tax systems can be an important part of this. Effective tax systems are central to effective states and can help to reduce aid dependency.</p>
	<p pid="b.910W.9/2">The UK provides capacity building to help strengthen tax systems in developing countries. As well as collecting revenue, good tax systems also encourage accountability and better governance. The Government have supported the creation of semi-independent revenue authorities in countries including Uganda, Mozambique and Rwanda, significantly improving revenue collection. In Burundi, the UK is helping to establish an independent revenue authority which is already expecting to raise &#163;35 million more revenue this year than last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.910W.9/3">The Government strongly support improvements in international tax information exchange to help all countries, including developing countries, tackle tax evasion and avoidance. The work of the Global Forum on Tax Transparency and Exchange of Information, which the UK fully supports and which developing countries are being encouraged to join, is particularly important in this respect. In addition, one of the Government's first acts on coming into office was to sign up to a new international protocol strengthening the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/ Council of Europe Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.910W.9/4">The UK is also working bilaterally, through the OECD and through the OECD Tax and Development Task Force, to provide technical assistance for developing countries with transfer pricing, to enhance their ability to assess and collect the tax they are owed.</p>
	<p pid="b.910W.9/5">The Government have made clear that it will press at the European Union (EU) for requirements to be placed on EU extractive industry companies to disclose the payments they make to Governments. Such disclosures will enable the citizens of resource rich countries to see what their governments receive from the exploitation of natural resources and promote accountability in the use of these funds.</p>

	<p pid="b.913W.2/1">Rapid population growth will place a significant strain on the ability of Governments to deliver basic services such as health and education. Even with economic growth, the increase in global population is likely to build additional pressure on natural resources with some regions of the world experiencing increased water scarcity, food shortages and new challenges for sustainable energy supplies and land availability.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.2/2">The UK Government are working closely with others to advance a comprehensive understanding of the role of population dynamics (specifically the demographic dividend associated with declining fertility) in helping achieve increased economic productivity and rising per capita income in developing economies. The lack of choices for women and girls and their inability to be able to exercise control over their own fertility is a major cause of poverty and also contributes to population growth. Some 215 million women, desperately wanting to delay or avoid pregnancy, are not using an effective method of family planning.</p>
	<p pid="b.913W.2/3">The UK's Framework for Results &#8220;Choices for women: Planned pregnancies, safe births and healthy newborns&#8221; sets out how the Government will double its efforts on women's and children's health. It commits us to enabling at least 10 million more women to use modern methods of family planning by 2015, contributing to a wider global goal of 100 million new users, and to prevent more than 5 million unintended pregnancies.</p>

	<p pid="b.914W.3/1">The Academies Act 2010 financial impact assessment identified that conversion costs could be around &#163;75-80,000, based on experience of the legal and associated costs of opening sponsored academies. Actual conversion costs fluctuate between schools depending on individual circumstances. Schools may apply to the Department to receive a one-off &#163;25,000 conversion support grant to contribute towards these costs. Additional grants are also available for PFI schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.3/2">From May 2010 until <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-01">1 October 2011</phrase>, 1526 applications were received from schools wishing to convert to academy status. A list of all applications received (the &#8220;Publication List&#8221;) is updated monthly and available on the Department for Education website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.3/3"><a href="http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/typesofschools/academies/a0069811/map-of-open-academies-and-schools-submitting-applications">http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/typesofschools/academies/a0069811/map-of-open-academies-and-schools-submitting-applications</a></p>
	<p pid="b.914W.3/4">As at <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-01">1 October 2011</phrase>, 1031 Schools in England had converted to academy status. A further 495 schools had at this time applied to convert. It typically takes three to four months for a school to convert. As set out in the recent DFE consultation on the basis for the decision on the appropriate amount of academies funding transfer for 2011-12 and 2012-13, current estimates of the number of academy converters for the financial year 2011/12 are for between 1550 and 2113 schools to convert to become academies. It is important to point out that these are the best estimates which can be made at this time given the demand-led nature of the Academies' Conversion programme. They should not therefore be regarded as a target but as the best assessment that can be made of how the expansion in the numbers of academies may develop.</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.3/5">Project Leads in Academy Converter Division {within the Infrastructure and Funding Directorate) liaise directly with schools to support them in their conversion to academy status. There are currently 98 full-time equivalent officials working exclusively in the Department's Academy Converter Division. Of these staff, the majority are Project Leads who work directly with schools that are seeking information about becoming an academy or which have applied to convert. There are other staff in the Department who make a contribution to policy development and programme delivery related to schools converting to academy status as part of their wider role. Current staff numbers cost &#163;2,443,000, The converter grant paid so far is &#163;18,642,779, although this is expected to increase as more converting schools are given grants to convert.</p>

	<p pid="b.917W.8/1">One of the requirements of the current history curriculum is to develop in pupils an understanding of the diverse experiences and ideas, beliefs and attitudes of men, women and children in past societies and how these have shaped the world. The current programmes for history are a broad framework, so although there are no specific references to history relating to women in the range and content, they provide ample opportunities for schools to cover this topic.</p>
	<p pid="b.917W.8/2">We are currently undertaking a review of the National Curriculum. The review is considering which subjects beyond English, maths, science and physical education should in future be compulsory subjects within the National Curriculum, and at which key stages. We expect to announce our proposals early next year. For those subjects which we propose should remain part of the National Curriculum, we will work with subject experts and other interested parties during the course of next year to develop new Programmes Of Study for those subjects. There will be a full public consultation before final decisions are made.</p>

	<p pid="b.918W.5/1">The Department has introduced internal procedures to review all proposals to engage consultants. These procedures now incorporate the cross-Government consultancy review arrangements established by the Efficiency and Reform Group (ERG) in Cabinet Office for high value cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.5/2">Consultancy engagements have to meet criteria before approval is granted:</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.5/3">The requirement is of genuine operational necessity ;</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.5/4">The work cannot be undertaken by existing in-house resources;</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.5/5">The commercial proposals represent real value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.5/6">Within the Department all consultancy proposals require at least a business case signed off at director level. For engagements in our arm&#8217;s length bodies, sign-off is at chief executive level. Separate approval processes are then required depending on the value and requirement of the engagement. All cases are reviewed within Finance and Commercial Group at deputy director and director levels. Engagements that are intended to last for over nine months require clearance from the Minister for Efficiency and Value for Money, my noble Friend, Lord Hill of Oareford, and the Cabinet Office. Consultancy contracts of over &#163;20,000 also require approval by Lord Hill and if they involve procurement related consultancy also require Cabinet Office approval.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.5/7">Existing consultancy contracts of &#163;20,000 and above are reviewed every three months from the date of contract commencement to ensure they still meet the criteria. Contracts are reviewed at three and six months within the Department, and at nine months they are referred to Cabinet Office for approval to continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.5/8">The Department is subject to EU and UK Procurement regulations and the strategy of centralising procurement of common goods and services for central Government Departments. As such the Department encourages use of existing framework agreements wherever possible, including those established by the Government Procurement Service. Where requirements are not met by an existing framework, business units are advised that, following the fundamental principles of EU legislation, and Government purchasing policy, contracts should be awarded following competitive tendering.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.5/9">Up to February 2011, Departments had saved &#163;350 million on consultancy engagements&#8212;a reduction of 55%.</p>

We are supporting school staff to proactively identify the motivation of poor behaviour and bullying that are particular to their school, and to ensure that they have clear strategies in place to tackle them. We have published clearer anti-bullying advice to help schools to develop an effective approach. We have updated statutory guidance to school governors, clarifying their legal powers to tackle bullying both in and outside school; and legislation currently before the House will strengthen the authority of teachers to enforce discipline and promote good behaviour. The new Ofsted inspections framework, which comes into force in January next year, will place a sharper focus on behaviour and bullying, increasing schools' accountability in this area.</p>

	<p pid="b.924W.7/1">It is important the work capability assessment (WCA) is subject to an ongoing process of review, evaluation and refinement. This includes continuing to listen to the concerns of both representative groups and individuals and we welcome the recent Work and Pensions Select Committee Report which acknowledged improvements to the WCA resulting from the review process.</p>
	<p pid="b.924W.7/2">As part of this continuous improvement Professor Harrington published his first Independent Review of the WCA in November 2010. He concluded that the principles of the assessment are right, but that the system contains some flaws that risk undermining its effectiveness. We fully endorse his review and have sought to implement all of its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.924W.7/3">Improvements include the introduction of mental, cognitive and intellectual &#8216;champions&#8217; into assessment centres to improve the assessment of these functions. Atos have additionally published a customer charter which is available in their medical assessment centres, ensuring that individuals understand the level of service they may reasonably expect from the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.924W.7/4">We will continue to review and refine the WCA to ensure that it is effective; fair for all claimants and as a result fair for the taxpayer. I am delighted therefore that Professor Harrington has agreed to take on the second Independent Review of the WCA. We look forward to receiving his further recommendations by the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.925W.5/1">The Government takes awareness of carbon monoxide issues very seriously, and provides information for the public on websites and in publications. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) advice to consumers is to always use a Gas Safe registered engineer for all gas work in their home, and to ensure that any gas appliances are regularly serviced and maintained. Although not a substitute for the correct installation or maintenance of an appliance, HSE also strongly recommends the use of audible carbon monoxide alarms. Additionally, HSE provides a free gas safety advice line, which gas consumers, tenants and landlords can contact for advice and information.</p>
	<p pid="b.925W.5/2">The Gas Safe Register, the statutory registration scheme for gas engineers, was launched in April 2009. The Register has undertaken significant campaigns, including national TV advertising, coverage on a wide variety of consumer programmes and national and regional press and radio, along with regional and community events to raise public awareness of gas safety risks. Recent research by the Gas Safe Register has shown that 81% of consumers are aware of gas safety risks and the Gas Safe Register.</p>
	<p pid="b.925W.5/3">HSE and Gas Safe Register continue to work to raise awareness of the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning, particularly with vulnerable groups such as the elderly and students. Gas Safe Register ran their first Gas Safety Week in September 2011 and reached millions of consumers with key gas safety messages.</p>

	<p pid="b.929W.0/1">Universal credit is a national benefit. It will be delivered largely through an online service, with its core administration most efficiently run by a centralised system. As DWP start to build the organisation to deliver universal credit, and we have yet to settle on the precise detail, and select the right people with the right capability it is likely some of those skills will exist within local authorities. We will therefore always look to include local authority staff in our thinking.</p>
	<p pid="b.929W.0/2">In relation to the longer term delivery of universal credit, we will continue to work with colleagues in HM Revenue and Customs and local authorities to test new ways of working and impact ongoing Delivery Model design at both a national and local level. Our aim is to work collaboratively to enable the decision making process and deliver optimal value. This includes the decision making around any redundancies, for which we have a small amount in our business case (whether they are in DWP, HMRC or local authorities). However, we do not expect there to be significant numbers of redundancies, if any at all, given the time available to us to plan and complete the transition to universal credit by 2017. I will be able to say more on the transition plan and the associated costs once we have collated and analysed the responses from the recent survey of local authorities. I expect to be able to do this by the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="b.936W.5/2">The Government believe that all people of working age who can work should be expected to do so and that it is not right to continue the current position where pension credit can go to households which contain a person of working age without that person having to meet any work-related requirements. The universal credit approach provides financial support to such couples, whilst giving the working-age member of the couple access to support in finding work.</p>

	<p pid="b.937W.0/1">Payment of state pension starts from the first full benefit week that follows the date a person reaches state pension age. State pension is paid in full weeks and this means that for most people there will be a gap between their birthday (when they reach pension age) and the day they receive their first payment of pension. The gap could be anything between one and six days, depending on the person's birthday and their benefit payday.</p>
	<p pid="b.937W.0/2">If a person's birthday happens to fall on the same day of the week as the first day of their benefit week, there is no gap between that birthday and the first day for which payment is due. For most other people, there will be. However, because we make pension payments in complete weeks, there are no part-week payments at the end of a claim either, when a full week's benefit is also paid and thus the system balances itself out.</p>
	<p pid="b.937W.0/3">There are administrative costs associated with making part-week payments and it is important that we continue to deliver the Department's service as cost-effectively as possible. If we made part-week payments at the commencement of a claim then logically we should seek to recover any days' overpayment at the end this would be at a cost to the Department.</p>
	<p pid="b.937W.0/4">The Government have no plans to change this arrangement at the present time. I do receive letters on this subject from time to time and my response has been along similar lines.</p>

This will be a cost to the Exchequer and the taxpayer of around &#163;4 billion as a result of entitlement changes and increased take-up. Offsetting this it is estimated that there will be savings of around &#163;2 billion due to reduced fraud, error and overpayments together with changes to the earnings disregards that currently exist in tax credits. In the longer term reduced complexity has the potential to lead to savings of more than &#163;0.5 billion a year in administrative costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.939W.8/1">We expect that the vast majority of claimants will manage their universal credit payment by either electing to use a joint bank account or opting to have it paid directly to one member of the household.</p>
	<p pid="b.939W.8/2">There may, however, be exceptional cases that require alternative arrangements, and we are considering the circumstances for and details of these. For example, where there is proven abuse of the money by one partner, the Government already have and will retain the power to direct payments to the other partner, or there may be instances where it is more appropriate to divide the payment.</p>

	<p pid="b.943W.9/1">The National Apprenticeship Service has end to end responsibility for delivering apprenticeships in England. As part of this role, the National Apprenticeship Service work with employers to try and find alternative placements for those individuals at risk of redundancy.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.9/2">In this case, the National Apprenticeship Service and Skills Funding Agency are working together to provide BAE with site level support across the country to manage any transition activities for individuals as necessary. BAE are sensitive to ensuring that apprenticeship schemes are protected and will look to ensure that existing apprenticeships can be completed. Where individuals are unable to complete their apprenticeships at the same site, the apprenticeship programme has sufficient flexibility within its contracts to allow those affected to move to other BAE sites to complete their training.</p>

	<p pid="b.944W.5/1">The Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) Corporate Governance Code sets out principles and best practice for good corporate governance and covers the role and responsibilities of audit committees. In September the FRC published a document setting out how they will achieve the aims set out in their paper &#8216;Effective Company Stewardship&#8217; to extend the remit of audit committees.</p>
	<p pid="b.944W.5/2">In September the FRC also published a paper, &#8216;Boards and Risk&#8212;A Summary of Discussions with Companies, Investors and Advisers&#8217;, which considered the approach of companies and boards to risk and how that risk is managed. This was based on extensive discussion with market participants about how they operate. One of the key conclusions is that a company's ability to understand and articulate its business model leads naturally to a better understanding of risk and how it should be prioritised.</p>
	<p pid="b.944W.5/3">In September I published a consultation, &#8216;The Future of Narrative Reporting&#8217;, which describes a new, simpler and more user-friendly reporting framework for UK companies. This framework will enable companies to provide investors with a clear description of the company's strategy, business model and principal risks.</p>

	<p pid="b.946W.11/1">The eligibility for asylum seekers to access funding for skills training are described in paragraphs 32 and 33 of the Skills Funding Agency 2011/12 Learner Eligibility and Contribution Rules (Version 2.1, August 2011). This can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="b.946W.11/3">From the 2011/12 academic year, where English language skills have been identified as a barrier to entering employment, full Government funding is provided for English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) qualifications delivered to unemployed people in receipt of jobseeker&#8217;s allowance or in the Employment and Support Allowance (Work-Related Activity) Group. Further education colleges and training organisations also have local discretion to provide fully subsidised courses for people on a wider range of benefits where the training is to help them enter employment. Learners are expected to share the costs of publicly funded ESOL courses with Government where full fee remission is not applicable. The Government will no longer fund ESOL courses delivered in the workplace. This is to ensure publicly-funded training provision is focused on people whose lack of English is preventing them from finding work.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.11/4">This Department and the Department for Communities and Local Government are working in partnership to develop new forms of support for individuals who need language skills to assist with integration and community cohesion. I will announce further details in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.946W.11/5">The potential impact on adult learners participating in ESOL courses of the changes to eligibility criteria for fee remission set out in the Government's 'Skills for Sustainable Growth' strategy (November 2010) are described in an equality impact assessment, published by this Department on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-18">18 July 2011</phrase>.

	<p pid="b.950W.8/2">The Government are committed to creating the most competitive corporate tax system in the G20 and are undertaking a significant programme of reform. This includes reductions in the main rate of corporation tax which will benefit all companies including those which derive profits from copyright and other forms of intellectual property. The Government are also introducing the Patent Box which will improve the competitiveness of the UK for high-tech businesses, encouraging a wide range of sectors to invest in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.952W.5/1">The law relating to patent applications has been amended and modernised in several ways during the last five to 10 years. These changes have implemented new international treaties, reduced or removed regulatory burdens on patent applicants, and helped with the enforcement of rights. More recently, this Government have introduced a number of new services for users of the patents system&#8212;most notably a fast-track procedure for international patent applications coming into the UK, and a free online service for viewing patent application documents. Furthermore, the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property recently looked at the UK patents system in detail, with an emphasis on ensuring that the system supports growth and innovation&#8212;and made no recommendations relating to the law governing the patent application process. For these reasons, no further changes are planned at this time.</p>

	<p pid="b.954W.0/1">Responsibility for enforcing competition law which prohibits certain anti-competitive agreements between firms and abuse of a dominant position in a market falls to the Office of Fair Trading as the responsible independent competition authority. The Government have brought legislation to Parliament to introduce a Groceries Code Adjudicator to enforce the Groceries Supply Code of Practice which ensures that large retailers must deal fairly and lawfully with their suppliers.</p>

	<p pid="b.954W.6/12">It is important to note that estimates for local authorities are subject to large sampling variability and should therefore be treated with caution and viewed in conjunction with their Confidence Intervals, which indicate how accurate an estimate is. For example, a Confidence Interval of +/- 5.8 percentage points (ppt) means that the true value is between 5.8 ppt above the estimate and 5.8 ppt below the estimate.</p>
