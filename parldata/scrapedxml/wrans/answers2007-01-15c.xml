It does, however, estimate a global net enrolment ratio in secondary education of 58 per cent. Net enrolment ratio is enrolment of the official age group for a given level of education, expressed as a percentage of the population in that age group.</p>

	<p pid="c.738W.9/1">In March 2006, the UN Secretary-General's Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation announced an action plan which included a call for a global mechanism to promote water operators partnerships. We intend to increase support to various partnership initiatives that support public utilities and we are currently considering how best to do this. We are discussing a number of proposals with potential partners. Previous experience has shown that twinning agreements and capacity-building arrangements in the sector can often be ineffective. Our approach to public partnerships should capitalise on this experience and be based on evidence of what works best. In particular, we want to be sure that any new partnerships are set up with the right incentives in place and do not duplicate or undermine the efforts of other established partnership approaches.</p>

	<p pid="c.739W.5/2">The programme ended in December 2006. DFID commissioned a series of independent reviews of its outcomes. These showed considerable impact in reducing poverty and conflict, in securing access to state forest lands by local communities, in improving small enterprises, in reducing illegal logging, and in rebuilding trust and effective government in a fragile state. A portrait of the programme was also written by a British journalist and published in a book entitled &quot;Aid That Works&quot;, highlighting many human interest stories and how lives have changed by the improvements in forest governance in Indonesia.</p>
	<p pid="c.739W.5/3">The programme has built a solid platform for taking forward the new DFID White Paper agenda&mdash;engaging in governance reforms in difficult environments, working across Whitehall, and addressing climate change. We are now preparing joint work with the FCO in Indonesia to carry forward this agenda, particularly in addressing the international trade in illegal timber, the stabilisation of local land rights to curb deforestation and illegal logging, and to raise the profile of climate change and the huge contribution to greenhouse gas emissions made by deforestation in Indonesia. Initially this will be supported as part of DFID's &pound;24 million global Forest Governance and Trade programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.740W.2/1">DFID has a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Indonesia on combating illegal logging, and a wider forest governance reform programme, the Multistakeholder Forestry Programme (MFP). As part of the &pound;25 million bilateral MFP, DFID has spent approximately &pound;2 million per year, over the past three years, on research, advocacy, coordination, media communications, training and policy development to combat illegal logging. While the MFP has ended, DFID's bilateral commitment to combating illegal logging continues under a &pound;24 million global programme on Forest Governance and Trade. We expect to spend over &pound;1 million each year over the next three years from this global programme in Indonesia.</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.2/2">Through its contributions to the EU, DFID is also contributing to a number of EU-funded projects combating illegal logging in Indonesia. The EU-Illegal Logging Response Centre, the EC Tropical Forest Budget Line, and the EU support to the Asia Regional Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (FLEG) process, have all contributed over &pound;2 million per year, and the new EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Support Project will spend just under &pound;2 million per year over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.2/3">Through its staff and contributions to the World Bank, DFID has also contributed to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)-World Bank partnership against illegal logging in Indonesia, and leveraged US$1 million (2006-07) from a Dutch Trust Fund for a Forest Transparency Initiative. Through its contributions to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), DFID has contributed to the work of the Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) in supporting the Asia Forest Partnership.</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.2/4">These funds are backed up by the staff whom we have in our Policy Division, the DFID Indonesia country office, and seconded to the European Commission office responsible for global forestry support, as well as the work we do across Whitehall in providing a coherent response to this international problem from DFID, DEFRA and FCO.</p>

	<p pid="c.742W.0/1">The following table shows the debts currently owed by Low Income and Lower Middle Income Countries to the UK through DFID, as well as debt relief and cancellation in terms of flow relief and stock cancellation for these countries. No debt is owed directly by any government to CDC Group plc, which only lends to commercial organisations. However, some loans by CDC to parastatal and quasi-governmental organisations were guaranteed by their governments. Income to CDC and debt relief on these loans are therefore included in the table.</p>
	<p pid="c.742W.0/2">Debts owed by countries to the World Bank on loans financed by the UK and other then-EEC donors in the 1970s are listed separately. DFID receives payments on these loans from the World Bank. The loans reverted to bilateral status in 2005 and those to Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) are being treated in accordance with the UK's 100 per cent. debt relief policies. All payments by HIPCs to the UK since 2000 on these loans will be returned to them when they complete the HIPC Initiative. The balance of the loans will also be cancelled. Payments returned to HIPCs so far are listed as flow relief since 2004, with loans cancelled recorded as stock cancellation. DFID is in the process of returning payments and cancelling our share of these loans to Malawi and Sierra Leone, which recently completed the HIPC Initiative. We are also in the process of returning payments received from Mauritania.</p>

	<p pid="c.746W.2/1">No debt is owed directly by any government to CDC Group plc, which only lends to commercial organisations. Some loans by CDC to parastatal and quasi-governmental organisations were guaranteed by their governments, and income to CDC from these loans is recorded in the table. The only income received directly by DFID from a Low Income Country (LIC) in 2005-06 came from Zimbabwe, which has not met the standards of accountability, public financial management and commitment to poverty reduction needed to qualify for debt relief from the UK. No payments are expected from LICs in 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="c.746W.2/12">In addition, &pound;1.852 million was received by DFID in 2005-06, and &pound;1.883 million is expected in 2006-07 from repayments by countries to the World Bank on loans that were originally funded by the UK and other then EEC creditors in the 1970s. The bulk of these loans were to Low Income Countries. Debts held by Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) are cancelled in full when they reach HIPC Completion Point, with any payments made to the UK since 2000 returned to them. The UK is not currently able to provide debt relief on our share of the loans to non-HIPC Low Income Countries as this requires the agreement of all eight creditors. We are continuing discussions and hope to be able to offer debt relief on these loans soon.</p>

	<p pid="c.746W.5/1">The UK is a major supporter of the World Food Programme (WFP) globally and in Somalia. WFP plans to distribute 114,000mt (metric tonnes) of food aid in Somalia this year, and a significant proportion of this will be in the worst affected areas in southern and central Somalia, such as Middle and Lower Juba. The UK is the second largest contributor after the US to the World Food Programme's protracted Relief and Recovery Operation 10191, which runs to <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase>, with US$11.4 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.746W.5/2">WFP is currently preparing a food aid convoy from Mogadishu to Wajid. A distribution in Middle Shabelle was planned just before the recent fighting, but it remains stalled because of lack of clarity over the security situation in that region. In Middle and Lower Juba there has been some limited food aid distribution in Bualle. There are 1000mt on trucks at Afmadow in Lower Juba, which it is planned will be distributed soon. WFP also has teams in Wajid on standby for a return to Kismayo.</p>
	<p pid="c.746W.5/3">The recent conflict caused restrictions on access to Somalia for relief workers and supplies. However, for most agencies, including WFP, it is proving possible to resume operations, although there have been some problems related to the re-emergence of local militias. The UK continues to take all opportunities to press the authorities on the ground to allow for the re-establishment of humanitarian relief operations in all areas, including the deliveries of WFP food aid and the use of helicopters and aircraft. Much of this operation is funded by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund to which the UK is the largest single contributor. WFP has adequate supplies for the next five to six months for Somalia.</p>

	<p pid="c.747W.2/10">We are also examining urgently, with donor partners, how existing donor support to restoring effective policing in parts of Somalia can be extended to southern and central Somalia. This support is being channelled primarily through the UNDP's Rule of Law and Security programme (RoLS), which has been supporting police strengthening in Somaliland, Puntland and Baidoa. The programme has already established police training centres in Armo and Baidoa.</p>

	<p pid="c.753W.2/1">Traffic calming measures will have an effect on motorcycle traffic directly and also indirectly as a result of slowing the speed of the general flow of traffic, including motorcycles. Full-width road humps are likely to be the most effective in slowing motorcycles directly. I recognise that speed cushions and chicanes may be less effective in slowing motorcycles. It is for the relevant highway authority to determine the most appropriate form of traffic calming depending on local circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="c.753W.5/1">16-year-olds are entitled to ride mopeds, which have an engine capacity of under 50 cc and are limited to a maximum speed of around 50 mph. Anyone wanting to ride a moped, even with a provisional licence, must first of all successfully complete a Compulsory Basic Training course. This is a legal requirement, which is designed to provide riders with the necessary skills before riding unaccompanied on the road. In this way, those who need independence and mobility at a younger age are given the opportunity to gain it.</p>
	<p pid="c.753W.5/2">The number of personal injury road accidents reported to the police, in each of the last five years, involving a 16-year-old rider on a motorcycle of 50 cc and under (whether or not the rider was themselves injured) are:</p>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.753W.5/13">In 2005, 1,882 16-year-old riders of mopeds were injured in road accidents, of whom four were killed and 318 were seriously injured. A further 38 pillion passengers of 16-year-old moped riders were injured, of whom none was killed and five were seriously injured. In addition, another 71 road users were injured in accidents involving 16-year-old moped riders, of whom none was killed and 12 were seriously injured.</p>
	<p pid="c.753W.5/14">Accidents involving 16-year-old moped riders accounted for 8 per cent. of all accidents involving motorcycles and 8 per cent. of all casualties to motorcycle riders and passengers but only accounted for less than 1 per cent. of fatal accidents and casualties. We have not made any other assessment of the impact on road safety of permitting 16-year-olds to drive mopeds.</p>
	<p pid="c.753W.5/15">We have no plans to consider raising the minimum age for riding a moped. Moped riders of all ages will benefit from the range of measures for improving the safety of all motorcycle users, as set out in &quot;The Government's Motorcycling Strategy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.753W.5/16">In addition, last year the Motorcycle Industry Association (MCIA) produced a DVD on moped safety &quot;Get the Message: Act Your Age&quot;, which is aimed at young moped riders. Manufacturers provide a free copy with all new mopeds. It has also been distributed to all secondary schools and local authority road safety officers, as part of MCIA's educational resource &quot;Links: connecting citizenship and Road User Education&quot;.</p>

However, the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) has included in Network Rail's licence a condition that limits NR's borrowing under the DIP to 90 per cent. of its regulatory asset base (RAB). If DIP debt reaches 85 per cent. of the RAB, Network Rail have to provide ORR with an action plan of how to reduce debt below this level.

	<p pid="c.764W.0/1">A sound basis of research to understand the implications of a changing climate is essential to drawing a climate change perspective into decision-making across the whole range of DEFRA's responsibilities. DEFRA's climate change research programme analyses the risk of human-induced climate change. It also assesses the potential impacts of climate change and our means of adaptation and mitigation.</p>
	<p pid="c.764W.0/2">DEFRA's committed spend to those research projects which have some relevance to climate change is given in the following table.</p>
	<table>

	<p pid="c.764W.0/15">In addition to spending on projects relating directly to climate change, the figures given in the table also include spending on projects of a cross-cutting nature where climate change may be of secondary importance but still has some relevance.</p>
	<p pid="c.764W.0/16">Details on all the climate change research funded by DEFRA can be found on the DEFRA website at:</p>
	<p pid="c.764W.0/17" class="indent"><a href="http://www2.defra.gov.uk/research/project_data/projects.asp?M=KWS">http://www2.defra.gov.uk/research/project_data/projects.asp?M=KWS</a>&amp;V==climate+change&amp;SUBMIT1=Search&amp;SCOPE=0</p>
	<p pid="c.764W.0/18">Research on climate change funded by DEFRA is assessed through peer-review where relevant both prior to commissioning and after completion. DEFRA staff routinely review the progress and outcome of projects, often with the assistance of independent steering committees. As part of these processes, value for money is evaluated throughout the lifetime of a research project and its translation into policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.764W.0/19">DEFRA also commissions periodic reviews of its research contracts. A technical and scientific review of the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) was carried out in 2005 to assess its performance and identify its priorities for the next five years. The review concluded that UKCIP is performing very effectively with the resources available and therefore represents good value for the current level of investment.</p>
	<p pid="c.764W.0/20">DEFRA's research budget includes support for the Hadley Centre, which it co-funds with MOD) (contributions of &pound;12.5 million and &pound;3.5 million respectively in 2005-06).</p>
	<p pid="c.764W.0/21">DEFRA and the Ministry of Defence have commissioned a major independent review of the activities of the Hadley Centre. This review is concerned with the scientific output and quality of the Hadley Centre's activities, as well as structure and engagement with external stakeholders. A final report is due to be published by the end of this month.</p>
	<p pid="c.764W.0/22">The UK Research Councils support a considerable amount of research that is both directly about climate change or is relevant to climate change. Taken together this is of the order of &pound;400 million over the five years. They have also invested over &pound;190 million over the same period into sustainable and future energy.</p>
	<p pid="c.764W.0/23">Research work of relevance to climate change is also undertaken and funded by the Department for International Development and the Department for Transport. In addition, the Department of Trade and Industry funds research into emerging low carbon technologies.</p>

This showed the strong links to a wide variety of partners as sources of unpaid work of which the main ones were the voluntary sector (45 per cent.), local authorities (38 per cent.), education (15 per cent.), faith groups (12 per cent.) and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (10 per cent.). The overall numbers add up to more than 100 per cent. as some projects fit more than one category.</p>

	<p pid="c.778W.2/1">Plans to establish new models for conditional cautioning were announced in the Respect Action Plan launched in January 2006. These new models involve the offender undertaking unpaid (reparative) work&mdash;to make good the damage they have caused to the local community that has suffered. In this way, offenders give something back to the community to repair the harm they have caused. The pilots are now starting in Durham, Lancashire, Merseyside, North Wales, South Yorkshire, Thames Valley and West Mercia, and will run until December 2007. A decision on whether to expand the scheme will be taken early next year.</p>

This network consists of 69 offices throughout the UK in the following proposed locations:</p>

	<p pid="c.780W.5/3">These offices will open in 2007 and the network will subsequently be used for the national identity scheme. Where the network of enrolment centres needs to be further expanded, we will first seek to use high street offices that are already used by central and local government. The extent to which this will be done and the offices involved will be determined following further analysis of the needs of the scheme. We will also look at options for the private sector providing outlets. The Authentication by Interview project for passports is working with local authorities to make use of their offices to provide remote interview facilities (via videoconferencing) for remote communities that are not near any of the 69 local interview offices.</p>

We are also committed to increasing the flexibility of the free entitlement so that it is more responsive to the needs of children and families.</p>
	<p pid="c.798W.3/3">In the context of the comprehensive spending review (CSR) work is ongoing to estimate the cost of the extensions to 15 and 20 hours, based on population and take-up data and current levels of funding. We are seeking to roll-out the extension to 15 hours gradually, starting with 20 pathfinder local authorities who will begin providing the 15 hours and greater flexibility from April this year. These pathfinders will provide crucial information on the practical local implications of the changes which will underpin national estimates of the cost of extending the entitlement and increasing its flexibility. Figures cannot be confirmed in advance of the Department's comprehensive spending review settlement and until we have these findings.</p>
	<p pid="c.798W.3/4">We have no plans to extend the free entitlement to 43 rather than 38 weeks, though some local authorities offer the current free entitlement over more than 38 weeks by providing access to fewer hours per week where this is what parents want for their children.</p>

	<p pid="c.799W.0/1">I announced in October 2006 the withdrawal of automatic fee remission from courses in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) from August 2007. This move follows significant growth in spend on ESOL, which tripled between 2001 and 2005. At the same time, however, learners from priority groups who need to improve their English skills for employability and integration are finding it increasingly difficult to access the help they need quickly. The change to fee remission policy will help us to focus limited resources on those learners who most need our support.</p>
	<p pid="c.799W.0/2">Those learners in receipt of benefits or on working tax credit will be eligible for full fee remission. However, the Government will continue to support the cost of learning for those who are asked for a contribution and will fund around 77 per cent. of the overall cost of learning. It is reasonable that where employers are benefiting from the opportunity to recruit in large numbers from outside the UK we should ask them to fund the full cost of English language learning and where employers seek training provision through programmes such as Train to Gain, ESOL costs will be considered as part of the overall package.</p>

	<p pid="c.800W.5/2">It is vital that we secure effective progression pathways for people looking to continue learning beyond level 3 either through further or higher education. Within their funding responsibilities, both the Learning and Skills Council and the Higher Education Funding Council for England have made important contributions to developing non-traditional pathways, particularly for people seeking to progress through the vocational route. Within our wider discussions with the funding councils about the future development of higher level skills and learning, we are considering whether there is a more effective way of organising responsibilities for funding the provision of non-prescribed higher education. Our further consideration of the issues will be set in the context of the changes needed to deliver the ambitions for higher level skills set out in the report from Lord Leitch on the UK's future skills needs. We have asked the two funding councils to work together to assess the issues relating to the current funding of higher level skills provision and to make appropriate recommendations. There are a number of complex issues to be considered and we do not expect to reach conclusions before the summer.</p>

	<p pid="c.805W.8/1">The Renewables Obligation (RO) is the Government's key policy for promoting renewable energy. Suppliers of electricity are obliged to supply an increasing percentage of electricity from renewable sources by surrendering Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) or pay a buy-out price. Those suppliers that surrender ROCs receive a share of the total buy-out fund. Co-firing of biomass in coal fired station is eligible for ROCs and suppliers can meet 10 per cent. obligation through co-firing. We are consulting on whether to remove the limit on co-firing in conjunction with banding the RO. Banding the RO will allow for technologies to be given more targeted levels of support through awarding multiple or fractional ROCs. Subject to assessment of responses to the consultation and passage of legislation, banding and removal of the co-firing cap could begin in April 2009.</p>

Support is also provided to electric vehicle projects. For example Modec has been awarded a Selective Finance for Investment in England grant of up to &pound;1.39 million to support the production of an electric delivery van with drivetrain developed by Zytek, a UK automotive technology company, using up to 85 per cent.

We welcome the fact that Ofgem is calling for the recent reductions in the wholesale price of gas to be passed on to consumers. Ofgem indicates, however, that there can be a time lag. Within this competitive market, individual pricing decisions are a matter for each of the energy companies, and the Government cannot direct Ofgem as to its approach on prices.</p>

	<p pid="c.809W.5/1">When the Low Carbon Buildings Programme Phase 1 was launched in April 2006, &pound;6.5 million was set aside to be allocated to the household stream over three years. Due to higher than anticipated demand, we announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-25">25 October 2006</phrase> that we would be re-allocating &pound;6.2 million of the total &pound;28.5 million funding to the household stream. This will give a total pot of &pound;12.7 million, which on projected demand levels should allow householder funding to continue until June 2008. By this time, some of our wider measures to promote microgeneration should be taking hold, and we believe the sector may have matured to a point where householder grants are no longer necessary.</p>

We believe eradication should be targeted where there is access to legal rural livelihoods, as set out in the Afghan government's National Drug Control Strategy. The Afghan government has yet to make a final decision on whether ground based spraying of poppy will be conducted in 2007. The UK supports the well-explained piloting of ground based spraying in areas of Afghanistan where the security situation permits, and if the Afghan government agrees, in order to assess its relative effectiveness compared to current eradication approaches. We judge that the risks of ground based spraying in Afghanistan to health and the environment are within acceptable levels. We continue to oppose aerial spraying, as does President Karzai.</p>

	<p pid="c.821W.8/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-01">1 May 1997</phrase> we have made numerous representations about the application of the death penalty. In that period, over 20 countries have abolished the death penalty for all crimes. As stated in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's 2006 Annual Human Rights Report we and the EU have lobbied in 2005-06, among other countries, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Botswana, Cameroon, China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Malawi, Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority, the Philippines, Republic of Korea, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, the US, Vietnam and Yemen. Since <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-01">1 May 1997</phrase>, we have lobbied most, if not all, countries which retain the death penalty in law. We have carried this out through multi-lateral and bilateral d&eacute;marches or dialogues, and through lobbying for co-sponsorship of resolutions in the Commission for Human Rights and at the United Nations General Assembly.</p>

	<p pid="c.822W.2/1">Reports suggest that Laurent Nkunda met with General John Numbi and other Congolese army representatives in early January. It is important for stability in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the region that the situation in North Kivu is resolved. We support the efforts of the Congolese Government to do so in a way that avoids causing further suffering to the population of North Kivu.</p>
	<p pid="c.822W.2/2">The UK continues to support the Congolese Government, the UN peacekeeping force in the DRC (MONUC), and other bilateral and multinational efforts to secure an end to the conflict and lasting peace in DRC. Successful elections for which the UK was the leading bilateral donor, were an important part of that process. The UK is actively supporting Congolese army reform, which is also crucial to the country's long-term security.</p>

	<p pid="c.827W.9/6">In a separate cycle of reviews, the WGB assesses all aspects of parties' implementation of the convention&mdash;from awareness-raising to administrative processes and legal enforcement. The &quot;phase 2&quot; report on the UK was published in March 2005. It commended a number of aspects of our anti-bribery framework, such as employee whistleblower protection, the ability of the tax authorities to make spontaneous disclosures of suspicious information to law enforcement agencies and the wide scope of the &quot;regulated sector&quot; in our anti-money-laundering reporting regime. The report also noted the Government's support provided to a range of private sector and civil society anti-corruption initiatives. In addition, the report made a number of recommendations for further action, for example in our awareness-raising efforts, on investigation and prosecution and on working with the Crown dependencies and overseas territories. In line with the standard procedure, the UK gave an oral progress report to the WGB in March 2006 and we will be submitting a written report in March this year. I will place a copy of this report in the Library of the House after the WGB plenary discussion in March.</p>

	<p pid="c.832W.5/1">We take every opportunity to press both Sudan and Chad to stop supporting each others' rebels and to fulfil their obligations under the Tripoli Agreement. Christopher Prentice, UK Ambassador-at-Large for the Sudanese Peace Process, stressed this to the Government of Sudan during his visit in December 2006. Our Permanent Representative to the UN in New York did the same with the Chadian Foreign Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-20">20 December 2006</phrase> in New York. Given the importance of this issue, we will continue to press both Governments on this matter.</p>

No central information is maintained and this information and the costs could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.842W.8/1">The UK made an application to the Commission which made the strongest possible case for renewal of this derogation. However, the Communication of <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-08">8 December 2006</phrase> (reference 16528/06 (Com(2006)743)), on the operation of private pleasure craft, confirmed that the Commission would not be submitting a proposal to the council for renewal of the derogation permitting the use of red diesel. The question of a vote on the issue did not therefore arise. The UK's position, including its assessment of the implications for regional policy, is set out in its application to the Commission for renewal of the derogation, and the Government's estimate of compliance and other costs is set out in the partial RIA published in March 2006. Both documents have been deposited in the Library of the House of Commons. Officials are in discussions with concerned and affected organisations to discuss how the new arrangements can be administered so as to minimise the compliance costs to businesses and individuals.</p>

	<p pid="c.847W.5/1">Central Government began receiving housing receipts in 2004-05. Before then, with-debt local authorities were required to set aside a proportion of their housing receipts. The receipts set-aside could only be used for the repayment of the authority's debt. From 2004-05 set-aside no longer applied to Right to Buy (RTB) receipts as the &quot;pooling&quot; regime was introduced to ensure fair distribution of receipts and investment across the country, whereby local authorities paid over or &quot;pooled&quot; a proportion of their housing receipts to the Secretary of State to support wider housing investment.</p>
	<p pid="c.847W.5/2">The proportion of the capital receipt set-aside or pooled is 75 per cent. for a dwelling and 50 per cent. for a non-dwelling asset. The local authority is free to use the remaining 25 per cent. or 50 per cent. respectively for any capital purpose they see fit.</p>
	<p pid="c.847W.5/3">Data formerly collected about amounts set-aside and data collected about the value of receipts pooled by the Secretary of State does not separately identify the value of the set-aside or pooled capital receipt derived from RTB disposals. The data cover all housing set aside/pooled receipts. These include receipts arising from the sales of vacant housing land, shops, community centres, and garages that are on estates owned by local authorities, and receipts arising from the sales of dwellings made under powers other than Right to Buy.</p>
	<p pid="c.847W.5/4">The following table shows total receipts set aside and pooled for the whole of Manchester, since the Department does not collect data for individual areas such as South Manchester; nor does it collect data on the amount of receipts retained by local authorities. The table also shows the amount of financial support Manchester has received for its capital expenditure programme. This does not include support to Registered Social Landlords who all have built new homes in Manchester. It also includes the amount of revenue subsidy Manchester receives for running its own housing stock. Pre 1995-96 data is available only at disproportionate cost.</p>

They have different estimated start and completion dates and there will, therefore, be different dates when the homes on each site will be placed on sale.</p>
	<p pid="c.850W.8/2">The start of work on each site will vary according to when issues such as detailed planning consent and contractual arrangements have been completed. The length of time it will take to complete each site also varies as they are of different scales.</p>

On top of that we will have also made &pound;3.7 billion available for ALMOs delivering improvements to council housing stock, and &pound;2.7 billion for PFI schemes by March 2008.

It is a guide for Housing Associations and their consultants. It is also the basis upon which the Corporation will assess HAs' performance on developing housing projects.

The accent is on accessibility and design features that make the home flexible enough to meet whatever comes along in life: a teenager with a broken leg, a family member with serious illness, or parents carrying in heavy shopping and dealing with a pushchair.</p>

	<p pid="c.866W.10/1">Sir David Clementi published his final report in December 2004. At that time, the Government confirmed that they broadly accepted Sir David's recommendations. In October 2005, the Government published their White Paper &quot;The Future of Legal Services: Putting Consumers First&quot;, which was essentially a substantive response to Sir David's final report. The Government subsequently introduced the Legal Services Bill to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-23">23 November 2006</phrase>. While the Bill contains much more detail when compared with Sir David's original report, the proposals for the most part are based on his blueprint for reform.</p>
	<p pid="c.866W.10/2">As part of reforming the regulatory framework for legal services in England and Wales, the Bill will make it possible for lawyers to provide their services in new ways. This will include lawyers forming partnerships or other business structures with other types of lawyers (eg solicitors and barristers) and with non-lawyers. External investment will also be possible. This will provide an opportunity for all firms to change their business structures to enable them to draw more effectively on non-legal expertise and external financing to modernise and improve their business systems and infrastructure. It could also provide smaller firms with new ways of reaching a wider consumer base, which could act as a means for those operating at the margins to become more efficient and compete more effectively with larger or more well established firms.</p>

	<p pid="c.874W.2/1">The only significant change to magistrates' training in the last 12 months is that in April 2006 the Lord Chief Justice assumed responsibility from the Lord Chancellor for magistrates' training.</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.2/2" class="indent">In 1997 each of the 42 Magistrates Courts Committees (MCC) in England and Wales were responsible for the training of magistrates in their area, subject to guidance from the Judicial Studies Board (JSB).</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.2/3" class="indent">In 1999 the &quot;Magistrates' New Training Initiative&quot; introduced a competence framework and appraisal scheme for all magistrates.</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.2/4" class="indent">In 2002 Bench Training and Development Committees (BTDC), were introduced by the &quot;Justices of the Peace (Size and Chairmanship of Bench) Rules 2002&quot; to replace the Bench Chairmanship Committee, with statutory responsibility for overseeing the training and appraisal of court chairmen plus a number of other training responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.2/5" class="indent">In 2003 the &quot;Magistrates National Training Initiative&quot; was introduced. This refined the competence framework for magistrates, set a training syllabus for magistrates in all their jurisdictions, recommended a standard national practice for the mentoring and appraisal of magistrates, and provided guidance to BTDCs on their training functions.</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.2/6" class="indent">In 2005 training became compulsory for magistrates before they were permitted to undertake certain functions, the Lord Chancellor was required to provide training material for those compulsory courses and the JSB assumed a strengthened role in magistrate training.</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.2/7" class="indent">The 2005 Rules also created Magistrates' Area Training Committees (MATC). MATCs are responsible for agreeing the annual training plan for magistrates in their area and monitoring and evaluating its implementation.</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.2/8" class="indent">In 2005 the JSB and Her Majesty's Courts Service (HMCS) agreed a &quot;Minimum Protocol for The Provision of Magistrates' Training&quot;. This ensures that HMCS provides sufficient resources to allow magistrates to fulfil their minimum training requirements. That Protocol is renegotiated annually.</p>

	<p pid="c.874W.5/1">Before being allowed to sit in court the newly appointed magistrate undertakes an initial training session of three hours to introduce him/her to the bench and its organisation. This is followed by a minimum of three days training covering such topics as the jurisdiction of magistrates; judicial decision making; case management and preliminary decisions; summary trial; evidence and determining guilt or innocence; sentencing, and enforcement of court orders. This training input is supplemented by court observations. In addition newly appointed magistrates are required to visit penal establishments and these visits are normally completed within the first year of sitting. The newly appointed magistrate's learning and development is supported by a mentor scheme. Approximately 12 months after beginning to sit in court he/she will attend a further 12 hours consolidation training. Following this an appraisal will take place to identify if the magistrate has any outstanding training needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.874W.5/2">Although training provision varies across different court areas in England and Wales in response to local training needs, all sitting magistrates are required to undertake a minimum of six hours training every three years. In addition magistrates are provided with extra initial and continuation training if they hold additional responsibilities, for example if they sit in the Youth Court or Family Proceedings Court. Additional training is also provided if there is major legislative change, for example to support the implementation of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

This is an independent guide, written by the mental health peer review panel. The LSC has facilitated the development, but is not a contributor. The LSC is working with the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies and peer reviewers to provide more appropriate wording. The LSC hopes to reissue an amended mental health guide in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="c.880W.3/2">Information about the sale of property to pay for residential care is not collected centrally. Local authorities also may not know if this has happened, for example where a person sells a property and arranges their care privately without involving social services. It is not, therefore, possible to estimate the number of homes that may have been sold for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="c.880W.3/3">However, the Government have taken steps to help people avoid having to sell their homes during their lifetime to pay for residential care. Since October 2001 councils have been able to enter into a deferred payments agreement. The aim is to allow people with property, but without income and other assets sufficient to meet their assessed financial contribution to the cost of residential care, to have a legal charge placed on their property to meet any shortfall. This gives people more options for meeting care home fees.</p>

Expenditure on carers has been interpreted to include the following: a. total carer's allowance expenditure; b. total income support expenditure who are entitled to income support by virtue of being a carer. People who are unemployed, lone parents or disabled and who also receive a carer premium are counted in column d. The figures quoted include people who were unemployed and entitled to income support prior to the introduction of income based jobseeker's allowance in October 1996; c. carer premium entitlement for people in receipt of income support (for people over 60 years of age) and pension credit; d. expenditure on the carer premium for carers who are on income support by virtue of being unemployed, lone parents or disabled.  2. Income support carer expenditure [(b) in the tables] has been estimated using caseload and average weekly amount data.  3. Pension credit and income support expenditure [(c) and (d) in the tables] has been estimated using caseloads and carer premium rates.  4. Carer premium expenditure has been quoted in full. It has not been reduced, or offset, by any income received by the beneficiary of the benefit.  5. The income support carer premium was introduced in October 1990. The first caseload information was collected in May 1991, so the income support expenditure quoted in the tables has been estimated using administration data for 1991-92.  6. All figures have been rounded to the nearest million pounds.  7. Expenditure is consistent with the 2006 pre-Budget report.  8. Carer's allowance replaced invalid care allowance on 1 April 2003.  9. Pension credit replaced income support, for people over 60 years of age, on 5 October 2003.  10.

	<p pid="c.884W.8/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the chief executive. He will write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.8/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="12006-01-15">15 January 12006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.8/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent parliamentary question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.8/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions two related questions:</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.8/5" class="indent">How many Child Support Agency cases were (a) outstanding and (b) unprocessed in (i) Yeovil and (ii) Somerset in each year since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.8/6" class="indent">How many Child Support Agency cases were (a) outstanding and (b) unprocessed in each year from 1997 to 2006 in (i) Somerset and (ii) Yeovil constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.8/7" class="indent">The agency begins to process new applications as soon as they are received and continues until they have been cleared. Any applications that have not yet been cleared can be regarded as outstanding. The amount of work required to achieve clearance and the elapsed time it involves varies considerably depending on, amongst other things, the circumstances of the parents and how readily they cooperate with the agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.8/8" class="indent">As such, the agency holds only a negligible number of completely unprocessed cases and it is not possible to allocate these to individual constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.8/9" class="indent">With regard to part (a), the agency can only provide the information requested for applications (both new and old scheme) operating on the new computer system (CS2). Therefore this is not representative of the overall trend and volumes of the total amount of uncleared applications at the geographical level requested. Please see the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.8/10" class="indent">It should be noted that there are always applications for which the agency cannot assign a county or a constituency, either because they had been received directly via Jobcentre Plus and had not reached the point in the process at which details on the constituency of the parent with care can be identified, or because the application is on the old computer system from which it is not possible to provide robust estimates at the geographical level requested. In September 2006, there were around 70,000 such applications.</p>
	<p pid="c.884W.8/11" class="indent">For future reference, it should be noted that information relating to the number of uncleared applications on the new computer system in September 2006 in each parliamentary constituency is publicly available, and can be found in table 27 of the September 2006 Child Support Agency 'Quarterly Summary of Statistics', a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library, or on the internet via the following link: <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/child_support/CSA_quarterly_sep06.asp">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/child_ support/CSA_quarterly_sep06 .asp</a></p>
	<p pid="c.884W.8/12" class="indent">Although the total volume of uncleared applications nationally across both schemes, 247,500 in September 2006, is the lowest since comparable records began, the agency recognises that this remains unacceptably high. The agency therefore has a 2006-07 target to ensure that, by march 2007, the volume of new scheme uncleared applications outstanding at March 2006 is reduced by 25 per cent. and our challenge, as set down in our operational improvement plan, is that the agency should not have a backlog in this area by March 2009. I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="c.887W.0/2">Having considered Sir David Henshaw's recommendation that the 12-month rule be removed to prevent parents from being able to approach the new organisation to overturn consent orders, we have decided that the 12-month rule should remain. This rule has a positive impact on the level of child maintenance in consent orders as it ensures maintenance is generally set at a substantial level that broadly reflects the child maintenance formula. It also ensures that parents will avoid being locked into the Court system indefinitely however their circumstances change. However the removal of the requirement for parents with care to be treated as applying to the Child Support Agency if they make a claim for benefit will ensure that fewer maintenance agreements are unnecessarily overturned against the wishes of both parents.</p>

	<p pid="c.894W.2/5" class="indent">Even if an applicant for benefit already has a national insurance number, he or she will be expected to provide confirmation of their identity as part of the claims process.</p>
	<p pid="c.894W.2/6" class="indent">At the initial interview the Financial Assessor will establish the customer's identity and, if applicable, their partner's identity. If the Financial Assessor has any concerns, they will request evidence to be provided to verify the identity of the customer, and would not allow the claim to proceed until they are satisfied of the customer's identity.</p>
	<p pid="c.894W.2/7" class="indent">Anyone who has arrived in the UK in the two years prior to making a benefit claim must prove they have a right to reside in the UK, as well as being habitually resident, before any claim is processed or payment made.</p>
	<p pid="c.894W.2/8" class="indent">In addition, a &quot;right to work&quot; condition has been introduced into the National Insurance Number allocation and decision-making process for employment-related applications. This was implemented in July and guidance has been issued to all Jobcentre Plus staff</p>
	<p pid="c.894W.2/9" class="indent">To support this, changes to Regulation 9 of the Social Security (Crediting and Treatment of Contributions and National Insurance Numbers) Regulations 2001 were laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-07">7 November 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.900W.2/1">Our first priority on taking office was dealing with the situation we inherited of pensioners already living in poverty. Since 1997 1 million pensioners have been lifted out of relative poverty thanks to measures like pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="c.900W.2/2">The White Paper &quot;Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system&quot; announced our commitment to secure these gains into the future by uprating both the basic state pension and the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit in line with earnings over the long-term.</p>
	<p pid="c.900W.2/3">Pension credit ensures that no pensioner need live on less than &pound;114.05 a week (&pound;174.05 for couples). The Department has a public service agreement performance target to: by 2008, be paying pension credit to at least 3.2 million pensioner households, while maintaining a focus on the most disadvantaged by ensuring that at least 2.2 million of these households are in receipt of the guarantee credit.</p>
	<p pid="c.900W.2/4">In the report &quot;A Sure Start to Later Life: Ending Inequalities for Older People&quot;, published in January 2006, the Department committed to look at wider definitions and indicators of pensioner poverty in the wake of recently commissioned research, and to consider with the Treasury how and whether these should feed into PSA targets as part of the 2007 comprehensive spending review.</p>
	<p pid="c.900W.2/5">We have set a public service agreement target to halve the number of children in relative low-income households between 1998-99 and 2010-11 on the way to eradicating child poverty by 2020. This latter is defined as:</p>
	<p pid="c.900W.2/6" class="indent">Halve the number of children in relative low income (below 60 per cent. of median income before housing costs); and</p>
	<p pid="c.900W.2/7" class="indent">Halve the number of children suffering a combination of material deprivation and relative low income (below 70 per cent. median income before housing costs)</p>
	<p pid="c.900W.2/8">We have also announced that we aim to make further progress so that there are fewer than 1 million children in absolute low income.</p>
	<p pid="c.900W.2/9">There are no explicit departmental targets regarding poverty among working age adults without children based on the 60 per cent. of median earnings definition. However we have set ourselves the ambitious target of achieving a 70 per cent. employment rate for lone parents by 2010. This is part of our overall aim of achieving 80 per cent. employment across the country. Hitting these targets will contribute towards reducing working age poverty.</p>

	<p pid="c.906W.0/1">A key part of the Government's package of proposed reforms is to make the state pension fairer and available to more people as soon as is practicable. This means addressing women's lower state pension outcomes as soon as possible and is why we are planning to introduce the reduction in qualifying years for all those reaching state pension age from 2010. The effect of this is to ensure around three quarters of women reaching state pension age in 2010 would achieve a full basic state pension, compared to just 30 per cent. today.</p>
	<p pid="c.906W.0/2">This approach does however mean that two people with similar contribution histories reaching state pension age either side of <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-06">6 April 2010</phrase> will have their state pension entitlement calculated differently and this could produce different outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.906W.0/3">Changes could be made more gradually to avoid this situation, for example, by phasing in the reduction in years needed for a full basic state pension and we have explored different way to do this.</p>
	<p pid="c.906W.0/4">Smoothing the reduction of qualifying years from 2010 would delay the substantial improvement in women's basic state pension outcomes for some years beyond 2010. Phasing the reduction in qualifying years before 2010 would give some women the advantage of both a lower state pension age of 60 and the benefit of these reforms. However the reforms are introduced there will be some people who reach state pension age on the wrong side of the chosen date or the series of dates chosen to phase in the reduction of qualifying years.</p>
	<p pid="c.906W.0/5">It is a difficult balance. Our intention in opting for a 2010 introduction is to improve the pension position of as many women and carers as possible and as quickly as possible while keeping the reforms within the fiscal envelope.</p>
	<p pid="c.906W.0/6">We are unable to provide the information in respect of the particular phasing options you have set out in the time available.</p>

	<p pid="c.918W.6/2">The authorities will be under a statutory duty to establish LINks to specified standards, with guidance to ensure consistency between authorities.

The use of the grant will also come under the scrutiny of the Audit Commission.</p>

	<p pid="c.919W.5/1">The population figure used to calculate funding for the Milton Keynes primary care trust (PCT) was 228,793 in 2006-07 and 231,410 in 2007-08. For both years the number of prisoners used was 218, but this figure is subtracted from the population totals. Prisoners are regarded as usually resident in a prison if they have served six months or more of a custodial sentence. This data is provided to the Department by the Office for National Statistics, which receives it from the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="c.919W.5/2">Funding for health care within prisons is currently calculated and provided separately from general PCT allocations. The phased transfer of funding from HM Prison Service to PCTs was accompanied by a growth in revenue&mdash;meaning that whereas &pound;118 million was transferred in 2002-03, by 2006-07 investment reached nearly &pound;200 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.919W.5/3">Throughout this period of staged budget increases, allocations to those PCTs which have a prison in their area were calculated using a fair shares formula, constructed independently to tackle funding anomalies and take into account the type of prison, its size, the number of receptions, market forces factors and baseline budget. From 2006-07, simple percentage increases to these allocations will apply. For 2007-08, Milton Keynes will receive &pound;3.264 million to fund prison health services, in addition to its general allocation of &pound;277.9 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.924W.0/1">North Bristol NHS Trust first reported a cumulative deficit of &pound;4.2 million in 2001-02, which increased to &pound;48.8 million in 2002-03. In the subsequent three financial years the trust has recovered &pound;3.9 million, and therefore the cumulative deficit remaining to be recovered at the end of 2005-06 is &pound;44.9 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.924W.0/2">The timescale for the recovery of deficits by NHS trusts is determined by the statutory breakeven duty, which states that a cumulative deficit must be recovered in the subsequent two years following the first year in which a cumulative deficit position is reported. It is the responsibility of the strategic health authorities (SHA) to work with NHS organisations in their local health economies and agree a recovery plan that phases the recovery of deficits over a number of years. By exception, the SHA can agree an extension to the recovery period to four years in line with an agreed recovery plan. At the end of 2005-06 North Bristol NHS Trust had been in a cumulative deficit position for five years and is therefore in breach of its statutory duty.</p>
	<p pid="c.924W.0/3">The Department cannot simply write off historical deficits. The Department, and, consequently, the NHS, have to live within an agreed level of resources in each financial year. This level is set by HM Treasury and voted by Parliament. In order for the system as a whole to balance, a deficit in one organisation has to be matched by a surplus elsewhere. Deficits therefore must be repaid so that the resources can be returned to the organisations that generated the offsetting surpluses.</p>

In advance of the transfer, a review of waiting restrictions was carried out throughout the city. As a consequence, amendments to some waiting restrictions were introduced to facilitate residents where the restriction was deemed no longer appropriate or necessary. I can also advise that we are considering further changes in the Strand Road area with a view to providing additional space for short term parking. If there is any particular location where you would wish Roads Service to undertake a review of the current restrictions, I would ask you to contact the local traffic engineer, Keith Cradden, telephone 028 7132 1653, who will consider the issue.</p>

	<p pid="c.937W.2/1">The Government's vision is to see improved standards of building in Northern Ireland which will lead to a reduction in greenhouse gases by encouraging energy efficiency and increasing the use of renewable energy technologies. An amendment to the relevant part of the Northern Ireland Building Regulations came into operation on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-30">30 November</phrase> requiring all building, whether public or private, to demonstrate improved energy performance and reduced carbon dioxide emissions. These requirements, which are continually under review, will be enhanced by implementing provisions of the EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings, which, under new regulations to be introduced next year to promote greater awareness of energy performance, will require the production of an energy performance certificate whenever a building is constructed, sold or rented out.</p>
	<p pid="c.937W.2/2">The Sustainable Development Strategy for Northern Ireland, which the Secretary of State launched in May 2006, requires the Government estate to be carbon neutral by 2015. Progress towards this objective will be supported by the Achieving Excellence in Construction Initiative, which requires procurement and investment decisions to be based on whole lifecycle costing underpinned by sustainability assessments. Further, from <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March 2007</phrase> all Departments and district councils will be under a statutory duty to act in the way best calculated to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="c.937W.2/3">From 2007-08, part of the Government office estate will be managed by a private sector partner under the Workplace 2010 programme. The contract governing this arrangement will stipulate that the buildings involved must meet appropriate standards of energy and environmental management. This will produce a better use of space and increased energy efficiency, resulting in a significant reduction in our carbon footprint.</p>

	<p pid="c.942W.2/1">In Northern Ireland section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 requires public authorities to have due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity and regard to the desirability of promoting good relations. These duties ensure that equality issues, including gender, are integral to the whole range of public policy decision making. Public authorities, such as the Northern Ireland Office (NIO), are required to submit Equality Schemes to the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and to carry out impact assessments of their policies in certain circumstances.</p>

The NIO Equality Scheme, approved by the Northern Ireland Equality Commission in November 2001, sets out how the Department proposed to fulfil those duties with regard to all of its policies and functions. In 2006 the NIO conducted a comprehensive review of the operation of the scheme during its first five years and this report was submitted to the Equality Commission in July 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.948W.2/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="c.948W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. D M McKibbin dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-15">15 January 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.948W.2/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a parliamentary question regarding how much was paid by the Department for Regional Development Roads Service to National Car Parks (NCP) under the contract to enforce car parking restrictions in the most recent period for which figures are available; what performance indicators apply under that contract; how those indicators are <i> (a)</i> measured and <i> (b)</i> monitored; and what the maximum annual amount payable w NCP is under the terms of the contract.</p>
	<p pid="c.948W.2/4" class="indent">As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.948W.2/5" class="indent">I can advise that to date, no payment has been made by Roads Service to National Car Parks Ltd (NCP) in relation to the contract for the operation of parking and enforcement services as no invoice has been submitted.</p>
	<p pid="c.948W.2/6" class="indent">Performance measurement and monitoring is on the basis of 31 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which relate to the quality of the service being provided (see Annex A). These KPIs relate to all aspects of work covered by the contract and are not solely related to the enforcement of parking restrictions. They cover such items as the level of deployment of traffic attendants, training, quality of information recorded, car park management and cash collection. There are no KPIs related to the number of penalty charge notices (PCNs) issued.</p>
	<p pid="c.948W.2/7" class="indent">Given the wide scope of the KPIs, different methods are required to measure and monitor performance. For example, deployment levels are measured through payroll records and can be independently monitored from reports produced by Roads Service. Quality of information recorded will be analysed by examining the number of PCNs cancelled due to traffic attendant (TA) error.</p>
	<p pid="c.948W.2/8" class="indent">The contract includes for the management of Roads Service's off-street charged car parks and the enforcement of parking restrictions. If NCP provides the appropriate level of service as measured against the KPIs, under the terms of the contract, the maximum annual amount payable to them will be &pound;8,848,698.38. This sum includes the maximum performance related payment, and refers to the full service to be provided by NCP, not just enforcement of parking restrictions.</p>

	<p pid="c.950W.3/1">The following actions are taken in cases where persons who claim to be entitled to free prescriptions are subsequently found not to be:</p>
	<p pid="c.950W.3/2" class="indent">(i) A letter is issued to the person requesting payment of the health charge within 14 days if they accept they were not entitled to a free prescription;</p>
	<p pid="c.950W.3/3" class="indent">(ii) If payment is not made within 14 days then a further letter is issued requiring payment of the health charge within 28 days to include a penalty charge of five times the health charge up to a maximum of &pound;100;</p>

	<p pid="c.950W.3/6">During the 2005-06 financial year, from the sample of claims examined by the Counter Fraud Unit, some 3,202 individuals who had claimed to be entitled to free prescriptions were subsequently found not to be so entitled. Restitution was made in all of these cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.950W.3/7">The following payments were made by the individuals concerned:</p>
	<p pid="c.950W.3/8" class="indent">2,601 paid the relevant statutory prescription charge;</p>
	<p pid="c.950W.3/9" class="indent">405 paid the relevant statutory prescription charge and a fixed penalty charge;</p>

	<p pid="c.950W.3/11">During the same period, in addition to the above, 179 cases were referred through the Small Claims Court and the appropriate Court Decree obtained.</p>
	<p pid="c.950W.3/12">As a result of these and other actions, the overall level of prescription exemption fraud in Northern Ireland has fallen from an estimated &pound;14.7 million in 1999-2000 to &pound;7.6 million in 2005-06. Over the same period, the estimated fraud rate has reduced from 8.14 per cent. to 4.63 per cent. While the level of fraud continues to fall it is still a significant loss, which we intend to reduce further. The introduction of a major IT system, which will provide prescription information (including exemptions claimed by patients) in electronic format, will assist in this task. The new system will enable greater levels of checking and action against those who claim but are not entitled to free prescriptions.</p>
