	<p pid="a.2191W.3/1">The UK was one of the world's first countries to introduce late payment legislation in November 1998. It provides all businesses with the right to claim interest for the late payment of commercial debt, and where there are no pre-agreed payment terms, the legislation provides that the payment period is 30 days from the later of either delivery of goods or receipt of invoice.</p>
	<p pid="a.2191W.3/2">Over half of UK business transactions are not covered by pre agreed payment terms so we are also equipping business to better manage customer relationships and cash flow management through a series of guides developed in partnership with the Institute of Credit Management, the CBI, IoD, FSB, FPB and BCC.</p>

	<p pid="a.2204W.9/4" class="indent">(a) The Central Office of Information (COI) does not hold office parties funded by the organisation, other than those listed below.</p>
	<p pid="a.2204W.9/5" class="indent">An event in the summer is held to coincide with the publication of the Annual Report and Accounts to review the year's activity and to acknowledge any outstanding contributions from staff during the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.2204W.9/7" class="indent">The cost of these events is in line with guidance issued by the HMRC. This guidance states that no more than &pound;150 per person, per year should be spent on such events. In the last 12 months COI spent &pound;42.82 per person.</p>
	<p pid="a.2204W.9/8" class="indent">(b) The COI do not pay a corporate bonus to its employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.2204W.9/9" class="indent">COI paid eligible staff a non-consolidated performance pay award for the 2008/9. This amounted to 5.36% of the regular monthly salary.</p>

	<p pid="a.2208W.8/2">The Government have been exploring the possibility of improving the clarity of labelling of produce from the West Bank. Earlier this year, the Cabinet Office held a meeting with a group of interested parties to discuss the possibility of introducing some voluntary guidance, so that consumers could better understand which products came from occupied Palestinian territories. The Government are carefully considering the next steps following that discussion.</p>

We will be reviewing the take-up of accessible housing standards, such as Lifetime Homes Standards, across all sectors in 2010. We will decide at that time whether further measures may be required to increase the supply of accessible and adaptable properties in new build housing. In the meantime, we continue to promote the Lifetime Homes Standards as a part of the Code for Sustainable Homes where they are currently mandatory at Code level 6.</p>

	<p pid="a.2221W.6/1">Our priority is to get new equipment to the front line as quickly as possible for use by personnel facing the greatest danger. However, we look to ensure that whenever possible new equipment is also provided for troops during pre-deployment training so that they can use it safely and effectively on arrival in theatre. In practice, where shortfalls occur due to prioritising equipment to the front line, sufficient equipment is still made available for training to ensure personnel meet the minimum safety and operating standards. We have recently introduced measures to reinforce this, and all Urgent Operational Business cases now include a clear requirement that sufficient numbers of pre-deployment vehicles are procured and delivered for training before they are deployed operationally.</p>

The rock groyne and rock face of the sea wall were found to be in good repair. The defences are designed to provide those living and working in the area with a 1 in 200 year standard of protection, a 0.5 per cent. chance of flooding in a year. This is the standard level of protection to which new sea defences are constructed.</p>

	<p pid="a.2230W.6/1">The <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-20">20 August 2009</phrase> Presidential and Provincial Council elections in Afghanistan were the first Afghan-run elections for over 30 years. That the insurgents were unable to disrupt this important day is a tribute to the Afghan National Security Forces and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's International Security Assistance Force. The Afghan people want and deserve the right to decide the future of their country and we and the international community are committed to helping them achieve this. Credible elections, that represent the will of the people, demonstrate that the Afghan Government have the authority to rule.</p>
	<p pid="a.2230W.6/2">We and the rest of the international community are following the elections result process closely. There have been allegations of fraud but it is important that we wait for the Election Complaints Commission to complete their investigation processes into allegations of fraud, and for the election observation missions to report their conclusive findings. In this intervening period, we call on all parties to exercise patience and respect the process for which so many Afghans made their support clear on polling day.</p>
	<p pid="a.2230W.6/3">The UN, the relevant Afghan authorities and international observation missions have taken every possible measure to prevent fraud. The Afghan Independent Election Commission, the UN and the international community worked hard to ensure that there was a level playing field for candidates, and that these elections could be as credible and inclusive as possible. Multiple safeguards such as photographs and fingerprints were in place to minimise fraudulent registration and voting.</p>
	<p pid="a.2230W.6/4">There were over 400 international observers on the ground, including 100 from the EU. 7,000 independent monitors were also registered with the Independent Electoral Commission by the Afghan Free and Fair Elections Association. The UK has helped fund election observation missions and 23 of our staff participated in the EU observation mission.</p>

	<p pid="a.2231W.8/2">This guidance includes the identification of possible signs of torture and mistreatment, as well as the procedures to be adopted in such circumstances. The first step when a British national is detained overseas is to seek and secure access by our consular staff. Our staff are instructed to ask our nationals whether they have suffered abuse or mistreatment, and to look out for signs of mistreatment even where an individual does not raise it. They are required to follow up all reports of mistreatment whether they come from the individual themselves, from their friends, family or representatives, or from other sources. What form this follow up action will take will depend on the individual circumstances of the case. Most obviously, we can raise our concerns with the relevant authorities. Whatever action we take the objective remains the same: to end the mistreatment, and have the incident investigated and the perpetrators of any abuse brought to justice.</p>

	<p pid="a.2234W.2/1">Since 2004 there have been a number of ministerial visits to Libya made by Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Ministers: two in 2004, one in 2005, two in 2006, one in 2007, one in 2008 and two in 2009. During the same period, Ministers from Libya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs have visited the UK for meetings with their UK counterparts on a number of occasions: one in 2004, three in 2008 and six in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.2234W.2/2">Ministerial discussions since 2004 have covered the full range of UK-Libyan bilateral relations, including co-operation in the fields of security, trade, at UN and with the African Union: as well as, visas, consular matters and the safety, security and wellbeing of FCO officials and their families living and working in Tripoli.</p>
	<p pid="a.2234W.2/3">There is no central record of the number of official overseas visits made by FCO officials to Libya. However officials from various parts of the FCO, both in the UK and overseas, visit Libya regularly in the course of their official duties. Senior officials hold an annual meeting with Libyan Government officials which alternates between Tripoli and London. No senior officials meeting has taken place in 2009. Issues discussed since 2004 covered the full range of UK-Libyan bilateral relations.</p>

	<p pid="a.2234W.5/1">When consular staff from our High Commission in Islamabad first visited them in prison on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-29">29 July 2004</phrase>, Mr Naheem Hussain and Mr Rehan Zaman raised allegations that they had been mistreated while in initial police custody. This was reported back to London. We failed to seek an explicit view at the time from them as to whether they wanted us to raise their concerns with the local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.2234W.5/2">Staff in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London subsequently advised the High Commission in Islamabad to seek such a view on their next visit to Mr Hussain and Mr Zaman. However, once it was realised that this would not be until October 2004&mdash;prison visits to British nationals in Pakistan are usually done on a three monthly cycle&mdash;a decision was taken to seek their view via their lawyer which we did in early September 2004. As the right hon. Member will be aware, their lawyer subsequently confirmed that they did not want the matter raised with the local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.2234W.5/3">It should not have taken five weeks from our first visit to Mr Hussain and Mr Zaman to obtain their view. Our consular guidance has developed since 2004 and we have taken steps to ensure such a delay would not happen now. This has included giving clear guidance to our consular staff both overseas and in London that where we have reason to believe a British national has been mistreated in detention overseas, this should be raised urgently with the relevant authorities. Our immediate objective in these cases is to have the allegations investigated and, if there is a possibility that mistreatment is continuing, to ensure that it is stopped. By reacting promptly in this way we also hope to deter abuse in future cases.</p>

The pre-candidacy spending limit will operate in the same way as the limit on post-dissolution candidate expenses. In order to be regulated by either limit, spending must be: (i) used during the relevant regulated period; (ii) on one of the matters listed in part 1 of Schedule 4A of the Representation of the People Act 1983; and (iii) used for the purposes of the individual's election.</p>

	<p pid="a.2263W.0/1">The information requested is not centrally available and could be collated only by manual checking with individual establishments, which would incur disproportionate cost. However, Prison Service Order 4460 (Prisoners' Pay), a copy of which has been placed in the House Library, sets out minimum rates of prisoner pay which includes allowance levels for unemployment and for work (enabling prisoners to obtain life skills), education and other duties or activities. The PSO sets a minimum unemployed rate of &pound;2.50 per week and an employed rate of pay of &pound;4.00 per week. However Governors have devolved authority to set rates of pay for their particular establishment and these will reflect the particular regime priorities of their establishment.</p>

	<p pid="a.2266W.8/1">The figures requested are available for 2008-09 and 2009-10 only and are shown in tables.</p>
	<p pid="a.2266W.8/2">Employment is known to be a key factor in helping to reduce re-offending. The Government's aim therefore is to improve the quantity and quality of offender learning to provide more offenders with the skills and motivation to turn away from crime, improve their employability, and become productive members of society.</p>
	<p pid="a.2266W.8/3">NOMS is actively engaging with employers to create employment opportunities for offenders both in prison and on release. The Government are committed to expanding this programme significantly.</p>
	<p pid="a.2266W.8/4">The Government recognise the contribution that having a stable home makes to the rehabilitation of offenders and the reduction of re-offending. The National Offender Management Service is working in partnership with other Government Departments, local authorities and housing providers to deliver public service agreement (PSA) 16, which includes a commitment to raising the proportion of offenders under the supervision of the probation service that are in suitable and stable accommodation at the end of their supervision.</p>
	<p pid="a.2266W.8/5">Performance against employment targets in 2009-10 has shown a decline compared to 2008-09, but this must be seen in the context of the economic downturn. The current economic climate has exacerbated the disadvantages already faced by offenders in the jobs market. However, we remain committed to maximising employment opportunities for offenders and we are working with probation areas to ensure they retain their focus on performance.</p>

	<p pid="a.2274W.8/1">Probation Officers in the National Offender Management Service are trained to undertake a comprehensive assessment of all sexual offenders prior to sentence, using evidence based assessment tools, including Risk Matrix 2000 which has been designed specifically to assess the likelihood of reconviction for a sexual offence. The assessments are used to create a risk management plan for the offender, and, if online offending was assessed to be likely, this would be addressed in the risk management plan. For the most serious sexual offenders, the risk assessment and risk management will be undertaken within the context of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA). Within MAPPA, the Police Probation and Prison Services work together to assess and manage the risks presented by the most serious sexual offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.2274W.8/2">For sexual offenders subject to licensed release from custody, licence conditions may prohibit them from, for example, using the internet or may exclude them from places where they might pose a risk of harm to children. If they breach their licence conditions, they are liable to be recalled to custody. In addition, the most high risk offenders will be required to reside in approved premises on release from custody. In approved premises, offenders are subject to strict conditions of residence and additional monitoring.</p>
	<p pid="a.2274W.8/3">The National Offender Management Service provides guidance, in the form of prison service orders, instructions and manuals, to prison and probation staff to ensure sex offenders do not pose a danger to children while in custody. In addition, specific training and support is given to staff who deliver sex offender treatment programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.2277W.9/1">The charges were suspended on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-21">21 July 2009</phrase> for about six hours between the busy rush hour periods due to the failure of the crossing's standby generator during the power cut. As the traffic counting systems also failed we have no measure of the traffic flows but staff on site reported light flows below normal expected levels. The operator considered that flows in the area were lighter because a significant part of the local network including shopping centres and businesses did not have power to operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.2277W.9/2">There was some congestion around 10.30am as the systems failed and the operator switched to manual charge collection.</p>
	<p pid="a.2277W.9/3">The crossing was operated manually with staff placed in each lane to control traffic and the additional staffing helped to ensure that there were no significant incidents that would have disrupted traffic in the toll plazas.</p>
	<p pid="a.2277W.9/4">The effect on journey times, congestion and pollution cannot be measured but the light traffic levels combined with additional staffing levels operating the crossing appears to have avoided significant delays and stationary traffic.</p>

	<p pid="a.2285W.8/1">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) takes all instances of suspected fraud seriously and is stepping up its work in this area. The Department is increasing its use of data matching using information from a wide variety of sources to identify those who attempt to abuse the system. HMRC also shares intelligence and investigates cases jointly with other Government agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.2285W.8/2">Those who are caught may face prosecution or in less serious cases, being charged a penalty and interest in addition to repaying the amount they defrauded.</p>
	<p pid="a.2285W.8/3">To help prevent fraud from occurring in the first place, child benefit customers must provide HMRC with documentary evidence of the child being claimed for, such as a birth certificate, adoption certificate or passport.</p>
	<p pid="a.2285W.8/4">All claims for child benefit are then subject to a wide range of checks throughout the life of each claim. It would be inappropriate to disclose a complete list as to do so may provide assistance to those attempting to defraud the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.2285W.8/5">Details of suspected benefit fraud can be reported to the National Benefit Fraud Hotline (0800 854 440), the Child Benefit Helpline (0845 302 1444) or the tax credits Helpline (0845 300 3900).</p>

The stocks of live unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus.

Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open.<br/> 6. To provide a geographic breakdown, in most cases the postcode of the vacancy is used to allocate the vacancy to a local area. Where this is missing or invalid, the employers' postcode or the postcode of the local Jobcentre Plus office is used.<br/> 7.

	<p pid="a.2292W.2/3">The effects of the NMW on younger workers need to be considered carefully to avoid damaging incentives between education and work and ensure the employment prospects of younger workers are not adversely affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.2292W.2/4">We know that young workers experience substantially worse unemployment and employment rates than adults. Both are more sensitive to the economic cycle. That is why the Low Pay Commission recommended a separate youth rate from the outset in 1999 and continues to believe there is a case for retaining them. Government and the LPC are concerned that removing the youth rates could adversely affect employment levels for this group. Earlier this year, the LPC recommended that 21-year-olds be entitled to the adult minimum wage. We have accepted this recommendation but, given the current economic conditions, stated that this change will be implemented from October 2010.</p>
