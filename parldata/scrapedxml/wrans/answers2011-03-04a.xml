	<p pid="a.608W.9/1">Inshore Fisheries Conservation Authorities (IFCAs) are made up of representatives from the constituent local authorities (who provide funding for the IFCA) along with people from across the different sectors that use or are knowledgeable about the inshore marine area, such as commercial and recreational fishermen, environmental groups and marine researchers, who offer their time voluntarily. The exercise to recruit these people known as appointees was a significant recruitment process carried out last year by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) working with DEFRA and Capita. The exercise generated considerable interest around the country and was delivered in line with the Nolan principles of public appointments. A total of 341 applications were received of which 283 candidates were interviewed and 111 appointments made to the 10 IFCAs around the country. All appointees were selected on merit against three main criteria set out in the information sent out to all candidates:</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.9/2" class="indent">An active interest and involvement in the local community;</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.9/3" class="indent">A passion for making a positive difference in the local area;</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.9/4" class="indent">Excellent communication, influencing and participation skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.9/5">Not all of the Sea Fisheries Committee appointees who applied around the country were successful in being appointed to the local IFCA. If candidates were not successful it was because other applicants in the same category scored higher in the discussion interviews. In the example of the Kent and Essex IFCA, the MMO was asked to appoint nine appointees to cover all of the disciplines and three appointees from the commercial fishing sector were appointed.</p>
	<p pid="a.608W.9/6">The IFCAs will be undertaking a broader range of issues and duties when they replace sea Fisheries Committees and it is not possible for a spokesman from individual associations or industry groups to be appointed. I am sure however that the Sea Fisheries Committee and the IFCA going forwards will wish to maintain close links and discussions with the local cockle industry since the Thames Estuary Cockle Fishery Regulating Order forms an important part of the fisheries management and enforcement work. The quarterly meetings are also open to the public and there is no reason that industry representatives cannot attend these meetings to hear the business that is being discussed.</p>

Hampden Park is currently a FIFA and UEFA compliant football stadium and meets the criteria for holding international and domestic football matches. Therefore, we do not expect any structural changes to be made to the stadium in order to stage these matches, although the sponsor branding will be changed to use the London 2012 dressing.</p>
	<p pid="a.613W.3/2">Three countries have confirmed that they will use facilities in Scotland as Pre-London 2012 Games Training Camps. The British Swimming Team will use the Royal Commonwealth Pool (RCP) in Edinburgh, which is currently undergoing a refurbishment for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games and will be completed in time so that it can act as a pre-London 2012 Games training facility. Namibia and Zambia will use The Palace for Art Centre for Sports Excellence-Scotstoun Leisure Centre in Glasgow. The venue is already in use and will also be staging squash and table tennis competitions at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games. As both the RCP and Scotstoun Leisure Centre are already equipped for use no changes are required apart from London 2012 branding being used when teams are training.</p>

A further 3,230,000 cubic metres is expected from existing facilities from now until the end of their life. The inventory has recently been assessed and an updated UK Radioactive Waste Inventory, will be published shortly by the NDA. The strategy for the Management of Solid Low Level Radioactive Waste from the UK Nuclear Industry sets out how the waste hierarchy should be implemented in LLW management.</p>
	<p pid="a.618W.2/2">Decommissioning LLW will only arise in large quantities as redundant facilities are demolished in the future. The management of this material will be continuously optimised as it arises, in line with the waste hierarchy. Most operational LLW currently goes to the Low Level Waste Repository (LLWR) in Cumbria, some is disposed of at its point of arising and small amounts are also disposed of to some specific landfills, approximately 14,000 cubic metres of LLW being sent to specified landfills in 2010. LLW Repository Ltd, the site licence company who operate the LLWR in Cumbria, is currently undertaking a review of the capacity of the Repository as part of the Environmental Safety Case process which, once complete in May 2011, will help determine the amount of low level waste that could be disposed of via this route.</p>

	<p pid="a.618W.5/2">The LLWR recently opened a new vault (Vault 9) that, is currently licensed for storage, pending permissioning as a disposal facility, once the Environmental Safety Case has been approved by the Environment Agency (EA). Vault 9 together with developments at Dounreay is expected to provide the UK with sufficient LLW waste disposal capacity for at least 10 years. This vault alone will not accommodate all the anticipated future arisings of decommissioning LLW, so further extensions may be required. The life of Vault 9 (and indeed the LLWR overall), will be greatly extended through application of the waste hierarchy and recycling and reuse of suitable material. This approach is outlined in the UK Strategy for the Management of Solid Low Level Radioactive Waste from the Nuclear Industry, published in August 2010. The Environmental Safety Case will determine what the ultimate capacity of the LLWR site could be.</p>
	<p pid="a.618W.5/3">Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd are planning to construct disposal vaults adjacent to the site to ensure the safe, long-term management of 175,000 cubic metres of LLW arising from decommissioning of the site. Construction work will begin in autumn 2011 and, subject to regulatory consent, the facility is scheduled to operate from 2014 to 2025.</p>

	<p pid="a.619W.2/2">A number of landfill sites around the UK currently accept small disposals of very low level waste (VLLW) from hospitals and other non-nuclear industries. Only some of these sites are currently permitted to accept greater volumes of VLLW and LLW from the nuclear industry; the largest being Clifton Marsh in Lancashire. Clifton Marsh has been accepting waste for disposal since 1986, under authorisations held by the waste producers. The overall capacity of the site is around 9 million cubic metres, but only 10% of this will be LLW, with the remainder being everyday household and commercial waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.619W.2/3">Some landfill sites are currently going through the process of seeking permission to accept LLW, in line with the UK Strategy for the Management of Solid Low Level Radioactive Waste from the Nuclear Industry. This process requires the operator to obtain an Environmental Permit (in England and Wales) or a Radioactive Substances Authorisation (in Scotland) and relevant planning permission. Planning permission may or may not require amendment for an existing landfill site.</p>

	<p pid="a.628W.3/2">It is our intention that the area off the Suffolk coast where ship-to-ship transfers are monitored by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) under existing arrangements will be formally recognised as the 'permit area' for ship-to-ship transfers in forthcoming secondary legislation. This area off Suffolk has, for several years now, been the only location in UK jurisdiction where the MCA allows ship-to-ship transfers (other than those in a harbour authority area) to be carried out. These waters are recognised by the MCA and by the industry as a suitable area for carrying out ship-to-ship transfers on navigational safety grounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.3/3">Consequently:</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.3/4" class="indent">as the activity will take place in the same waters as at present, we anticipate that the same benefit to the local economy, which is currently experienced in that part of East Anglia, will continue and we do not anticipate any significant change in the level of shipping traffic off the coast of East Anglia;</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.3/5" class="indent">while we are aware of the risks of collisions involving a ship on its way to, engaged in or on its way from a ship-to-ship transfer operation, we do not anticipate that the formal recognition in the legislation that these are the waters where ship-to-ship transfers are allowed will increase that risk;</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.3/6" class="indent">whereas currently there are no regulations in force governing ship-to-ship transfers, and the MCA's application system, instructions and guidelines function without the backing of legal sanctions, under the forthcoming secondary legislation the MCA will have legal sanctions to ensure that ship-to-ship transfers are conducted to a high standard with regard to maritime safety and the protection of the marine and coastal environment;</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.3/7" class="indent">the MCA monitors ship-to-ship transfer activity in the waters off the Suffolk coast, and is consequently aware of the relationship between levels of shipping traffic in these waters and incidences of collisions between vessels. We are also aware of the data contained in the Marine Accident Investigation Branch's report on the collision between mt Saetta and mt Conger published in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.632W.15/1">The Government recognises the significant contribution that smallholder farm production can make to improving food security in Africa. We draw on assessments by international agencies such as the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation and African regional organisations in planning how our interventions should address food security needs. For example, in Ethiopia, a DFID co-funded programme ensures that 8 million smallholders previously dependent on emergency aid are now food sufficient and can maintain their livelihoods. The Government is a strong supporter of Africa's own initiative, the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). The Programme's goal is to contribute to the elimination of hunger and reduce poverty and many of its activities involve helping smallholder farmers, both directly to help increase their productivity, and indirectly for example by improving their access to markets.</p>

UK Forces operate in Afghanistan as part of a wider NATO effort and assets are assigned based on task not nationality. Accordingly, the UK will routinely make use of other nations' assets and vice versa. However, since December 2010, this has included UK troops in theatre utilising heavy lift assets including aircraft, trucks and cranes belonging to Denmark, Slovakia and the United States.</p>

	<p pid="a.640W.2/1">As part of the strategic defence and security review, it was announced that there would be a reduction in the number of airframes the RAF would be operating in future. This included the early withdrawal from service of the Harrier fleet, a reduction in the number of Tornado aircraft and the cancellation of the Nimrod MRA4. As a result of these decisions, the RAF's requirement for future trained pilots has now reduced. In addition, there has been a reassessment of the required number of helicopter pilots due to there being fewer service leavers and the limited capacity of operational conversion units.</p>
	<p pid="a.640W.2/2">Accordingly, RAF trainee pilots were informed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-15">15 February 2011</phrase> of a decision to remove up to 170 student RAF pilots from the flying training pipeline. They are currently being briefed on the personal implications in one-to-one discussions. Those RAF trainee pilots who are removed from the flying training pipeline will be considered for potential re-selection for other ground based appointments. Those that are not successful will be put forward for redundancy and will receive support from the RAF by way of resettlement packages.</p>

Since the beginning of the New Year, the Department has focused attention on implementing those principles most relevant to its role as a commissioner for service provision. It is too early to judge the adherence to each of the principles.

	<p pid="a.648W.2/1">In 2009 the Social Work Task Force recommended the establishment of an independent College of Social Work to articulate and promote the interests of good social work. It will give the profession itself strong, independent leadership; a clear voice in public debate, policy development and policy delivery; and strong ownership of professional social work standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.648W.2/2">The Social Care Institute for Excellence has been asked to facilitate the establishment of the College of Social Work, providing administrative support and expertise in a developmental phase of two years. Neither Government nor SCIE seek to influence the form or function of the emerging college. SCIE will have no role in the governance of the college that emerges.</p>

	<p pid="a.648W.8/1">The Early Intervention Grant and funding arrangements for it were established as part of the comprehensive spending review. as part of the spending review process, my Department considered carefully the equality implications of proposed changes to the funding it provides to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.648W.8/2">The Government are freeing local authorities to focus on essential frontline services, and to invest in early intervention and prevention to produce long-term savings and better results for children, young people and families. A key element of this approach has been the creation of the Early Intervention Grant for local authorities in England. In a tight funding settlement, some reduction in central government support was inevitable. The grant will however provide a substantial funding stream, with new flexibility to enable local authorities to act more strategically and target investment early, where it will have the greatest impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.648W.8/3">Against the background of greater flexibility to decide priorities locally, there are key areas of early intervention where the Government have prioritised investment in the overall grant:</p>
	<p pid="a.648W.8/4" class="indent">to maintain the existing network of Sure Start Children's Centres-accessible to all but identifying and supporting families in greatest need;</p>
	<p pid="a.648W.8/5" class="indent">to enable local authorities to build capacity towards our planned extension of free early education with an entitlement for disadvantaged two-year-olds from 2013 (subject to the will of Parliament); and</p>
	<p pid="a.648W.8/6" class="indent">to provide respite to the most vulnerable families through provision of short breaks for disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="a.648W.8/7">When deciding the formula used for allocating the grant to local authorities we considered the equalities impact and for that reason selected an approach which is weighted to relative levels of social deprivation, given that families with disabled children and those from a number of other disadvantaged groups are over-represented in deprived areas. We have therefore created the conditions for local authorities themselves to consider locally where to invest to get the best outcomes, especially for the most disadvantaged groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.648W.8/8">The Department has a range of formal and informal contact and discussions with local government and trade unions, which cover many issues including funding.</p>

We recognise that study in other subjects will be just as valuable to pupils and we will encourage all pupils to study non-English Baccalaureate subjects alongside the English Baccalaureate in order to benefit from a well rounded education. This is why we have kept the number of core subjects small enough to allow wider study.

	<p pid="a.654W.2/3">However we recognise, as many schools do, the benefits that religious education can bring to pupils. This is why the teaching of RE remains compulsory throughout a pupil's schooling. Success in all subjects studied at GCSE will also continue to be recognised by other performance table measures, as it has in the past. We are open to arguments about how we can further improve the measures in the performance tables and will review the precise definition of the English Baccalaureate for the 2011 tables.</p>

	<p pid="a.655W.3/1">This matter was discussed at the Education Select Committee inquiry into behaviour, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-17">17 November 2010</phrase>. I plan to meet with young carer organisations to discuss how schools can be more flexible and supportive in responding to young carer's needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.655W.3/2">Helping to care for a family member is something that many young people are happy and proud to do. These young people play an important role both for their families and society as a whole and they deserve our recognition and support. The Department for Education with the Department of Health is committed to supporting local services including many voluntary organisations which have been set up to support these young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.655W.3/3">Removing the requirement for 24 hours notice of detention will allow detentions to be issued for the end of the same day, enabling a more immediate response to poor behaviour. Schools must act reasonably when issuing detentions and it is common sense that they should carefully consider whether an after school or Saturday detention is appropriate for certain pupils, including those with caring responsibilities. The Government trust teachers to make decisions such as these.</p>
	<p pid="a.655W.3/4">The Department for Education and the Department of Health are already working with National Young Carers Coalition to raise awareness within schools about how to identify and support young carers. The Government have also recently published &quot;Recognised, valued and supported: next steps for the Carers Strategy&quot;. It recognises that there are a number of 'hidden' young carers and encourages front-line services including schools, GPs, mental health and substance misuse to put in place systems to identify and respond to young carers needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.656W.8/1">The pupil premium for 2011-12 will be allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils that are known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) as recorded on the January 2011 school census, pupil referral unit census and alternative provision census. Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract &#163;430 of funding which will go to the school or academy via the local authority or YPLA if the pupil is in a mainstream setting or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.8/2">Local authorities will also attract the looked after child pupil premium for 2011-12 which will be allocated to local authorities for pupils who at some point in the year to <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase> were looked after continuously for at least six months, and who were aged 4 to 15 on <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-31">31 August 2009</phrase> as recorded on the April 2010 local authority return. Each pupil will attract &#163;430 of funding which will go to the responsible local authority who will pass it to maintained schools for pupils who have been in care for six months or more in the year to <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.8/3">The amounts allocated in 2011-12 will depend on the numbers of FSM and looked-after pupils recorded on the January 2011 censuses, so it is not possible to give precise figures for 2011 and subsequent years. We aim to extend the coverage of the pupil premium from 2012-13 onwards to pupils who have previously been known to be eligible for free school meals. We intend to consult on this, including the question of which deprivation indicator to use, in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.8/4">The January 2010 school censuses allow an estimate of the number of pupils known to be eligible for FSM or to be looked-after children to be made. In Warwickshire in January 2010 there were 8,165 pupils known to be eligible, which would give rise to a pupil premium of &#163;3,510,950. In addition to this there were 185 pupils known to be eligible for the service child premium, paid at a lower rate of &#163;200 per pupil, which would give rise to a further &#163;155,000. However, these are estimates only and are not necessarily indicative of how the pupil premium will be distributed.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.8/5">At borough level again the January 2010 school census allows an estimate of the number of pupils known to be eligible for FSM to be made. This does not include looked-after children or service children as data for these is not available at borough level. In North Warwickshire in January 2010 there were 1,110 pupils known to be eligible, which would give rise to a pupil premium of &#163;477,300. In Nuneaton and Bedworth in January 2010 there were 2,580 pupils known to be eligible, which would give rise to a pupil premium of &#163;1,109,400.</p>

	<p pid="a.657W.2/3">A range of savings options were considered in order to achieve the unit cost savings necessary, given the fiscal position we faced. The decision to reduce the funding for additional enrichment activities was taken after due consideration of whether it provided value for money for all full-time students compared to other options and in order to deliver the priorities for 16-19 education. These included our commitment to deliver on full participation, the need to protect the core programme equivalent to four A-levels, and the need to protect tutorial provision as far as possible. The savings from the entitlement also made it possible to increase the funding for 16 to 19-year-old disadvantaged students where we have increased funding by one-third to &#163;770 million.</p>

	<p pid="a.665W.6/2">The White Paper set out how we will empower and liberate healthcare professionals to innovate, with the freedom to focus on improving healthcare services with greater autonomy from political interference and greater accountability to patients and the public.

	<p pid="a.665W.6/3">&quot;Liberating the NHS: Legislative framework and next steps&quot; (which has already been placed in the Library), proposes a distinctive approach to commissioning maternity services, that reflects the special nature and circumstances of maternity services, locating responsibility for commissioning maternity services with GP consortia, with the NHS Commissioning Board giving a particular focus to quality improvement and extending choice for pregnant women, and supporting consortia to work collaboratively to commission services.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.6/4">Officials met with maternity and newborn professional and user organisations and commissioning organisations on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-03">3 February 2010</phrase> to begin work to explore how best to support the development of these new arrangements, including the role of networks in this context. This work will draw on existing experience, including from areas with networks already in place, with structures varying from formal managed networks to informal networks. We expect commissioners and providers to build on these, and we anticipate that all maternity providers will want to benefit from network relationships that will enable them to extend choice and provide a seamless service for pregnant women and their families. Networks may look different in different geographical areas as they seek to meet local needs and circumstances. It will be for the providers to agree network arrangements and any support or management structures that they might want to adopt, and to identify how these could be resourced including any efficiency gains that might cover the costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.6/5">There will be opportunities for developing networks to link with general practitioner consortia pathfinders and Health and Wellbeing early implementers to ensure their arrangements work well for women and their families.</p>

	<p pid="a.667W.0/1">The Department has worked closely with its strategic partner, Combat Stress and the mental health charity Rethink to put the 24 hour support line in place. The helpline will offer a signposting service which will help veterans to access other relevant services, including those which are relevant to the improvement of physical and mental wellbeing for former service personnel. The formal launch of the helpline will take place this month.</p>

	<p pid="a.667W.3/1">The recent spending review announced by the Government committed to taking forward proposals to invest in mental health diversion services at police stations and courts to intervene at an early stage, diverting mentally ill offenders away from the justice system and into treatment where appropriate. The diversion service will be rolled out nationally over the spending review period, subject to business case approval.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.3/2">Both the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Health have committed to this work in their recently published departmental business plans, and this aim has been supported in the Sentencing and Rehabilitation Green Paper that was recently published by the Ministry of Justice. The recently published cross-Government mental health outcomes strategy &quot;No health without mental health&quot; clearly details diversion as a key policy contributing to the improved mental health of offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.667W.3/3">This work on diversion includes the coalition commitment to explore 'alternative forms of secure, treatment-based accommodation for mentally ill and drugs offenders'. To support the Health and Criminal Justice work programme an interdepartmental Offender Substance Misuse Board has been convened and met to take this commitment forward. A workstream has been formed that will examine alternative forms of secure, treatment-based accommodation for drugs offenders in detail and submit a report by December 2011. In addition, a linked piece of work to scope potential options for alternatives for the mentally ill will start in April 2011 with a view to reporting later in the year.</p>

The volunteering opportunities created through the Civic Service will be available to all civil servants, apart from those in the devolved administrations who will have different arrangements. The Civic Service is wholly focused on encouraging civil servants to volunteer and will therefore not be extended to hon. Members.</p>

	<p pid="a.681W.0/1">The new Strategic Partners Transition programme will start in April 2011 and run for three years. The programme will fund key national representative civil society organisations (CSOs) to ensure that they can efficiently and effectively act as a conduit between government and wider frontline CSOs, communicating and helping to support and deliver the strategic policy of the Office for Civil Society. These organisations will support CSOs to contribute to the development of the big society.</p>

	<p pid="a.687W.6/1">The renewed Compact between the coalition Government and civil society organisations sets out shared principles and commitments for mutually beneficial partnership working. The outcomes in the Compact are joint outcomes that the coalition government will work in partnership with civil society organisations to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.687W.6/2">Beyond this, the Compact sets a framework for what is expected of Government Departments, but it does not prescribe how individual Departments should be achieving the objectives. No one size fits all and Departments will work with civil society organisations to achieve their strategic objectives in a way that is consistent with the Compact.</p>
	<p pid="a.687W.6/3">The Compact is not a bureaucratic or regulatory device that is monitored. However, for the first time, an accountability framework has been published alongside the renewed Compact and this can be found on the Cabinet Office website. This includes an inquiry into the implementation of the Compact by the National Audit Office. This report will be presented to Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.700W.8/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can access a diverse range of sources of finance, including equity finance, to invest and grow.</p>
	<p pid="a.700W.8/2">We are aware that there continues to be an 'equity gap' ranging up to &#163;2 million for SMEs seeking early-stage finance and up to &#163;10 million for those seeking growth capital.

	<p pid="a.700W.8/3">Improving the supply of growth capital would allow funds to be released for capital investment as well as for investment in IP, software and skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.700W.8/4">To address this, we announced in the &quot;Financing Business Growth&quot; paper last November, an additional &#163;200 million of funding for the Enterprise Capital Funds programme for equity finance of up to &#163;2 million to small innovative companies with high growth potential. We have also worked with the UK banks to set up a &#163;2.5 billion bank-led Business Growth Fund for growth capital between &#163;2 million and &#163;10 million for established businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.700W.8/5">In addition, the Government have in place two tax schemes to incentivise equity investment into small companies, namely the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and the Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) scheme.

In order to publish such a report, the FSA consider they would need permission from RBS and other individuals to use confidential information provided by them in the course of the supervisory investigations now concluded, as well as those to whom the information relates.</p>
	<p pid="a.703W.8/3">Lord Turner suggested delivering the report to the Government and the Treasury Select Committee by the end of March. The Government welcome this proposal and look forward to the FSA's publication in the spring.</p>

	<p pid="a.707W.2/1">Under the new arrangements, full Government funding will be provided for English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) to unemployed people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance or in the Employment and support allowance (work-related activity) group, where English language skills have been identified as a barrier to entering employment. We will also continue to pay 50% of ESOL course fees for people who are settled here.</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.2/2">From August 2011, the Government will no longer fund ESOL courses delivered in the workplace. It is right that workers from overseas, or their employers, should meet the costs of any additional English-language training necessary to enable them to take up jobs here. This change will not affect learners who have already begun ESOL courses</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.2/3">The equality impact assessment published alongside &quot;Skills for Sustainable Growth&quot; (November 2010) found that, at the aggregate level, there are unlikely to be disproportionate impacts on protected groups. A separate assessment of how the changes may affect ESOL learners is currently being carried out by this Department.</p>

We will have funding in place to train over 350,000 apprentices (at all ages) in 2010/11, though to reach this number employers and providers will need to work together to offer sufficient opportunities, in the context of the greater freedoms and flexibilities that we have created in the Further Education system.</p>

	<p pid="a.713W.3/2">Our assumption for modelling the new higher education finance system was that the average charge across the sector would be around &#163;7,500 per year. On that basis we would expect the number of student places across the spending review period to be broadly constant. Graduate contributions at that sort of level should replace any reduction in teaching grant. Higher average charges could have consequences for the student finance budget which we have indicated may need to be met from within the overall higher education budget. However, at this stage in the process it is too early to form a judgment on the level of charge that will be set. No institution so far has an agreed Access Agreement in place with the Director for Fair Access which would allow for a contribution to the costs of tuition to be set above &#163;6,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.715W.8/1">The intellectual property system plays an important role in promoting technological innovation and incentivising private sector investment in research and development of low carbon products. Evidence suggests that intellectual property rights are not a barrier to trade in low-carbon products in most cases, although inadequate enforcement in specific markets can discourage businesses from trading there.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.8/2">We have commissioned research on the role of intellectual property in the low carbon economy and continue to explore practical ways to further stimulate innovation and support technology diffusion. For example, in May 2009 the UK was the first country to implement a fast-track approval process for green patents to help enable technology to get to market more quickly. A number of other Intellectual Property Offices (IPO) including the US, South Korea and Japan have since adopted similar schemes. The UK also provides business support services to companies operating overseas, through UKTI and the IPO, to help overcome potential barriers to trade in specific markets.</p>

	<p pid="a.716W.5/1">The Department's budget for science research is distributed by the Research Councils. They do not award funding direct to the private sector but fund some research in the academic research base that is carried out in collaboration with industry. RCUK and the Research Councils have been actively developing their business and industry interactions, which is increasing their ability to deliver Research Council priorities that are of relevance and importance to industry. The Council for Science and Technology was among the bodies which the Department consulted during the allocations process for the science research budget and their response was published at</p>

	<p pid="a.716W.5/3">There are a wide range of management and governance arrangements for organisations carrying out publicly-funded research and scientific services. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is responsible for the Research Council institutes (via the funding provided to the relevant Research Councils) and NPL. Plans for the future of the Research Council institutes were included in the Allocation of Science and Research Funding 2011/12 to 2014/15 and in the individual Research Council Delivery Plans which were published late last year. The extent to which the private sector should be involved in the management of Research Council assets was taken into account in developing these Allocations and Delivery Plans. In the case of NPL the laboratory is currently operated on behalf of the Secretary of State by a private sector body.</p>
	<p pid="a.716W.5/4">Responsibility for other organisations carrying out publicly-funded research and scientific services lies with their parent Department. It is for that Department, in consultation with the management of the Public Sector Research Establishment, to decide on the extent to which the private sector participates in their management. This model ensures that there is a clear line of accountability for the management of each research organisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.720W.6/1">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills provides funding to support the Union Learning Fund (ULF) and unionlearn, the TUC's learning and skills organisation, which administers the fund on behalf of the Department. The main purpose of this budget is to enable trade unions and Union Learning Representatives (ULRs) to work with employers, employees and learning providers to encourage greater take up of learning and raise skill levels in the workplace. It is not used to fund the provision of education or training courses but enables trade unions and their ULRs to provide advice, guidance and support in order to help workers, particularly those with low skills, access learning opportunities to improve their skill levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.720W.6/2">With the help of the ULF, and supported by unionlearn, trade unions and their ULRs have achieved real success in working with employers and training providers to help people get back into learning, addressing both organisational and individual skill needs.

	<p pid="a.720W.6/3">A recent evaluation of the ULF and unionlearn from 2006-09 undertaken by the Leeds University Business School shows that employers as well as workers benefit from union learning activity. Two-thirds of employers say there has been a benefit to their organisation; and 8 in 10 cite a benefit to individual learners, over half of whom improved their qualifications having been helped to access a suitable learning opportunity.</p>

This is excluded as this cost will occur regardless of status, and is therefore a timing issue. estimates, again excluding pension costs, also indicate that the change in status will result in ongoing net savings of around &#163;8.4 million per year, by the end of the 2014-15 financial year.

The transfer of &#163;1,847,000 relates to operating costs in 2010-11 for Grenadier House and a transfer of &#163;709,000 relates to operating costs in 2010-11 for Ashley House.</p>

	<p pid="a.732W.6/2">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) does not collect information centrally as to whether risk assessments have been carried out or safe systems of work have been implemented in prisons. This will be identified by the audit process on an individual prison basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.732W.6/3">An audit of the health and safety performance of each prison is carried out every two years by departmental health and safety advisors. The audit focuses on the procedures in place for implementing the requirements of health and safety legislation, including arrangements for carrying out risk assessments and implementing measures to eliminate or reduce the risks. A report is prepared for Governors which includes any deficiencies identified during the audit, the actions required to ensure compliance with legislation and Prison Service Guidance and timescales for implementation.</p>
