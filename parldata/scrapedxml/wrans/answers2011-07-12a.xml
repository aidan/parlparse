In addition to putting in place fiscal incentives for local authorities to develop housing, in the form of the New Homes Bonus and the reformed Community Infrastructure Levy, the Government are also accelerating the release of public sector land, investing &#163;4.5 billion to help deliver over 150,000 new affordable homes and, together with house-builders, providing around &#163;400 million for the new First Buy scheme, which will help nearly 10,500 first time buyers to buy a new build property over the next two years. While introducing incentives we are also abolishing top-down Regional Strategies through the Localism Bill. Together, this package of measures will enable people in all areas of the country, including south east Dorset, to support and shape future housing development.</p>

	<p pid="a.215W.5/11">The definition of central Government revenue funding used here is the sum of formula grant (revenue support grant, redistributed non-domestic rates), area-based grant and specific grants inside aggregate external finance i.e. revenue grants paid for council's core services.</p>
	<p pid="a.215W.5/12">Figures exclude grants outside aggregate external finance (i.e. where funding is not for authorities' core services, but is passed to a third party, for example, rent allowances and rebates), funding for the local authorities' housing management responsibilities and those grant programmes (such as European funding) where authorities are simply one of the recipients of funding paid towards an area.</p>
	<p pid="a.215W.5/13">It also excludes Dedicated Schools Grant a ring-fenced specific grant for education service. Formula grant is an unhypothecated block grant and area-based grant and certain specific grants are unring-fenced. Therefore it is possible for local authorities to spend these grants on any services including education.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40116" name="Eric Pickles">the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr Pickles)</phrase>, has announced his intention to repeal the duty to involve. Repeal requires primary legislation; therefore until it is repealed via legislation, it remains a duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.216W.2/2">The plan to repeal the duty is in line with the Government's commitment to freeing up local authorities to innovate and work in new ways to serve their local communities. Central Government should not be prescribing how local government engages with local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.216W.2/3">We want to encourage authorities and civil society to collaborate more, including greater involvement for voluntary groups in the design and running of public services. In this context, we recently consulted on light touch statutory guidance on the Best Value duty setting out some reasonable expectations of the way authorities should work with voluntary and community groups and small businesses when facing difficult funding decisions. The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-14">14 June</phrase> and we expect to provide a Government response and publish final guidance this summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.216W.2/6">was carried out on a package of decentralisation measures including the repeal of the duty to involve. The screening showed that new best value guidance will balance out any possible equality impacts arising from the loss of the duty since it supplements the existing duty to consult under best value and underlines support for voluntary and community sector organisations. It will strengthen the role of voluntary and community sector groups in terms of engagement, funding and potentially running public services. It will also give greater freedom to councils to respond to local rather than central priorities and expand the scope of councils to collaborate with small businesses and voluntary and community sector organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.216W.2/7">Once the duty to involve is repealed, the separate duty to consult local representatives (which supports the duty of best value) will remain in place. This will be backed up by the additional support for voluntary and community groups in the best value guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.216W.2/8">In addition, the new duties contained in the Localism Bill (i.e. the Community Rights to Challenge and Buy) aim to have a greater impact on links between councils and communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.222W.2/1">The Government are working closely with the livestock industry on its product roadmaps. They are good examples of what can be achieved by bringing producers, processers and retailers together to commit themselves to more sustainable operation. The recently published Dairy Roadmap sets targets for waste recycling and recovery for both farmers and processers, and on amounts of recyclate used in packaging for retailers. Part two of The English Beef and Sheep Production Roadmap also looks at waste and efficiency issues through supply chains, extending the work begun on greenhouse gases in part one. While April's publication of the English Pig Meat Roadmap highlights the importance of animal health and carcase utilisation issues in avoiding waste in that sector. The Roadmaps can be found at:</p>

The potential for a variety of other renewable energy sources, including wind and tidal energy, has been considered as part of the project There are significant planning constraints on a world heritage site, but the project team will continue to explore the feasibility of these technologies, and the infrastructure provided as part of this project will be capable of adaptation to cater for other systems which may be found suitable for heritage estates and become more economically attractive in future years.</p>

	<p pid="a.230W.8/3">Over the next four years VisitBritain will be running the &#8220;You&#8217;re Invited&#8221; programme, which will capitalise on the international interest in the recent royal wedding, as well as next year's diamond jubilee and Olympic and Paralympic Games, and showcase Britain to the world. The programme aims to attract 4 million extra visitors, spending &#163;2 billion in the UK economy, which will support businesses, jobs and growth. The programme is backed by a &#163;100 million marketing fund, funded by the public and private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.230W.8/4">VisitEngland is working closely with local areas and destinations, in line with Government's localism agenda, to grow the value of local tourism economies. This is co-ordinated through the National Strategic Framework for Tourism, which includes an action programme developed in consultation with the tourism sector. VisitEngland is currently working with destinations across the country, including Liverpool, on a campaign to deliver economic growth from the domestic market, and to support employment and job creation. &#8216;The time to be in England&#8217; initiative will maximise the impact of the unique events of 2012, including the Queen&#8217;s diamond jubilee and the Olympic and Paralympic Games, helping to spread the benefits of the Games outside London and maintain a legacy of domestic tourism growth. The campaign is the subject of a bid to the second round of the Regional Growth Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.230W.8/5">Tourism policy seeks to help improve the sector's productivity and competitiveness, in particular, to address the burden of regulation affecting the industry. The Government's Red Tape Challenge focused on the hospitality sector in May, inviting the industry and the public to identify regulations holding back the industry and stifling growth. Alongside this, the Government have set up an industry task force, led by senior industry figures, to identify rules, regulations and inspections impeding the sector, and which might be cut, modified or abolished.</p>

	<p pid="a.233W.6/2">However, we believe that the financial penalty deposit requirement (on the spot fines) provides an effective enforcement mechanism to deal with non-UK resident offenders who do not comply with GB road traffic rules. It has helped to alleviate a public concern about the variation in enforcement against UK and non-UK resident hauliers and we have seen a reduction in personal injury collisions involving foreign HGVs, although it is too early to establish any direct and significant link with the deposit scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.237W.9/1">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is responsible for the child maintenance system. I have asked the Child Maintenance Commissioner to write to the hon. Member with the information requested and I have seen the response.</p>
	<p pid="a.237W.9/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Noel Shanahan</p>
	<p pid="a.237W.9/3">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner as the Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.237W.9/4">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the powers of the Child Support Agency to investigate non-resident parents where a disparity appears between lifestyle and declared earnings.</p>
	<p pid="a.237W.9/5">The variations scheme is relevant if a parent believes there are circumstances which should be taken into account in assessing what should be paid to support a child that have not been captured within the standard maintenance calculation. Under the 2003 child maintenance scheme a &#8220;variation&#8221; can be allowed in cases where the non-resident parent seems to have a lifestyle which is inconsistent with the amount of income that has been used in the maintenance calculation, and which suggests that they might have other income which should have been taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.237W.9/6">Generally a decision on whether to agree to a variation will be made on the basis of the information brought forward by the parent with care. However in certain cases&#8212;for example where there is a likelihood of serious fraud being committed&#8212;the Commission has the power to undertake further investigations. The Commission can appoint inspectors to obtain information required. Inspectors have the power to enter premises (except those only used as a home) to make enquiries and to inspect documents.</p>
	<p pid="a.237W.9/7">In January the Department for Work and Pensions published its Green Paper, &#8220;Strengthening families, promoting parental responsibility: the future of child maintenance&#8221;. The purpose of the Green Paper was to seek views on the Government's strategy for reforming the child maintenance system by empowering parents to take responsibility for their children and families. The consultation is now closed and the Government is considering the responses.</p>
	<p pid="a.237W.9/8">Variations will continue to be available to parents in the proposed new child maintenance scheme and will be based upon more robust HMRC information. They will continue to capture circumstances which are not accounted for in the maintenance calculation.</p>
	<p pid="a.237W.9/9">We are currently in the process of working on the details of the new variations scheme in order to fulfil the Commission's commitments of simplifying and improving the child maintenance assessment process. Along with the new variations system there will be a new duty on the Commission to support parent with care applications by using readily available information sources such as HMRC. The detail of the new variations scheme will be included in draft regulations, which will be subject to consultation in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.237W.9/10">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.245W.2/1">The headline youth unemployment figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) cover the UK. These show the number of 16 to 24-year-olds unemployed on the International Labour Organisation (ILO) definition in February to April 2011 was 895,000, a fall of 35,000 over the last year. Nearly a third of unemployed young people are full-time students; the number not in full-time education and unemployed is 618,000, down 30,000 on the year. The latest unemployment rate for 16 to 24-year-olds&#8212;the number unemployed as a proportion of the active labour force&#8212;is 19.3%.</p>
	<p pid="a.245W.2/2">Figures for England, the west midlands and Dudley are available from the Annual Population Survey (APS). The latest data, covering January to December 2010, show a 16 to 24 ILO unemployment level of 738,000 in England and an unemployment rate of 19.2%. In the west midlands the level is 83,000, an unemployment rate of 21.2%. In Dudley there are around 6,000 unemployed people, an unemployment rate of 22.5%.</p>
	<p pid="a.245W.2/3">APS data are not available monthly. The following table shows the number of 18 to 24-year-olds claiming jobseeker's allowance (JSA) in England, the west midlands and Dudley over the last 12 months. These figures are not adjusted for seasonal fluctuation so month-on-month changes should not be seen as an indication of the underlying trend. Comparing the latest May 2011 data with the same month last year suggests the number of JSA claimants aged 18 to 24 has fallen in England and the west midlands and risen in Dudley.</p>

	<p pid="a.245W.2/33">Tackling the high level of youth unemployment it inherited is a key priority for the coalition Government. Young people will benefit from radical reform of the welfare system which, through the Work programme, will create more flexible, personalised support to find work. In addition, the 2011 Budget invested &#163;200 million in support specifically targeted at young people which will include work experience; skills training; guaranteed interviews and progression into apprenticeships.</p>

	<p pid="a.249W.0/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has allocated assistance for capacity-building at all levels of government. All DFID-funded development programmes in South Sudan contribute to capacity-building and one, the Capacity-building Trust Fund, focuses entirely on this objective. A precise breakdown by level of government is not possible as programmes often operate at more than one level.</p>

	<p pid="a.249W.3/1">We are deeply concerned about the situation of civilians displaced by the recent fighting in the Abyei region. At present, lack of access to the conflict affected areas and populations hinders accurate humanitarian needs assessment by humanitarian personnel, but the current UN assessment is of about 100,000 people displaced. We are working with the United Nations to ensure that if security and access is granted, assistance will reach these displaced civilians. The UN has reserves of both shelter and food for such situations. As well as its ongoing support to the Common Humanitarian Fund, the UK has made an additional &#163;10 million available for contingency planning to respond to any emergencies that are linked to southern secession.</p>
	<p pid="a.249W.3/2">We are also working with the UN and wider international community to ensure that the new peacekeeping mission to Abyei, which is made up of Ethiopian troops, is able to fulfil its mandate to protect civilians who are threatened with imminent physical violence and to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance and personnel within the Abyei area.</p>

	<p pid="a.256W.2/1">HM Treasury regularly reviews, for the benefit of Parliament and the public, a wide range of studies by external commentators that attempt to assess the economic cost and benefits of the UK's membership of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.2/2">The most recent update, along with a previous literature review from 2005, is published on the Treasury's website:</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.2/3"><a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/foi_disclosures_index.htm">http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/foi_disclosures_index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.256W.2/4">following a request under the Freedom of Information Act. Neither review is a cost-benefit analysis. Rather, both reviews summarise published evidence on the economic impacts of the UK's membership of the European Union (EU), and cover for example the reported impacts on UK trade, foreign direct investment and productivity.</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.2/5">The Government are clear in their view that EU membership is in the UK's national interest. For example and as set out in the BIS Trade and Investment Analytical Paper No 4 - The UK and the Single Market, which can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="a.256W.2/6"><a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/international-trade-investment-and-development/docs/u/11-719-uk-and-single-market.pdf">http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/international-trade-investment-and-development/docs/u/11-719-uk-and-single-market.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.256W.2/7">the Single Market is the world's most important trading zone, generating total GDP close to &#163;10 billion in 2010 and providing us access to 500 million consumers without the barriers of customs or tariffs. European markets account for half of the UK's overall trade and foreign investments and as a result, around 3.5 million jobs in the UK are linked to the export of goods and services to the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.258W.8/1">Recent reports suggest that violence is continuing in many parts of Southern Kordofan. There are reports of aerial attacks by Sudanese armed forces; of abuses against civilians carried out by soldiers from both sides; and of innocent civilians being caught up in the violence. The British Government condemns the ongoing violence and calls all parties to cease hostilities immediately. The recent Framework Agreement on Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile is a step in the right direction but must lead to a ceasefire without delay, so that humanitarian aid can reach those in need, and talks on the future of Southern Kordofan can take place without continuing violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.258W.8/2">We urge the parties to keep to the commitments made in the framework agreement, and work urgently for a peaceful and long lasting resolution.</p>

The UK Border Agency aims to process each visa application within the agreed customer service standards but it cannot guarantee that all visa applications will be completed within this time. The unique circumstances of each individual case may result in longer decision times. For non-settlement visas the UK Border Agency aims to complete 90% of applications within three weeks, 98% within six weeks and 100% within 12 weeks.</p>

	<p pid="a.278W.8/1">While everyone has a right to respect for their private and family life under article 8 of the European convention on human rights, it is not an absolute right, and it is legitimate to interfere with that right where it is in the public interest to do so. This includes in particular where it is necessary to protect the public and to maintain our immigration controls. The Government will be consulting in due course on family migration, and will use that consultation to discuss the operation of article 8 and immigration control. In light of the consultation, we will bring forward proposals which strike a proper balance between the individual's right to respect for family life and the broader public interest, and we will lay immigration rules before Parliament which reflect this.</p>
	<p pid="a.278W.8/2">In addition, the Government have established a Commission to investigate the creation of a UK Bill of Rights. The Commission will look at the way rights are protected in the UK and we expect it to explore a wide range of different views as it carries out its work.</p>

	<p pid="a.279W.0/2">Foreign identity cards are not currently accepted as evidence of identity for taking the Life in the UK test. This is largely because of the large number and variety of foreign documents that University for Industry (Ufi) staff would need to be familiar with in order to ensure effective verification. The vast majority of those taking the Life in the UK test are able to provide another valid form of identity.</p>
	<p pid="a.279W.0/3">The UK Border Agency will consider whether the list of acceptable evidence could be reviewed. However, any proposed change in practice would need to be balanced against the resource implications of retraining and updating Ufi centre staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.282W.0/2">Data for the number of rapes recorded by the police in each police force area in England and Wales are provided in Table A. The latest period for which figures are available is the year ending December 2010. Data for the 12 months to March 2011 will be published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-14">14 July 2011</phrase> in &#8220;Crime in England and Wales 2010/11&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.282W.0/3">The number of rape offences shown in the table need to be interpreted with caution. In the 24 month period for which data are provided, it is known that police forces took additional steps to improve their recording of sexual offences, including rape. This may be reflected in the increases in rape offences seen in the data. Extra guidance for the recording of sexual offences was formally incorporated into the Home Office Counting Rules from <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>. However, some forces were following the new guidance prior to this date, reflecting good practice that the Association of Chief Police Officers had been promoting within forces before this formal implementation.</p>

However, DECC remains committed to simplifying the statute book and reducing the burden of regulation on business where possible. Internal reviews of our regulatory stock and engagement with our stakeholders have identified a number of potential repeals and simplifications to date, with the exact process for repealing these currently being explored. We will continue our efforts to identify opportunities to eliminate any unnecessary burden on businesses this year through full engagement with the &#8216;Red Tape Challenge&#8217;.</p>

	<p pid="a.295W.11/1">Ultimately it is for the industry to propose what type of fuel to use in any future nuclear reactors, the designs of which would be subject to independent regulatory assessment and acceptance. To date, no potential operator has put forward proposals for a Thorium-fuelled plant.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.11/2">That said, the Department is aware of the potential of thorium-fuelled nuclear reactor designs and is in the process of assessing claims regarding its suitability as an alternative to uranium-based reactors in the longer-term.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.11/3">The National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) undertook a recent independent assessment, in which it assessed a number of claims made by proponents of thorium fuel. The report can was published on the NNL's website:</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.11/4"><a href="http://www.nnl.co.uk/positionpapers">www.nnl.co.uk/positionpapers</a></p>
	<p pid="a.295W.11/5">The conclusion was that, while the science is reasonably sound, developing reactors based on a thorium fuel cycle would carry major technological and commercial risks. The resources required to develop these technologies to the point at which they might be deployed successfully at a commercial scale are also very significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.11/6">To date, both in the UK and elsewhere in the world, this has prevented private industry and government from investing significantly in the development of the technology. No thorium reactor design has been implemented beyond relatively small, experimental systems, while many either exist only on paper or have only had specific subsystems demonstrated. As an indicator of the challenge of taking this technology further, the Chinese Academy of Sciences estimates a development period of at least 20 years will be required before a demonstration thorium molten salt breeder reactor might be available.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.11/7">While thorium does not appear to have a part to play in the UK's near to mid-term energy market, we do maintain an interest in its development. The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40236" name="Christopher Huhne">the right hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)</phrase>, has asked the NNL to look further into the wider benefits of next generation reactor designs and to compare the use of thorium and uranium fuels in them. We are expecting the findings to be available by the end of the summer.</p>

	<p pid="a.305W.2/1">Implementation of the Organ Donation Taskforce recommendations has seen donor rates rise by around 28% since 2008 but work continues at a local, regional and national level to increase donor rates still further to the 50% by 2013 anticipated by the Organ Donation Taskforce.</p>
	<p pid="a.305W.2/2">Future action will focus on increasing consent rates; ensuring that the potential for donation can be optimised in all cases; and increasing donation from emergency medicine. This will be achieved through a variety of means, including through the clinical leads for organ donation, donation committees and donation chairs in acute trusts driving improvement locally; regional collaboration to share learning and ongoing work to raise the profile and benefits of organ donation and transplantation with the national health service, professional groups and with the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.305W.2/3">We will seek to ensure that measures to increase organ donation are appropriately incorporated into the new arrangements for the Department and the NHS as these are established.</p>

	<p pid="a.306W.6/1">All state funded schools, including academies, are required to comply with the School Admissions and Appeals Codes. It is the responsibility of admissions authorities to ensure that the admissions arrangements they set, having consulted with parents and others as specified in regulations, must comply with the code. Parents, local authorities and others as set out in regulations can refer any admissions arrangements they feel are unfair to the Office of the Schools Adjudicator (OSA). Currently for academies these objections are made to the Young Persons Learning Agency. In future, subject to clause 62 of the Education Bill, we intend to see all objections being made to the same body, the OSA. Local authorities have a duty, under the School Admissions Code, to refer any admissions arrangements they feel to be unfair or unlawful to the OSA.</p>

Subject to the passage of the Education Bill, we anticipate bringing the final codes into force in early 2012. One of the proposals in the consultation is that we would wish to enable anyone who has concerns over the fairness of admission arrangements at any school, including academies, will be able to refer their objections to the OSA.</p>

Local authorities in England also have a duty to secure enough suitable education and training to provide for the reasonable needs of all persons in their area who are under 19 but over compulsory school age and to encourage, assist and enable them to participate.

The scheme is for Qualifications, Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA) staff affected by its closure in September 2011; the estimated cost is &#163;2.6 million. In order to try and avoid compulsory redundancy, we are making significant efforts to redeploy QCDA people.

	<p pid="a.314W.11/1">We believe that the best schools and the best head teachers should take responsibility for developing the next generation of head teachers. We will continue to support the National College's existing approach to succession planning, which is focused on providing local solutions to find, develop and keep high-performing head teachers. Overtime we will increasingly work with teaching schools, as they become established, in order to ensure that promising leaders are identified in each local area and that they have the opportunity to learn from the best in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.314W.11/2">Meetings are taking place between Government and public service unions to discuss pension reform in light of Lord Hutton's final report; no decisions have therefore yet been taken on changes to the Teachers' Pension Scheme (TPS). However, in taking forward reform of the Teachers' Pension Scheme the Government will consider carefully the potential impact on head teachers, including recruitment and retention issues, in the context of the Government's wider education reform agenda.</p>

	<p pid="a.315W.2/1">Local authorities have a wide range of powers and duties in respect of maintained schools. A full list of local authority duties is published on the DCLG website:</p>
	<p pid="a.315W.2/2"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/decentralisation/tacklingburdens/reviewstatutoryduties/">http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/decentralisation/tacklingburdens/reviewstatutoryduties/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.315W.2/3">Local authorities are able to decide significant changes (prescribed alterations) such as enlargement, change of age range, closure and establishment, to all categories of maintained schools (i.e. community, community special, foundation, foundation special, voluntary aided (VA) and voluntary controlled (VC)) which are proposed either by the local authority or the governing body. Governing bodies have a right of appeal to the schools adjudicator, in most cases, where they disagree with the local authority's decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.315W.2/4">For community and VC schools, the local authority acts as the admissions authority in respect of school admissions, the employer of staff in those schools and the owner and maintainer of the premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.315W.2/5">Local authorities may, under section 96 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 (SSFA), direct the governing body of a foundation or voluntary aided school in its area to admit a child where, in relation to every school within a reasonable distance from the child's home, the child has been refused admission or has been permanently excluded. Under section 97A to 97C of the SSFA, a local authority may direct other admission authorities for any maintained school to admit a child in their care to the school best suited to their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.315W.2/6">Local authorities have statutory powers of intervention in maintained schools that Ofsted has judged as requiring special measures or significant improvement or where the local authority itself has given a performance standards and safety warning notice. In such cases, local authorities may require the school to enter into arrangements with another school or body, appoint additional governors to the school, suspend the right to a delegated budget, or apply to the Secretary of State to replace the governing body with an Interim Executive Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.315W.2/7">Local authorities may also suspend the right of the governing body of a community or VC school to a delegated budget where it appears to the local authority that the governing body has failed to comply with a delegation requirement or is not managing expenditure properly. In those circumstances, the local authority, and not the governing body may appoint, suspend and dismiss teachers and other staff at the school as the authority thinks fit.</p>
	<p pid="a.315W.2/8">Local authorities are represented on all maintained school governing bodies, but are a &#8216;minority&#8217; category unless the school is eligible for intervention, in which case the local authority can appoint such number of additional governors as it deems appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.315W.2/9">In respect of the Secretary of State's powers regarding an academy, the Secretary of State establishes an academy by signing a funding agreement, which provides the framework within which the academy must operate. The governing body of an academy is accountable to the Secretary of State through the requirements of its funding agreement. If an academy is in breach of its funding agreement, the Secretary of State may take legal action. If there should be a need for the Secretary of State to</p>
	<p pid="a.315W.2/10">intervene more directly in the running of an academy, the academy's Articles of Association make provision for him to do so by appointing additional governors to the governing body of the academy. The Secretary of State could also decide to terminate an academy's funding agreement if the grounds set out in the funding agreement apply. Academies continue to be subject to Ofsted inspections and are also accountable to parents through the achievement and attainment of pupils. The Secretary of State can ask Ofsted to carry out an inspection of an Academy causing concern. In addition, the Young People's Learning Agency (YPLA), on behalf of the Secretary of State, plays a major role in overseeing the financial management of academies.</p>
	<p pid="a.315W.2/11">For both maintained schools and academies, the Secretary of State has reserved powers of direction.</p>

In addition, benefits already accrued under existing schemes will still be payable from the normal pension age in existing schemes; this will be 60 for many members.
