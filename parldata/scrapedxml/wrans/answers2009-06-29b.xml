The estimates do not take account of the anticipated reductions in the costs of work which are expected as a result of the changes to scheme processes being enforced through the ongoing contract renegotiations with eaga which are not yet complete.

	<p pid="b.9W.6/3">It is also essential to note that these estimates have been affected by the recent increase in the Warm Front grant maxima.

	<p pid="b.10W.6/2">The Commission is due to review the regulation in 2010. To help the air transport industry to comply with its obligations under the regulation, the Department has published an updated version of its code of practice 'Access to Air Travel for Disabled Persons and Persons with Reduced Mobility'. The code includes a section on oxygen which advises that air carriers may approve the carriage of small gaseous oxygen or air cylinders required for medical use, but notes that carriers will wish to ensure that these do not pose a risk to security. The code also recommends that portable oxygen concentrator devices should normally be allowed if battery powered. Where air carriers wish to supply medical oxygen to passengers on request, the code acknowledges that it would be possible to make a charge for this service to cover the provision of the oxygen.</p>

	<p pid="b.16W.13/2">The UK believes that every state has an obligation to protect the rights of all its citizens, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) people, without discrimination of any kind. We regularly raise this with governments of countries where the rights of LGBT people are violated. In countries where same sex relationships are illegal, we continue to press for decriminalisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.16W.13/3">In 2008 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office launched a &quot;toolkit&quot; designed to provide guidance to our posts to help them in lobbying host governments to protect LGBT rights. We work extensively through the EU and other actors to promote LGBT rights including through wider equality and non-discrimination initiatives. At the end of 2008, the UK was heavily involved in lobbying for support for the joint UN Statement on the Rights of LGBT people at the UN General Assembly. This was supported by a number of developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.34W.2/1">DCMS and VisitBritain work closely with partners in the regions. The chair of the South West of England Regional Development Agency (SWRDA) (the lead RDA for tourism) sits as an observer on the board of VisitBritain; and representatives of VisitBritain and DCMS participate in regular meetings of the RDA Tourism Leads Group. DCMS and VisitBritain also work with the Local Government Association, and with destination management bodies such as the British Resorts and Destinations Association and Destination Performance UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.34W.2/2">The &quot;Partners for England&quot; initiative, (led by SWRDA and Visit England, and supported by DCMS), is working to develop better resource and policy co-ordination at national, regional and local levels, bringing together stakeholders to address better local authority engagement and performance; improved marketing co-ordination and coherence; improved tourism data and intelligence; and strengthened leadership and co-ordination structures.</p>
	<p pid="b.34W.2/3">The British Tourism Framework Review led by VisitBritain sets a new agenda for tourism, including better co-ordination of the funding invested in tourism and to identify ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector support for tourism. The review was published by VisitBritain on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-11">11 February</phrase> and set out recommendations aimed at better co-ordination of the significant public investment being made centrally, regionally and locally. The review's proposals also involve the restructuring of VisitBritain and developing the role of Visit England, which will market England within a more focused partnership at national, regional and local levels.</p>

	<p pid="b.35W.2/1">My Department works with others across Whitehall to reduce the regulatory burden on the tourism industry. Following this January's National Tourism Summit, Government and the industry have been working together to try and resolve concerns about existing, and future, regulatory burdens. These have been discussed by the newly formed Tourism Advisory Council and with tourism leads from the nations and regions.</p>
	<p pid="b.35W.2/2">Following these discussions, I covered the first meeting of the inter-ministerial group on tourism, whose members are drawn from the main regulatory Departments, and asked them to take the economic importance of tourism into account when formulating new, or re-formulating old, regulatory proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.35W.2/3">Some of my Department's regulatory responsibilities concern the tourism and leisure sectors but, so far, it has achieved a 43 per cent. reduction in administrative burdens against a baseline established in May 2005. These savings in the cost of red tape are derived mainly from the reform of the licensing and gambling regimes.</p>

	<p pid="b.36W.9/1">In the past year, we have introduced a number of significant improvements to our equipment for Army personnel. The majority of the improvements relate to force protection including increasing the numbers of existing Electronic Countermeasure (ECM) equipment and an enhancement to the ECM capability.</p>
	<p pid="b.36W.9/2">Improvements to existing vehicles, either complete or under way, include enhanced mine blast protection for the Viking all-terrain vehicle, a series of modifications to enhance Snatch's mobility and protection, and modifications to the Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) (CVR(T)) to enable the vehicles to perform better in the harsh Afghan conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.36W.9/3">We have also continued to acquire new vehicles to meet the evolving threat. New vehicles delivered in the last year, or in the process of being delivered, include Mastiff 2, Ridgback and Panther. In addition, we have placed contracts for a number of new vehicles which include the three tactical support vehicles (Coyote, Husky and Wolfhound), Jackal 2, and Warthog. We intend that the tactical support vehicles will replace unprotected vehicles such as the General Service Land Rover and the RB44 operating outside our protected camps.</p>
	<p pid="b.36W.9/4">Viking has now reached its limit to carry extra weight and protection and Warthog will replace Viking on operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.36W.9/5">There have also been recent improvements in the personal equipment issued to our armed forces. These include the purchase of Underslung Grenade Launchers, combat shotguns and the 60mm mortar and improved night vision devices. We have also introduced enhancements to the fit of Osprey body armour which have improved user manoeuvrability. Additionally, a system which allows troops to wear front and back Osprey plates without the soft armour jacket has just been introduced. This system is used by troops who require extra mobility or are operating in confined spaces.</p>
	<p pid="b.36W.9/6">To help counter the significant mine threat in Afghanistan, a system for searching and clearing of mines and improvised explosive devices from roads and predictable routes, Project Talisman, has been ordered. Talisman includes the Buffalo and Mastiff armoured vehicles, a small unmanned air vehicle and the high mobility engineer excavators. Also, additional Vallon hand held mine detectors have been purchased. The Vallon provides a significantly enhanced performance to the detector which it has replaced.</p>
	<p pid="b.36W.9/7">Finally, a range of logistics vehicles such as the support vehicle and the heavy equipment transporter have been modified to 'Theatre Entry Standard' with, among others, improvements to air conditioning, dust filtration, night vision and additional armour. Protected plant equipment such as wheeled tractors have been delivered to operations with a second tranche now on order.</p>

	<p pid="b.37W.2/2">During 2008, we enhanced our strategic air lift capability by taking delivery of two more C-17s, taking our total C-17 fleet to six aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="b.37W.2/3">We continue to improve our fast jet capabilities with significant enhancements to our Harrier and Tornado fleets. These improvements include our new Paveway IV Precision Guided Bomb, which entered service in December 2008, and which provides the RAF with a state of the art all-weather, day and night, precision bombing capability. The Dual Mode Seeker Brimstone also entered service in December 2008 providing increased target accuracy and reduced risk of collateral damage. We are making good progress on Typhoon too. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-01">1 July 2008</phrase>, Typhoon was declared operational in the air to ground role, and on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-21">21 October 2008</phrase>, deliveries of our Tranche 2 Typhoon aircraft commenced.</p>
	<p pid="b.37W.2/4">We have also increased our surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities with the introduction of the Airborne Stand off Radar, which achieved its in-service date in November 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.37W.2/5">On helicopters, we continue to deliver improvements to our fleet to ensure the safety, airworthiness and operational effectiveness of our platforms on operations. We continue to increase the number of helicopter flying hours available to our commanders in Afghanistan, which have gone up by 84 per cent. between November 2006 and April 2009 through the deployment of more aircraft and improvements in support and crewing arrangements. By the end of 2009, the Department intends to make the first of the eight Chinook Mk3 Reversion aircraft available for operations and will have deployed the RAF's Merlin Mk3 force to Afghanistan, providing a significant increase to our front-line helicopter capability.</p>
	<p pid="b.37W.2/6">In the past year, there have been a number of improvements in the equipment provided to the RAF Regiment. The latest variant of the Snatch Land Rover, the Snatch Vixen which has improved mobility and protection is currently deployed on operations, as is the new Panther Command and Liaison vehicle. In addition to the new vehicles, there has also been recent improvement in dismounted close combat equipment including the supply of underslung grenade launchers, night vision devices, combat shotguns and the 60 mm mortar.</p>

	<p pid="b.38W.2/1">The MOD places a very high priority on the welfare of its service personnel and their families. To that end, the MOD has robust procedures in place to support immediate family members of service personnel who are killed while on operations. These procedures are under constant review to ensure that the support provided meets the needs of the recipients and reflect current MOD policy. Families are assigned a visiting officer who acts as the link between the family and the services, assisting with such matters as repatriation, funeral arrangements and expenses, and help with necessary paperwork to procure pensions etc. The visiting officers will also direct the family to the most appropriate internal and external welfare agencies for specific areas of support.</p>

	<p pid="b.43W.3/1">Pensions paid under the terms of the Gurkha Pension Scheme, which is now a closed scheme, are calculated in Indian currency rupees (ICR) and paid in Nepalese currency rupees (NCR). This is because the scheme retains a structural link to the Indian Army Pension Scheme and also has the benefit of protecting pensioners from fluctuations in the pounds sterling/NCR rates of exchange. Members of the scheme qualified for immediate payment of pension on completion of 15 years service.</p>
	<p pid="b.43W.3/2">The current rate of pension for a former Gurkha soldier who retired in the rank of Sergeant on <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-30">30 April 1997</phrase>, after 15 years service, is ICR 13,687.64 per month.</p>
	<p pid="b.43W.3/3">Expressed in pounds sterling, at the <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-01">1 June 2009</phrase> exchange rate, this gives the following annual rates provided below.</p>
	<p pid="b.43W.3/4" class="indent">Gurkha Sergeant after 15 years: &pound;2,149.56 a year, paid immediately on leaving the Army.</p>
	<p pid="b.43W.3/5">A non-Gurkha soldier who was in the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975 (AFPS 75), unlike his Gurkha counterpart, did not receive a pension until age 60, if he left after 15 years' service. The AFPS 75 pensions for a sergeant as calculated on the last day of service on <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-30">30 April 1997</phrase> is provided below.</p>
	<p pid="b.43W.3/6" class="indent">Sergeant after 15 years: Preserved pension of &pound;4,162.13 a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.43W.3/7">There would be no payment until age 60, at which point the pension calculated on the last day of service would be index linked by rises in the retail prices index over the period. While the Gurkha pension is lower it is paid from an earlier age and over a longer period and is therefore well suited to life in Nepal, where it provides an income that equates to a very good working wage.</p>
	<p pid="b.43W.3/8">Gurkha soldiers on leaving the Army on <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-30">30 April 1997</phrase>, on completion of 15 years service, would also have received lump sums, provided below in pounds sterling, but paid in NCR.</p>

We are also working with stakeholders, including the Government Office West Midlands and local authorities, to engage and support schools work towards the DCSF's Sustainable Schools strategy which aims for all schools to be sustainable by 2020. The strategy is guided by a commitment to care for the environment both locally and nationally and a national framework has been established to help schools identify areas on which they can focus to develop their sustainability practices.</p>

	<p pid="b.53W.5/12">The above special school figure includes other additional costs often incurred by local authorities, such as support for inclusion, inter authority recoupment, fees for pupils at independent special schools, educational psychology services, local authority functions in relation to child protection, therapies and other health-related services, parent partnership, guidance and information, the monitoring of SEN provision and inclusion administration, and assessment and co-ordination. Hence the higher figure. The above figure does however exclude any allowance for SEN related transport costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.73W.2/3">Since the launch of tier 4 of the PBS on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March 2009</phrase>, educational establishments wishing to bring non-EEA national students to the UK are required to hold a sponsor licence, which can only be obtained by establishments that are either publicly funded and subject to the system of public inspections and audits, or private institutions that are accredited by a UK Border Agency-approved accreditation body. Around 1,500 institutions are currently registered to bring students to the UK. We estimated that around 4,000 institutions were active in bringing non-EEA students to the UK prior to the introduction of tier 4 of the points-based system.</p>

	<p pid="b.83W.5/1">This is a matter for the East of England Strategic Health Authority. We understand that the proposal to create heart attack centres in the east of England were subject to public consultation on as part of Towards the best, together from <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-06">6 May 2008</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-04">4 August 2008</phrase>. These proposals in Towards the best, together were put forward by clinicians working in the national health service in the east of England region, and involved eight clinical work-streams involving around 200 clinicians (with representatives from every NHS organisation in the region), stakeholders, and patients in drawing up the proposals. The proposals were the result of taking the best clinical evidence and applying it to provide the best health service for the people of the east of England.</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.5/2">The consultation directly engaged more than 6,000 people and the public gave 90 per cent. approval to create four specialist heart attack centres. Staff saw them as the one of the most important changes to acute services in the vision, second only to a guaranteed future for all acute trusts, including Ipswich.</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.5/3">The Joint Overview and Scrutiny Committee (JOSC) for the east of England scrutinised the proposals made as part of the Towards the best, together consultation. Following the Towards the best, together consultation, the NHS discussed with the OSCs the plans for implementing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PPCI) across the region and it was agreed that further consultation was not required as the changes were in line with those already consulted on in Towards the best, together.</p>
	<p pid="b.83W.5/4">The decision on the four specialist centres to deliver PPCI in the east of England was made by the East of England Specialised Commissioning Group. The East of England Specialised Commissioning Group is a committee comprising representatives of all of the 14 primary care trusts (PCTs) in the east of England, including Suffolk PCT, and is a sub-committee of their Boards.</p>

	<p pid="b.87W.6/1">National health service organisations in the North West have been preparing their pandemic response for the last five years. All 63 NHS organisations in the North West region have provided assurance to the NHS North West strategic health authority (SHA) that they have robust plans in place to respond to an influenza pandemic.</p>
	<p pid="b.87W.6/2">The NHS Operating Framework stated that all NHS organisations should have robust pandemic flu plans in place by December 2009. Self-assessment of plans have been completed against the requirements set out in the &quot;National framework for responding to an influenza pandemic&quot;. (A copy of this has already been placed in the Library).</p>
	<p pid="b.87W.6/3">Following the outbreak of swine flu in April, SHAs have revisited and reviewed primary care trust plans, in particular to ensure resilience of antiviral collection points (ACPs).</p>
	<p pid="b.87W.6/4">Lancashire has several ACPs which will be open to the general public plus others which are located in prisons and hospitals for prisoners and in-patients. Of the ACPs in Lancashire, several can be operational within 48 hours, and the remaining within 96 hours or a week.</p>
	<p pid="b.87W.6/5">The Ribble Valley is a more rural area and has its main ACP, for public access, located at Clitheroe hospital which is a community hospital. The population of the Ribble Valley can also access several other ACPs in the area.</p>

Proposals for trusts in the south to use the ASCC will be subject to appropriate approvals being obtained. Part of the process will be to establish the likely overall demand and estimated value of contracts to be awarded. This has not yet been completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.91W.2/2">Financial management information is not kept in a way that enables all the costs of the ASCC to be separately identified within the staffing and other administrative costs of NHS Connecting for Health, which is responsible, within the Department, for the National Programme for IT. However, suppliers' systems are not &quot;accredited&quot; as a part of the ASCC procurement. The purpose of the procurement is to create a framework of suppliers with demonstrated capacity and capability in various specialisms. Subsequently, on identification of a business need, each trust will specify its particular requirements to suppliers in the most appropriate service category. It will be for suppliers to demonstrate how they can meet this need against the procurement's specific evaluation criteria.</p>

	<p pid="b.94W.6/1">The Department is in negotiations with Airbus over support for the A350 XWB programme. We would aim to complete these within the next few weeks; however this is subject to reaching satisfactory agreement with the company.</p>
	<p pid="b.94W.6/2">The long term nature of this project, and the fact that negotiations are still continuing, make it hard to be precise about the numbers of UK-based jobs that will be created directly within Airbus and within the A350 XWB supply chain. However, our assessment is that the programme will provide significant employment opportunities as well as generating skills and expertise that will help keep the UK at the forefront of aerospace technology.</p>

	<p pid="b.97W.2/2"><i> </i>No official estimates of the number of company administrations in 2009/10 and beyond have been compiled by the Insolvency Service (The Service). This is because company administrations are overseen by private practice insolvency practitioners, and so do not require additional funds from The Service. Administrators have a duty to report to the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills on the conduct of directors and shadow directors of a company in administration. Where an adverse report has been submitted, The Service may carry out an investigation. The Service has implemented a number of initiatives to assist in the planning and management to deal with increases in the number of adverse reports, including more pro-active targeting and prioritisation of cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.2/3">The Service also monitors compliance by insolvency practitioners with Statement of Insolvency Practice 16 (SIP 16 Pre-packaged sales in administrations), with which all insolvency practitioners are required to comply. Pre-pack administrations are where a sale of the business or assets is arranged before administration and executed by the administrator immediately on or shortly after their appointment. SIP 16 requires insolvency practitioners in pre-pack administrations to explain in detail to creditors the background to their appointment and the reasons for any transaction undertaken through a pre-pack.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.2/4">An increase in the number of administrations could result in an increase in the number of reports submitted to the Service under SIP 16. This work is part of The Service's regulatory function. The Service has increased its fees to insolvency practitioners to cover our regulation work in relation to SIP 16s.</p>
	<p pid="b.97W.2/5">The Redundancy Payments Services has also had additional funds available to take into account the increase in the number of overall company insolvencies.</p>

	<p pid="b.98W.2/2">UK trade statistics do not allow us to identify exports from the UK to Iran of technology intended to inspect, monitor or filter internet content and the Government have not made an estimate of these types of export.</p>
	<p pid="b.98W.2/3">The Government publish statistical summaries of export licences issued and refused by destination in its Annual and Quarterly Reports on Strategic Export Controls. No UK licences have been issued for the export of items which might have contained technology intended to inspect, monitor or filter internet content to Iran since 1999. Such technology would however not necessarily be controlled under UK export controls. This would depend on the specific items concerned: some technology could be controlled if it employed cryptography or was specially designed for military use.</p>

	<p pid="b.98W.5/2">The vehicle scrappage scheme is a targeted, time-limited action with a capped budget designed to help the whole motor trade. It was limited to make sure its benefits are balanced with the needs of other sectors of the car industry including the second hand market and repair businesses, and of manufacturers of other consumer durables. Over 74,000 orders for new vehicles have been taken since the scheme was announced in the Budget in April.</p>

	<p pid="b.110W.8/1">The total number of centrally recorded information security breaches/incidents occurring within the last five reporting years for the Department (created May 2007) and its predecessor (the Department for Constitutional Affairs) are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.110W.8/13">Our records now enable us to break down the 2008-09 figure, which comprises 394 information breaches and 922 IT incidents. The 394 includes the following agency breakdown:</p>

	<p pid="b.110W.8/23">NOMS was formerly part of the Home Office, and figures for incidents prior to May 2007 are held by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.110W.8/24">My Department and its agencies report all significant personal data security breaches to the Cabinet Office and the ICO. Information on personal data security breaches are published on an annual basis in the Department's annual resource accounts as was announced in the Data Handling Review published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-25">25 June 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.110W.8/25">Additionally, all significant control weaknesses including other significant security breaches are included in the Statement of Internal Control which is published within the annual resource accounts. Only two of the information incidents in 2008-09 were assessed to be significant and nine in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.110W.8/26">Although, the last two reporting years has seen a 43 per cent. increase in reported information and IT security related breaches/incidents, much of this is the result of the implementation of a robust information assurance programme. This has included the need for all areas to apply procedures for reporting information security incidents, including the identification and investigation of the departure, however minor, from all security procedures. The result is an evidently improving information security management system.</p>
	<p pid="b.110W.8/27">Where incidents involve the inadvertent disclosure of personal data these now include the requirement to involve managers and senior civil servants within an hour of any potential disclosure being identified. The circumstances surrounding each potential incident are investigated and where appropriate disciplinary action is taken.</p>
