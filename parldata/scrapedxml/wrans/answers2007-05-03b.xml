	<p pid="b.1792W.9/1">There is no simple relationship between a long-term stabilisation goal and the pathways required to get there. The most recent science indicates that to stabilise at between 450 and 550 ppm CO2 equivalent, global greenhouse gas emissions would need to fall by between 10 per cent. and 65 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2050.</p>
	<p pid="b.1792W.9/2">The UK's target of a 60 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is consistent with this approach. However, we recognise that we will need to keep this goal under review in the light of emerging scientific evidence and other developments.</p>

Management of coastal erosion risk and associated monitoring is the responsibility of the relevant local authority in each area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1793W.3/2">DEFRA does not measure the extent of coastal erosion or hold these figures centrally. Erosion risk will vary around the coastline depending on local conditions and defences in place. DEFRA has encouraged the relevant authorities to produce Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) which provide large-scale assessments of the risks associated with coastal processes and present long term policy frameworks to manage them in a sustainable manner. In 2001, DEFRA funded a national study of information on long term coastal processes and evolution over the next century (Futurecoast). This is designed to be used by coastal authorities to inform their current revisions of SMPs.</p>

The European Commission has not referred to specific projects in the North East programme in this regard.

The provisions were amended in April 2006 to raise energy efficiency standards and change the method of showing compliance. Without prescribing solutions, this new approach and associated calculation tools, take into account the low carbon benefits of solar thermal and other microgeneration systems, thus encouraging their use. Guidance was published alongside the Part L changes to highlight the contribution that these technologies can make. These standards are kept under review and the Government have signalled the next comprehensive amendment will come into effect around 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.1803W.3/1">Planning Policy Statement 3: &quot;Housing&quot; (PPS3) does not stop local authorities taking advantage of windfall sites to boost the delivery of housing in their areas. But it does seek to ensure that, generally speaking, housing provision is properly planned, and that local authorities develop clear and informed strategies for the location of housing development, and for the infrastructure needed to service it. PPS3 asks local authorities, wherever they can, to identify specific sites in their plans where they consider homes should be built, including brownfield sites, and discourages an over-reliance on windfall sites (such as garden land) that may come forward randomly and speculatively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1803W.3/2">We recognise that in some circumstances it may make sense for local authorities, within a planned strategy, to include a windfall allowance in planning their land supply.

The Government are committed to ensuring that, wherever possible, councils receive funding through unhypothecated provision. The Chancellor announced in the recent Budget report that the Government are committed to set out a clear target to reduce specific grants and ring fenced funding to local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1810W.5/1">The Government's decision to withdraw the industrial and agricultural buildings allowances were based on an assessment of a number of issues, common across industry sectors. The Government have not sought to target the farming industry or any other industry with this change.</p>
	<p pid="b.1810W.5/2">Industrial buildings allowances (IBAs) and agricultural buildings allowances (ABAs) were introduced in 1945 to encourage post-war reconstruction. They are now a poorly focused subsidy, selectively available on a disparate range of assets, including some that typically appreciate in value. IBAs and ABAs have long been recognised as a significant distortion in commercial property investment. These issues are compounded by the compliance burden imposed by their complicated rules.</p>
	<p pid="b.1810W.5/3">The withdrawal of IBAs and ABAs is not an isolated measure. The Budget also announced cuts in both the basic rate of income tax and the main rate of corporation tax and introduced a new annual investment allowance (AIA) of &pound;50,000 for business investment from 2008. Taken as a whole, these reforms to the business and personal tax systems are designed to deliver increases in investment and growth overall.</p>

We expect the final figures for 2006-07 to show an increase over 2005-06, principally because of complaints about British Gas. British Gas is working closely with Energywatch to address this. The Government have no plans to take any steps at this time. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), which is responsible for regulating gas and electricity supply, has extensive powers to act against suppliers that breach licence conditions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1816W.11/1">Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs minimum wage compliance teams are devoted to making sure all workers receive their entitlement to be paid at least the national minimum wage. Every year the DTI publicises details about the minimum wage and the number to ring (0845 6000 678) if workers need more information or believe they are being underpaid. The helpline operators have access to language line interpreters so that callers can be phoned back allowing the caller to speak in their own language.</p>
	<p pid="b.1816W.11/2">The Government will not tolerate the mistreatment of migrant workers. Legal migrant workers have the same employment rights and recourses as their UK equivalents. To ensure migrant workers are aware of their rights we have produced 'Know before you go' leaflets in partnership with the Polish, Lithuanian and Portuguese governments. The Home Office is also distributing a one page DTI note on &quot;basic employment rights and where to go for further advice&quot;. This is going to all workers registering under the worker registration scheme and is available in a range of languages.</p>

	<p pid="b.1826W.10/1">The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the Chief Executive. He will write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.1826W.10/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-03">3 May 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1826W.10/3" class="indent">In reply your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1826W.10/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many DNA samples have been taken by or on behalf of the Child Support Agency (CSA) in each year since its inception; in what circumstances and on what ground the CSA may require someone to take a DNA test; how many DNA tests resulted in maintenance being demanded from those tested; how and by whom any DNA data obtained by the CSA is stored; for how long such data is stored; and to which other departments agencies or authorities it may be made available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1826W.10/5" class="indent">The Child Support Agency does not require DNA tests to be carried out but may suggest a DNA test in cases where the parentage of a qualifying child is disputed. The parent with care and alleged non-resident parent must consent to such a test, as must the qualifying child if he or she is over the age of 16. If the alleged non-resident parent refuses to take a DNA test, the Agency may assume parentage and proceed accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1826W.10/6" class="indent">The information requested concerning the number of DNA tests undertaken on behalf of the Child Support Agency is provided in the attached table. However information is unavailable prior to 1997/8 and the Agency does not record information on how many DNA Tests result in the pursuit of maintenance from those tested. We do know that on average since 1997/98 around 84% of tests return a positive result and it may therefore be reasonable to assume that in these cases a maintenance assessment will be undertaken. We do not have figures on how many of these assessments result in a positive maintenance assessment and are subsequently pursued as there may also be other circumstances in which maintenance is not pursued, for example, if the parent with care requests the case be closed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1826W.10/7" class="indent">DNA samples are stored in a secure environment by the Agency's contractor. Access to the data is restricted to laboratory staff, and managed by swipe card access controlled doors, alongside a number of other security measures. The case data is retained by the contractor for 3 months, and case records are kept for 1 year after the case has been resolved, after which they are destroyed by shedding and incineration.</p>
	<p pid="b.1826W.10/8" class="indent">Finally the CSA does not routinely share data relating to individual DNA tests with any other Departments, Agencies or authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1826W.10/9" class="indent">I hope you find this answer helpful.</p>

The approach taken to this co-operation is a matter for local decision, but there are powers to make joint appointments and for partnership arrangements, which include powers to create single pooled budgets, to be established as permitted under section 75 of the NHS Act 2006 and for an application to be made to the Secretary of State to establish a care trust as permitted under section 45 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001.</p>

	<p pid="b.1844W.8/2">In March 2006, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published guidance on the use of drugs to treat ADHD. NICE has estimated that around 5 per cent. of school-aged children meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, equivalent to 366,000 children and adolescents in England and Wales, but not all these children will require medication.</p>
	<p pid="b.1844W.8/3">The position concerning ADHD in adults is unclear. There have been a number of follow-up studies of those given the diagnosis as children, which indicate that a small proportion may continue with ADHD problems into adulthood.</p>

	<p pid="b.1846W.6/7" class="indent">Category A claims are lower value claims that were handled by individual trusts up to 2002, and were reported to NHSLA upon completion. The NHSLA cannot account for the accuracy of the reported data.</p>
	<p pid="b.1846W.6/8" class="indent">Similarly, until 2000, individual trusts handled and funded existing liabilities scheme (ELS) claims less than &pound;10,000 themselves. However these claims were never notified to the NHSLA on completion. Hence any of these smaller valued claims which closed prior to the ELS call-in in April 2000 will be missing from the data.</p>
	<p pid="b.1846W.6/9" class="indent">Table 2 shows the total value of the claims which closed in the year in question but the actual payments may have been spread over several financial years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1846W.6/10" class="indent">The real terms figures in table 2 are calculated using the deflator series provided by HM Treasury on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-28">28 March 2007</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1851W.2/2">The Army's Foreign and Commonwealth task force was set up in 2004 and works to identify concerns and to implement practical and achievable measures to ameliorate them. Since its inception, the task force has seen adjustments to Tri-Service or Army policy and guidance, including changes in other Government Department regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1851W.2/3">Notable developments have included:</p>
	<p pid="b.1851W.2/4" class="indent">Reviewing services allowances and ensuring priority allowances take account of country of origin implications;</p>

	<p pid="b.1851W.2/6" class="indent">Providing a Commonwealth soldiers and families information website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1851W.2/7">The task force met most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-26">26 April 2007</phrase>. There are a number of ongoing issues; dialogue continues with other Government Departments where appropriate, while work within MOD control includes providing improved guidance for non-British soldiers during initial training and improving the flow of communications through the chain of command to both soldiers and their accompanying families.</p>

Reminders about priority treatment for war pensioners are circulated by the health services to senior NHS managers who are tasked to ensure that relevant clinical staff are aware.There is no formal system to monitor or evaluate the provision, but officials take up cases with the relevant health authority where it is alleged that there is an issue around provision of priority treatment. The Service Personnel and Veterans Agency monitor these cases. The Ministry of Defence and its Service Personnel and Veterans Agency do not keep records of those war pensioners who receive priority treatment for their accepted disablements; this is a matter for the Department of Health.</p>

The elements of 1 RW who will be deploying have already had their pre-deployment leave (<phrase class="date" code="2007-03-30">Friday 30 March</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-18">Wednesday 18 April</phrase>). However, a handful of personnel were not able to take this in full owing to operational commitment. Arrangements are in place for those affected to return to their home base and receive the balance of leave owed shortly after the unit arrives in theatre.The Second Battalion the Royal Welsh (2 RW) is based in Tidworth, Wiltshire. 2 RW have been on leave since after duties on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-30">Friday 30 March</phrase> and returned to work on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-23">Monday 23 April</phrase>.</p>

We will be working ever more closely with employer organisations to deliver the planned apprenticeship entitlement and the Leitch UK target of 500,000 apprentices by 2020. Development of new or revised apprenticeship frameworks for each industry are the responsibility of Sector Skills Councils (SSCs). Each SSC is an employer-led, independent organisation that covers a specific sector across the UK and provides employers with a unique forum to express the skills and productivity needs that are pertinent to the sector. Apprenticeship frameworks therefore reflect employer needs and requirements.</p>

	<p pid="b.1855W.5/1">The Government are investing in a wide range of financial support for child care in England. We are investing some &pound;3 billion each year in the delivery of free part-time nursery education so that all three and four-year-olds can benefit from 12.5 hours a week free early years provision, rising to 15 hours a week by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.1855W.5/2">Further funding to support child care is also provided through the General Sure Start Grant (GSSG). This includes supporting child care for disabled children and children with special educational needs (SEN). The GSSG can be used to provide training to staff, enable early education and child care settings to make adaptations to premises and equipment, provide additional staff and support multi-agency working focused on the needs of individual children for example as developed by the Early Support Programme for disabled children and their parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1855W.5/3">Local authorities have the freedom to decide how much they wish to spend on activity related to disability and SEN within the GSSG based on their knowledge of the local market. In 2007-08, &pound;664 million of revenue funding and &pound;544 million of capital funding is available to local authorities through the GSSG. Local authorities now have a duty through the Childcare Act 2006 to secure sufficient child care provision in their area for all children with a specific focus on provision that is suitable for disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1855W.5/4">Further funding is available to parents through the child tax credit, and the working tax credit, which was introduced in April 2003. The child care element of the working tax credit is designed to help remove the child care barrier that often prevents people taking up or returning to work. It is available for meeting up to 80 per cent. of the cost of registered or approved child care to a maximum childcare cost of &pound;175 a week for families who pay child care for one child and &pound;300 a week for families who pay child care for two children or more. For parents with disabled children, additional funding to help with the costs of child care is provided through the disability living allowance, the carers allowance and the disability and severe disability elements of the child tax credit. A longer period of help is given to families for children with disability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1855W.5/5">Child care can be subsidised in a variety of other ways including local authority subsidies, Jobcentre Plus New Deals, Care to Learn, Learner Support Funds and NHS child care allowances. The Department supports initiatives with sector organisations such as the National Portage Association and Kids, to raise awareness and change attitudes towards the delivery of services for disabled children. Parents of disabled children can also apply for direct payments from local authorities in some circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.1857W.5/1">The proposed star rating system&mdash;the Framework for Excellence (FfE) and the associated strategies announced in the White Paper 'Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances' will be developed and implemented as part of a coherent and evolving package of reform. The framework aims to improve the quality of post-16 provision and support better-informed choices and decisions by employers and individuals, thereby contributing to better and more relevant outcomes for end users, increasing skill levels in the workforce and increased productivity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1857W.5/2">The Framework is in an early stage of development and will be piloted this summer in approximately 100 general FE, 6<sup>(th)</sup> form colleges and work-based learning providers. It will enable further education institutions to use a single performance management framework, with common sets of data and performance indicators instead of a number of different frameworks. Thus the framework will be more streamlined than existing arrangements and should help to reduce bureaucracy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1857W.8/1">The Office for Fair Access (OFFA) requires institutions in their annual monitoring returns to report on the amount of spend on bursaries and scholarships disbursed to low income and other under-represented groups. OFFA is then under a statutory duty to provide an annual report to Parliament containing an overview of progress. Monitoring returns are due at the end of the academic year (end of July 2007). OFFA will analyse the returns over the summer and publish a short report on the findings of the monitoring process in autumn/winter 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.1857W.8/2">OFFA has successfully ensured that all institutions that have chosen to set fees above the basic level have successfully completed an access agreement. As a result these institutions are forecast to deliver in excess of &pound;300 million per year in bursaries to students. I am aware that concerns have been raised about a potential underspend on bursaries in some universities. As I said in the Higher Education debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1857W.8/3" class="indent">'I have been monitoring that situation very closely. The overall scale of underspend has been exaggerated in some reports. In several universities, including a significant number in the Russell group, the projections are that there will be no underspend at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.1857W.8/4" class="indent">Forecasts of spend inevitably carry with them some uncertainty, especially in the first year of an entirely new bursary scheme, and some universities set a high figure for reasons of prudent financial management. I am not in the business of unfairly or unjustly criticising people. OFFA will monitor expenditure and performance annually, and we will have a full picture of year 1 after the relevant monitoring information has been collected this summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1857W.8/5" class="indent">At the same time, universities should be doing all they can to ensure that students get the support to which they are entitled. In recent weeks, several vice-chancellors have explicitly said to me that they intend to invest any underspend in their original bursary estimates on other measures to improve social inclusion. One of them told me:</p>
	<p pid="b.1857W.8/6" class="indent">&quot;The money for bursaries is 'budgeted out'. If it cannot be spent on bursaries, then it will go to support other widening participation projects.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1857W.8/7" class="indent">That is heartening. I would urge all universities forecasting a genuine underspend on bursaries to take that approach.'&mdash; [<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March 2007</phrase>; Vol. 458, c.494.]</p>

However, the Health and Safety Executive advise that asbestos was commonly used in buildings constructed between 1945 and 1980. It is a requirement that the duty-holder as defined in the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations keeps records of the location and condition of asbestos in all its buildings. For local authority maintained schools, the local authority as the employer is the duty-holder. The duty-holder is responsible for the safe management of asbestos. Removal is not a requirement and where the location and condition of the asbestos permits, it is often safer to manage the asbestos in-situ.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-05-03b.132379.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2007-05-03b.1861W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" colnum="1861W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070503/text/70503w0017.htm#07050384006843">
	<p pid="b.1861W.2/1">There are several ways to define low attainment and underperformance in relation to schools. The House of Commons Education Select Committee report of December 2003 recommended that a distinction should be drawn between low absolute levels of attainment (for example, a performance benchmark such as 25 per cent. five A*-C grades at GCSE) and low performance, which generally involves a value added measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1861W.2/2">Underperformance is particularly difficult to define with clarity. For example, by definition, 25 per cent. of all schools will appear in the bottom quartile of any performance measure, but the cohort of these schools will change year on year, so such schools are not necessarily persistent underperformers. Therefore, no schools have been formally classified as underperforming by DfES.</p>
	<p pid="b.1861W.2/3">For the purposes of this question, low attaining primary schools are defined as those at which fewer than 65 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved the target level 4 of the national curriculum in both English and mathematics in 2006 and where performance has been below 65 per cent. in both subjects for the previous three years. 65 per cent. is the minimum level set in the Department's floor targets for primary schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1861W.2/4">Low attaining secondary schools for the purpose of this question are defined as those in which less than 25 per cent. of 15-year-olds achieved five A*-C at GCSE or equivalent in 2006. 25 per cent. is the minimum level set in the Department's floor targets for secondary schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1861W.2/5">All low attaining schools are subject to support programmes, particularly those provided by the primary and secondary national strategies. Although we have not classified the schools as underperforming we have funded a programme that identified secondary schools that were likely to benefit from the raising attainment in teaching and learning (RAIL) initiative to tackle underperformance. A total of 764 schools are included in RAIL.</p>
	<p pid="b.1861W.2/6">The national strategies are continuing to work with all local authorities in using comparative data to help identify underperforming primary schools and to support them in raising standards of literacy and numeracy through interventions such as the Intensifying Support programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1861W.2/7">The following table gives the number of schools in each local authority based on the above criteria.</p>

	<p pid="b.1868W.8/2">Statements set out details of children's special educational needs, the provision to meet those needs and the school the child should attend. Once a statement is finalised local authorities are under a duty to arrange the specified provision. Of the new statements issued in 2006, 5,330 were for children placed in special schools. 4,870 children were placed in maintained special schools (including foundation schools); 110 were placed in non-maintained special schools; and 360 were placed in independent special schools. (Figures are taken from the SEN 2 Survey 2007 and are provisional.)</p>
	<p pid="b.1868W.8/3">The Department's team of SEN advisers following visits to all 150 local authorities, report proactive dialogue with parents on statutory assessment matters.

	<p pid="b.1868W.8/4">The outcomes achieved by vulnerable groups of learners, including many children with SEN, are improving, for example, the proportion of children with SEN (with and without statements) achieving 5 A* to C grades at GCSE continues to rise.</p>

	<p pid="b.1870W.2/1">Antisocial behaviour orders on conviction were introduced by the Police Reform Act 2002 to allow the courts to deal with the antisocial behaviour of a convicted individual in an effective and timely manner by removing the need for a separate application to be made on complaint to the magistrates court. The order is in addition to the criminal sentence and is considered separately from the criminal part of the proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1870W.2/2">An order on conviction has the same effect as an antisocial behaviour order and lasts a minimum of two years. Breach of the terms of the order is a criminal offence, whether the order was obtained on conviction or by way of a stand alone application.</p>
	<p pid="b.1870W.2/3">The effectiveness of the Government's antisocial behaviour policies has been assessed in two key independent reports published last year, by the National Audit Office and by the Youth Justice Board. Both confirmed that our twin track approach of support and enforcement is effective in protecting communities from antisocial behaviour. This is bringing results&mdash;nationally, the percentage of people who perceive high levels of antisocial behaviour has fallen from 21 per cent. in 2002-03 to 17 per cent. in 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="b.1884W.2/2">Provisional data from the Penalty Notices for Disorder (PNDs) Database showing the number of PNDs issued, broken down by offence and police force area, are provided in the tables.</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.2/3">The figures show that the PND has been an increasingly useful disposal option for the police in tackling low-level antisocial behaviour, providing them with a simple, non-bureaucratic financial punishment. The figures also show a wide variation in the numbers of PNDs issued for the same offence from force to force. This reflects the fact that the extent to which PNDs are used is a matter for individual forces according to their local operational factors and requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.2/4">Of the 192,583 PNDs issued in 2006, 74,182 penalties were paid within the 21-day suspended enforcement period (SEP) with a further 26,068 being outside the SEP. 21 days is the minimum period before forces can register a fine against the recipient for not responding to a notice, so forces can accept payments after the SEP for administrative purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1884W.2/5">Finalised data for 2006 will be available this summer.</p>
