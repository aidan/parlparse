The report concluded that most of today's core skills for home building will be very similar in future.

	<p pid="a.129W.6/1">Reference of the market to the Competition Commission is in the first place a matter for the independent sector regulator, Ofgem. The Secretary of State may only make a reference if Ofgem has decided not to do so or, after bringing to the attention of Ofgem information he considers relevant to the making of a reference, where he is not satisfied that Ofgem will make such a reference in a reasonable period. The Secretary of State must have reasonable grounds for suspecting that competition is not working effectively before making a referral.</p>
	<p pid="a.129W.6/2">Following the recent announcement of price increases by some energy suppliers, Ofgem has launched a review of the effectiveness of the retail energy market to see if further action is needed to protect customers. Ofgem plans to complete the review by March 2011 alongside its next quarterly report on retail and wholesale energy prices.</p>

	<p pid="a.130W.2/1">Most if not all of the networks likely to be affected by these proposals operate under exemptions from the requirement for an electricity or gas licence. These exemptions are deregulatory in that, in most cases, networks are not obliged to apply for an exemption. It is therefore difficult to estimate the number of networks affected, but there are likely to be significant numbers. As part of the recent consultation the Government published an impact assessment which estimated that of 93TWh of non-domestic, non-industrial electricity consumption (DUKES 2010) half is supplied through private networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.130W.2/2">The impact assessment can be found at the following link:</p>
	<p pid="a.130W.2/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/Consultations/698-third-party-access-exempt-networks-ia.pdf">http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/Consultations/698-third-party-access-exempt-networks-ia.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.130W.2/4">Ofgem will only need to approve tariff agreements in cases where third party access has been requested and the licence exempt network owner decides to make a charge for use of that network. Ofgem will also publish a generic charging methodology that companies can opt for and that this should aid Ofgem's ability to process tariffs agreements.</p>

	<p pid="a.139W.6/1">It is the Department for Transport's policy to resurface motorways and trunk roads with material with noise reducing properties when the existing surface needs replacing as part of its normal maintenance cycle.</p>
	<p pid="a.139W.6/2">The surface of the M54 in Staffordshire has not yet reached the stage where a full resurfacing scheme is justified and there have been no recent works other than minor routine patching schemes. A major surfacing renewal scheme was carried out on the M6 between junctions 12 and 13 in 2007. This means that combined with previous schemes, the length of motorway between junctions 10 and 13 has a low noise surface and no further schemes are proposed in the foreseeable future. Environmental barriers are being replaced on the M6 between junctions 8 and 10A as part of the current managed motorway scheme, which will open the hard shoulder as a running lane. Although the barriers provide some relief from noise, they are not specifically intended for noise reduction.</p>

Where third parties procure on behalf of the Department, its agencies or NDPBs, the contract with the third party will include a clause(s) requiring that all timber and timber derived products meet the Government's timber procurement policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.144W.9/1">All applications for funding under the Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE) are subject to an appraisal process that meets the requirements of the guidance for appraisal, delivery and evaluation produced jointly by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills, English Partnerships (now part of the Homes and Communities Agency), regional development agencies and the Office of Project and Programme Advice and Training. That appraisal process includes, among other issues, an assessment of the need for Government funding and any local displacement of existing business. The mid-term evaluation of the RDPE currently being undertaken is considering the additional funding provided through the programme and any displacement impacts.</p>

Before June 2007 ex gratia payments were made, based on individual valuations of the animals. However, we cannot disclose details of these payments as that would enable third parties to attribute the payments to a specific claimant. Information that would enable compensation to be attributed to specific claimants cannot be disclosed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

	<p pid="a.146W.0/3">A national, multi-agency register of flood rescue assets and the operational arrangements that will govern how they are used is being finalised, and will be co-ordinated by the Fire and Rescue Services' National Co-ordination Centre. To complement this, DEFRA has recently launched a grant scheme for flood rescue operators, including Fire and Rescue Authorities, to apply for funding to help improve national capability and meet the standards for flood rescue assets as defined in the FRCO. &#163;650,000 has been allocated to date and a further round of the grant scheme has been opened which will conclude in January 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.146W.0/4">DEFRA has also committed funding to raising the standard of existing teams to the required level, as articulated in the FRCO. This is important, as the consideration should be not only numbers of assets, but the standards of assets allowing them to be successfully utilised in flooding emergencies. DEFRA has committed such funding to Fire and Rescue Authorities as well as voluntary flood rescue organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.148W.2/1">DEFRA Ministers have held no discussions with EU colleagues on this issue. We do not consider the European Parliament's amendment 205 to the Food Information Regulation to be the correct way to address this, as we would like to see method of slaughter labelling considered in an animal welfare context.</p>
	<p pid="a.148W.2/2">However, we believe people should know what they are buying in shops and when they are eating out and we are discussing with food and catering industries whether labelling and point of sale information can play a greater role in giving consumers an informed choice about the food they buy.

	<p pid="a.150W.2/2"><i> </i>DEFRA does not recommend any treatment for animals suspected of carrying tuberculosis (TB). Treatment of cattle for TB is explicitly forbidden in both the domestic and EU tuberculosis control legislation. There are several sound scientific and public health reasons for this, including the fact that treatment can mask the reactions to the TB tests in infected animals, thus causing false negative results. In addition, there are no veterinary drugs licensed in the UK for the treatment of TB in cattle or other mammals.</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.2/3">The interferon-gamma test is the only ancillary blood test approved for the detection of TB infected cattle in the European Union. It is down to member states to define the specific circumstances in which this test is to be deployed in their territory, always in conjunction with the primary tuberculin skin test. The field procedures for blood testing of cattle herds are laid down in the Operations Manual of Animal Health. The laboratory methods are set out in the Veterinary Laboratories Agency standard operating laboratory procedures. In certain prescribed circumstances, the application of the interferon-gamma test in cattle herds is mandatory, whereas in other scenarios its use is subject to a degree of discretion, professional judgement and risk assessment by Animal Health veterinary officers.</p>

	<p pid="a.153W.2/2">Conflict prevention activity is funded primarily through a tri-departmental fund called the Conflict Pool. This is managed jointly by the Department for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Ministry of Defence. The Conflict Pool has existed in various forms since 2005 (as the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, Africa Conflict Prevention Pool and Conflict Prevention Pool). Funding for the Conflict Pool is provided through the spending round, separately from departmental expenditure limits. The FCO does not normally contribute additional funds from its own budget. However, in financial year 2009-10 the FCO contributed an additional &#163;2 million from its departmental budget towards a &#163;20 million uplift to the Afghanistan programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.153W.2/3">This financial year, the Conflict Pool is &#163;178.5 million and funds five programmes; four regional: Africa, the middle east, wider Europe and South Asia, and one thematic: Strategic Support to International Organisations. FCO spend through the Conflict Pool is listed in the departmental resource accounts available on the FCO website and in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.153W.2/4">In addition to programme activity funded through the Conflict Pool, a large part of the FCO's core bilateral work supports the Government's conflict prevention, peacebuilding and peacekeeping goals. As this is part of wider bilateral relationships, it is not possible to provide a separate figure for this.</p>

The Government are aware of this case and our embassies in Rabat and Algiers are following events closely.

A range of methods are used to engage with stakeholders and the methods used are selected in each circumstance on the basis of good practice, practicality and the other needs of all involved. Methods include forums, bilateral meetings, correspondence, telephone conversations, attendance at conferences and formal public consultations.</p>

	<p pid="a.162W.2/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus maintains contact with stakeholders and welcomes feedback that helps to improve the quality of the service it offers. Jobcentre Plus maintains regular contact with the National Autistic Society (NAS) who have provided a range of information including contact centre scripts and adviser training details. Jobcentre Plus also chairs a Hidden Impairments National Group with representatives from organisations supporting customers including those with autism. Representatives from both NAS and Autism Plus are members of this group. This group are in the process of developing &quot;e-cards&quot;, quickly and easily accessible, intranet based information. The &quot;e-cards&quot; will be available to all Jobcentre Plus staff via the intranet and will contain examples of the difficulties customers with hidden impairments may have in their daily lives as a consequence of their particular condition. These &quot;e-cards&quot; will outline the most appropriate reasonable adjustments Jobcentre Plus advisers can make for customers with hidden impairments and enable our staff to support these customers so that they can more easily access appropriate services.</p>
	<p pid="a.162W.2/6" class="indent">Last year Jobcentre Plus engaged with two autism telephone tutorials held by the Employers Forum on Disability at which Jobcentre Plus Disability Employment Advisers actively participated. Events such as these help to develop an even greater understanding of autism and the issues related to employment.</p>

	<p pid="a.163W.3/1">I am currently considering the proposals of HSE for delivering a renewed and effective health and safety regulatory service in the light of the challenges of reduced Government funding, in line with most other parts of the public sector, and also the recommendations made by Lord Young of Graffham in his report 'Common Sense, Common Safety', which the Government have accepted. At their heart will be the principle that those workplaces presenting low risks and good standards of compliance with health and safety laws should receive less inspection from the regulators. We will look to widen cost recovery in relation to businesses with a level of risk justifying a higher level of regulatory intervention or where material fault is found and enforcement action is necessary. We now have the opportunity to both reduce bureaucracy for business and put the emphasis back on addressing real risks and preventing death, injury and diseases to those at work and those affected by work-related activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.163W.3/2">With regard to the police and fire services the Government have accepted Lord Young's recommendations. The Health and Safety Executive is consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service regarding guidance for regulators on the application of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 to ensure that it is consistent with, and reflects the principles, already agreed with the two services, as set out in HSE's high level statements 'Striking the balance between operational and health and safety duties in the Police Service' and 'Striking the balance between operational and health and safety duties in the Fire and Rescue Service'.</p>

	<p pid="a.165W.3/3">More recently, BIS has been looking at how to make the public sector more innovative and as such have sponsored The key programme which is being delivered by DWP to develop a set of on-line innovation tools. These tools are being developed for use across the public sector to build innovation capability, in the interests of gaining efficiency savings, reducing duplication, stimulating the wider economy and encouraging innovation through competition and innovative procurement. The three component tools being developed are:</p>
	<p pid="a.165W.3/4" class="indent">'Idea Street' to capture staff ideas</p>
	<p pid="a.165W.3/5" class="indent">Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI)-an automated pre-commercial procurement tool to provide more flexibility in developing innovation</p>

	<p pid="a.165W.3/7">Within DWP we are taking a 'crowdsourcing' approach to encourage innovation amongst the Depts. staff. This involves using the 'Ideas Street' platform to set innovation challenges and engage with frontline staff to generate ideas around the challenges they face. The 'Idea Street' allows the 'crowd' to comment, develop and vote on the ideas. This process results in only the good ideas with support and approval ratings being put before a panel of experts who determine whether to develop a business case for approval by the change committee. A number of challenges are already in place for example:</p>
	<p pid="a.165W.3/8" class="indent">JCP Paper Reduction programme</p>
	<p pid="a.165W.3/9" class="indent">LEAN team</p>

	<p pid="a.165W.3/11" class="indent">Corporate IT cost reductions</p>
	<p pid="a.165W.3/12">This is intended to increase the breadth of challenges across the Department.</p>

	<p pid="a.170W.2/1">We expect universal credit to improve take-up in two ways. First, universal credit will be much simpler than the existing arrangements, so it will be easier for people to understand whether they have an entitlement. Secondly, universal credit replaces support that is currently provided through a number of different benefits and tax credits. Under the current system people need to claim separately for these different benefits whereas in universal credit this support will be available through a single claim.</p>
	<p pid="a.170W.2/2">Departmental estimates suggest that once universal credit has been fully implemented over 80% of people will take-up their full entitlement to universal credit, which translates to over 90% of overall potential universal credit expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.170W.2/3">This is a significant improvement on take-up under the current system:</p>

	<p pid="a.180W.5/1">Information about local authorities' discharge of their duties under homelessness legislation is collected on quarterly PIE returns. Summary information about English local housing authorities' actions under the homelessness legislation (part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected at local authority level, and published by the Department in the quarterly Statistical Release on Statutory Homelessness, available both in the Library of the House and via the CLG website:</p>
	<p pid="a.180W.5/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/homelessnessstatistics/publicationshomelessness/">http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/homelessnessstatistics/publicationshomelessness/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.180W.5/3">Data collected include the number of households accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty (to secure that suitable accommodation is available). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available and this information is also collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.180W.5/4">Information is also collected on rough sleeping. Since 1998, only councils in areas with a known, or suspected, rough sleeping problem were required to conduct an official rough sleeper count-which meant that only 70 councils submitted information to central Government. Figures published in July 2010 showed that under this previous method, on any given night there were 440 rough sleepers in England. However, when the remaining 256 councils provided estimates of the scale of the problem in their areas, this added a further estimated 807 rough sleepers-taking the national total to 1,247 rough sleepers on any given night.</p>
	<p pid="a.180W.5/5">Under new guidance all councils across England will now provide information on rough sleeping. This move follows consultation with homelessness charities and councils and is aimed at getting a clearer picture of the scale of the problem in each area so more targeted support can be provided to some of the most vulnerable in society.</p>
	<p pid="a.180W.5/6">Rough sleeping figures are published by the Department on the CLG website:</p>

	<p pid="a.183W.2/7" class="indent">The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) has issued professional guidance on this matter in its Local Authority Accounting Panel (LAAP) Bulletin 77, 'Local Authority Reserves and Balances', which was issued in November 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.2/8" class="indent">Under section 5(1)(e) of the Audit Commission Act, auditors have a duty to satisfy themselves that each local authority has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources. Auditors are required to do so by reference to criteria specified by the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.183W.2/9" class="indent">For 2010/11, the specified criteria include whether the authority has proper arrangements for securing financial resilience, and so the auditor will consider whether the authority has arrangements for determining its policies on reserves. This will include considering whether the authority has robust financial systems and processes to manage effectively financial risks and opportunities and to secure a stable financial position that enables it to continue to operate for the foreseeable future.</p>

	<p pid="a.184W.2/1">Over 2 million deposits worth &#163;1.88 billion are currently protected in one of the three tenancy deposit protection schemes. Although some landlords continue to have reservations, the majority have found access to a free adjudication service under the schemes helpful in resolving disputes. At the same time, tenants welcome the increased security the schemes offer to their money. In view of this, the Government are committed to ensuring that tenancy deposit protection continues in future. In this context, we will be taking steps to put in place new insurance schemes when the existing agreements expire in 2013. The current custodial scheme will be in place to 2016.</p>

	<p pid="a.196W.5/1">Current evidence of the impact of litigants in person on the justice system is limited. We are currently reviewing the existing data and research to inform the final impact assessments that will support the reforms to Legal Aid on which we are currently consulting. While the thrust of these reforms is to reduce recourse to the courts, we recognise that they will also potentially lead to an increase in litigants in person. We consider that the overall effect should not significantly impact on court or tribunal operating costs. There will be a post-implementation review of any reforms.</p>

	<p pid="a.227W.2/1">By working collaboratively with the United States, the UK is sharing the costs of designing and integrating a missile compartment.

At a difficult time our aim has been to ensure that the maximum amount of funding is spent at the front line, rather than on bureaucracy.

	<p pid="a.229W.6/4">Over 890 cultural or sporting projects across the UK have been awarded the Inspire mark. In the south-east 78 projects have been awarded Inspire marks, some of these projects are based in the southern coastal resorts. One example is Brighton and Hove Primary Schools Language and International Project which links 34 primary schools together, and encourages focused learning and inter-school activities to bring children together from across the city.</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.6/5">In addition, 204 contracts have been awarded by the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) to suppliers in the south-east and some of these suppliers are also based in southern coastal towns. One of the suppliers is Brighton and Hove city council which has provided business services and consultancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.6/6">So far 22,209 companies in the region have registered on Competefor (the website where London 2012 contract opportunities are advertised), and 169 contracts have been awarded to Competefor suppliers. Not all the information on 'supply chain' level contracts is in the public domain. There may be other companies that have secured 'supply chain' contracts in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.6/7">The Minister for Sport and Olympics has recently announced the 'Places People Play' programme, which will bring sporting legacy to life in communities across the country. This will be achieved by transforming the places where people play sport, inspiring people to make sport happen at a local level and creating sporting opportunities that give everyone the chance to become part of the mass participation legacy. Further detail can be found at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.229W.6/9">Locations across the UK, particularly those that are hosting international teams in pre-games training camps (PGTCs), have additional opportunities to realise the economic benefits of the games. 13 agreements have been signed with teams to hold PGTCs in the south-east.</p>
	<p pid="a.229W.6/10">In addition, enhancements to the Weymouth and Portland sailing venue were completed in November 2008. The National Sailing Academy will benefit from the improved facilities that the games will leave behind, providing a state-of-the-art facility for elite training, competition and local community use.</p>

	<p pid="a.232W.3/1">Budgetary responsibility lies with the Accounting Officers for the Law Officers' Departments. Nevertheless the Law Officers expect each of those Accounting Officers to ensure maximum value for money in respect of all expenditure and to ensure that any expenditure is necessary and appropriate. The information relating to specific LOD's is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.3/2">The Attorney-General's Office has no planned expenditure on conferences in 2010-11 other than for training purposes. Such events would only take place if there was a significant business need, and every effort would be made to maximise value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.3/3">The Treasury Solicitor's Department has no planned expenditure on conferences in 2010-11 other than for training purposes. In some years the Department has held an all staff conference but will not hold such a conference in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.3/4">The Government Legal Service (GLS) Secretariat, a part of the Department, usually organises an annual conference for GLS lawyers across Government, but no GLS conference will be held 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.3/5">HMCPSI has taken the following steps to reduce expenditure on conferences:</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.3/6" class="indent">No staff conferences are now held outside London.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.3/7" class="indent">Wherever possible HMCPSI facilities are used.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.3/8" class="indent">Where it is not possible to use HMCPSI facilities, other Government departmental facilities are used at nil cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.3/9" class="indent">Attendance at conferences for staff training purposes will be authorised only where there is a clear business need.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.3/10">The Serious Fraud Office's expenditure for conferences would have to be met within a tight budget framework given the need for the SFO to meet the reduction in funding following the comprehensive spending review, and therefore there would have to be a significant business need or spend to save opportunity for any conferences to go ahead. At present the SFO has no plans to hold any internal staff conferences.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.3/11">Attendance at conferences for staff training purposes will be authorised only where there is a clear business need.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.3/12">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), like other Government Departments, is subject to budget reductions and must make cost savings. The CPS has implemented a freeze on new Government advertising and marketing spend for the remainder of the financial year 2010-11. Conferences fall within this expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.3/13">If the CPS does run a conference or event, such as the annual Senior Managers' Conference, CPS premises rather than outside venues are used wherever possible to maximise value for money. Attendance at conferences for staff training purposes will be authorised only where there is a clear business need.</p>
	<p pid="a.232W.3/14">The National Fraud Authority (NFA), since May 2010, has observed the cross- Government guidance on marketing by Departments and has not funded any conferences. External conferences are only attended by the NFA where a highly compelling business requirement can be justified, identifying cost savings where possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.235W.9/1">There are different routes for a company to enter liquidation. Compulsory liquidations result from a winding-up order made by the court on the petition in most cases of a creditor. In a few cases the petition may be presented by a Government body such as the Insolvency Service in the public interest and very occasionally by the company itself. On the making of a winding-up order the Official Receiver is appointed as liquidator.</p>
	<p pid="a.235W.9/2">Creditors' voluntary liquidations result from an extraordinary resolution by a company's shareholders that an insolvency practitioner should be appointed as liquidator.</p>
	<p pid="a.235W.9/3">A liquidator in either type of liquidation does not carry out a criminal investigation. However, if any prima facie criminal offences come to their attention, they have a statutory duty to report such matters to the appropriate prosecuting authority, which in almost all liquidation cases is the Legal Services Directorate of the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), or to the relevant police authority, for them to decide whether to investigate the matters further.</p>
	<p pid="a.235W.9/4">The Legal Services Directorate of the BIS receives complaints from a number of sources (but predominantly the Insolvency Service) concerning misconduct during the insolvency of companies and individuals. It is not possible to identify from the case tracking system whether the case referred to and investigated by this directorate arose as a result of a compulsory or voluntary liquidation or indeed whether the company referred is not in liquidation at all. In addition, specific charges are not entered onto the case tracking system when proceedings are instituted by this department but rather the charges are entered when a plea is entered and a conviction and sentence or acquittal is recorded. The Legal Services Directorate are therefore unable to state how many charges have been brought in respect of liquidations in each of the last three years.</p>

	<p pid="a.236W.5/3">The Office of Fair Trading does not have a separate Consumer Affairs branch. Since 2006 its structure has been arranged by markets rather than legislation, enabling it to look more easily at whole markets and to use all of the competition and consumer protection tools available to it to improve them where they are not operating effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.244W.5/2">Re-export controls are unenforceable. Once a good has left the UK, it is in practice under the jurisdiction of the destination country. We would be claiming that UK export controls applied, whereas in reality we would have no powers to enforce them.</p>
	<p pid="a.244W.5/3">We do agree that it is undesirable for UK-origin goods to be re-exported to destinations or end-users of concern. That is why the risk of undesirable re-export is embedded in our assessment of licence applications: where the risk of such a re-export is sufficiently high, an export licence will not be granted.</p>
	<p pid="a.244W.5/4">If a re-export of concern comes to light we can and do factor that in to our assessment of subsequent licence applications for similar goods to that destination. In practice, a re-export control would give us no extra powers.</p>

	<p pid="a.246W.5/3">The outsourcing of the research function in its entirety would not have met the statement of requirement for the new vessel, particularly in respect of the enduring need to provide barter, swap and collaboration opportunities to deliver world-class multi-disciplinary marine science.</p>
	<p pid="a.246W.5/4">As part of its comprehensive review of ship operations in 2008/9, NERC concluded that the lack of guaranteed availability of vessels with the right capabilities to deliver world-class multi-disciplinary science programmes precluded exercising an option to charter in research ship time to replace the RRS Discovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.246W.5/5">NERC sought bids for a long-term maintenance contract option as part of the production of the RRS Discovery replacement.

In November 2008, NERC Council agreed a revised funding envelope of &#163;70 million to &#163;75 million to encompass an extended project scope and the latest market intelligence information on shipbuilding, material costs, and design risk, and to allow for the prevailing currency weakness.

	<p pid="a.247W.12/1">The decision to appoint Skipsteknisk AS as the lead design authority the replacement of RRS Discovery was taken by the shipyard (C.N.P. Freire SA) as part of its bid to build the vessel, not the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).</p>
	<p pid="a.247W.12/2">Skipsteknisk AS is a world renowned and leading designer of research ships. It designed the RRS James Cook which has been deployed extensively by the NERC on research projects with little or no downtime since delivery in August 2006. The appointment of Skipsteknisk AS is allowing NERC the benefit of improving on areas of design utilising lessons learned from the RRS James Cook Project.</p>

	<p pid="a.248W.2/1">The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) formally reviewed eight options in its assessment of a requirement to deliver an enduring marine science capability. Utilising private sector capability for scientific data acquisition was subject to a formal business case assessment as a 'Charter' option. This option was not pursued as it provided the weakest value for money case in net present value terms in accordance with HM Treasury Green Book guidance. A thorough assessment of the qualifying submissions which included long-term maintenance responses was conducted and NERC concluded that a design and build was the most affordable and practical approach at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.2/2">The private sector currently has the ability to collect routine survey data sets; however few private sector vessels are capable of acquiring the complex multi-disciplinary data sets required simultaneously in support of UK marine research interests. This is primarily because the private sector platforms are optimised to collect data of specific types, whereas the NERC research vessels have been designed to perform multi-disciplinary science ranging from the atmosphere to the sub seabed, as an increasing trend in marine research is the inter-action between biological, chemical, physical and geological processes.</p>

	<p pid="a.255W.11/1">Since his appointment, the Secretary of State for Education has introduced a number of significant steps to reduce levels of educational under-achievement. First, the Academies Act 2010 enabled the expansion of the Academy programme and the introduction of free schools to offer schools more freedom and autonomy in their drive to tackle under-achievement. Furthermore, in the Education White Paper presented before the House, the Secretary of State has outlined reforms to reduce educational under-achievement through measures to support teachers and the teaching profession, ensure rigorous standards in the classroom and help schools to drive their own improvement. This includes a new focus on higher floor standards in both primary and secondary phases.</p>

However, the normal arrangement is that two additional legal agreements are put in place.

Second, a principal agreement made between the local authority, the academy trust and the Secretary of State, which contains indemnification for the authority in relation to various obligations of the Academy. When a PFI school applies to convert, officials provide specific advice and guidance. We do not expect that any free schools would be subject to an existing PFI contract, but if they were, similar arrangements would apply.</p>
