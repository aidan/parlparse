The consultation will discuss the best ways to improve access to the English coast, including costs and any legislative changes needed to support their implementation.

	<p pid="b.1343W.5/1">The Countryside Agency, along with its Natural England partners English Nature and the Rural Development Service, has carried out a detailed data-gathering exercise to support a comprehensive picture of the English coast and existing access provision. This work includes in-depth investigation, testing and costing of a number of possible ways to improve access, and ways to maximise landscape, historic environment and wildlife benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.1343W.5/2">In 2005 the Countryside Agency carried out short studies of six different parts of the English coast to gain an understanding of different coastal environments. In January 2006 the Natural England Partnership selected four study areas in which they are exploring coastal access issues in greater depth. These areas, selected to reflect the diversity of the English coast, are the Suffolk Coast, Southern Cumbrian Coast and Morecambe Bay, County Durham and Hartlepool Coast, North Devon, Exmoor and the West Somerset Coast.</p>
	<p pid="b.1343W.5/3">The Countryside Agency has also commissioned a study to examine how coastal access works in other European countries and what might be learnt from their experience. Further survey work is being done to assess current public knowledge about the demand for and use of coastal access, along with research into the costs of possible options to improve coastal access.</p>

	<p pid="b.1360W.5/1">Exceptionally, an interim payment of compensation in respect of a miscarriage of justice may be made by the Home Secretary, on the advice of the independent Assessor, before the final amount is determined. The amount of any interim payment will be paid on account and will be deducted from the final award. The Assessor's consideration of whether, and how much, interim payment might be made in a particular case is based on the information available to him about the miscarriage of justice in respect of which compensation is being paid and the consequences which flowed from it, not simply on what the applicant's financial needs are at the time. In very exceptional circumstances interim payments may be made on compassionate grounds depending on the circumstances and provided the payment is within the scope of compensation under the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1360W.8/1">The independent Assessor for compensation for miscarriages of justice does not generally correspond directly with applicants or their legal representatives. All correspondence is handled by the Miscarriages of Justice Team in the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. They attempt to resolve any apparent discrepancies in the submissions from applicants or their representatives, to ensure that the Assessor has all the information he needs to make an assessment. Claims for compensation can amount to hundreds of thousands of pounds and some run into millions. Claims are complex and time consuming and often require investigation by forensic accountants, and, on occasion, high-level legal advice. In many cases an interim award is paid before a final assessment of compensation is made. All correspondence requiring a response should receive an interim or substantive response within the Home Office target of 20 working days. In the circumstances of these applications an interim reply is often unavoidable. Detailed statistics on performance against target for correspondence for this work are not immediately available and I will write to the hon. Member as soon as possible with performance figures for the last quarter.</p>

	<p pid="b.1365W.0/2">The SIA do not calculate the mean or modal period processing times for applications. Some, such as those involving overseas criminal records checks, unavoidably take a considerable time. The SIA have a published target of processing 80 per cent. of all applications within six weeks, measured from the date that a properly completed application enters the processing system to the date that a licence is issued. From April 2004 until August 2005 the SIA processed 62 per cent. within six weeks and 88 per cent. within nine weeks. Since September 2005, there has been a backlog of applications that have been waiting to enter the system. These have added an additional time of between two and four weeks to the process, so it is now taking up to 10 weeks to process most applications.</p>

The same information, by region, can be found in the Public Library Statistics published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.</p>

I have written to the leaders of all the 149 library authorities in England asking them to consider carefully what would be lost through closures.

	<p pid="b.1370W.5/4">Although some proposals remain it is too early to speculate on their likely outcome. However, my officials continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

	<p pid="b.1377W.4/1">The delivery of the Northern Way initiative is the responsibility of the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Cabinet Office will support the Department for Communities and Local Government in delivering their agenda around social exclusion. In addition, my role is to build on the achievements of the Government to date and spearhead a renewed drive to address the most socially excluded in our society. This will include chairing the new Cabinet Committee on Social Exclusion and publishing an Action Plan in the autumn setting out how we will reach the most excluded. The immediate priority will be to focus on the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.1377W.4/2">improving the early identification of the most at-risk households, individuals and children; children in care; teenage pregnancy; mental illness; and supporting ongoing work by the Respect Unit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1377W.4/3">We are also producing a 10 year review of the long-term trends and drivers of social exclusion and the systemic reform needed to address them.</p>

During 2003, a further six individuals were transferred to US custody in different circumstances. Four individuals, who have since been released, were transferred to US custody and held at Abu Ghraib. Two individuals classified as High Value Targets were taken into custody by the UK and subsequently transferred to US custody. They were subsequently transferred to the jurisdiction of the Iraq Special tribunal, although they remain in US physical custody.</p>

This challenge is not just to the education service, but also to business and employers to engage and to contribute to what young people learn and experience during their time at school and college. The future funding and organisational arrangements must reflect this changing agenda. For example, the Government have given a significant increase in funds this financial year for enterprise and the development of the vocational curriculum&mdash;these funds have been targeted at schools, and not providers. It is for the schools themselves to determine which providers can best meet the individual needs of their pupils in the light of the school's circumstances. I have no doubt that the best providers will continue to deliver high quality provision.</p>

The 10 year science and innovation investment framework, published two years ago jointly by Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Education and Skills, sets out a range of measures to develop a strong supply of scientists, engineers and technologists. It is a matter for each individual higher education institution to decide which courses to offer, including whether to offer courses related to nuclear science.</p>

	<p pid="b.1405W.3/1">It is not the Departments policy that primary schools in England with fewer than 100 pupils should be closed. Local authorities are responsible for balancing the supply and demand of places in their areas to ensure schools serve the needs of their local communities and provide good quality education in the most cost effective way. As part of this, they need to determine the numbers and sizes of schools they need, taking into account the views and aspirations of parents and other stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="b.1405W.3/2">Many small schools are also rural schools and there is a presumption against the closure of these schools. Although this does not mean that no rural school will ever close, the case for closure needs to be strong and clearly in the best interests of education provision in the area. Since the presumption was introduced in February 1998 the number of rural schools approved for closure has fallen from an average of 30 a year to six a year. Statutory guidance to school organisation committees and the schools adjudicator also makes clear that they must not assume a school must be of a certain size to be a good school.</p>

	<p pid="b.1408W.2/1">On June 2, the United Nations General Assembly agreed a Political Declaration which provides a political blueprint for achieving Universal Access. It sets out commitments for countries to develop, by the end of 2006, ambitious national plans to scale up towards universal access by 2010. The commitments include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1408W.2/2">working towards comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care and support, with interim targets for 2008;</p>
	<p pid="b.1408W.2/3">providing $20 to 23 billion annually by 2010 for AIDS responses;</p>
	<p pid="b.1408W.2/4">promoting the rights and reducing the vulnerability of sex workers, men who have sex with men, children, women, adolescent girls and drug users;</p>
	<p pid="b.1408W.2/5">intensifying efforts to develop new technology especially microbicides and vaccines; ensuring that no credible, sustainable national plan should go unfunded; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1408W.2/6">strengthening countries' capacity to use the flexibilities within TRIPS because of their importance in protecting public health.</p>
	<p pid="b.1408W.2/7">The UK delegation&mdash;led by my right. hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development and by the Minister of State for Public Health, including four representatives from civil society, two parliamentarians and one representative from the Overseas Territories&mdash;played an active role in the difficult negotiations which led to the agreement of this Declaration. The document broadly reflects the core issues that the UK wanted to see included. We would have preferred to see explicit reference to vulnerable groups&mdash;sex workers, men who have sex with men, drug users, prisoners and migrants. But the Declaration does commit to promote the rights of these groups. As such, it presents progress&mdash;something which will promote future action towards universal access, and that can be used as the basis for future discussions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1412W.8/1">The World Summit on the Information Society, which met in Tunis in November 2005, recommended the creation of an Internet Governance Forum (IGF) to bring together industry, civil society and governments to look at important Internet issues such as freedom of expression and the free flow of information, security and user protection, linguistic diversity, and the digital divide.</p>
	<p pid="b.1412W.8/2">In January 2006, DTI hosted a UK consultation on the IGF, and the conclusions of this meeting have been fed into the international consultation and are published on the IGF website (<a href="http://www.intgovforum.org/contributions/igf.pdf">http://www. intgovforum.org/contributions/igf.pdf</a>). The creation of a forum where stakeholders can meet on an equal footing is seen as a positive step: industry, civil society and users working with governments can develop practical ways of addressing concerns on the use and misuse of the Internet. The IGF should be open and inclusive, and focus on a few topics.</p>
	<p pid="b.1412W.8/3">We now want industry and civil society to take the lead in preparing for the first IGF meeting in October. I am pleased that Nominet, the registry for dot.uk Internet domain names is organising a first meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-04">4 July 2006</phrase> in the Houses of Parliament, bringing together industry, civil society, and government.
