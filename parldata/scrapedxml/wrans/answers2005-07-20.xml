	<p pid=".1704W.0/1">The Government's decision to implement section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 will give effect to recommendations made nearly 20 years ago by Lord Roskill's Fraud Trials Committee, and more recently by Sir Robin Auld in his &quot;Review of the Criminal Courts&quot;, that the most serious and complex fraud cases should be heard without a jury. The justification for the change is that the efforts made by the prosecution and the court to keep such cases to a manageable length mean that sometimes the defendant cannot be tried for charges that fully expose the extent of the criminality alleged. Moreover, notwithstanding these efforts, some trials are inordinately long and impose an unreasonable burden on juries, whose members ask to be excused and sometimes as a result the jury becomes unrepresentative. In other cases the number of jurors can fall worryingly low because jurors cannot continue to serve for a prolonged period.</p>

	<p pid=".1710W.8/2">Non-GM crops can only be cross-pollinated by GM crops of the same or very closely related species. In addition, for some crops like beet or potatoes, cross-pollination does not affect the harvested material, so if a GM variety cross-pollinated a non-GM variety, the produce of the latter would not have any GM content. Pollen produced by crop plants may be dispersed by insects or on the wind. The frequency of cross-pollination events between crops decreases with distance, but it is known that they may occur infrequently over very long distances.

	<p pid=".1711W.6/1">Local authorities only started reviewing and assessing local air quality from 1997 onwards.</p>
	<p pid=".1711W.6/2">Within Hertfordshire, only two authorities have currently designated air quality management areas (AQMAs). Firstly, St. Albans city and district council designated six AQMAs in September 2002 in respect of the annual mean nitrogen dioxide objective. Following the further review and assessment which concluded that there had been an over-estimation of the levels of nitrogen dioxide, five of the AQMAs were revoked, which left one remaining AQMA close to the M25. Furthermore, following the second round of air quality reviews and assessments which started in May 2003, St. Albans declared two more AQMAs in November 2004; one area at the M1 junction 7 with M10; and the other comprising properties in London road, city centre.</p>
	<p pid=".1711W.6/3">The other authority in Hertfordshire, Hertsmere borough council declared 14 AQMAs in September 2001; 10 of which were revoked in 2003. Following the second round of reviews and assessments Hertsmere declared a further two AQMAs in January 2005 bringing the total to six in their borough in respect of nitrogen dioxide, all of which relate to local road transport.</p>
	<p pid=".1711W.6/4">DEFRA does not have an equivalent to the local air quality management system for noise; therefore no noise management area system was in place in 1997 or is in place now. However, legislation exists that allows local authorities to investigate and if necessary mitigate or control noise issues when they occur.</p>

	<p pid=".1712W.0/1">Defra has not assessed the effect of poor air quality on the structure of historic buildings in St. Albans. The effect of acid rain on materials has been studied by the then Department of the Environment through the National Materials Exposure Programme (NMEP). This was initiated by Building Effects Review Group (BERG) in 1987 and consisted of 29 sites. The UK NMEP was part of the International Materials Exposure Programme set up under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe framework. The UK continues to maintain sites in London and Lincoln as part of this programme. Details of this programme can be found at <a href="http://www.unece.org/env/wge/materials.htm">www.unece.org/env/wge/materials.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".1712W.0/2">In recent years concern for the effects of pollutants on heritage buildings has focussed on the multipollutant atmospheres found in modern urban areas. In cities such as St. Albans where brick is commonly used the main concern is the soiling of facades by particulates from vehicles. Details can be found at http://www.corr-institute.se/MULTI-ASSESS/</p>
	<p pid=".1712W.0/3">The pollutants that form acid rain are principally sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. These are released from the combustion of fossil fuels like coal and oil. The UK is a party to several protocols under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Pollution aimed at reducing emissions of acidifying gases. The UK has also agreed to meet emissions ceilings according to the national emissions ceilings directive. National emissions of sulphur dioxide have reduced from 3,721 kilotonnes in 1990 to 1,002 kilotonnes in 2002; and national emissions of nitrogen oxides have reduced from 2,771 kilotonnes in 1990 to 1,582 kilotonnes in 2002. These improvements are due mainly to reduced emissions from electricity generation, industry, domestic heating and road transport.</p>
	<p pid=".1712W.0/4">St. Albans city and district council has designated three air quality management areas in respect of the annual mean nitrogen dioxide objective which has to be achieved by end of December 2005; one of the air quality management areas designated in November 2004 comprises properties in London Road, central St. Albans and this relates to emissions from local road transport.</p>
	<p pid=".1712W.0/5">Once a local authority has designated an air quality management area, it has a duty to take action, along with other stakeholders, to work towards meeting the air quality objective(s). Where local road transport is identified as a major source of local air pollution concentrations, those local authorities are being recommended to integrate their air quality action plans into the local transport plan. St. Albans city and district council will therefore be working with Hertfordshire county council to take forward measures to tackle the emissions sources within the city centre.</p>

	<p pid=".1718W.12/4" class="indent">I enclose a table showing the number of adults who were in some form of education funded by the LSC or by the Higher Education Funding Council in 2003/04 (the most recent figures available). Please note that the table I've enclosed shows the number of people who are resident of one of the London boroughs who are in education either in London or elsewhere. This definition has been chosen as it is the best way to make sense of a proportion based on resident population, in response to your specific request. This is not the same as the number of adults who are accessing learning in an institution within a particular borough.</p>

	<p pid=".1718W.12/6" class="indent">Overall, figures show that 15 per cent. of the adult population in London accessed some form of education in Further Education (FE), Adult and Community Learning (ACL) or Higher Education (HE) in 2003&ndash;04. Just over half of this provision was in FE, about a third in HE with the remaining one-sixth in ACL.</p>
	<p pid=".1718W.12/7" class="indent">In addition, a further 50,000 adults in London accessed learning through Ufl and 3,000 were participating in work based learning.</p>
	<p pid=".1718W.12/8" class="indent">The percentages by borough vary from 11 per cent. to 20 per cent. Interestingly, the boroughs with the highest proportions of adults in learning tend to be in the inner London boroughs. More than 18 per cent. of adults in Lambeth, Hackney, Islington, Newham, Waltham Forest, Haringey, Brent and Lewisham were accessing learning in 2003&ndash;04.</p>

	<p pid=".1720W.5/1">Data on bullying is not collected centrally and there is no reliable basis for an estimate of prevalence in Lancashire and the Ribble Valley. Bullying cases appear to be reported more often now than previously but we have no hard evidence that bullying is increasing or affecting more children. Indeed, as children and young people increasingly feel safe at school to report bullying, and confident that it will be tackled effectively and sensitively, it is likely reporting will rise.</p>
	<p pid=".1720W.5/2">However, any level of bullying is too high and we are determined to help schools tackle the problem. Our guidance pack &quot;Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;, the anti-bullying Charter and the anti-bullying website <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying">www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying</a> offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying. We also offer specific advice to schools on tackling homophobic bullying and are developing advice on racist bullying.</p>

	<p pid=".1748W.25/1">The sorting of incoming Parliamentary mail, its preparation for delivery or forwarding, and collection and despatch of outward mail, have been provided by Royal Mail to both Houses for many years on an informal contractual basis, subject to annual revision in line with rising costs. In 2004 it was decided that, in order to comply with EU procurement rules and to ensure value for money, these mail services would be the subject of a full tender exercise. Following the placing of an advertisement in the <i>Official Journal,</i> and the drafting of a full specification, four companies, including Royal Mail, were invited to tender. The award of the contract to Royal Mail, subject to agreement of detailed contractual terms, is being announced today to the parties concerned. It will run for three years from August 2005. Costs for the service are expected to be between &pound;1 million and &pound;1.5 million a year.</p>
	<p pid=".1748W.25/2">The new contract will provide for a significantly enhanced service to Parliament. More mail will be delivered to offices first thing in the morning; the 7pm collection will apply to all post boxes on the estate; forwarding will be more efficiently handled off-site; and there will be a rigorous and robust set of service standards, with regular service reviews and customer input. The price will be reviewed in line with RPI over years two and three of the contract.</p>
	<p pid=".1748W.25/3">This contract is quite separate from that for off-site screening of incoming mail, which will from August 2005 be carried out by Pitney Bowes under a separate contract let in 2004, and the provision by post office counters of postal services at its three outlets on the estate.</p>

	<p pid=".1749W.6/1">I have recently replied to a letter from Dr. John Low, Chief Executive of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf (RNID) and the Department has also responded to a letter from Mr. Chris Underwood who is the RNID's Campaign Manager. Both raised concerns about the 50dB threshold used to determine eligibility for awards under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme where bilateral noise induced sensorineural hearing loss has resulted from military service. I have offered to meet Dr. Low to discuss his concerns.</p>

Provided all training and medical standards have been met, soldiers are deemed fit to deploy to theatres and at this stage the majority will join a regular unit, for up to two months prior to deployment, where they will undergo further integration and training.</p>

	<p pid=".1773W.6/2">The Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation was established in October 2003. Since then the Corporation has focussed on the development of its strategic plans and strategies with particular emphasis on corporate governance, business planning, regeneration, development control and spatial land use issues. The Corporation has also worked with local and regional partners with respect to the preparation of a broad programme of capital interventions, which will kick start the regeneration and growth of the area. Funding for the Corporation's first capital project (a regional RSPB Visitors Centre at Rainham Marshes) was announced in June 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1773W.6/3">The appointment of the chief executive was announced by the Corporation on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-14">14 October 2004</phrase>. He took up the post on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-18">18 October 2004</phrase>. To <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, the total cost of setting up the Corporation was &pound;1,321,927. An Order making the Corporation the local planning authority for strategic development will be laid before Parliament shortly under the negative resolution procedure. The acute lack of office accommodation in Thurrock has prevented the Corporation from establishing itself in the Thurrock area. However the organisation will be moving to their new offices in Thurrock (Gateway House, Purfleet) at the beginning of August 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".1776W.6/1">Trafficking in human beings, for any purpose, is a particularly abhorrent crime and the UK is committed to taking firm action to combat it.</p>
	<p pid=".1776W.6/2">Since accession, all nationals of the new EU member states have rights of free movement throughout the EU. The UK also provides full access to its labour market to workers from the new member states through the worker registration scheme. A national from a new member state can therefore move to and work legally in the United Kingdom. But there is self-evidently a very clear distinction between voluntary movement of this sort and trafficking.</p>
	<p pid=".1776W.6/3">Trafficking is a priority issue for the UK's presidency of the EU. We aim to bring a particular focus on raising best practice, by improving the exchange of law enforcement information and supporting the development of intelligence-led policing. As presidency we will also work closely with other EU member states and the Commission on developing an EU plan to combat human trafficking, which provides a balanced and coherent framework that will support the efforts of law enforcement and protect the victims of trafficking. We will also continue to work closely with the relevant international organisations, UN agencies and NGOs.</p>
	<p pid=".1776W.6/4">Nationally, as part of the UK's work to tackle organised immigration crime, the UK has established, under a multi-agency taskforce known as Reflex, a network of immigration liaison officers covering 23 key source and transit countries in Europe. One of Reflex's three key objectives is to target human trafficking and recent successful operations have specifically targeted the trafficking of women from Eastern Europe.</p>
	<p pid=".1776W.6/5">From the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, we have funded a number of projects to help combat the trafficking of young women from Eastern Europe, including through providing advisors to the Bulgarian and Macedonian Anti-Human Trafficking and Smuggling Units, support for Polish-Ukrainian cross-border co-operation and a project which raises awareness in Lithuania about the dangers of bogus employment agencies and facilitators and provides assistance to victims of trafficking.</p>

	<p pid=".1777W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-13">13 June 2005</phrase>, the EU's General Affairs External Relations Council (GAERC) called on the Uzbek Government to allow an international independent inquiry into the events of 12&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-05-13">13 May 2005</phrase> in Andizhan. The Uzbek President, Islam Karimov, responded to the repeated calls of the international community to allow such an investigation by creating a parliamentary committee, and inviting diplomats from the US, France, Russia, China and Uzbekistan's regional neighbours to observe its work. We and our EU partners, however, considered this an inadequate response, on the grounds that the enquiry needed to be external and independent.</p>
	<p pid=".1777W.5/2">The partnership and co-operation agreement (PCA) enshrines the basis of EU-Uzbekistan relations: mutual respect for the principles of democracy, rule of law, and human rights. There is growing evidence, such as the recent Office for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) report, which draws on the testimony of eyewitnesses now in Kyrgyzstan, that the Uzbek authorities used disproportionate and indiscriminate force in Andizhan. As presidency of the EU, we and our partners have condemned the Uzbek leadership for breaching these principles.</p>
	<p pid=".1777W.5/3">The EU is currently reviewing certain trade-related elements of the PCA, and cancelled the sub-committee on Trade and Investment meeting scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-13">13 July 2005</phrase>. We have also delayed consideration of President Karimov's March 2005 proposals for a further deepening of EU-Uzbek relations under the PCA.</p>
	<p pid=".1777W.5/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July 2005</phrase>, the GAERC invited Mr. Jan Kubis, the EU's newly appointed special representative for Central Asia, to visit the region as soon as possible. The EU will consider further appropriate action in the light of Mr. Kubis' report. The GAERC will, in particular, keep under review the case for suspension of further elements of the PCA, the introduction of an embargo on exports to Uzbekistan of arms, military equipment which might be used for internal repression, as well as other targeted measures.</p>

	<p pid=".1781W.5/1">Respondents over the age of 60 are not asked to undertake British Crime Survey (BCS) self-completions. Traditionally, this has been because older people are sometimes less able or willing to use the laptop computers. There is evidence from the BCS that older respondents in the 16 to 59 age group are more likely to require interviewer assistance for the self-completion (see Budd and Mattinson, 2000). There is, however, also anecdotal evidence from interviewers and survey companies to suggest that this is increasingly less of a problem.</p>
	<p pid=".1781W.5/2">However, the decision to limit the upper age range has remained, primarily for research reasons. Inclusion of the 60 and over age group in modules relating to 'interpersonal violence' issues (such as sexual victimisation) is methodologically problematic. The issue of 'elder abuse' (in common with the issue of child abuse) tends to be explored in a different context, using dedicated surveys.</p>

	<p pid=".1784W.2/1">The UK Passport Service purchased 1,200 umbrellas in 1999 due to the abnormal situation of those calling personally at our offices having to queue in the rain. The appointment system that has operated in all offices since 2002 resulted in the umbrellas no longer being required and they were donated to the charity, Oxfam. In 2004&ndash;05, 94 per cent. of customers that applied personally were seen within 20 minutes of their appointment time.

The Department is paying a fixed cost for the development and introduction of XHIBIT to all courts in England and Wales, and so is not charged on an individual court basis. XHIBIT will be in use in all 101 Crown court centres across England and Wales by April next year. The total charge to introduce and operate the system will be &pound;20 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1788W.0/2">The decision to introduce nationally was based on pilots in Essex and at Snaresbrook Crown Court. These pilots, along with an assessment of the first 11 courts to receive XHIBIT, is showing that the new system is making Crown courts more effective. For example, it reduces the clerical effort required to capture and distribute hearing information, such as, results, bail orders and imprisonment orders. Previously, such information took days to reach other criminal justice agencies, now they can get it in minutes allowing them to operate better. Local assessment of XHIBIT's effectiveness in Lincoln is scheduled for September 2005. XHIBIT's reliability is currently above that which the supplier is contracted to provide. This is monitored on a daily basis by the XHIBIT National Support Centre.</p>

	<p pid=".1792W.8/1">Urban traffic control techniques are a key part of the delivery of sustainable local transport. The introduction of traffic signal control at individual junctions or over wide areas often requires a balance of the conflicting demands of vehicular traffic capacity and provision for vulnerable users such as pedestrians.</p>
	<p pid=".1792W.8/2">Studies have shown that good, coordinated traffic signal operation can reduce delays to traffic which in turn can lead to reductions in pollution. Benefits will vary from site to site but typical delay reductions due to coordinated operation under the SCOOT urban traffic control system, used in many UK towns and cities, compared with un-coordinated operation were measured as 23 per cent. in Worcester and 30 per cent. in Southampton.</p>
	<p pid=".1792W.8/3">The Department commissioned a research project in 2003 to explore how casualty rates for pedestrians and cyclists are affected by traffic signal control strategies and ways of operating. It is intended that the findings of the project will form good practice guidance for local highway authorities who have responsibility for managing traffic in urban areas. The project is due to report around the end of 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".1794W.2/1">The trial began in January 2004 and is due to finish in December 2005, although London and seven other cities taking part in similar trials are currently in discussions with the European Commission about extending the project for a further year.</p>
	<p pid=".1794W.2/2">We estimate that the total costs of the London trial will amount to over &pound;3 million. Costs have been shared among a number of partners. The European Commission provided just over &pound;1 million of support, and the UK Government provided just under &pound;500,000 through the Department for Transport's New Vehicle Technology Fund programme. The trial was overseen by Transport for London and a number of other project partners provided financial and other support including London Bus Services Ltd., FirstGroup, Daimler-Chrysler, Ballard, BP and the Energy Savings Trust.</p>
	<p pid=".1794W.2/3">Comparing the purchase, maintenance and running costs of the hydrogen fuel cell buses against conventionally fuelled buses is neither straightforward nor meaningful. The hydrogen fuel cell buses are prototype vehicles which are not mass produced or commercially available. The approximate cost of each fuel cell bus was around &pound;900,000, which is some seven times the cost of a similar, new diesel bus, but this cost included maintenance costs for the duration of the trial. As to running costs, the hydrogen fuel was granted a fuel duty exemption for the duration of the trial, making a direct comparison with the costs of diesel fuel difficult.</p>

	<p pid=".1796W.2/51">The need to carry out works in a way that ensures the safety of the travelling public means that it is not always possible to carry out planned works consecutively.</p>
	<p pid=".1796W.2/52">To minimise disruption all planned routine maintenance works to the motorway network are carried out at night, when traffic volumes are at their lowest. These works are generally phased so that there are at least 10 kilometres between each set of works. Roadworks are also planned so that the length of road restricted by traffic management is generally no greater than 4.5 kilometres in length. There will be times when the application of this restriction may be untenable or unsafe and in such cases the impact on the travelling public is of primary concern when considering whether adjacent schemes should go ahead concurrently.</p>
	<p pid=".1796W.2/53">It is sometimes necessary to close lanes on the motorway at short notice due to incidents. The Agency aims to keep these closures and disruption to a minimum. Likewise when major maintenance is necessary lanes are closed over a period of time. Any associated routine maintenance works are undertaken during these periods in order to avoid further inconvenience to motorists and to minimise the safety risks for our workforce.</p>

	<p pid=".1802W.8/28">Although numbers of speed related accidents have increased since the installation of the camera, traffic flows have also significantly increased on this section of M11. However, because there has been a significant growth in traffic over this period the accident rate on this section has dropped overall, and is lower than the national average for a motorway.</p>
	<p pid=".1802W.8/29">The need for further safety measures on this section of road is continuously reviewed as is the need for the existing speed camera.</p>

	<p pid=".1804W.0/2">The police already make considerable use of the motor insurance database (MID) to help detect uninsured driving. However we introduced in the Serious and Organised Crimes Act 2005 provisions to improve police access to the MID. This will enable them to have data on uninsured vehicles for use with their automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) equipment. This should significantly improve their detection capabilities. We plan to have the necessary regulations in place by autumn this year.</p>

However, care needs to be taken to ensure that schemes are appropriate to local circumstances and, in particular, that they do not reduce levels of walking or cycling or undermine the viability of important commercial bus services.</p>

	<p pid=".1815W.2/1">We are committed to making work pay for all those who are able to work, and to supporting households in sustaining employment.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.2/2">We have made significant progress in taking forward our Housing Benefit Reform Programme which was launched in October 2002. As part of this reform, we implemented the local housing allowance in nine pathfinder authorities for tenants in the deregulated private sector. Nine more local authorities will implement the local housing allowance between April and July 2005. Early results from the Pathfinders are contained in the evaluation report &quot;Delivering the Local Housing Allowance: A summary of the early experiences of implementing the Local Housing Allowance in the nine Pathfinder areas&quot;, published in April, which is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.2/3">In April 2004, we introduced a number of measures to improve work incentives for housing benefit recipients. These included removing the need for people to reclaim housing benefit when they start a job. In most cases this ensures that benefit claims remain &quot;live&quot; while local authorities determine whether someone is entitled to continue claiming housing benefit. We also applied the additional earnings disregard in housing benefit and council tax benefit to those customers who are working for 16 or more hours a week and who have children or are disabled, and to some people of 50 or over who have recently returned to work. In addition, we extended housing benefit run-on to people receiving incapacity benefit and severe disablement allowance.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.2/4">As part of our reform programme, we are also reducing administrative complexity and providing housing benefit recipients with a clearer understanding of their benefit entitlement on return to work.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.2/5">We have also introduced a range of other measures which act as real incentives for people to move off benefit and into work. The National Minimum Wage was introduced in April 1999. It established minimum standards of pay in the labour market. In October 2004 the minimum wage was increased from &pound;4.50 per hour to &pound;4.85 for workers aged 22 and over and from &pound;3.80 per hour to &pound;4.10 per hour for people aged 18&ndash;21.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.2/6">Building on the success of working families' tax credit (WFTC), disabled person's tax credit and the children's tax credit, from April 2003 we introduced two new tax credits: the child tax credit (CTC) and the working tax credit (WTC) both of which are designed to make work pay.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.2/7">The Adviser Discretion Fund was introduced in July 2001, giving Jobcentre Plus Advisers direct access to funds to remove immediate barriers to employment and help people move quickly into work. In October 2004 we introduced Job Grant to help people manage until they receive their first wages. Additionally, housing benefit and council tax benefit extended payments allow maximum housing benefit and council tax benefit to continue for the first four weeks after starting work.</p>
	<p pid=".1815W.2/8">The effectiveness of work incentives will be monitored as part of the comprehensive Pathfinder evaluation.</p>

	<p pid=".1816W.2/1">Currently there are no facilities for direct communication between the Department for Work and Pension Information Technology (IT) Systems and Local Authority Housing Benefit IT systems. The Department does, however, supply local authorities with Remote Access Terminals that allow authorised users to view details of income support, pension credit and jobseekers allowance customers that are relevant to housing benefit and council tax benefit entitlement.</p>
	<p pid=".1816W.2/2">DWP also provides electronic transfers of data to relevant local authorities on awards, changes and terminations of income support, job seekers allowance and pension credit for customers known to be in receipt of housing benefit or council tax benefit.

	<p pid=".1819W.5/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, who will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid=".1819W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Leslie Strathie to Mr. Lembit &Ouml;pik, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-20">20 July 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".1819W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning the closure of the Jobcentre Plus office in Newtown and the economic effect on the town. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".1819W.5/4" class="indent">Firstly, I must make it clear that there are no plans to close the Jobcentre Plus Office in Newtown. As David Anderson, the former Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus outlined in his letter to you of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase>, it is the behind the scenes Benefit Processing work that will eventually transfer to our Processing Centre in Wrexham.</p>
	<p pid=".1819W.5/5" class="indent">The centralisation of Benefit Processing, at a smaller number of larger sites, will play a crucial role in helping Jobcentre Plus to meet the Government's efficiency challenge and I know that Charles Morse, the District Manager for North West Wales and Powys wrote to you on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-27">27 May</phrase> detailing the timescales for the transfer of this work.</p>
	<p pid=".1819W.5/6" class="indent">It is not envisaged that the transfer of Benefit Processing to Wrexham will have an adverse impact upon the wider local economy. Customers will continue to have access to the fully integrated Jobcentre Plus service at Afon House and, through our enhanced Personal Adviser service for customers on inactive benefits, we will continue to target our help at some of our most disadvantaged customers.</p>
	<p pid=".1819W.5/7" class="indent">Nevertheless, I recognise that the decision to centralise Benefit Processing has led to surplus staff. Unfortunately, it has not proved possible to identify suitable redeployment opportunities for all those staff involved. Consequently, it has been necessary to run a Voluntary Early Release Scheme and in the coming months, as we complete the transfer of work to Wrexham, a number of staff will be leaving Jobcentre Plus under the terms of our scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1819W.5/8" class="indent">While the loss of experienced staff is always regrettable, the challenges that Jobcentre Plus has taken up are about providing a better and more efficient service to our customers, and there is no doubt in my mind that the decision to centralise Benefit Processing is the correct one. Charles Morse will continue to keep you fully informed as our plans take shape.</p>
	<p pid=".1819W.5/9" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid=".1823W.5/1">The social fund plays an important role in the Government's agenda for tackling poverty and social exclusion. It provides valuable support to millions of people on low incomes, including some of the most vulnerable people in our society. We have recently announced a number of planned improvements to the social fund.</p>
	<p pid=".1823W.5/2">The Child Poverty Review, published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-12">12 July 2004</phrase>, announced the Government's intention to abolish the Budgeting Loan &quot;double debt&quot; rule and to reduce the current standard repayment rate of 15 per cent. of a customers benefit to 12 per cent. These changes will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="">3 April 2006</phrase> and will make budgeting loans more consistent and easier to understand and the social fund more effective in assisting those families most likely to experience debt problems.</p>
	<p pid=".1823W.5/3">These changes, which will make it easier for applicants to access loans, will be supported by a net increase in loans funding of &pound;210 million over the three years from 2006&ndash;07. In the short-term these changes will strengthen the social fund's contribution to increasing access to affordable credit for those on the lowest incomes. In the longer term we intend to consider more widely the role the social fund might play in the wider financial inclusion agenda.</p>

	<p pid=".1825W.3/1">Since 1997 the Government's priority has been to tackle the scourge of unemployment, inactivity and poverty through investment in, and reform of, the welfare state. The UK now has one of the strongest labour markets in the world, with the best combination of employment and unemployment of the major world economies. More people are moving from welfare back into work with employment up almost 200,000 in the last year and by over 2 million since 1997. With more people in jobs than ever before, we now spend &pound;5 billion less on unemployment benefits than we did in 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".1825W.3/2">A central part of our strategy is to ensure that work pays, establishing a real incentive for people to move off benefit and into work.</p>
	<p pid=".1825W.3/3">The National Minimum Wage was introduced in April 1999 as part of our overall strategy, establishing minimum standards of pay in the labour market. In October 2004 the minimum wage was increased from &pound;4.50 per hour to &pound;4.85 for workers aged 22 and over and from &pound;3.80 per hour to &pound;4.10 per hour for people aged 18&ndash;21 inclusive.</p>
	<p pid=".1825W.3/4">Building on the success of working families' tax credit (WFTC), disabled person's tax credit and the children's tax credit, from April 2003 the Government introduced two new tax credits, the child tax credit (CTC) and the working tax credit (WTC). Entitlement to the tax credits is based on the particular circumstances of an</p>
	<p pid=".1825W.3/5">individual or family.</p>
	<p pid=".1825W.3/6">The Adviser Discretion Fund was introduced in July 2001, giving Jobcentre Plus Advisers direct access to funds to remove immediate barriers to employment and thus help people move quickly into work. In addition, from October 2003, access to the Fund was further extended to all incapacity benefit customers in Pathways to Work pilot areas from the first day of their claim.</p>
	<p pid=".1825W.3/7">Job Grant was also introduced in October 2004 to help people manage until they receive their first wages. It replaced both the Lone Parents Run-On and the original Job Grant schemes.</p>
	<p pid=".1825W.3/8">Additionally the housing benefit and council tax benefit extended payments allow maximum housing benefit and council tax benefit to continue for the first four weeks after starting work. Help with mortgage interest in the first four weeks of employment may also be available through Mortgage Interest Run-On in the income-related benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".1825W.3/9">Today, Britain is working again. We are transforming the welfare state from a passive one-size-fits-all model to an active system that delivers both rights and responsibilities, tailoring help to the individual and providing the support and incentives people need to move from welfare and into work.</p>

Lloyd's unique structure did not prove readily compatible with the provisions of these regulations without further complex adaptation and refinement. Following consultation on draft regulations earlier this year, we intend to make the Insurers (Reorganisation and Winding-Up) (Lloyd's) Regulations 2005 using powers under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act.</p>

	<p pid=".1839W.9/1">DFID has recently launched a new policy on conditionality. Our policy makes it clear that we do not believe that conditionality can &quot;buy&quot; reform. Our aid programmes are based on partner commitment to reducing poverty, respect for human rights and international obligations and the strengthening of financial systems.

	<p pid=".1839W.12/1">The Department for International Development uses a financial model to help inform decisions on bilateral aid allocation in Africa and other regions. The model takes account of the extent of a country's poverty and the likely effectiveness of aid in reducing poverty there. The amount of aid which countries are likely to receive from other donors is also taken into account. As such, there is a good correlation between UK aid to African countries and levels of poverty. For example, the three poorest countries in terms of GNI per capita, Sierra Leone, Malawi and Tanzania, are also the three highest recipients of UK aid per capita.</p>
	<p pid=".1839W.12/2">Once aid has been allocated, we take a number of actions to ensure it reaches the poor and impacts on poverty. We have learnt that the best way for aid to deliver sustainable poverty reduction is to support developing countries own priorities&mdash;and to build capacity and accountability for delivery of services which improve the lives of the poor. As such, we help countries to develop and implement their own Poverty Reduction Strategies, which take into account the interests and needs of the poor. An important part of this is to strengthen monitoring systems and the accountability of governments to their citizens (including the poor). We also work closely with countries to strengthen public financial management and tackle corruption.</p>
	<p pid=".1839W.12/3">Before providing funds directly through government systems, we undertake a rigorous assessment of whether policies are sound and funds will be properly used. Where risks are too high, we channel funds directly to the poor through the United Nations or non-government organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".1839W.12/4">Debt relief is provided to countries which qualify for the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. This also requires that countries have demonstrated their commitment to poverty reduction through developing and implementing sound Poverty Reduction Strategies, which includes careful monitoring of impact on the poor.</p>

For the UK, in September 2004, fewer than 5,600 doctors (4.9 per cent. of the total) working in NHS hospital and community health services had a primary medical qualification from Africa. Many of these have been working in the NHS for many years.</p>
	<p pid=".1840W.2/2">UK policy explicitly prevents the targeting of developing countries for recruitment of health workers. An element of this policy is the code of practice for International Recruitment of Healthcare Professionals (available at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">http://www.dh.gov.uk</a>), which prevents the NHS from actively recruiting healthcare professionals from low and middle-income countries unless there is a Government-to-Government agreement in place. The code of practice was revised and strengthened last year to widen its scope to include temporary workers and to enable all healthcare organisations, including in the independent sector, to sign up to it's principles.</p>

	<p pid=".1842W.2/1">The EU has an important role in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), in terms of political support to the transition and as a donor. EU member states and the EC work together in Brussels and Kinshasa to try to ensure that messages and actions are properly co-ordinated. The EU's special representative to the Great Lakes, Aldo Ajello, has an important role in helping to ensure the effectiveness of EU engagement.</p>
	<p pid=".1842W.2/2">The European Commission has a large and ambitious programme in the difficult operating environment of the DRC. EC support to the DRC over the period 2003&ndash;07 is &pound;205 million. We work closely with the EC on all aspects of their programme and believe it to be effective.</p>
	<p pid=".1842W.2/3">The EC have so far committed &euro;80 million to DRC's elections trust fund managed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), making the EC the largest donor to the electoral process in the DRC. It is also providing up to &euro;8.9 million to the elections security project to train and equip DRC's police force in preparation for the series of elections due in the next year.</p>
	<p pid=".1842W.2/4">The EC also has substantial involvement in providing support on health and water and sanitation. It chairs the water and sanitation donor group in Kinshasa and is also an active member on the donor group supporting the development of the DRC's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The EC is also active in work to improve the management of the DRC's natural resources, in particular in forestry, and is developing a new justice sector programme in the East of DRC.</p>
	<p pid=".1842W.2/5">There are also two EU member state joint missions currently operating in the DRC. EUPol Kinshasa is training and equipping 1,008 members of the Congolese National Police to protect Kinshasa's key institutions over the course of the transition period. EUSec DRC is providing expertise on security sector reform to the Government of DRC. DFID are funding two UK security sector reform experts to take part in this mission.</p>
	<p pid=".1842W.2/6">One of the key ways of improving all aid effectiveness in the DRC is through better co-ordination among donors and harmonisation of their approaches within the framework of national plans. There is an active discussion under way in Kinshasa on how to promote this, including DFID, the EC and other donors. One of the priorities for the UK's EU presidency role in Kinshasa is making progress on improved donor co-ordination and aid effectiveness in the DRC.</p>
	<p pid=".1842W.2/7">Globally, the EC's reforms of its external assistance overall are beginning to show improvements in efficiency and better portfolio management. While this is very encouraging, DFID continues to monitor EC effectiveness closely.</p>

	<p pid=".1844W.6/1">Commitments made by the G8 and other donors will lead to an increase in official development assistance to Africa of $25 billion a year by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".1844W.6/2">By 2010, the UK's contribution to the additional $25 billion is likely to be around $3.3 billion. In the period of the current spending review, we are committed to providing over &pound;1.2 billion to Africa in financial years of 2007&ndash;08, which will increase to &pound;2.10 billion ($3.3 billion) by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".1844W.6/3">The EU has committed to double aid by 2010 from around $40 billion a year in 2004 to over $80 billion a year in 2010 and has agreed to allocate at least 50 per cent. of this increase to Africa. Therefore, by 2010, the EU will collectively provide $20 billion of the additional $25 billion.</p>

	<p pid=".1845W.2/1">As G8 leaders agreed at the Gleneagles summit,</p>
	<p pid=".1845W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;it is up to African countries themselves and their Governments to lead on development&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1845W.2/3">This includes deciding how best to use resources to accelerate progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. These policy decisions cannot and should not be imposed by donors. The UK will therefore provide additional resources in support of national poverty reduction plans, where partners have shown that they are committed to poverty reduction, protecting human rights and improving public financial management. We will deliver this as far as possible through national budgets, with more than half of our country programmes as poverty reduction budget or programme support by 2007&ndash;08. We will encourage G8 partners to do the same.</p>
	<p pid=".1845W.2/4">There are a few cases where aid is earmarked for sectors at the global level and channelled through specific mechanisms. This is generally for reasons of international co-ordination or advocacy. For example, funding for polio will be channelled through the polio eradication initiative. The UK has committed &pound;20 million to close the polio funding gap this year and the G8 has committed to ensuring that the $829 million needed for 2006&ndash;08 found. The G8 committed to replenish the global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria (which needs $7.18 billion for 2005&ndash;08) and ensure that the education for all fast track initiative has the resources necessary for countries to implement their education strategies (estimated to require $2.3 billion extra a year). In the case of the fast track initiative, resources may either be channelled through the initiative or directly to support national education strategies. For both AIDS and education, additional resources will be required beyond those channelled through these global mechanisms. These will largely be provided by donors in support of developing countries' national strategies.</p>

	<p pid=".1847W.5/1">At the G8 Summit at Gleneagles, the G8 Heads agreed a package of comprehensive support to help accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly in Africa which is falling behind. In advance of the Summit, the United Nations published a comprehensive review of prospects for achieving the MDGs called 'Investing in Development', which informed UK policy.</p>
	<p pid=".1847W.5/2">As part of the Gleneagles agreement, the G8 leaders agreed to support African Governments' commitment to ensure that, by 2015, all children have access to and complete free and compulsory education of good quality. We also called on African countries to implement the African Charter on Human and People's Rights and its protocols, in order to encourage respect for the rights of ethnic minorities, women and children.</p>
	<p pid=".1847W.5/3">The UK firmly believes, as the G8 Heads recognised, that it should be up to developing countries to decide how best to use resources on a country-by-country basis to achieve the MDGs. The additional resources should therefore not be allocated to specific sectors. We will support developing countries to build on their existing national strategies and processes such as the Poverty Reduction Strategy process to develop more ambitious plans for achieving the MDGs, including with increased resources. In some limited cases, commitments have been made for specific interventions at the global level. This is generally for reasons of international coordination or advocacy. Support is still for implementation of nationally defined policies. In the case of the Education for All Fast Track Initiative, resources can be channelled through the Initiative or provided directly to support national education strategies. At Gleneagles, the G8 Heads agreed to ensure that this Initiative has the resources necessary for countries to implement their education strategies (estimated to cost around US$2.3 billion extra per year).</p>

	<p pid=".1849W.8/1">The UK committed &pound;3.7 million in response to humanitarian needs in the wake of the Bam earthquake of <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-26">26 December 2003</phrase>, including the UK's share of the European community contribution. DFID humanitarian advisors conducted two monitoring missions to assess the effectiveness of this support. The British embassy, Tehran has also been involved in monitoring the response. On the basis of this monitoring, we believe our assistance was well targeted, effective and appreciated by the beneficiaries.</p>
	<p pid=".1849W.8/2">DFID focussed its immediate support on life saving action through deployed search and rescue teams, the provision of tents and shelter materials and the hiring of aircraft for delivery of relief items and in the medium-term to sectors where it could have the greatest impact, including urban water supply and sanitation, primary health care and agricultural irrigation and livestock replenishment.</p>
	<p pid=".1849W.8/3">DFID support to Bam's agricultural sector was provided through the United Nations Development Programme for its work to repair wells and irrigation channels and for Action Against Hunger's work to provide livelihoods for vulnerable families. DFID assistance contributed to a successful 2004 date harvest of higher quality and quantity than normal and also to the provision of livelihoods to 1,200 families, including providing goats to several hundred families. DFID's funds through the United Nations Development Programme were almost completely spent on providing water supply for agriculture in and around Bam. This covered 10 per cent. of the agricultural area of Bam, and in that area prevented the date groves from drying up at a crucial point in the agricultural cycle. The United Nations Development Programme estimated that there would otherwise have been an 80 per cent. smaller date harvest.</p>
	<p pid=".1849W.8/4">In the health sector, the humanitarian effort prevented outbreaks of disease despite the threat following earthquakes. DFID played an important part in this, channelling its support through the World Health Organisation (WHO) for its activities in primary health care, and also through the United Nations Children Fund for its work in water and sanitation. There were delays by WHO in kitting out 10 urban health centres because of slower than expected progress in building the health centres, which were late in starting because of the need to wait for the necessary planning permission.</p>
	<p pid=".1849W.8/5">A planned commitment of &pound;450,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) was not disbursed, as the IFRC subsequently advised us that our support was no longer needed as their appeal was sufficiently funded by other contributions they received.</p>

	<p pid=".1856W.0/1">At the G8 summit at Gleneagles, G8 Heads agreed a package of comprehensive support to help accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly in Africa which is falling behind. In advance of the summit, the United Nations published a comprehensive review of prospects for achieving the MDGs called 'Investing in Development', which informed UK policy.</p>
	<p pid=".1856W.0/2">This package of support includes substantial additional resources: an extra US$50 billion globally and US$25 billion for Africa by 2010. In addition, the G8 agreed debt cancellation worth up to US$40 billion for 18 of the poorest countries and up to $55 billion for 38 countries in total.</p>
	<p pid=".1856W.0/3">On trade, the G8 Heads expressed political commitment to an ambitious outcome at the Doha ministerial in Hong Kong and committed to provide increased assistance for building the capacity to trade. The additional resources will be targeted where they can make the most difference: on low-income countries that are committed to growth and poverty reduction, to a democratic, accountable and transparent government and to sound public financial management, while recognising that aid is important to respond to humanitarian crises and countries affected by or at risk of conflict.</p>
	<p pid=".1856W.0/4">Achieving the MDGs to reduce by half the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day and those who suffer from hunger will depend on progress in a range of different areas. This is why G8 Heads emphasised the importance of coordinated and coherent action.</p>
	<p pid=".1856W.0/5">The Evian G8 water action plan commits G8 member countries to playing a more active role in the international efforts towards achieving the water and sanitation Millennium Development Goals. At Gleneagles, G8 Heads agreed to increase aid to the sector, while maintaining political momentum and commitment on the water issue and reinforcing coordination and monitoring mechanisms. The UK recently announced it was doubling, over the next three years, its funding for improvements in water and sanitation in Africa.</p>
	<p pid=".1856W.0/6">G8 Heads agreed a range of measures aimed at boosting growth and attracting new investment, contributing to building Africa's capacity to trade and improving the lives of slum dwellers. Work will continue on building an infrastructure consortium for Africa, involving the African Union (AU), the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the EU. The sectors to be covered by this major new effort are water and sanitation, energy, transport, telecommunications and urban infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid=".1856W.0/7">Work will continue to support investment, enterprise development and innovation, for example, through support to the AU/NEPAD investment climate facility. International financial institutions and African Governments are encouraged to increase access to financial services for poor people through increased partnerships between commercial banks and micro-finance institutions.</p>
	<p pid=".1856W.0/8">In recognition of the particular problems faced by least developed countries (LDC)s, the G8 committed to provide them with additional support for trade capacity building. They also agreed to work for appropriate flexibility in the Doha development agenda (DDA) trade negotiations to help LDCs to decide, plan and sequence their economic reforms in line with their country-led development programmes and their international obligations. Moreover, they reiterated their commitment to duty and quota for free market access for LDC products, and the importance of addressing products of interest to LDCs as part of the single undertaking of the DDA.</p>
	<p pid=".1856W.0/9">The G8 summit did not reach any specific agreements regarding landlocked and small island development states, although other measures agreed there will benefit these countries, including additional development resources and progress on climate change and trade.</p>
	<p pid=".1856W.0/10">G8 leaders committed to support youth employment in Africa for both men and women, including vocational education and training relevant to market demands.</p>
	<p pid=".1856W.0/11">To help develop skilled professionals for Africa's private and public sectors, the G8 Heads agreed to support networks of excellence between African and other countries' institutions of higher education and centres of excellence in science and technology.</p>

In advance of the summit, the United Nations published a comprehensive review of prospects for achieving the MDGs called 'Investing in Development', which informed UK policy.</p>
	<p pid=".1858W.0/2">G8 Heads agreed several specific measures to tackle the health and HIV/AIDS related MDGs. They undertook to support African Governments' commitment to ensure access to basic health care for all (free wherever countries choose to provide this) to reduce mortality among those most at risk of dying from preventable causes, particularly women and children. This includes a commitment to invest in improved health systems, which are critical for progress across the board.</p>
	<p pid=".1858W.0/3">On malaria, the G8 committed to work with African countries to scale up action to reach 85 per cent. of the vulnerable populations with the interventions that will save 600,000 children's lives a year by 2015. These include ensuring access to anti-malaria insecticide-treated mosquito nets, adequate and sustainable supplies of Combination Therapies including Artemisin, presumptive treatment for pregnant women and babies, household residual spraying and the capacity in African health services to effectively use them.</p>
	<p pid=".1858W.0/4">The G8 Heads committed to the aims of an AIDS-free generation, significantly reducing HIV infections, aiming as close as possible to universal access to treatment for all who need it by 2010 and ensuring proper support for all children left orphaned or vulnerable by AIDS. They committed to increase resources to tackle AIDS, including through replenishing the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) and malaria (GFATM). They also undertook to work with the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and other international bodies to develop and implement a package for HIV prevention, treatment and care, and to improve coordination through implementing the 'Three Ones' principles.</p>
	<p pid=".1858W.0/5">To encourage the development of vaccines, microbicides and drugs for AIDS, TB, malaria and other neglected diseases, the G8 leaders committed to increase direct investment and take forward market incentives, through mechanisms such as Public Private Partnerships and Advance Purchase Commitments. We also re-affirmed our commitments made at the G8 summit at Evian, agreeing to improve access to affordable medicines by encouraging differential pricing of drugs by originator companies and by supporting the appropriate use of flexibilities in agreements on intellectual property rights where necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".1859W.0/1">G8 Finance Ministers met on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-11">11 June</phrase> and re-affirmed their commitment to the full implementation and financing of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. They also agreed a new proposal to cancel the debt stock of qualifying HIPCs to the International Development Association of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Fund of the African Development Bank. In addition, they agreed the need to find a solution to Nigeria's debts. G8 leaders re-affirmed their support for these agreements when they met at Gleneagles, and welcomed the Paris club's agreement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-29">29 June</phrase> which will result in the elimination all of Nigeria's $29 billion bilateral debt to Paris club creditors.</p>
	<p pid=".1859W.0/2">The UK is committed to broad and generous debt relief for poor countries in order to make debt sustainable in the long-term and to free up resources for their achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. We continue to lobby others in support for this objective. Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals varies, but Sub Saharan Africa in particular will not meet any of the goals by 2015 if current rates of progress continue. We believe that debt relief, including the G8's new proposal, will help countries to make the investments in health, education and infrastructure, that are needed to reach the Millennium Development Goals.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-07-20.12934.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-07-20.1863W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="1863W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050720/text/50720w42.htm#50720w42.html_spnew1">
	<p pid=".1863W.2/1">Immediately following the tsunami DFID provided some &pound;7 million of direct assistance to Sri Lanka. In addition DFID financed a number of relief activities across the region, at a cost of over &pound;26 million. While it is difficult to attribute precisely Sri Lanka's share of this funding, we would estimate that approximately one third, or &pound;8.7 million, went to the island. The following table provides full details.</p>
	<p pid=".1863W.2/2">To support longer term recovery Britain has agreed to meet 10 per cent. of the Government of Sri Lanka's interest payments to the World Bank, for the next 10 years. This will be worth over &pound;41 million and the Government have agreed that the funds released will be spent on tsunami relief and recovery and on poverty reducing programmes for the poorest communities.</p>
	<p pid=".1863W.2/3">Sri Lanka has received generous support from international organisations and from the public, sufficient to fully finance the recovery and reconstruction needs. However, following my visit to Sri Lanka last month I have agreed that we should offer further assistance to strengthen Government's capacity to implement these recovery programmes effectively and equitably. Discussions are under way in Sri Lanka to identify the best way to tackle this issue and programme DFID support.</p>

The key to spending more money well will be helping governments in Africa to improve the priority given to water and sanitation in their own country plans, so that they better reflect the needs and aspirations of the poorest.</p>
	<p pid=".1866W.2/2">DFID will finalise a report, &quot;Financing DFID Support to the Water Sector 2002&ndash;04&quot; in August which will provide full statistics on DFID's bilateral funding, contributions to multilateral agencies and civil society organisations, public private partnerships, and contributions to research programmes. It will also estimate the proportions of the poverty reduction budget support (PRBS) and debt relief benefiting the water and sanitation sector. Many programmes directed primarily at education, health and other sectors also include a significant water and sanitation component. The total of all of these forms of support to the water sector is estimated at over &pound;220 million in 2003&ndash;04. Comprehensive figures on total DFID support to water in 2004&ndash;05 are not yet available.</p>

	<p pid=".1867W.0/2">DFID recognises the importance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank being transparent and accountable to parliaments in developing countries. Clearly, such accountability needs to be at the heart of their relationship.</p>
	<p pid=".1867W.0/3">The main means by which parliaments should engage with the Bank and the IMF activities is through the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) process. This is a national strategy for development that sets the agenda, which donors, including the World Bank, should follow in each country.</p>
	<p pid=".1867W.0/4">In the past, parliamentary involvement in the PRS process has often been weak. However, over the past two years, DFID country offices have begun to support stronger involvement of parliamentarians in the PRS process. We are providing active support for parliamentary involvement in Malawi and Tanzania, where an independent Monitoring Group was established to oversee the joint commitments made around the PRS.</p>
	<p pid=".1867W.0/5">In Board meetings, DFID encourages the World Bank and the IMF to engage with parliaments as much as possible. We also actively push for them to make more of their documents public and will continue to pursue this both at Board meetings and in discussions with staff. In fact, in March this year a new Bank disclosure policy was approved which, among other things, makes Board minutes public. The World Bank is now working closely with parliamentarians in some of its borrowing member countries to involve them in the design and implementation of its lending programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".1867W.0/6">The World Bank Institute has a major Parliamentary Strengthening Programme. A key objective is to strengthen the capacity of parliaments to scrutinise the allocation and use of public funds, and oversee the PRS. Since it began in 1996, it has delivered activities in a range of countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Kenya, Indonesia and Uganda.</p>
	<p pid=".1867W.0/7">The World Bank Institute has also supported the African Parliamentarians Network Against Corruption (APNAC) and the Global Organization of Parliamentarians against Corruption (GOPAC) to encourage parliamentary scrutiny and action against corruption.</p>
	<p pid=".1867W.0/8">Outside the PRS, the main means of oversight is the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank. This provides opportunities for parliaments to scrutinise the World Bank and engage more deeply in development policy issues. The independent Network has some 450 members from over 90 countries and facilitates direct dialogue between parliamentarians and the World Bank to achieve greater transparency of policies and practices.</p>

	<p pid=".1885W.10/23">It is important to note that a report of an adverse drug reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease. It is particularly important to note that causality has not been established for fatal reports.</p>

	<p pid=".1886W.2/1">No estimate has been made by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the number of bed days lost due to adverse drug reactions. The MHRA has, however funded a study conducted from November 2001 to April 2002, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-02">2 July 2004</phrase> <sup>1</sup> , conducted in two large hospitals in Merseyside. This suggested that adverse drug reactions account for 6.5 per cent. of hospital admissions. The median bed stay was eight days, accounting for 4 per cent. of the hospital bed capacity. Patients admitted with adverse drugs reactions, who were of a median age of 76 years, were significantly older than patients without adverse drug reactions, who were of a median age of 66 years.

	<p pid=".1895W.0/2">The Government are monitoring the impact of the clinical trials directive in collaboration with its partners in clinical research. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the licensing authority for clinical trials under the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, which implemented Directive 2001/20/EC (the Clinical Trials Directive) in United Kingdom law with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase>. The MHRA asked the UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC) to analyse the available evidence on impacts that can be attributed to the Directive. The UKCRC has reviewed the preliminary evidence and found that no sources of information measure reliably the effects of the directive on the volume and type of clinical research, the difficulties or benefits it has produced, or the impact on research costs. It has agreed on the need for a reliable and independently derived set of metrics.</p>
	<p pid=".1895W.0/3">At this early stage, there is evidence of good performance by the MHRA in approving clinical trials promptly and of a reduction in the time taken for ethics committee review. There is also evidence that in other respects, in 2004&ndash;05 it took longer to set up trials and to secure permission to begin them in some national health service organisations. This may in part have been due to confusion in universities and the NHS about the interpretation of the law, leading to inconsistent behaviour and delay in reaching agreement. Financial information also suggests an initial decline in the numbers of early phase trials recruiting volunteers outside the NHS. Members of the UKCRC, including the Government, have agreed to collaborate on actions designed to speed up the approval of trials and reduce costs. The Government aims to work with its partners to build on this country's excellent reputation in clinical research.</p>

The PCT anticipates this funding will deliver an additional 10,560 NHS patient registrations. This funding is also being used to fund the development of two new dental surgeries in a health centre in Rotherham, expected to be completed in 2005&ndash;06. The PCT has also been awarded funding to re-open a recently closed surgery, which should provide 2,888 additional patient registrations.</p>

The Rotherham Health Advice Centre actively manages access to NHS dentistry by directing patients to practices with vacancies as they become available. The dental access centre in the Dearne Valley accepts patients from all over South Yorkshire for a range of emergency dental treatment. In addition, three practices within Rotherham provide emergency pain-relief sessions.</p>
	<p pid=".1897W.9/4">Rotherham PCT has recruited three Polish dentists from the Department's central international recruitment initiative. These dentists are now providing NHS services to patients in the area. The PCT has also been proactive in working with its dentists to move them to personal dental service contracts&mdash;with over 60 per cent. of practices having taken up this opportunity to move to new ways of working.</p>

Examples of illicit purchases include the internet, pubs, clubs, boot fairs and by mail order.

However, unlicensed generic versions coming mainly from India and China have been and are being investigated.</p>

	<p pid=".1908W.11/1">Commercial cloth laundering services supplying national health service maternity wards with communally laundered cloth nappies for newborn babies must comply with HSG(95)18, a copy of which is available in the Library.

	<p pid=".1910W.2/1">In the light of the recommendation in the report from the National Audit Office in 2000 that the Department should produce an infection control manual, the Department carried out a scoping study aimed at establishing what infection control specialists wanted from an infection control manual. The study showed a clear consensus that what was wanted was a reliable and high quality infection control information resource, bringing together all national guidance and other source literature relevant to the prevention and control of infection, rather than an infection control manual as such.</p>

	<p pid=".1918W.2/1">Information on the number of people who became ill as a result of second hand smoke in Huddersfield and the West Yorkshire primary care trust area and the cost of treating them is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".1918W.2/2">The most recent estimate of the number of workplace deaths caused by second hand smoke was published in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-02">2 March 2005</phrase>, in a report by Professor Konrad Jamrozik. This gave an estimate of 617 deaths a year in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".1918W.2/3">The report went onto estimate that second hand smoke in the home accounts for a further 2,700 deaths in persons aged 20&ndash;64 years and 8,000 deaths among people aged 65 years. The author acknowledges that the results are &quot;distinctly sensitive&quot; to some of the underlying assumptions.</p>
	<p pid=".1918W.2/4">A copy of the paper is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".1918W.2/5">The cost to the national health service of treating disease and illness caused by smoking is between &pound;1.4 billion and &pound;1.7 billion a year.</p>
