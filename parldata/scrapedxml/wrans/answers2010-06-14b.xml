	<p pid="b.247W.0/1">Reaper, operated by the Royal Air Force, is the UK's only armed remotely piloted air system (RPAS). Reaper's primary mission is to provide a persistent intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capability in support of coalition forces on the ground in Afghanistan. Being armed, Reaper has the capability to respond to requests for support from commanders on the ground and engage emerging targets.</p>

Reaper is not an autonomous system and does not have the capability to employ weapons unless it is commanded to do so by the flight crew.</p>

	<p pid="b.247W.9/1">We take the protection of our armed forces very seriously, strive to reduce the risk they face and improve their protection. The best force protection involves using a range of equipment, combined with the right training and tactics. The combined effect of our continuous improvements to equipment, better tactics and ongoing research, together with a greater number of helicopter flying hours, and the deployment of a Counter-Improvised Explosive Device (C-IED) Task Force, contribute to managing the threat our troops face.</p>
	<p pid="b.247W.9/2">The biggest challenge we face is the threat from IEDs. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-10">10 June</phrase>, the Prime Minister announced that we will spend an additional &#163;67 million on countering the IED threat. This will include more protected vehicles for use by our C-IED teams, more Remote Control Vehicles, and enhancing our military working dog capability. This investment, together with enhancements that have already been made to our IED equipment, training and other capabilities will continue to make a difference.</p>

The Environment Agency, internal drainage boards, local authorities, water utilities and landowners have powers to provide drainage of land for purposes such as to improve agricultural production but this is not the objective of the Government's investment in flood risk management.

The role of physicians' assistant has been particularly successful in London and the west midlands and Skills for Health are sharing this good practice with employers in other areas so that they can consider whether to introduce this new role into their work force.</p>
	<p pid="b.260W.3/2">Given the length of time that the physicians' assistants have been in post, there has been no national evaluation of the role. However, there is to be a formal review of the Competence and Curriculum Framework later this year.</p>

Also, the PBC figures for disease specific expenditure do not include expenditure on prevention, or general practitioner expenditure, but do include prescribing expenditure. Some expenditure on obstructive airways disease may also be included in the &quot;other&quot; category due to problems with miscoding and difficulties with providing a definitive clinical diagnosis for all patients.</p>

	<p pid="b.263W.11/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) undertakes a range of activities designed to reduce the incidence of food poisoning. These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.263W.11/2" class="indent">The Foodborne Disease Strategy-a programme for reducing foodborne illness by targeting those pathogens that cause the greatest incidence and burden of disease in the United Kingdom. This programme includes the FSA Food Hygiene Campaign, designed to raise consumer awareness of food safety issues and good food hygiene practices;</p>
	<p pid="b.263W.11/3" class="indent">The Food Hygiene Delivery Programme-set up to address the recommendations of the report of the Public Inquiry into the 2005 South Wales outbreak of <i> E. coli</i> 0157. A primary aim of this programme is to improve awareness and control of food safety hazards by food businesses, food law enforcers and consumers;</p>
	<p pid="b.263W.11/4" class="indent">Provision of a range of guidance and resources to help catering businesses (particularly small businesses) to comply with the requirements of food hygiene legislation;</p>
	<p pid="b.263W.11/5" class="indent">Development of a Food Hygiene Ratings Scheme (also known as 'scores on doors') to provide consumers with information on hygiene standards in food premises and encourage these businesses to improve their standards; and</p>

	<p pid="b.263W.11/7">The number of cases of foodborne illness shows a seasonal summer peak, between May and September. Most cases are due to <i> Campylobacter</i>, which has been identified as a priority organism for action in the FSA's Foodborne Disease Strategy. The FSA is working in partnership with industry and retail stakeholders to develop and implement interventions to reduce <i> Campylobacter</i> in chicken.</p>
	<p pid="b.263W.11/8">The FSA's Food Hygiene Campaign has been running since 2001 to raise awareness and increase understanding of food hygiene by consumers. The campaign's varied activities have included seasonal activity to address the rise in cases that occurs each summer, focusing on safe summer eating including barbecuing. UK Food Safety Week, a focus for the promotion of food hygiene messages, is held in June each year and has been co-ordinated by the FSA since 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.284W.3/1">The legislation which governs the annual review of the rates of benefits and pensions requires that state second pension and additional elements of the state pension are increased each year in line with the growth in prices. The fact that they stayed the same in April 2010 was due to negative price inflation. Under this legislation, when prices continue growing as normal, state second pension and additional elements of the state pension must be increased by that growth.</p>

	<p pid="b.287W.3/1">Firearms (including air weapons) were reported to have been used in 14,250 recorded crimes in 2008-09. Firearms are taken to be involved in a crime if they are fired, used as a blunt instrument or used as a threat. A fatal or serious injury was incurred in 3% of these offences (431 offences), including 0.06% that involved rifles (eight offences) and 0.51% that involved shotguns (72 offences).</p>

	<p pid="b.288W.8/2">Due to the underground nature of forced marriage it is very difficult to estimate the scale of this practice in the UK and it is therefore likely that many cases go unreported.</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.8/3">The Forced Marriage Unit (FMU), a joint unit of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Home Office, was established in 2005 as the 'one-stop shop' for dealing with forced marriage policy, outreach and casework. It operates both inside the UK, where support is provided to any individual, and overseas, where consular assistance is provided to British nationals, including dual nationals.</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.8/4">The FMU collects data on (i) the number of reports it receives relating to possible forced marriages and (ii) the number of cases where the FMU provides direct support to a victim in the UK or overseas. Data on the number of reports made to the FMU relating to possible forced marriages were not collected prior to 2008. Data collected since then are recorded by UK region (where this is known) and are not broken down further. Data on the number of cases where the FMU provided direct support are available from 2005. Details are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.8/5" class="italic"> Reports to the FMU relating to possible forced marriage</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.8/6" class="indent">In 2008: 1,618 total reports across the UK. Of these, 1,252 reports were from England (where the region was known) and 197 of these reports originated from the north-west of England (where the region was known).</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.8/7" class="indent">In 2009: 1,682 total reports across the UK. Of these, 1,200 reports were from England (where the region was known) and 210 originated from the north-west of England (where the region was known).</p>

	<p pid="b.291W.0/1">Most Departments have no car pool of their own. The sole exceptions are the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Ministry of Defence.</p>

	<p pid="b.291W.0/5">UK manufactured cars make up a relatively small proportion (around 16%) of the current GCS fleet, most of which is comprised of low carbon emission hybrid vehicles manufactured abroad. Changed rules for allocation of cars and the need to reduce the cost of operating the Government Car Service mean that vehicle replacement is likely to be restricted in the immediate future, necessarily limiting the options for reconfiguring the fleet without incurring additional cost. For reasons of efficient and economic fleet management, it is not practical for Ministers to specify a particular vehicle or type of vehicle for a journey in a pool service car.</p>

	<p pid="b.295W.7/1">Neither the Government nor the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) have formally reviewed the effectiveness of the KPCS in preventing the trade in diamonds funding violence. However, compliance with KPCS requirements is monitored and evaluated through a 'Peer Review' system. Teams of experts representing KPCS governments, civil society groups and industry visit selected KPCS states every year to review implementation of the KPCS and if necessary investigate reports of diamonds contributing to violence. Review reports are discussed by KPCS members at the annual Plenary and Intersessional meetings. Action can be taken against states shown to be persistently failing to implement the KPCS, including suspension. The June 2010 KPCS intersessional in Tel Aviv will include looking at ways the KPCS can be more effective. The UK is attending as part of the EU delegation.</p>

	<p pid="b.310W.3/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) made an assessment of conditions on the ground caused by tropical storm Agatha in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, through consultations with the Red Cross, other aid agencies in Central America and Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) colleagues. Our assessment was that Guatemala suffered the most damage and loss of life. The storm affected some of the country's poorest rural indigenous communities. We found that 5,000 families in Guatemala were in need of immediate humanitarian assistance and made a rapid allocation of &#163;100,000 to the Guatemalan Red Cross relief appeal.</p>

	<p pid="b.317W.2/2">The need to attract more students from disadvantaged backgrounds into higher education is written into the coalition agreement. This makes clear that once Lord Browne's review of student finance has reported, its proposals will be judged against the coalition's agreed criteria, which include increasing social mobility and attracting more students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.317W.2/3">This Government's aim is to create a society where everyone, regardless of background, has the chance to fulfil their talents and ambitions. We envisage creating clear progression ladders, re-engaging young people into work. This will be through a wide range of routes into further education, including high quality apprenticeships. By refocusing employer-responsive budgets this year, we will allocate &#163;150 million for 50,000 new, high quality additional apprenticeship places focused on SMEs.</p>

	<p pid="b.324W.5/2">The Government have not commissioned research on postal ballot fraud in the last 10 years. However, the Electoral Commission has addressed the issue of the integrity of the electoral process, including in relation to postal voting, in its statutory reports on elections in accordance with section 5 of the Political Parties and Elections Act 2000. In addition, the Electoral Commission also undertook detailed analysis of case files held by the Crown Prosecution Service which covered the period 2000-06, and published their findings in its reports, &quot;Allegations of electoral malpractice in England and Wales 2000-2006&quot; and &quot;Further analysis of CPS files on allegations of electoral malpractice in England and Wales 2000-2006&quot;. More recently, the Electoral Commission in conjunction with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has published the reports &quot;Allegations of electoral malpractice at the May 2008 elections in England and Wales&quot; and &quot;Analysis of allegations of electoral malpractice at the June 2009 elections&quot;. These reports give details of allegations of electoral malpractice reported to police during the elections in 2008 and 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.5/3">The Government have not commissioned research on under-registration in the last 10 years. However, in 2005, the then Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) made use of existing research to inform work aimed at identifying an evidence base for policy development and service targets. More recently, the Electoral Commission published their report, &quot;The completeness and accuracy of electoral registers in Great Britain&quot;, in March 2010. This, their latest of several studies on this subject, was based on a range of national data sources and case studies of eight local authorities across Great Britain. Among its key findings, the report found that,</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.5/4" class="indent">&quot;Recent social, economic and political changes appear to have resulted in a declining motivation to register to vote among specific social groups&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.5/5">The social groups to which the report referred are those most likely to move home. Specifically among these, its case studies identified 17 to 24-year-olds, private sector tenants and black and minority ethnic (BME) groups as having higher than average rates of under-registration.</p>

At a UK parliamentary election, under the Representation of the People Act 1983, this is 11 working days before polling day.

	<p pid="b.333W.2/1">I will chair the Public Sector Transparency Board myself and Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Professor Nigel Shadbolt and Mr Tom Steinberg will be members. Further initial external members of the Board will be announced shortly. Ministers, officials and others may also be invited to attend meetings if they can help on particular issues the Board is considering.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.2/2">The Board will also involve and engage the wider community of experts, developers and advocates on transparency and open data, as well as working with Ministers and officials in Government Departments and other public bodies. I envisage that the Board will meet formally as necessary, and at least quarterly, but that most of its work will be through its members working together, individually and with others on transparency, open data and standards issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.333W.2/3">The secretariat and initial budget for the Board itself will be drawn from the existing resources of the Cabinet Office. The overall budget for the Board's work, which will be from within existing departmental allocations, will be settled once I have the Board's advice on the work which is necessary and its priority.</p>
