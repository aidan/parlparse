	<p pid="b.484W.6/1">In November 2008 the European Commission published its proposal for a new directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes to replace EU Directive 86/609/EEC. The European Parliament adopted its first reading report on the Commission's proposal in May 2009. The Council of Ministers has not yet adopted an agreed position. However, discussions between the Swedish presidency, the Commission and the European Parliament completed in December 2009 made significant progress towards agreement of a common compromise text.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.6/2">The only provisions remaining to be agreed relate to the arrangements for delegated and implementing acts introduced by articles 290 and 291 of the Lisbon Treaty, the operational details of which are still being negotiated.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.6/3">Once these provisions are agreed, the way should then be clear for the new Directive to be adopted. Our current expectation is that this will be in the first half of 2010 and that the final implementation date for the measures set out in the new directive, after transposition into UK law, will be <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-01">1 January 2013</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.484W.6/4">We believe the compromise text provides a sound basis for the future regulation of animal research in Europe. The text is more flexible and less prescriptive than the Commission's initial proposal and, overall, provides a regulatory framework which, we believe is balanced and will allow the United Kingdom to maintain high standards of welfare and animal protection after transposition and implementation without the imposition of unnecessary bureaucracy.</p>

	<p pid="b.494W.2/2">My Department has delivered significant reductions in carbon emissions from our buildings and road travel, by 14 per cent. and 30 per cent. respectively over the last two years. In 2007-08 an estates emissions reduction of 10.8 per cent. was achieved. While this proves that such a reduction is possible, my Department continues to bear a significantly increased work load to support those impacted by the recession. While we remain committed to the achievement of the carbon reductions targets from Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate (our progress is detailed in the Sustainable Development in Government report), it is the opinion of my officials that it would be unrealistic for the Department to commit to a further 10 per cent. reduction in a single year from an already low baseline and with an expanding business.</p>
	<p pid="b.494W.2/3">During December my Department has achieved the Carbon Trust Standard, and we remain committed to actively reducing our carbon emissions. We will exploit, where possible, low carbon technologies and we will be shortly relaunching our energy efficiency campaign across our estate.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-03-12b.309340.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2010-03-12b.498W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1899" speakername="Angela Eagle" colnum="498W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100312/text/100312w0005.htm#10031228008926">
	<p pid="b.498W.2/1">The Government have made available up to &#163;5 billion additional discretionary spending to support people through the course of the recession. This has been used in a variety of ways-and the bulk of this has been for this Department to lead on. Of this &#163;5 billion we expect to spend &#163;2.1 billion in 2009-10 and &#163;2.9 billion in 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/2">As a result of the investment that the Government have made, claimant unemployment was over 450,000 lower at the end of 2009 than was expected at the time of the Budget 2009. This has also allowed us to use this funding flexibly to ensure it can be directed to where it can support people in the greatest need. To maintain such flexibility, we have not ring-fenced allocations to each element.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/3">The following DWP programmes are funded from this budget:</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/4" class="italic"> Increasing resources available to Jobcentre Plus, employment programmes and local authorities</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/5">We announced in the 2008 pre-Budget report, and in the Budget 2009, that we would be providing extra funding to Jobcentre Plus to effectively handle the higher volume of customers through the recession. That funding was provided immediately and Jobcentre Plus has increased staffing levels by 16,000. The funding also allowed increase in programme budgets to core programmes including the new deals and the flexible new deal. Benefit exit rates have been maintained and over 330,000 people left JSA in January alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/6" class="italic"> Additional support before redundancy</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/7">In November 2008, we quadrupled the funding to deliver the Jobcentre Plus' Rapid Response Service which offers support to employers and workers who are facing redundancy. Since the service was expanded, more than 4,000 employers have taken up this support.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/8" class="italic"> Additional day one support for all</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/9">From the start of a new jobseeker's allowance claim, customers can access improved help from Jobcentre Plus to get them back to work quickly. This support can include one-to-one adviser support, coaching and access to Local Employment Partnership vacancies.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/10">In April 2009, we introduced new specialist help for professionals and executives, delivered by external recruitment agencies, to help them with jobsearch techniques and give them advice specific to their needs and experience. In our December White Paper &quot;Building Britain's Recovery&quot;, we announced our intention to extend this support further by offering professionals and executives follow-up sessions.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/11" class="italic"> Six month offer for all</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/12">Every jobseeker's allowance customer who remains unemployed for six months or more now have access to a substantially improved range of services including access to recruitment subsidies vouchers, work-focused training and volunteering placements and help to become self employed through the six month offer.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/13">The six month offer was introduced in April 2009 and provides opportunities for up to 230,000 people. Between April 2009 to October 2009, 39,420 people has taken up the support offered through the six month offer.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/14">Furthermore, access to self employment support and the financial credit is now available to all jobseekers after three months.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/15" class="italic"> Young Persons Guarantee and the Future Jobs Fund</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/16">The Young Persons Guarantee launched on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-25">25 January 2010</phrase> guarantees all young jobseekers aged 18-24 a job, training or work experience from six months unemployment. From April 2010 young people will be required to take up one of the options on offer if they are still unemployed after 10 months. The Future Jobs Fund is a key element of the guarantee, where local authorities, partnerships and others (such as third sector or social enterprises) are able to bid to create jobs through the fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/17">The first FJF jobs began in October 2009, and to date Government have agreed to fund up to 110,000 FJF jobs; around 65 per cent. of the 170,000 jobs the fund is targeted to fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/18">The YPG is also supported by over 400,000 Government funded training, internship, work experience and job opportunities. This will include a target of 16,000 apprenticeship places through the FJF.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/19">Graduates are also eligible for a new graduate guarantee, where any new graduate still unemployed after six months is guaranteed access to an internship, training or help to become self-employed.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/20" class="italic"> Backing Young Britain</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/21">The BYB campaign was launched in July 2009. This national campaign delivers a variety of measures to help young people aged 16-24 into work, or move closer to the labour market. As well as encouraging business to support young people by offering jobs, apprenticeships and work experience places, it will create 10,000 mentoring places, 5,000 short term work experience placements and 20,000 longer term non-graduate internships, as well as supporting the graduate internships already announced. Places are available now.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/22">870 organisations have signed up to BYB to date (at <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-08">8 March 2010</phrase>), with the number growing all the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/23" class="italic"> Additional support for older workers</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/24">In the &quot;Building Britain's Recovery&quot; White Paper we committed to provide additional back to work support to people aged 50 and over. This support includes more time with a personal adviser, access to specialist back to work support and giving people early access to the six month offer.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/25">These new measures will be delivered from spring 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/26" class="italic"> Help for homeowners</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/27">Improvements to the help provided to homeowners through the Support for Mortgage Interest scheme were introduced in January 2009 for new working age claims, which:</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/28" class="indent">shortened the waiting period to 13 weeks</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/29" class="indent">increased capital limit to &#163;200,000,</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/30" class="indent">introduced 2 year time limit for new JSA claims</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/31" class="indent">froze the standard interest rate used to calculate Support for Mortgage Interest at 6.08 per cent. for all customers (including pensioners), until the end of June 2010 benefiting around 220,000 homeowners.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/32">Once the standard interest rate freeze ends, the Government intend to move towards a fairer, more affordable approach, that more closely reflects mortgage interest rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.498W.2/33">These changes demonstrate very clearly the Government's commitment to provide additional support to those facing financial difficulties and help protect them against repossessions and will be reviewed once the housing market conditions improve.</p>

	<p pid="b.500W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the right hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.500W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Darra Singh:</p>
	<p pid="b.500W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking how many Jobcentre Plus offices have used (a) extended postal signing, (b) telephone jobsearch reviews, (c) suspension of signing, (d) 13-week interviews by telephone and (e) 13-week group sessions in each month since flexible interventions were first used; and how many Jobcentre Plus customers were the subject of each such practice; and what estimate she has made of the number of Jobcentre Plus offices that have used flexible interventions in each month since they were first used; and how many customers have been the subject of such interventions. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.500W.2/4" class="indent">Flexible interventions were introduced at a time of rapidly increasing demand on our services and before we had the opportunity to increase our staffing levels to meet those demands. We have subsequently recruited additional staff which in turn has allowed us to reduce the number of flexible interventions deployed. In some circumstances, we have decided to deploy our flexibilities into our core business as part of our improved delivery model, in order to further improve customer service. During the economic downturn, despite these increased demands, Jobcentre Plus maintained and improved performance and is meeting all of its key performance targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.500W.2/5" class="indent">A total of 19 flexible interventions were approved. The number of Jobcentre Plus offices that have deployed the specific flexible interventions you requested information on are detailed in the table below.

In addition to rolling out Flexible New Deal, which is providing support tailored to meet the individual needs of jobseekers of all ages, we have doubled the resources available to help people facing redundancy, have introduced a financial incentive for employers who recruit people out of work for six months or more, and have introduced extra funding for training places.</p>

	<p pid="b.508W.0/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is the responsibility of the chief executive, Darra Singh. I have asked him to provide the right hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Darra Singh:</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking how many jobcentres have undergone estates works to enable them to meet demand for their services in the last 12 months and at what cost; how many Jobcentre Plus offices estate works are planned to enable them to meet demand and what the total estimated cost is of all such works; which Jobcentre Plus offices which closed in each of the last six years have been re-opened, when each was reopened and what the cost was of (a) closing and (b) re-opening each; and which Jobcentre Plus offices which closed in each of the last six years are under consideration for re-opening and what estimate has been made of the cost of (a) the closure and (b) re-opening of each. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.0/4" class="indent">In order to ensure that Jobcentre Plus was capable of meeting the challenge of rising caseload volumes as a result of the current economic climate, Customer Service Directors undertook a review of existing services delivery arrangements in each District. This review also took account of planned welfare reform changes for the next two to three years, and the latest known information on the expected increase in business and customer volumes.</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.0/5" class="indent">This exercise identified a requirement for work in 429 locations to increase capacity for dealing with the higher volumes of customers and to accommodate additional staff. The extent of this work varied from location to location, and we developed a range of solutions to meet additional capacity requirements. We have embarked on a programme of converting or extending our existing buildings where necessary and in the vast majority of sites affected there is sufficient internal space to enable capacity increases by converting under-utilised general office space. In sites where increased capacity is required, the work carried out is reversible and of a temporary nature. Estate modification works have so far been completed in 392 buildings to support meeting the challenge of prevailing economic conditions. The final cost of modification works at these sites is not yet known and will be published in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.0/6" class="indent">In order to make our services more accessible to customers we are providing a range of support through outreach, often delivering advisory and other support on partners' premises. We are supplementing these measures by operating extended opening hours in some locations where the need for this is identified locally. This includes some offices opening to the public on Saturday.</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.0/7" class="indent">We only acquire new temporary space where all other measures are insufficient and Jobcentre Plus presence in these buildings will be clearly badged as temporary facilities. Jobcentre Plus have considered re-opening four offices, which were previously open to the public but have been closed in the last six years, for temporary re-occupation. These sites are detailed at Annex A.</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.0/8" class="indent">These offices in Annex A were previously closed as part of the Jobcentre Plus modernisation programme. In 2002 Jobcentre Plus inherited around 1,500 offices from the merger of the former Benefits Agency and Employment service. At the time of merger the two organisations had many offices which were geographically close to each other, often in the same street. The modernisation programme has modernised our Jobcentre network to improve customer service, rationalising our estate to provide excellent high street coverage and a single, integrated customer facing office, at the same time reducing cost to the taxpayer. We remain the largest office network in Government with 741 modern Jobcentres supported by 31 modern, industry standard contact centres and 79 main benefit processing centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.0/9" class="indent">The four offices listed in Annex A have now re-opened and are delivering an appointment-only based service to customers. No further offices which have been closed in the last six years are currently under consideration for re-opening. The original lease exit costs of closing the offices are also included in Annex A. The cost of re-occupation is yet to be finalised.</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.0/10" class="indent">The Jobcentre Plus estate remains under constant review, taking into account prevailing economic conditions and changes in our service delivery planning. The work recently carried out on our buildings, to meet the challenge of increased business and customer volumes, is of a temporary nature. This ensures we retain the ability to cope with the ever changing demands on Jobcentre Plus, without unnecessarily burdening ourselves with permanent, costly estate which we will not need after the economy has recovered.</p>
	<p pid="b.508W.0/11" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.509W.5/2"><i> </i>There are two types of jobseeker's allowance-contribution-based and income-based. Contribution-based jobseeker's allowance is based on how many national insurance contributions have been paid over the last two complete tax years.</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.5/3">Income-based jobseeker's allowance is dependent on income and savings. For contribution-based jobseeker's allowance, personal and household capital and savings are not taken into account when determining entitlement. However, periodic payments of occupational and personal pensions made to the person claiming contribution-based jobseeker's allowance are taken into account. Pension payments made to anyone else within the household are not considered when deciding entitlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.5/4">When assessing the amount of contribution-based jobseeker's allowance that is payable to a person who is in receipt of a personal or occupational pension, the first &#163;50 per week of that pension is disregarded. For each 1 pence over and above the &#163;50 disregard, 1 pence of jobseeker's allowance is deducted. Under the present arrangements contribution-based jobseeker's allowance is only withdrawn completely from those with pension or annuity payments of more than &#163;114.30 per week, based on April 2009 benefit rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.509W.5/5">General guidance on the application and interpretation of jobseeker's allowance rules for our decision makers can be found in the decision makers guide. A copy of the guide is available in the Library and on the Department for Work and Pensions' website at</p>

	<p pid="b.512W.2/2">Before Work Choice begins in October the new prime providers will not only have to undertake all the usual activities to set up and prepare their business but will also be under a contractual obligation to understand the often complex employment support needs of up to 14,000 current WORKSTEP customers that will transfer to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.512W.2/3">To enable them to do this, Department for Work and Pensions officials have developed a process to transfer only the necessary minimum customer data from existing providers to incoming prime providers. The process and a supporting data transfer form have been developed in consultation with existing providers, bidders, the Department for Work and Pensions Provision Forum Work Choice Sub-group and the British Association for Supported Employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.512W.2/4">The critical part of the process is for the customer to give their informed consent. They will be invited to do so by their current provider and will be advised that they can withdraw their consent at any time up to 14 days later.</p>
	<p pid="b.512W.2/5">We expect the great majority of customers to give their consent. But any customers who express doubt about whether or not they should give their consent will be able to speak to a Disability Employment Adviser in Jobcentre Plus. If the customer is not reassured by, or if they do not wish to speak with the adviser, they will still be able to move to Work Choice.</p>
	<p pid="b.512W.2/6">In those exceptional cases the current and future providers will agree a convenient time and place where the new provider can discuss with the customer the personal information that the new provider needs to effectively support the customer and to administer the programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.512W.2/7">At all stages during the development of the data transfer process, the Work Choice project has been advised by solicitors in the Department's Legal Group to ensure that the process is compliant with all relevant legislation.</p>

	<p pid="b.521W.2/3">A study carried out by E4Tech to inform the UK's 2009 Renewable Energy Strategy, examined the availability of biomass supplies. The results indicate that there could be sufficient biomass resource potential in the UK for bio-energy to play a significant role in meeting the renewable energy target in 2020, and that imported biomass feedstocks could increasingly become a traded commodity. The study assumed that food demands are met first, and only considered the potential for UK energy crops from land currently not used for arable crops. The study also considered unexploited UK biomass reserves such as energy from waste and bringing back into production forest and woodland that has fallen out of good management practice. These sources of biomass do not compete with food crops and so do not impact on food prices.</p>
	<p pid="b.521W.2/4">Biomass used for the production of transport biofuels currently accounts for approximately 1 per cent. of global land use. The Government undertook an assessment of the causes and implications of the agricultural food price spike in 2007-08 (published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-05">5 January</phrase> and available on DEFRA's website as part of the Food 2030 package). The report concluded that biofuels had not been a significant cause of recent food price spikes worldwide. For the longer term, we are supporting the development of &quot;second generation&quot; technology which could produce biofuels from non food sources such as algae, wood, straw and food waste, so reducing pressure on food crops and land.</p>

	<p pid="b.522W.13/1">The number of males and females proceeded against at magistrates courts and found guilty at all courts for attempted murder, England and Wales, by police force area, from 1997 to 2008 (latest available) is given in Tables 1 and 2.</p>
	<p pid="b.522W.13/2">Court proceedings data for 2009 are planned for publication in the autumn, 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.522W.13/3">The information requested on arrests is not collected centrally. The arrests collection held by the Home Office covers arrests for recorded crime (notifiable offences) only, broken down at a main offence group level, covering categories such as violence against the person and robbery. From these centrally reported categories it is not possible to separately identify arrests for attempted murder.</p>

	<p pid="b.530W.2/3">Costs incurred since then, including the balance of 2008, are shown as follows. The costs stated are for refurbishment works to the fabric and structure of buildings and do not include items such as furniture and are exclusive of VAT.</p>

	<p pid="b.531W.5/1">According to the definition provided by the Office of Government Commerce (OGC), temporary staff include all interim managers, specialist contractors, administrative, manual and clerical staff. Personnel who are engaged to provide advisory services are excluded as the OGC classifies them as &quot;consultancy&quot;. It is often the case that the same suppliers provide temporary staff and consultants.</p>
	<p pid="b.531W.5/2">On its formation on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May 2007</phrase> as a merger between the former Department for Constitutional Affairs and parts of the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice inherited a range of local procurement arrangements which were brought together within a single departmental wide function from April 2009. It is not possible therefore to identify expenditure on temporary staff classified according to OGC definitions from procurement data prior to the current financial year. To provide this information would incur the disproportionate cost of scrutinising thousands of invoices from relevant suppliers to determine what costs relate to consultancy and what costs relate to temporary staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.531W.5/3">The new departmental wide arrangements are based on the best practice processes that were already in operation on the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) agency. NOMS is therefore able to identify &#163;27.25 million expenditure in 2008-09 with its contracted Administrative and Clerical Agency Staff providers at that time (Brook Street; Hays; Reed; Employment Plus; Kelly Services; NRG and Office Angels).</p>
	<p pid="b.531W.5/4">In most cases, the Ministry now utilises the OGC Buying Solutions framework arrangements for the provision of temporary staff. The suppliers under this framework can be found at the following link under the categories of (1) Temporary Clerical and Admin (2) Specialist Contractors (3) Interim Management:</p>
	<p pid="b.531W.5/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.buyingsolutions.gov.uk/frameworks/full.html">http://www.buyingsolutions.gov.uk/frameworks/full.html</a></p>
	<p pid="b.531W.5/6">Using a slightly different definition for headcount monitoring purposes, the departmental annual resource accounts identify agency and contract staff costs and numbers within notes (9a) and (9c) in the column headed &quot;others&quot;. However, these figures include some staff on temporary contracts who are employed directly by the Ministry of Justice, hence the pension and social security costs disclosed within the total expenditure. The figures also include the Scotland Office and Wales Office. It would incur disproportionate costs to identify the specific costs and numbers associated with staff employed through agencies rather than directly employed. The accounts can be found at the following links for 2008-09 and 2007-08 respectively:</p>
	<p pid="b.531W.5/7" class="indent"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/resource-accounts-2008-09.htm">http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/resource-accounts-2008-09.htm</a></p>

	<p pid="b.531W.5/9">As part of its Performance Efficiency Programme, the Ministry of Justice has controls in place to restrict and reduce the number of agency and contract staff employed. In some circumstances, however, the employment of temporary personnel is unavoidable, for example to secure specialist skills for specific time-limited projects or to cover for absences such as maternity leave.</p>

	<p pid="b.547W.0/1">This is a complex area of work and there is an extensive programme of work under way to better understand and meet the needs of offenders with learning disabilities. Much of this work is set out in a National Delivery Plan which was published by the Department of Health in November 2009 which is being overseen by a new Health and Criminal Justice Board. This plan builds on the Government's response to Lord Bradley's review of people with mental health problems or learning disabilities in the Criminal Justice System, and work already under way.</p>
	<p pid="b.547W.0/2">There is a commitment across Government to work together to improve the health and well being of offenders across the criminal justice pathway-in police, courts, probation and prison services, and in the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.547W.0/3">Detailed information on offenders with learning difficulties or disabilities is held in a number of places including individual case files or by those who have undertaken specialist assessments or are responsible for particular activities or data. Therefore to collate, validate and provide meaningful information for this question, and in many cases manually check records, could be undertaken only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.547W.0/4">Whether an offender requires a particular programme will depend upon the assessment of their risk and needs. All reasonable adjustments should be made to ensure programmes are accessible to those who could potentially benefit, and if not alternative provision should be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.547W.0/5">The National Offender Management Service offers a number of interventions to meet the needs of offenders including for example an adapted sex offender treatment programme. It has also recently been agreed to develop an adapted version of the Thinking Skills Programme, and a new programme for violent offenders to accommodate a broader range of learning needs.</p>

Of these, 18 resulted in grades A* to C and 50 resulted in grades below C. In the 2007/08 academic year, there were 207 enrolments in GCSEs.

	<p pid="b.557W.2/2">The data above includes only achievements that were secured by young people who took the examination while they were in custody. Those who were released before the examination date may have continued study and taken examinations in the community. Some young people in Young Offender Institutions are still registered at schools and colleges in the community and therefore any GCSEs that they achieve while in custody will be reflected in the achievement figures of their respective school or college.</p>
	<p pid="b.557W.2/3">HM Prison Service Young Offender Institutions make up part of the custodial estate for under 18s and achievements of GCSEs in Secure Children's Homes, Secure Training Centres, or private prisons are not recorded centrally.</p>

	<p pid="b.568W.2/1">The Government have put in place a programme of national health service investment and reform since 1997 to improve service delivery in all parts of the United Kingdom. 93 per cent. of people nationally now rate the NHS as good or excellent. The NHS constitution contains 25 rights and 14 pledges for patients and the public including new rights to be treated within 18 weeks, or be seen by a cancer specialist within two weeks and an NHS health check every five years for those aged 40-74 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/2">There is significant evidence that these policies have yielded considerable benefits for the Gorton constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/3">For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/4" class="indent">Figures for December 2009 show that in the Manchester Primary Care Trust (PCT):</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/5" class="indent">87 per cent. of patients whose treatment involved admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/6" class="indent">97 per cent. of patients whose treatment did not involve admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/7" class="indent">In December 2009, at the Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 98.0 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in accident and emergency from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/8" class="indent">Between September 2002 and September 2008, the number of consultants at the Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has increased from 304 to 366. Between September 2002 and September 2008 the estimated number of nurses has increased from 2,383 to 3,274.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/9" class="indent">Between September 2001 and September 2008 the number of general practitioners (GP) per 100,000 within the Manchester PCT area has increased from 67.9 to 70.3.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/10" class="indent">85.6 per cent. of urgent GP referrals to the Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of the referral (as at December 2009).</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/11" class="indent">A &#163;512 million private finance initiative (PFI) scheme to replace many of Central Manchester University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust's existing hospitals into a linked development on the Manchester Royal Infirmary (Oxford Road) site is now complete. It includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/12" class="indent">The new Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, which opened to patients in August 2009;</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/13" class="indent">The new Manchester Royal Infirmary wing, which opened to patients in August 2009;</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/14" class="indent">The new Royal Manchester Children's Hospital opened to patients in June 2009. It brings together the specialist services previously provided at the Booth Hall and Pendlebury Children's Hospitals. The new children's hospital includes the paediatric intensive care unit which is one of the leading centres in the North West and a paediatric emergency department.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/15">Although statistical information is not available at a local level, Manchester will have also benefitted from national policies in other areas. For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/16" class="indent">Since 1997, gross current expenditure on personal social services has increased by around 70 per cent. in real terms with around 105,000 households now receiving intensive home care and 3,076 new extra care housing units-exceeding the original target of 1,500 new extra care units.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/17">Other strategies currently being implemented are:</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/18" class="indent">Subject to parliamentary approval, the Personal Care at Home Bill will guarantee free personal care for 280,000 people with the highest needs and help around 130,000 people who need home care for the first time to regain their independence.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/19" class="indent">&quot;Shaping the Future of Care Together&quot; Green Paper, published in July 2009, sets out a vision of a National Care Service for all adults in England which is fair, simple and affordable. The Department has consulted widely on this reform and is currently analysing the responses, which will feed into a White Paper later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/20" class="indent">The National Carer's Strategy-(&quot;Carers at the heart of 21st century families and communities&quot;)-launched in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.568W.2/21" class="indent">The first National Dementia Strategy was published in February 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.574W.6/1">Patient welfare and safety is a priority for patients being treated under the Extended Choice Network (ECN) as it is across the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.574W.6/2">The ECN rules are in place to govern the referral of patients by general practitioners (GPs) to elective care facilities operated by independent providers. The rules are also in place to help safeguard patient safety. NHS patients referred to ECN facilities are assessed before they receive treatment to ensure that they are treated at a hospital that has the facilities and level of care required to meet their needs. The ECN rules state that ECN providers should not treat a patient who has a current and significantly unstable psychiatric disorder where the approved facility cannot reasonably be expected to accommodate the patient's needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.574W.6/3">ECN providers are not permitted under the ECN rules to exclude patients who have a history of mental illness and who are currently in a stable condition whether on medication or not. A GP will use their clinical judgment and knowledge of the patient and their medical history to determine this. However, many of the hospitals in the ECN network do not have the psychiatric facilities or trained psychiatric staff required to safely care for a patient with a current and significantly unstable mental illness. For this reason current and significantly unstable mental illness is included as a co-morbidity in the ECN exclusion criteria.</p>
	<p pid="b.574W.6/4">ECN providers are required to take their obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act into account when listing services available for ECN.</p>

	<p pid="b.575W.2/1">During 2009, the Department undertook a series of meetings with key national stakeholders, representing general practitioners, community pharmacists, and manufacturers, to discuss the commitment in the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) agreement in England. These national stakeholders were the General Practitioners Committee of the British Medical Association, the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry, the British Generic Manufacturers Association and the Ethical Medicines Industry Group. We recognise that we could not have meetings with all stakeholders that might have views on the PPRS commitment and this informed our decision to hold a full public consultation, which gives all stakeholders the opportunity to input.</p>
	<p pid="b.575W.2/2">Patient safety is at the core of the proposals. Substitution will not be permissible where it may pose a potential risk to patient safety. Option 1 involves no change to the current arrangements. Both options 2 and 3, which involve changes, would give the flexibility to create a list of drugs that is either exempt from any arrangements (option 2), or included in any arrangements (option 3), which allows implementation to take account of whether there are any general clinical or patient safety concerns with regard to interchange between different manufacturers' products. Furthermore, both options 2 and 3 also maintain prescribers' clinical autonomy to tailor prescribing to their individual patients' clinical needs, through the ability of prescribers to opt in or out of the generic substitution arrangements for any prescription item. Therefore, patients would continue to receive a specific manufacturer's product where their treating clinician judges that there is clinical need.</p>

	<p pid="b.576W.8/1">The Government have put in place a programme of national health service investment and reform since 1997 to improve service delivery in all parts of the United Kingdom. 93 per cent. of people nationally now rate the NHS as good or excellent. The NHS Constitution contains 25 rights and 14 pledges for patients and the public including new rights to be treated within 18 weeks, or be seen by a cancer specialist within two weeks and a NHS Health Check every five years for those aged 40-74 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.8/2">There is significant evidence that these policies have yielded considerable benefits for the Stroud constituency. For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.8/3" class="indent">Figures for December 2009 show that in Gloucestershire Primary Care Trust (PCT):</p>

	<p pid="b.576W.8/5" class="indent">97 per cent. of patients whose treatment did not involve admission to hospital started their treatment within 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.8/6" class="indent">In December 2009, at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 97 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in accident and emergency from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.8/7" class="indent">Between September 2007 and September 2008, the number of consultants at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has increased from 272 to 287. Between September 1997 and September 2008, the estimated number of nurses has increased from 2,320 to 2,407.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.8/8" class="indent">Between September 2001 and September 2008 the number of general practitioners (GPs) per 100,000 within Gloucestershire PCT has increased from 61.6 to 68.7.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.8/9" class="indent">97.5 per cent, of urgent GP referrals to Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks of the referral.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.8/10" class="indent">A new GP health centre opened at the Gloucester Health Access Centre, Gloucester in May 2009.

	<p pid="b.576W.8/12">Although statistical information is not available at a local level, Stroud will have also benefited from national policies in other areas. For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.8/13" class="indent">Since 1997, gross current expenditure on personal social services has increased by around 70 per cent. in real terms with around 105,000 households now receiving intensive home care and 3,076 new extra care housing units-exceeding the original target of 1,500 new extra care units.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.8/14">Other strategies currently being implemented are:</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.8/15" class="indent">Subject to parliamentary approval, the Personal Care at Home Bill will guarantee free personal care for 280,000 people with the highest needs and help around 130,000 people who need home care for the first time to regain their independence.</p>
