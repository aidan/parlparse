	<p pid="c.1154W.2/1">The Political Parties and Elections Bill provides two powers for the Electoral Commission to enter premises. The first power is contained in paragraph 1(5) of schedule 1 to the Bill, and replicates, with one important change, the existing power in section 146(3) of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. This provides that, at any reasonable time, the Commission may enter premises for the purposes of carrying out its functions. Having entered under the power, the Commission may inspect documents relating to the income and expenditure of the individual or organisation whose premises the Commission has entered. It may also make copies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1154W.2/2">The existing power in section 146(3) enables the Commission only to enter the premises of registered political parties, recognised third parties who campaign in elections, and permitted participants who campaign in referendums. In addition to these categories of people, paragraph 1(5) will allow the same power also to be used in relation to regulated donees (including MPs, candidates and their election agents).</p>
	<p pid="c.1154W.2/3">Paragraph 3 of schedule 1 to the Bill provides that the Electoral Commission may apply to a justice of the peace for a warrant to enter premises. In order to obtain a warrant the Commission must demonstrate, on oath, to a justice of the peace that there are reasonable grounds for believing that a person has committed an offence or contravened a restriction or requirement and that an earlier request for documents has been made and not complied with. If these requirements are satisfied a justice of the peace can issue a warrant allowing a constable, together with any other person named in the warrant, to enter premises. Such a warrant may authorise the use of reasonable force, the searching of premises and taking of documents and may require a person named in the warrant to provide an explanation about any of the documents that are the object of the search.</p>
	<p pid="c.1154W.2/4">No prior notification of the Commission's intention to enter premises would be required. The person would be notified at the time of the Commission's entry to the premises.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)</phrase> and I have made clear, we have heard the force of opinion in the House on the issue of the Commission's powers and we have proposed measures to address these concerns for debate at Committee stage on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-11">11 November</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.1158W.3/1">Table 1 shows incidents of prisoner on staff assaults in each of the last five years by prison.</p>
	<p pid="c.1158W.3/2">The information set out is subject to important qualifications. The NOMS Incident Reporting System processes high volumes of data which are constantly being updated. The numbers provide a good indication of overall numbers but should not be interpreted as absolute.</p>
	<p pid="c.1158W.3/3">Assault information is recorded at establishment level in four categories: prisoner on prisoner, prisoner on officer, prisoner on other and other (which may include non-prisoner perpetrators). The recorded incidents of assaults on prison officers are not completely exclusive to officers; establishment recording sometimes includes assaults on other prison staff in this category. Rises or falls in reported numbers from one year to the next are not a good indicator of an underlying trend for a particular prison. Additionally there have been improvements in reporting over the years, and this is reflected in the tables.</p>
	<p pid="c.1158W.3/4">Assault data are complex and the numbers need to be interpreted with caution. Information recorded as assault incidents may involve one or many prisoners as some assault incidents may involve more than one assailant or more than one victim. Additionally in a proportion of incidents only the victim is known.</p>
	<p pid="c.1158W.3/5">The numbers supplied refer to the number of individual assault incidents. The numbers refer to all incidents recorded as assaults; these may also include threatening behaviour, projection of bodily fluids and other non-contact events and allegations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1158W.3/6">The category &quot;Prisoner on Other&quot; contains few entries but these may include prison staff as well as visitors, legal visitors, etc. For the purpose of this response the categories &quot;Prisoner on Officer&quot; and &quot;Prisoner on Other&quot; are used.</p>
	<p pid="c.1158W.3/7">Ministers, NOMS and the Prison Officers' Association are collectively committed to ensuring that violence in prisons is not tolerated in any form. Since 2004, a national strategy has directed every public sector prison to have in place a local violence reduction strategy and since mid 2007 this has been applied to the public and contracted out estate. A whole prison approach is encouraged, engaging all staff, all disciplines and prisoners in challenging unacceptable behaviour, problem-solving and personal safety.</p>

	<p pid="c.1161W.2/1">There are positive indications that accredited programmes may be effective in reducing re-offending for offenders in the community. The re-offending rate for all offenders who had undertaken interventions was 55 per cent., based on a two-year reconviction rate. Programme completers did statistically significantly better than those who did not start or who dropped out of programmes. The rates were 38 per cent., 61 per cent. and 64 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.1161W.2/2">A recent prison-based study showed that the one-year reconviction rate for both adult men and young offenders who had completed enhanced thinking skills (ETS) and reasoning and rehabilitation (R+R) interventions in prison represented a positive 2.5 percentage points difference in reconviction for adult male completers (17.0 per cent. vs. 19.5 per cent.) and a 4.1 percentage point difference for young offender completers (31.4 per cent. vs. 35.5 per cent.) compared to matched comparison groups. There was no difference in reconviction rates between programme starters and comparison groups. See tables 3 and 4:</p>

	<p pid="c.1162W.8/1">The allocation of prisoners at Whitemoor follows a careful risk assessment, taking into account individual needs, matters such as safety and security, as well as the availability of accommodation. Prison Service policy is for prisoners to be allocated to prisons appropriate to their security category; safety and security; individual needs in respect of sentence planning; as well as taking into account matters such as the continuation of family contact. It is not policy to locate prisoners in particular prisons or any part of a prison on the grounds of religion.</p>

	<p pid="c.1165W.3/2">This is in line with the Government's policy of encouraging, together with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and NATS, the use of CDA, where airspace and safety considerations allow. The procedure seeks to reduce the noise of arriving aircraft by ensuring that aircraft remain as high as possible for as long as possible and that segments of level flight during descent, which increase engine noise, are avoided. Guidance in the form of an arrivals code of practice on the use of CDA, developed in partnership with the industry, was originally issued in February 2002. This guidance has been kept under review and a revised code was published in November 2006. The code can be accessed on the departmental website at:</p>
	<p pid="c.1165W.3/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/environmentalissues/arrivalscodeofpractice/arrivalscodeofpractice">http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/aviation/environmentalissues/arrivalscodeofpractice/arrivalscodeofpractice</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1165W.3/4">The original focus of the arrivals code was to promote CDA at the three London designated airports (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted). Following the successful implementation of the code at these airports, the code has been used by NATS as a basis to promote and encourage greater use of CDA at other airports nationally and internationally. However it has to be acknowledged that local operational circumstances and restraints can vary from airport to airport. CDAs are agreed by air traffic controllers and pilots on a flight-by-flight basis, according to weather and traffic conditions. In all cases, NATS' overriding consideration is the safe and efficient operation of air traffic control (ATC) operations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1165W.3/5">CDA performance and developments are monitored. Reports are regularly presented for review by the consultative and technical sub-committees at the three London designated airports Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. Current CDA performance consistently averages 80 per cent. throughout the 24-hour period of operation.</p>

The Department has not seen any evidence that bacterial growth is, in practice, creating fuel quality problems in the UK.

	<p pid="c.1172W.0/3">Two letters asked for details of the insurance cover available to service personnel on operations and whether they are charged higher insurance premiums than those not deployed. The responses explained that personal insurance is optional and additional to the benefits MOD provides under the Armed Forces Pension and Compensation schemes, which have recently been increased; however, MOD facilitates through commercial providers the PAX and service life insurance schemes which cover war risks and do not increase premiums for personnel on operations. In addition, MOD's Service Risks Insurance Premium Refunds Scheme contributes towards the inflated life insurance premiums which some insurers charge personnel serving on operations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.0/4">The third letter expressed concern that young members of the armed forces pay higher vehicle insurance premiums than civilians of the same age. The response explained that some brokers have special arrangements with insurers for providing motor insurance for service personnel. In particular, the Services' Insurance and Investment Advisory Panel, who are a panel of independent insurance and investment advisers specialising in advising service personnel, can arrange motor insurance cover without premium loading and offer rates that are competitive with the rates available to civilians and in many cases are cheaper. They also provide some benefits that are not normally found in policies sold to civilians.</p>

	<p pid="c.1172W.3/1">Within the north of England there is one military Department of Community Mental Health (DCMH), located in Catterick. DCMH Catterick is responsible for treating both regular and reserve service personnel, as out-patients, following a referral from their military general practitioner or the Reserve Mental Health Programme (RMHP) based at Chilwell. In-patient care, when necessary, is provided under contract by the Priory Group at facilities located in Darlington, Stockport, Altrincham and Bartle.</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.3/2">Figures on attendances at DCMHs have only been centrally recorded since the beginning of 2007 as part of the work carried out by DASA, on the Armed Forces Psychiatric Morbidity Report; figures for 2008 are currently being verified and are not available for release. In 2007 there were 720 new attendances at DCMH Catterick, of whom 521 were assessed at their first appointment to be suffering from a mental health condition. Of those 521, 10 personnel were diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.3/3">Information on the numbers of service personnel to be admitted as in-patients to the facilities named above for any cause between 2005-07 is shown as follows. Information is not held centrally on the specific diagnosis leading to their admittance.</p>

	<p pid="c.1172W.3/12">The treatment of veterans is the responsibility of the NHS and as such, with the exception of those eligible under RMHP, they do not receive treatment at DCMHs. However, the MOD does recognise that it has an expertise to offer in the diagnosis and treatment of service related mental health conditions. The Department of Health, in conjunction with the MOD, has launched five community mental health pilots targeted at veterans. Each site has a trained community veterans' mental health therapist. Veterans can access this service directly or through their GP, ex-service organisations, the Veterans' Welfare Service, or social service departments, the initiative is NHS-led and reflects NHS best practice. This will address assessment and treatment of veterans' mental health problems in the longer term. Within the north of England, a pilot is in operation at NHS Bishop Auckland General Hospital. Subject to the outcome of the evaluation, best practice will be identified and rolled out more widely across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.1172W.3/13">In addition, to assist those veterans not in the catchment areas of one of the pilots, we have expanded our Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) based at St. Thomas' Hospital, London, to include assessment of veterans with mental health symptoms with operational service since 1982. The clinician in charge also provides support and advice to GPs and other civilian health professional requiring advice on the military aspects of treatment.</p>

	<p pid="c.1173W.2/4" class="indent">I undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Question on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-29">29 October</phrase> (Official Report, column 1029W) about Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigations and reports.</p>
	<p pid="c.1173W.2/5" class="indent">In answering your question I have interpreted the phrase 'HSE Reports' to mean Crown Censures<sup>(1)</sup> or Crown Improvement Notices. None of the latter has been reported. The Ministry of Defence received two Crown Censures during January to December 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1173W.2/6" class="indent">The first Crown Censure followed the fatality of a Corporal as a result of injuries sustained from being crushed between two armoured personnel carriers being unloaded from a low loader at Teesport, Cleveland in March 2007. The second Crown Censure was a fatality as a result of crushing between a Multiple Launch Rocket System vehicle and a large fork lift truck at Albemarle Barracks, Northumberland also in March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.1173W.2/7" class="indent">As a result of these tragic incidents, investigations were carried out which have led to a revision of arrangements for assessing workplace transport risks in the MOD; specifically, improvements have been made in the following areas:</p>
	<p pid="c.1173W.2/8" class="indent">1. Safe systems of work are now in place, including carrying out risk assessments and taking action on the resulting recommendations before any work is undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="c.1173W.2/9" class="indent">2. All staff involved are properly trained and have access to sufficient information and instruction to enable them to carry out the work safely.</p>
	<p pid="c.1173W.2/10" class="indent">3. Staff with supervisory duties now receive improved training on those responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1173W.2/11" class="indent">4. Interfaces between the MOD internal organisations responsible for the delivery of vehicles and those operating the vehicle fleets have been improved.</p>
	<p pid="c.1173W.2/12" class="indent">5. Equipment maintenance practises have been reviewed and improved systems have been put in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.1173W.2/13" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> Crown Censure is an administrative procedure, whereby HSE may summon a Crown employer to be censured for a breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act, or a subordinate regulation, which, but for Crown Immunity, would have led to prosecution with a realistic prospect of a conviction.</p>

However, there will be times when it is necessary to employ private sector health specialists, such as when a particular specialism is not available within the DMS, or when it would be impractical to provide the service using internal resources (for example, aspects of healthcare for personnel posted overseas in places such as Germany and other smaller bases and detachments).</p>
	<p pid="c.1176W.0/2">In practice, the departmental spend on such private sector health provision is drawn from a number of individual budgets across the MOD, including at local unit level within the single services, and disproportionate effort would be required to provide the information requested.</p>

	<p pid="c.1189W.0/1">Evidence suggests that education is an important factor in reducing the risk of social exclusion. For example, people with no qualifications are seven times more likely to be unemployed and five times more likely to be low paid than people with higher education. The Strategy Unit's discussion paper 'Getting on, Getting Ahead' identified high quality post-16 education and training as a critical factor in improving people's life chances. The discussion paper provides the analytical base for a cross-Government White Paper, to be published in December. The White Paper will set out a range of policies that aim to raise social mobility including providing more people with the capabilities and skills needed to get more and better jobs.</p>

Opportunistic screening is offered to all sexually active women and men, aged under 25 years, in a variety of health and non-health care settings.

	<p pid="c.1197W.2/1">The Department is addressing reducing undiagnosed HIV infection in a number of ways, including increased investment in targeted HIV health promotion work to improve HIV testing uptake for those most at risk, namely gay men and people from African communities.

	<p pid="c.1197W.2/2">In addition, the offering and recommending of an HIV test to all pregnant women has resulted in an estimated 90 per cent. uptake in 2006 and a dramatic fall in the proportion of women giving birth to HIV positive babies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.2/3">Also, through funding the publication of HIV for non-HIV specialists: 'Diagnosing the Undiagnosed', we are providing detailed guidance to support improved detection and diagnosis of HIV in the UK. A copy has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1197W.2/4">We are also inviting proposals for new pilots on action to reduce undiagnosed HIV following publication in June of 'Health Inequalities: Progress and Next Steps'. A copy of this has been placed in the Library. Funding of &pound;400,000 is available to support the pilots this year. This will support implementation of the UK 'Guidelines for HIV testing 2008', prepared by the British HIV Association, the British Association of Sexual Health and HIV and the British Infection Society, and published in September 2008.</p>

	<p pid="c.1217W.6/1">A stage 1 equality impact assessment (EIA) of the National DNA database (NDNAD) was conducted by the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) in June-July 2007. This was an initial screening process to identify any potential equality issues in NDNAD processes. It made a number of recommendations which are being progressed by a working group comprising NPIA officials and representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the NDNAD Ethics Group. It also recommended that the EIA should be reviewed after further information had been gathered in 12 months' time.</p>
	<p pid="c.1217W.6/2">The NPIA also carried out an initial stage 1 equality impact assessment of the ACPO DNA Good Practice Guide in June 2007. The ACPO guide provides good practice guidance for police forces on the use of DNA, including the taking of DNA samples from persons in custody. The stage 1 EIA made 10 recommendations which are also currently under consideration by the working group.</p>
	<p pid="c.1217W.6/3">The working group has met several times since early autumn 2007. It has considered all the recommendations from both stage 1 EIAs and future action required. This consideration initiated the stage 2 EIA review process which is on-going, looking at any potential equality issues which were identified in greater depth. Work on some of the actions has been completed, but work on the majority is still in progress.</p>
	<p pid="c.1217W.6/4">Copies of the two stage 1 assessments have been placed in the Library. It is anticipated that the stage 2 assessments will be available in December 2008. Copies of the stage 2 EIAs will be published on the NPIA website in late 2008 or early 2009.</p>

It also set out a range of actions to address the challenge of climate change and to protect the environment. The Housing Green Paper was subject to an impact assessment, which includes a specific impact test on sustainable development, carbon assessment and other environmental assessments. This was published alongside the Housing Green Paper and its sister documents. These documents have been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1221W.0/3">It is for regional spatial strategies to determine the appropriate level of housing growth and the best location for it in their region. A sustainability appraisal, incorporating a strategic environmental assessment, is part of the process of preparing regional spatial strategies.</p>

	<p pid="c.1222W.2/35">Agreement has been reached on phasing out several of the remaining coupled payments, with their amounts usually being added to the decoupled SPS and SAPS, such that decoupling is budget neutral. The payments involved and relevant dates are presented in table 2. Decoupling is also a major focus of the current health check negotiations, where agreement is expected to be reached on phasing out several other coupled payments (with their amounts again being added to the SPS and SAPS), with expected phase-outs as presented in table 3. The UK &quot;Vision for the Common Agricultural Policy&quot; is clear that in the longer term, direct payments should be phased out completely, with payments to farmers targeted at delivering public benefits, including environmental benefits, through a re-shaped pillar two.</p>

Within this programme various studies have been made of the role of land management, including wetlands, on flood risk management. Most notably, my Department published the finding of a major review of the impacts of rural land use and management on flood generation in November 2004. Subsequently, further work was commissioned on the analysis of historical data sets to look for the impacts of land use and management change on flood generation. The final report will be published in the near future. The Environment Agency takes into account the role that washlands or wetlands may play in flood management when it is considering specific flood management problems.</p>

	<p pid="c.1230W.9/1">During 2005 to 2007, DFID and the World Bank group's Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) evaluated how tax policy and its administration shaped the investment climate in 13 countries in Africa and the middle east. This indicated that tax policy and administration do not enable business and promote growth in most developing countries. Even in the countries which have in place appropriate taxes at appropriate rates, weak tax administration results in a heavy financial and time burden for businesses, especially for small and medium enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="c.1230W.9/2">The studies, which were endorsed by a DFID/FIAS supported conference in Zambia in February 2007 of senior officials from Africa, showed that past donor assistance on tax had too often been fragmented between policy and administration. Tax reform had tended to focus on short-term revenue generation rather than structuring the tax system to promote economic efficiency and growth (and therefore longer-term revenue generation). This requires promoting investment, private sector development and the creation of a culture of compliance. DFID and FIAS have now initiated a project to help address such problems, by developing and piloting best practice policy guidance and support for implementation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1231W.2/2">The Department for International Development (DFID) has closely followed the development of the organisation through the Technical Advisory Committee and Annual Meetings. DFID has also seconded a senior official to work in the ICF Secretariat. ICF has quickly become effective in building up its project portfolio. The Board has approved 20 projects but it is too early to assess effectiveness fully. Recently, the ICF published its first Project Completion Report. The project created a productive dialogue between businesses, the East African Community and customs authorities in East Africa. Many of the project's recommendations for customs reforms have been implemented, leading to significant reductions in delays and costs to businesses in importing and exporting goods.</p>

	<p pid="c.1231W.5/1">The UK Government are providing &pound;20 million to the Bangladesh Investment Climate Facility (BICF) to assist the Government's Regulatory Reforms Commission and Better Business Forum, to improve this business environment and reduce costs. For example, there has recently been a 50 per cent. reduction to the costs of registering a business due to BICF inputs. We are also working with the Government of Bangladesh and the World Bank to help set up large economic zones that will provide businesses with cheaper access to land serviced with a constant supply of utilities such as electricity.</p>
	<p pid="c.1231W.5/2">In the export sector, Bangladesh needs to remain competitive with other producers in the Asia region.

By 2009, the Katalyst project will have contributed to the creation of 180,000 jobs through its work on making 800,000 farms and businesses more competitive. By 2015, Phase 2 of the project is projected to benefit 1.2 million enterprises and commercial farms&mdash;employing three million people in 26 sectors.</p>

	<p pid="c.1232W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) participates annually in the joint Government-donor review of the public financial management reform programme, with the most recent taking place in May 2008. Issues relating to public financial management also form part of the IMF's Article IV consultations and are a central feature of policy dialogue with budget support donors. These require regular reporting from Government and ongoing monitoring by development partners, including DFID.</p>
	<p pid="c.1232W.2/2">Since 2005, reform of public financial management has already delivered significant improvements in terms of revenue management and budget credibility. Tax revenues continue to grow, with a 37 per cent. increase during the first three quarters of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007; revenue out-turn up to September 2008 is 99 per cent. of budget forecast (compared to 85 per cent. in 2007); and Government have spent 72 per cent. of their budget in the first three quarters of 2008 (compared to 62 per cent. in 2007). In December, the Government will launch a second phase of the programme. This will build on these successes and provide additional focus to financial management in line ministries. It will also address outstanding issues from the first phase, including the integration of recurrent and capital budgets, and strengthen the links between planning, budgeting and expenditure.</p>

The World Bank and Secretariat are active in providing technical support to these CoST countries. An International Advisory Group (IAG), made up of representatives from CoST countries, international NGOs, construction companies, and professional organisations as well as DFID and the World Bank has been set up to review outcomes of the pilot programme.

No disaggregated data are currently available nationwide on prisoners.

The effectiveness of the project expenditure is formally reviewed on an annual basis by DFID staff in conjunction with Government partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.1237W.5/2">The latest annual reviews of each of the projects have projected that they will be successful. Household surveys in West Bengal show that the percentage of the urban poor has reduced from 33 per cent. in 1998 to 18 per cent. in 2006, with the rate of decline being faster in the project municipalities. Property tax receipts, the primary source of municipal revenue, have increased by between 11 and 14 per cent. as a result of improved tax collection procedures. Policy achievements include the introduction of new state legislation mandating that 25 per cent. of municipal revenues are spent on poor people. Development plans for the further improvement of basic services have been prepared on the basis of community priorities in each of the project municipalities and are now under implementation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1238W.8/1">The Multi-Stakeholder Forestry programme (MFP) in Indonesia ran from 2000 to 2007. The aim of the programme was to improve the rights of local communities to forest resources and reduce illegal logging. Independent evaluations of the project's impact on illegal logging, poverty, community forestry and conflict were conducted and published in 2006. A final project completion report published in 2007 gave the project the highest achievable rating. Further information can be obtained on the DFID website:</p>

	<p pid="c.1238W.8/3">The project resulted in Government better realising their obligations to forest communities, including the passing of 70 local-government decrees on community-based forest management in project areas. In the 300 project sites, covering 2.25 million hectares of forest, local people now have more economic opportunities and higher-value markets for their products. In Sulawesi, MFP support for a forest certification scheme means communities now get 11 times more for their timber than previously. Research by the projects' civil-society partners brought about a presidential decree on illegal logging.</p>

	<p pid="c.1240W.3/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has spent just over &pound;75 million on roads, agriculture and community forestry in Nepal since 2000. All these programmes were targeted at poor and excluded groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.1240W.3/2">Over 1,060 kilometres of rural roads have been built by poor local people, with wages paid for by DFID. Our support to Helvetas has built 163 new footbridges bringing 371,000 people closer to markets, schools and health clinics. DFID has spent &pound;47 million on these investments since 2002.</p>
	<p pid="c.1240W.3/3">DFID's Agriculture Perspective Plan Support Programme has supported poor and excluded groups in some of the most remote districts to improve farm production and the marketing of farm products. The programme has improved the incomes of over 500,000 people, lifting 87,500 people out of poverty since 2002 at a cost of &pound;147 per person.</p>
	<p pid="c.1240W.3/4">The Livelihoods and Forestry Programme (LFP) has been credited as an international example of good practice in community forestry supporting community forest user groups that have reached 460,000 Nepalese households, or 10 per cent. of the total population. In 2007-08, LFP user groups generated &pound;730,000 (Rs 90 million) from the sale of their own forest products to pay for improved local services and created 1.67 million person days of local employment managing community forests&mdash;equivalent to about 5,500 full-time jobs. More significantly the community forestry model developed with DFID support has spread across the country. 40 per cent. of households are involved nationally and many disadvantaged groups have been empowered by their involvement (see LFP case study) creating over six million days of employment for poor people per year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1241W.8/1">The information is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="c.1241W.8/2"><i> (a)</i> Nigeria has made good progress in improving the management of its oil revenues since the restoration of civilian rule in 1999. In 2004 the Government introduced an oil price based fiscal rule (OPBFR) which was given legal force within the federal-level Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) of 2007. The FRA provides a framework for fiscal management and institutionalises reforms intended to enhance fiscal transparency, accountability and medium-term fiscal sustainability. All oil revenue above a predetermined threshold has been held in a special excess crude account (ECA). Application of the OPBFR rule has led to considerable budget surpluses and quick accumulation of foreign currency reserves, which currently amount to over US$60 billion, covering more than 30 months of imports. Debt management has also improved greatly. In 2006, Nigeria used US$18 billion of its oil savings to settle its Paris Club debt obligations, leading to a public debt to GDP ratio of 12.5 per cent. of GDP in 2007. This is lower than the 34 per cent. median for countries with the same sovereign credit risk rating of BB-. External debt is now only 16 per cent. of total stock, most of this being multilateral debt contracted on concessional terms.</p>
	<p pid="c.1241W.8/3">Oil accounts for over 90 per cent. of total government revenues. Since 1999, approximately half of all revenues go to the federal Government and the rest to state and local governments. Under Nigeria's constitution, states have considerable autonomy. A major challenge to further improving fiscal policy in Nigeria is incentivising states to adopt sound public financial management policies, despite pressure to spend the increased revenues from higher oil prices, and building states' capacity to implement the necessary reforms.</p>
	<p pid="c.1241W.8/4"><i> (b)</i> In addition to the aforementioned reforms, Nigeria has also taken significant steps to strengthen its systems of accountability. It is now a global leader in the extractive industries transparency initiative (EITI), which aims to generate greater transparency in the flow of revenues from extractive industries. The Nigerian EITI (NEITI) successfully completed a full physical, process and financial audit of the oil and gas sector for the period 1999 to 2004. The 2005 audit is almost complete. In 2007, Nigeria became the first country to enact the EITI into legalisation. Further work is needed to institutionalise NEITI, and enforce the NEITI Act. Nigeria is also taking steps to improve the transparency and efficiency of its budget process, including the development of medium term sector strategies within a medium term economic framework. Progress on institutionalising budget reforms has been slow due to resistance from political interests, poor co-ordination, and weak capacity. Public procurement legislation was recently introduced, which aims to improve the transparency and effectiveness of public expenditure. Implementation and enforcement of this legislation could be impeded by weak capacity in ministries.</p>
	<p pid="c.1241W.8/5"><i> (c)</i> Non-oil growth to generate employment and raise incomes is a priority of the Nigerian Government. The non-oil sector provides the majority of livelihoods, mostly in agriculture, and is currently contributing strongly to overall growth. The IMF estimates that non-oil growth in 2007 was 9.6 per cent., compared to annual averages of 7.8 per cent. across all sectors for 2004 to 2007, and just 2 per cent. between 1980 and 2002. Agriculture, construction, telecommunications, transportation, retail and wholesale have all grown strongly. However, despite the strong response of the non-oil sector to reforms to date, major challenges remain. Nigeria is ranked 118 out of 181 countries in the World Bank Doing Business 2009 survey, and Nigeria's huge infrastructure gap must be addressed if the economy is to fully realise its growth potential. Non-oil exports grew by 30 per cent. in 2007 but still represent just 2 per cent. of total exports and consist mainly of primary agricultural commodities. The recent strong performance of the telecommunication and financial sectors demonstrate their growth potential once regulatory frameworks are established and macroeconomic conditions are favourable.</p>

	<p pid="c.1243W.2/2">Important progress has been made towards the MDGs, but there is still a long way to go. At the half-way mark to 2015, the UN High Level Event (HLE) last month in New York provided an opportunity to strengthen the commitment of the international community, including the private sector and foundations, to the MDGs. The UN Secretary General (UN SG) announced commitments of $16 billion at the closing plenary of the event. Of these commitments, the UK estimates that at least $11.5 billion represents new commitments (for education, malaria, health and food security) but we are waiting for the UN to confirm these figures with member states and other stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="c.1243W.2/5">Going forward we must ensure the commitments made at the UN HLE are delivered. The next major international meeting will be in Doha where the international community will come together to review progress on financing for development.</p>

	<p pid="c.1244W.8/1">Over the last six years the Department for International Development (DFID) has provided &pound;775 million for water supply and sanitation programmes. It is estimated that these programmes have resulted in 25 million people gaining access to these basic services. It is not possible to disaggregate data on our funding specifically for water wells, nor accurately to estimate how many lives have been saved directly.</p>
	<p pid="c.1244W.8/2">A detailed breakdown of DFID support for the water sector over the last five years can be found in the two reports titled 'Financial Support to the Water Sector 2002-2004' and 'Financial Support to the Water Sector 2004-2006'. These are both available on the DFID website and in the Library:</p>

	<p pid="c.1245W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has been supporting the Government of Sierra Leone to reduce the administrative barriers to investment.

	<p pid="c.1245W.2/4">As part of a Diamond Sector Programme (2004-07) DFID has funded and provided technical support to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in Sierra Leone, enabling more transparency and accountability by publishing and verifying transactions between Government and companies in the sector. Sierra Leone was accepted as an EITI candidate country on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-22">22 February 2008</phrase> and has until <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-09">9 March 2010</phrase> to undertake validation to obtain full membership of the initiative.</p>
	<p pid="c.1245W.2/5">DFID has been the principal donor to the Sierra Leone Anti-Corruption Commission, since its establishment in 2000. Until recently, progress in tackling corruption had been slow and political commitment weak. However, initiatives under the new Government such as the appointment of a capable and independent Anti-Corruption Commissioner, a revised Anti-Corruption Act and a new National Anti-Corruption Strategy gives us some confidence that we will see progress in the fight against corruption in Sierra Leone. Recognising this renewed commitment, we are looking at a new support package for the ACC with donor partners.</p>

	<p pid="c.1246W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) has committed &pound;8.66 million to the Making Markets Work Better for the Poor project in Vietnam since 2003. The project links poor people in rural provinces to international markets to maximise their revenues from agricultural and other production. A good example is the development of sustainable smallholder bamboo production supplying IKEA with materials for flooring which is delivering additional benefits of $1 million per year to poor households in Thanh Hoa province. Pilot schemes in 30 locations have raised incomes for 20,000 households and created 500 new jobs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1246W.5/2">DFID is also assisting Vietnam to fulfil its World Trade Organisation (WTO) commitments by providing &pound;4 million to the Beyond WTO programme, including help to poor people to seize the opportunities created by Vietnam's integration into the global economy. Vietnam's agricultural exports increased by 20 per cent. in 2007, the year after WTO accession.</p>
	<p pid="c.1246W.5/3">DFID also provide major funding to the rural transport sector (&pound;40.5 million over 10 years) to improve the quality of the rural road networks to link many poor villages to national and international markets. This has helped reduce the production costs of agro-processing for export, making products more competitive in global markets.</p>

	<p pid="c.1248W.3/5">The introduction of employment and support allowance will not affect the level of benefit expenditure on existing incapacity benefits customers, including contributory incapacity benefit and income support on grounds of incapacity. However, it will affect the level of benefit expenditure on new claimants receiving employment and support allowance for the first time instead of incapacity benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.1248W.3/6">According to our latest estimates, paying these people employment and support allowance rates will cost nearly &pound;400 million more spread over the first five years, including the knock-on to housing benefit expenditure, compared to paying the incapacity benefit rates.</p>
	<p pid="c.1248W.3/7">The &pound;400 million arises largely because, under employment and support allowance, claimants receive an increased rate of benefit at the 14<sup>(th)</sup> week, much sooner than under the incapacity benefits system, where higher rates are typically payable after a year of incapacity.</p>

	<p pid="c.1254W.2/2">We have no specific costs that can be directly attributed to moving income support carers to a modified jobseeker's allowance as they constitute a minority of the income support caseload that would be moved. As such, the work we have done to cost a move to a modified jobseeker's allowance has been on the basis of moving the entire caseload. However, there would be no change in the amount of benefit paid to carers on income support nor would there be any additional one-off implementation costs associated with this specific group. There would also be no increased requirements placed upon carers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1254W.2/3">The impact assessment produced alongside the Green Paper provided some high-level information about the proposal to move income support cases on to jobseeker's allowance in so far as it applied to lone parents. Further details will be provided once the policy has been reviewed in the light of responses to the consultation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1257W.0/1">The Department recognises and supports the vital role that the third sector plays in empowering individuals and communities. The funding of these organisations is an operational matter for the LSC. Mark Haysom, the LSC's chief executive, will write to the hon. Member with the information requested and a copy of his reply will be placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1257W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-07">7 November 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.1257W.0/3" class="indent">I am writing in response to your Parliamentary Question that asked: how much the Greater Manchester LSC has given to a) Greater Manchester Council for Voluntary Organisations (GMCVO), b) Greater Manchester Voluntary Sector Support and c) Greater Manchester Voluntary Sector Learning Consortium. Our understanding is that the latter two organisations are administered by the GMCVO which is the accountable body.</p>
	<p pid="c.1257W.0/4" class="indent">The question includes the term 'given' which may be interpreted as implying that the LSC has grant funded the organisations listed above. At present the LSC is not providing any form of grant funding to GMCVO but we do have a contract in place with this organisation for LSC funded activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.1257W.0/5" class="indent">The LSC currently has a single contract with GMCVO and an additional contract currently under negotiation. The organisation is also a partner in a successful consortium bid. The details are set out below.</p>
	<p pid="c.1257W.0/6" class="indent">The LSC has recently awarded a contract as part of the activity funded under the LSC's European Social Fund programme. The organisation has successfully completed the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire and is a on our approved supplier list. Subsequently, the organisation successfully tendered to the LSC to become the Grant Co-ordinating Body to manage the community grants programme for Greater Manchester. Details of the contract are publicly available on our website. In summary the contract for the management of the community grants programme will run from May 2007 to December 2010 and has a total value of &pound;796,232.</p>
	<p pid="c.1257W.0/7" class="indent">The aim of the project is to establish a sub-regional grants co-ordinating structure to develop, deliver and manage a community grants programme across the Greater Manchester sub-region to support smaller community based organisations who would not normally access ESF funding to engage in the programme. The focus of activity is engaging people from the hardest to reach communities and individuals experiencing multiple disadvantages. Ninety percent of the funding available will go to small community and voluntary sector organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1257W.0/8" class="indent">In addition the organisation has successfully tendered to deliver ESF funded Level 4 training which was tendered for in March 2008. We are currently at the contract clarification stage. The anticipated value of the contract is less than &pound;35,000</p>
	<p pid="c.1257W.0/9" class="indent">The LSC has recently procured activity through ESF Technical Assistance funding. The aim of the planned activity is to better engage the third sector workforce, both employed and volunteer, in the LSC's Train to Gain programme. The project will cover the whole of the North West and has a total value of &pound;120k for the whole region. Voluntary Sector North West have successfully tendered as the lead organisation in a consortia bid. Greater Manchester Council for Voluntary Organisations is a named partner in the bid. They will act as a sub-contractor undertaking delivery of activity for the Greater Manchester element of the region wide activity which we anticipate will be approximately 40% of the total contract value.</p>
	<p pid="c.1257W.0/10" class="indent">If you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact our regional Director for the North West, John Korzeniewski</p>

	<p pid="c.1258W.3/1">The consultation process for the relicensing of Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) is part of an assessment of their performance being undertaken by the National Audit Office. SSCs are being assessed by the NAO in five groups of five between now and August 2009. Each SSC has been asked to provide a stakeholder map to the NAO which includes sector specific stakeholders such as trade associations, employer forums and professional bodies and where appropriate sector specific awarding bodies. The NAO will then as part of the evidence gathering process use the map to consult with the identified key stakeholders. The consultation is an inclusive process and any organisation which wishes to input evidence on any SSC can submit their views to the NAO. This includes professional bodies, regulatory bodies, awarding bodies, funding bodies and regional partners, as well as individual employers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1258W.3/2">Organisations wishing to submit comments are asked to present information using the four key themes in the assessment framework. These are a well run SSC; SSC core products and services; SSC sector specific solutions; and SSC results and impacts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1258W.3/3">The UK Commission for Employment and Skills has a website which contains details of the SSC timetable for consultation for each SSC, as well as explaining the process for consultation for employers, professional bodies and stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="c.1263W.3/2">on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, as matters to do with employers' liability compulsory insurance (ELCI) sit with the DWP. I understand that your inquiry is about ELCI and not public liability insurance. At present, where a potential claimant who has been injured or made ill through their work and is unable to identify the employer's insurer to claim against, they may use the employers' liability code of practice tracing service. The code of practice, which was launched on <phrase class="date" code="1999-11-01">1 November 1999</phrase>, is a voluntary code operated by the insurance industry, which requires signatories to retain historical records of insurance policies for 60 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1263W.3/3">Tracing employers' liability insurance policies is complex and we know that the historical records of some insurers are incomplete. However, the Government are committed to improving this situation and we are working with stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of the tracing service, ensuring that we are in a position where we can be confident that every effort has been made to trace this information. For this reason, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has asked the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to consider positive measures within the industry to address this issue. I understand that the ABI are looking into the feasibility of a database.</p>
	<p pid="c.1263W.3/4">In the meantime, DWP will continue to monitor the success rate of employers' liability insurance policy tracing through the Employers' Liability Code of Practice Review Body, and support improvements to the code, in order to build further upon the successes in tracing employers' liability insurance policies.</p>

	<p pid="c.1269W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-07">7 November 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.1269W.0/3" class="indent">I am writing in response to your Parliamentary Questions 229264 and 229261 that asked: &quot;whether the Learning and Skills Council will reimburse college spending from the learner support funds to redress the effects of delayed education maintenance allowance payments,&quot; and &quot;what steps have been adopted by the Learning and Skills Council to allow colleges to give Learner Support monies to student yet to receive their Education Maintenance Allowance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.1269W.0/4" class="indent">The Learning and Skills Council provides schools and colleges with discretionary learner support to help learners in severe hardship. Where individuals are suffering as a result of late payment of their EMA, we would want colleges to offer whatever forms of help are necessary to learners. How these arrangements are best administered is a matter for colleges. Colleges will also need to determine how to recover any expenditure from learners once they receive their EMA back payment.</p>
	<p pid="c.1269W.0/5" class="indent">Many colleges are putting such arrangements in place using existing funding. However, where in the short term a college does need additional funding, the LSC will be willing to reprofile payments to the college in year, to front load their overall funding allocation. This will ensure that funds are available to each and every college to meet the current situation. The priority must be to ensure that any learner in need of support to alleviate hardship is able to access it. Colleges wishing to explore the possibility of reprofiling have been advised to contact their Regional Finance Director.</p>

The best evidence comes from evidence reviews, such as Douglas Kirby's 'Emerging Answers: Research findings on programmes to reduce teenage pregnancies and STIs' (2007), which identified the key characteristics of effective SRE programmes.

Responsibility for 16-19 funding will transfer to local authorities, supported by a new Young People's Learning Agency.

All 131 academies receive equivalent funding to SDG. Schools are free to spend SDG on any purpose to support improvements in teaching and learning in schools, leading to higher standards of attainment for every learner. This can include expenditure on improving teaching and learning for pupils with special educational needs. We do not collect centrally details of how schools spend their SDG, as the Government aim to keep reporting requirements on schools to a minimum. Standards in schools are not assessed against particular funding streams, so no particular assessment has been made of the effectiveness of school development grant. Standards in schools are assessed through Ofsted inspections and information on pupil attainment.</p>
