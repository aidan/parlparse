	<p pid="a.622W.5/1">The Department has supported the right to request (R2R), which has enabled 45 staff-led social enterprises to be established as shown in the following table. This policy has supported approximately 25,000 staff to move out of the national health service into social enterprises with contracts worth roughly &#163;900 million a list of these are also in the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.622W.5/2">The Department cannot provide details of individual social enterprise staff and turnover figures as they are commercial in confidence and belong to the social enterprises as they are now independent bodies. Contracts were negotiated between the new social enterprises and commissioners (ie primary care trusts). The Department's policy was the contracts should be for between three and five years, depending on services and the introduction of any qualified provider for their services.</p>

We have made good progress and are on track to meet the 50% improvement in deceased donor rates by 2013 anticipated by the Organ Donation Taskforce. A Transitional Steering Group, established in March 2011 is encouraging action at all levels and provides a clear reporting line to United Kingdom health ministers on progress. As we modernise the NHS we will continue our work to keep donation rates at a record high so that more people can benefit from a life-saving transplant.</p>

	<p pid="a.628W.5/17">Sustained work to improve organ donation and transplantation rates continues at national, regional and local levels and we have made good progress and are on track to meet the 50% improvement in deceased donor rates by 2013 anticipated by the Organ Donation Taskforce. Significant resources have been made available, largely through NHS Blood and Transplant, to increase the number of specialist nurses for organ donation and appoint clinical leads, donation committees and donation chairs in acute trusts to drive improvement locally. This has helped donor rates to increase and for rates to continue to rise in 2011-12.</p>

The list included a possible quality standard or standards on pain relief, including pain relief in children. This topic of &#8216;pain management&#8217; was included in the proposed list for the library of NICE Quality Standards that the National Quality Board will be considering shortly, following the completion of an engagement exercise hosted by NICE.

	<p pid="a.636W.5/1">&#8220;Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer&#8221;, published in January 2011, set out our commitment to expand radiotherapy capacity by investing over &#163;150 million of additional funding until 2014-15. This funding, as well as existing funding for radiotherapy, is included in overall primary care trust (PCT) baseline allocations which amount to around &#163;85 billion nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.5/2">The Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40541" name="Andrew Lansley">the right hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr Lansley)</phrase>, does not mandate how much PCTs are to spend on particular services within, these overall allocations. PCTs including those which commission services for Avon, Somerset and Wiltshire, have local discretion to decide how to use their overall allocation to commission services, including radiotherapy services, to meet the health care needs of their local populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.5/3">Work is under way nationally to develop radiotherapy tariffs and this will include consideration of a tariff for Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Treatment. The development and implementation of national tariffs for services such as radiotherapy is dependent on the existence and use of 'currencies' which describe the service being provided and which enable cost data to be collected, which is then used to underpin tariff prices. For some services with low activity volumes, setting a tariff on the basis of limited cost data may not be appropriate, in which case there would continue to be local agreement on price.</p>
	<p pid="a.636W.5/4">The &#8220;NHS Operating Framework 2011-12&#8221; states that the national health service is expected to implement the new Cancer Strategy and that commissioners should develop plans to ensure that local populations have appropriate access to radiotherapy treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.639W.0/2">Since publication of the Greek Action Plan on Managed Migration and Asylum Reform last year there have been some notable improvements to the overall asylum system. These include an increase in the recognition of refugee status from less than 1% to 12% and improvements in training for decision makers, qualifications for interpreters and developments to reception facilities for unaccompanied minors. The Greek Ministry of Citizen Protection has also appointed directors for the newly established Asylum Service and First Reception Service which are due to be up and running next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.639W.0/3">However, there is still much more progress needed and the Government remains concerned about the lack of improvements to the poor detention conditions, particularly at the Greek-Turkish border. We will continue to apply pressure on Greece to treat this area as a matter of urgency.</p>
	<p pid="a.639W.0/4">Successful delivery of the Greek Action Plan will ensure that Greece meets its international obligations towards asylum seekers. We will monitor the situation and progress made. When it is clear to us that Greece is meeting its obligations in practice, and that as a result the criticisms detailed in the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-21">21 January 2011</phrase> in the case of MSS <i>v.</i> Belgium and Greece have been addressed, we will seek to resume Dublin Regulation returns.</p>

Meeting the fourth carbon budget depends on progress on the EU 2020 target up to 2020, the 2050 roadmap beyond and the UK share of the EU ETS. Whether or not we manage to reduce emissions by the amount required to meet carbon budgets will depend on the level of the UK's share of the EU ETS cap. The UK is pushing for the EU to show more ambition by moving to a tighter 2020 emissions target, which in turn will drive a more stringent EU ETS cap.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.4/3">If by 2014 our UK commitments place us on a different emissions trajectory than the EU ETS trajectory agreed by the EU, we will, as appropriate, revise up our budget to align it with the actual EU trajectory.</p>

	<p pid="a.643W.9/2">As is already the case, applicants for licences have to demonstrate that they have the technical and economic means to conduct operations properly. In future onshore licensing rounds, applicants wishing to explore for shale gas will have to demonstrate that they have the appropriate competences and management systems, including systems to ensure protection of the environment.

	<p pid="a.647W.6/1">The optimal level of leverage will depend on the risk profile of the assets and exposures which vary from bank to bank and over time. Given a lack of consistent time series data and the presence of varying bank business models, it is not possible to determine with a high level of confidence an optimal leverage ratio for a wide range of banks and over an extended period of time. However there is evidence that banks can be excessively leveraged and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has published relevant analysis, indicating that banks which had particularly high levels of leverage prior to the financial crisis were more likely to experience stress during that period. Further details of the BCBS's analysis can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.647W.6/3">As part of the Basel III agreement, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision agreed to introduce a non-risked based leverage ratio to constrain the build-up of leverage in the banking sector and provide a backstop to risk weight based capital requirements. This will help reduce the leverage ratio for banks to a more sustainable level. In the EU, Basel III will be implemented through legislation on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms, which the Commission adopted proposals for on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-20">20 July 2011</phrase>.</p>

So the main commemorations will be on the centenary of the end of the First World War in 1918. However, given the importance of the centenary of world war one, a number of anniversaries of key events from 2014 to 2018, including the beginning of the war, will be marked in an appropriate way. The Prime Minister has asked my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40562" name="Andrew Murrison">the Member for South West Wiltshire (Dr Murrison)</phrase> to act as his special representative and coordinator for world war one commemorations. Dr Murrison will work with international partners to ensure that the UK plays a full and active role; and will coordinate the cross-Whitehall effort in respect of the commemorations.</p>

	<p pid="a.660W.5/1">Given the serious threat al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) poses to UK national security, Her Majesty&#8217;s Government have been working with the Yemeni Government for a number of years supporting them in disrupting AQAP. This support has included training, delivered both in Yemen and in UK, and the provision of a limited amount of non-lethal equipment. At the centre of our all training and support is a commitment to promoting human rights. The UK Government seek assurances that the forces we are involved with will not be deployed on operations outside of their mandate or in breach of human rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.660W.5/13">This training includes elements which enhance an individual&#8217;s understanding of the control and employment of security forces in accordance with the rule of law.</p>
	<p pid="a.660W.5/14">At the request of the Yemeni Government the UK provided training for the Yemeni Central Security Force Public Order Battalion in October 2010 and February 2011. The aim of this training was to reduce the use of lethal force in public order situations and address a source of grievance among Yemeni citizens by developing the capability of the Yemeni Central Security Forces to be able to deal with public order situations in an accountable and professional manner. The training, which was conducted in Yemen, included human rights and law of armed conflict training at the request of the Yemenis; escalation and de-escalation drills were included as were the principles of use of minimum force. As part of this training package a small amount of non-hazardous and non-lethal public order equipment, to the value of &#163;90,000, was gifted to Yemen from surplus UK stocks in order to cover Yemeni capability gaps and to ensure that UK techniques could be taught and applied correctly. This equipment was delivered to the Yemeni Central Security Force in February 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.660W.5/15">The UK has also worked with the Yemeni Counter Terrorism Unit, in concert with other donors, to increase Yemen's capability to tackle AQAP, including training and advice over the past five years and the provision of equipment and infrastructure in financial year 2010-11. The UK has also delivered training, advice and the provision of rigid inflatable boats to the Yemeni coastguard, based in both Sana'a and Aden, since 2005, as part of our wider counterterrorism and regional security efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.660W.5/16">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#8217;s counterterrorism programme is the principal funding stream for the Government&#8217;s counterterrorism work overseas, overseen by a cross-government programme board. A decision to fund a particular project is taken only after an assessment of possible impacts and human rights implications has been completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.660W.5/17">The political and security situation in Sana'a has deteriorated significantly this year; consequently this training was suspended in May 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.664W.2/1">We believe that engaging in negotiations for a protocol on cluster munitions in the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) is consistent with paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 21. These are negotiations within the framework of an International Humanitarian Law treaty. They are aiming to establish restrictions on a significant number of cluster munitions, which would have a notable humanitarian effect. A protocol could serve as a first step towards wider prohibitions for those states not in a position to accede to the Convention on Cluster Munitions in the near future. Irrespective of the outcome of negotiations at the CCW we will continue to encourage non-party states to accede to the Oslo Convention with the goal of universalising the Convention.</p>

	<p pid="a.664W.5/1">It is not Government practice to disclose whether they have sought legal advice or the content of any advice obtained. The UK played a full and active role in negotiations leading to the drafting of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. The UK signed the Optional Protocol in September 2000 and ratified on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-24">24 June 2003</phrase>. The Government's understanding of their obligations is clarified by the interpretive declaration they made upon signature and confirmed upon ratification. This made clear that the armed forces would continue to recruit from age 16 but included a clear commitment to take all feasible measures to ensure those who had not yet reached the age of 18 years old did not take a direct part in hostilities. The Government remains fully committed to meeting their obligations under the Protocol and welcomes the steps that have been taken to bestow special safeguards on young people under 18. We believe that our policies on under 18s are robust and compliant with national and international law. We will continue to keep them under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.665W.5/1">The UK has provided material and technical support to the Yemeni Government over the last five years as part of our counter terrorism assistance to reduce the risk from international terrorism to the UK and UK interests overseas. We have been working with the Yemeni Government to increase Yemen&#8217;s capability to tackle Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, including through the provision of training and advice, for example to the Yemeni Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU) and Yemeni Coastguard. Since the escalation in violence both projects have now been suspended. All our capacity building is delivered in accordance with UK values and human rights standards. Before providing any military support or training to Yemeni forces, the UK Government seek assurances that these forces will not be deployed on operations outside of their mandate or in breach of human rights. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#8217;s (FCO) Counter Terrorism Programme is the principal funding stream underpinning Her Majesty's Government&#8217;s Counter Terrorism projects overseas. The FCO&#8217;s total worldwide Counter Terrorism Programme budget: for financial year (FY) 2011-12&#8212; &#163;38 million, FY 2010-11&#8212;&#163;38 million, FY 2009-10&#8212; &#163;37 million, FY 2008-09&#8212;&#163;35 million, FY 2007-08&#8212; &#163;16.3 million. In each financial year a proportion of these annual allocations are committed to programmes in Yemen. The majority of our funding in Yemen is delivered through Ministry of Defence projects. Since the attempted aviation attack in Detroit in December 2009, we have also committed funds to assist the Yemeni authorities to improve security at the international airport in Sana'a. Funding has been allocated to provide x-ray machines and electronic trace detection equipment at a cost of &#163;427,000. We have also provided training for Yemeni airport personnel in Dubai and Amman.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.5/2">The FCO, together with the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence, contributes to and administers the conflict pool. In the period in question several projects were agreed which have benefited the Government of Yemen in terms of technical expertise. No money was committed directly to the Government of Yemen. Projects involved technical funding to support the work of the Yemeni authorities in addition to training and guidance. These are as follows: 2006-07 border security costing &#163;25,267; 2008-09 Ministry of the Interior CTU and coastguard development costing &#163;93,844; 2009-10 Yemeni Coastguard development costing &#163;50,563; 2010-11 officer training in the UK costing &#163;145,200 and public order training, scaled down to the gifting of non-lethal surplus equipment. In the current financial year funding has been allocated to provide further officer training, but none has yet been spent.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.5/3">A small bilateral programmes budget is administered by the embassy in Sana'a. While most of the work funded does not involve the Government of Yemen, one recent project was resourced to provide support to the Ministry of the Interior, specifically setting up the first Regional Maritime Security Conference.</p>

It is not just a problem of dangerous breeds of dogs, but one of irresponsible dog owners. Those owners need to be held to account and stopped from ruining people's lives. We have been engaged with key interested parties both inside and outside Government, including police and animal welfare organisations, concerning measures to promote more responsible dog ownership. It is essential to make sure that better public protection does not place unnecessary burdens on the vast majority of dog owners in this country who act responsibly and care for their pets.

	<p pid="a.669W.0/1">Between February and April 2011 payments of legal aid fees to advocates transferred from individual Crown court centres to the Legal Services Commission. An issue was identified in some cases where the computer system had not been updated correctly to show that the case had moved from the magistrates court to the Crown court. This meant some claims needed to be returned to Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service for resolution, leading to delays in making payments. Provisions were put in place to expedite claims in the case of genuine financial hardship as a result of the payment delays. The LSC resolved the system problem at the end of June and a recovery plan was immediately implemented to clear the backlog of cases that had built up as a result of this issue. I understand that payments are now being made in around eight and a half weeks, against a published target of eight weeks. If the volume of claims remains at current levels the LSC expect to process claims within the eight week target soon.</p>

	<p pid="a.670W.6/1">The Government have set out a core purpose for Sure Start Children's Centres, focused on outcomes for children and families, particularly the most vulnerable. It is clear that children's centres can best achieve this by providing access to a range of universal and targeted services, which includes high-quality child care and early education such as access to the three and four-year-old entitlement to 15 hours of free early education and the new entitlement for disadvantaged two-year-olds. The evidence is clear on the impact that high-quality early learning and child care has on children's outcomes, particularly for the most disadvantaged children.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.6/2">The Government do not want to prescribe the detail of how local authorities and professionals run local services. However, as set out in the Childcare Act 2006, all children's centres should provide access to child care, either by having it on site or by providing advice and assistance in accessing it elsewhere. Children's centres with early learning and child care on site must meet the requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), which set the standards for quality across all early years settings. The Government have recently consulted on their proposals for a clearer, simpler, more effective EYFS. A summary report on the consultation, and the Government's response, will be published later this year.</p>

The proposals set out a bursary rate of between &#163;4,000 and &#163;20,000 depending on the degree classification of the trainee and the subject specialism or phase of the postgraduate course. We expect to announce the final arrangements for 2012/13 shortly. The bursaries will continue to be adjusted regularly according to the size of the pool of potential teachers and the demand from schools for new teachers.</p>

	<p pid="a.673W.5/1">This Government have set out an education reform programme in order to drive up attainment for children, regardless of their background, and to keep pace with the highest-performing systems in the world. We have undertaken specific measures to improve social mobility as set out in the Government's &#8220;Opening Doors, Breaking Barriers: A Strategy for Social Mobility&#8221;. These measures aim to ensure life chances are more equal at critical points such as the early years of development; school readiness at age five; GCSE attainment and the choice of options at 16.</p>
	<p pid="a.673W.5/2">Evidence shows that investment in the early years of a child's life makes a difference to their future attainment. We have extended the free entitlement to early education to 15 hours per week for all three and four-year-olds, and we have committed to extend free early education to all disadvantaged two-year-olds by 2013. Funding for places for disadvantaged two-year-olds will rise from &#163;64 million in the current financial year to &#163;380 million by the end of the spending review period and will mean that around 140,000 two-year-olds will in the future benefit from free places.</p>
	<p pid="a.673W.5/3">We have introduced the pupil premium which will provide additional resources to help raise the attainment of pupils from low income families. Total funding for the pupil premium is &#163;625 million in 2011-12, &#163;1.25 billion in 2012-13 and will rise to &#163;2.5 billion a year by 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="a.673W.5/4">The pupil premium sits alongside a range of reforms that will help to ensure that more pupils achieve higher standards. These include allowing schools greater freedoms and flexibility to use their budgets as they think best, introducing a more rigorous emphasis on phonics in the early years of primary education and reviewing the national curriculum and assessment arrangements. We have also introduced a new &#163;50 million pupil premium summer school programme which will provide two weeks of teaching and activities to help the most disadvantaged pupils make the transition from primary to secondary school.</p>

	<p pid="a.679W.9/1">Transparency is a new way of operating in Government. Central and local government and wider public services have been made more accountable to the public, aided, by the release of over 7,500 datasets (including over 800 geographical linked datasets) via data.gov.uk. These datasets have enabled the public to view and track instances of crime in their area with police.uk having received hundreds of millions of hits since its launch; scrutinise Ministers' expenses, and; interrogate central and local government contracts. Originally targeted at technical experts and software developers, we are reviewing and repackaging data.gov.uk so that it can serve the general public more directly, as well as meet the needs of developers.</p>

This included an assessment of the positive effects of Open Data, demonstrating that it can have a transformative effect on public services; improving outcomes and productivity through informed comparison; driving dynamic economic growth; enabling accountability, and transforming social relationships through empowering individuals and communities. The consultation and the forthcoming White Paper represent the next phase of the Transparency agenda, moving away from a simple accountability model, towards embedding openness and transparency as core operating principles of public services. The White Paper will contain a full impact assessment of policy proposals and the benefits of Open Data.</p>
	<p pid="a.679W.9/3">The Transparency Team in the Cabinet Office is currently leading on an Open Data work stream within the second phase of the Government's growth review, to be released alongside the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#8217;s autumn statement on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-29">29 November</phrase>.

	<p pid="a.683W.2/1">While it is now clear that the full Doha Development Round will not be concluded in 2011, the Government are continuing to press for the best possible outcome at the 8<sup>(th)</sup> World Trade Organisation (WTO) Ministerial Conference in December this year. We are working closely with the European Commission, EU member states and other WTO members to ensure that there is a clear way forward for the Doha Round in 2012 which delivers trade liberalisation, strengthens the multilateral system and advances the interests of poor countries.</p>
