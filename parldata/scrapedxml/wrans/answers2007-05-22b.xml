	<p pid="b.1191W.8/1">In support of the 2005 comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army, the Ministry of Defence has provided training to the Joint Integrated Units (JIU), consisting of the Government of Sudan Armed Forces and the Sudan People's Liberation Army. The JIUs are critical to strengthening the fragile peace that exists between the CPA's parties. Between financial years 2004-05 and 2006-07, 11 mid and senior ranking members of the JIU have attended UK military establishments to undertake courses on managing defence in a democracy and collective training. This can be broken down by financial year as follows: two in financial year 2004-05; nil in financial year 2005-06 and nine in financial year 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="b.1209W.3/1">DEFRA has worked closely with the Department for Education and Skills, the Department of Health, and other stakeholders to support the Year of Food and Farming (YFF). We have provided financial support to develop the programme, including &pound;130,000 of funding last financial year to support the start-up phase. In addition, DEFRA has lent a member of staff to the Royal Agricultural Society of England (RASE) to work on the initiative. However, the YFF is an industry-led campaign, and the bulk of funding and sponsorship is coming from industry partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209W.3/2">DEFRA is committed to developing the understanding young people have of where and how their food is produced. To that end, we provide approximately &pound;1 million a year in payments to farmers who provide educational visits to their farms as part of their agri-environment scheme agreements. In addition, in this financial year, DEFRA will provide &pound;146,000 for the Countryside Educational Visits Accreditation Scheme (CEVAS), which provides training to farmers who provide educational access visits. This amounts to 50 per cent. of the scheme's funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.1219W.3/22">In addition there are a small number of staff who are employed locally and are not paid through the FCO payroll. These numbers are not held centrally and have not been included.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.3/23">The overall increase in staffing at our posts overseas is due to a rise in the number of staff delivering consular and visa services to the public. These staff positions are funded out of revenue generated by the sale of passports and visas. Their number is therefore dependent on demand. This increase masks a significant reduction over the same period in the number of staff, funded from central budgets, performing other diplomatic functions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1220W.0/2">In the same manner as most other international resettlement countries the UK does not operate a bespoke resettlement programme through which an individual can apply directly to a UK overseas post. Therefore the statistics requested are not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220W.0/3">In order to qualify for resettlement the established recognised international process is that an individual seeking protection must first register with the UNHCR who will initially decide whether it is appropriate to afford Mandate Refugee status. If they are given Mandate Refugee status the UNHCR will, in due course, decide which durable solution is appropriate. A very small minority of refugees only are referred by the UNHCR for resettlement and it is their decision as to which of the most vulnerable cases should take priority. Under these referral arrangements the UK currently accepts around 500 people for resettlement per year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1220W.3/3">Like all other refugees, Iraqi refugees are entitled to the protection of the Convention.

	<p pid="b.1220W.3/4">Under the Convention, refugees are people who are outside the country of their nationality because of a well founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion and who, because of this fear, are unwilling or unable to avail themselves of the protection of their national authorities. Certain individuals can be excluded from protection where they commit certain serious acts or crimes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1223W.0/1">We remain seriously concerned about human rights in Uzbekistan and closely monitor the situation there, with our EU partners. On individual cases, we welcome the fact that journalist and human rights defender, Umida Niyazova, has been released, but urge the Uzbek Government to lift the conditions attached to her suspended sentence. We also welcome the fact that EU experts saw Saidajon Zainabiddinov in April, but we urge the Uzbek authorities to allow families access to imprisoned relatives eg the human rights defender, Mutabar Tojibayeva, and party leader, Sanjar Umarov. We hope that the Uzbek authorities will give a sympathetic hearing to Gulbahor Turayeva's appeal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223W.0/2">On Uzbekistan's co-operation with international organisations, we hope that the International Committee of the Red Cross will soon be able to resume visiting prisons. We regret that the Goethe Institute is now facing difficulties in Tashkent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223W.0/3">We welcome the start of the EU-Uzbekistan Human Rights Dialogue. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-14">14 May</phrase>, the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council decided to keep measures against Uzbekistan under review on the basis of the criteria set out in previous Council conclusions, taking into account the actions of the Uzbek Government in the area of human rights, including the results of the human rights dialogue. The Council urged Uzbekistan to implement fully its international obligations relating to human rights, rule of law and fundamental freedoms.</p>

	<p pid="b.1225W.11/1">The Government have strict fiscal rules that differentiate between current expenditure, which over the economic cycle must be met from current income, and capital expenditure, which may be borrowed within the strict limits set for total public sector debt. Departmental budgets reflect these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1225W.11/2">Transfers from the capital budget to the resource budget were made in 2004-05 and 2005-06 for two reasons. Firstly, capital grants allocated to fund social care programmes in the local authority sector were funded from the capital budget, yet accounted as revenue expenditure. These capital-to-revenue transfers were possible as the expenditure gave rise to fixed assets. Secondly, transfers took place when funding the Connecting for Health project, as the clarification of technical details led to an increased understanding of the appropriate split of expenditure on the project.</p>

	<p pid="b.1229W.5/90">The NHS Cancer Plan, published in 2000, stated that we would extend invitations for breast screening to women aged 65 to 70 and introduce two-view mammography at all screening rounds. Thanks to the efforts of the staff in the screening programme, these targets have now been achieved in all local breast screening units. The expansion is already showing an effect, with nearly 12,000 cancers diagnosed by the programme in 2004-05, an increase of 40 per cent. on 2001 when the expansion began.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/91">However, the changes together represent a 40 per cent. increase in the workload of the programme. We are aware that this has had an impact on some services maintaining the three-year interval for screening and we are taking steps to bring all screening intervals back to three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229W.5/92">We take the issue of the 36-month standard between screens very seriously. That is why Professor Mike Richards, the National Cancer Director, wrote to the chief executives of all 10 strategic health authorities in England on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-09">9 February 2007</phrase> highlighting the importance of maintaining the 36-month interval.</p>

	<p pid="b.1237W.2/1">Methylphenidate is a stimulant drug that is authorised in children over six years of age as part of a comprehensive treatment programme for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Treatment should be under the supervision of a specialist in childhood behavioural disorders. Its safety is closely monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in conjunction with other European regulatory authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237W.2/2">Reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are collected by the MHRA and Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) through the spontaneous reporting scheme, the Yellow Card Scheme.

	<p pid="b.1237W.2/3">Between January 1997 and December 2006 a total of 488 reports of suspected ADRs have been received in association with methylphenidate treatment. The reactions that were most commonly reported were recognised side effects that are listed in the product information for prescribers and patients or reactions that may be part of the underlying condition. The following table shows the number of reports received in association with methylphenidate each year between 1997 and 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.1239W.2/1">Initiatives such as the single assessment process (SAP) for older people, and the developing common assessment framework for adults, increasingly require health and social care services to share personal information about individuals receiving joined-up care, both as part of the commissioning process and to ensure that needs are addressed and that effort is not duplicated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1239W.2/2">A patient's records may be disclosed to social workers working as part of a multidisciplinary care team where they need to have them to provide effective joined-up care, providing the patient has been informed that this may occur and has given express consent, or has not objected or expressed concern. Registered social workers are subject to a code of practice that requires them to respect a person's confidential information. Breaching the code can lead to their removal from the Social Care Register.</p>
	<p pid="b.1239W.2/3">The practice expected of national health service organisations in facilitating these arrangements is set out in the document &quot;Confidentiality: NHS Code of Practice&quot; published in November 2003. The code recognises that social workers are frequently involved in providing care for national health service patients and that sharing health information with them should be an essential part of providing joined-up services for patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.1239W.2/4">Arrangements for sharing personal information with social care staff have included the development of local information sharing protocols. These are agreements between an individual NHS body and a council with social services responsibilities on how an individual's data may be shared between them. These agreements are based on well known data protection principles and make clear under what conditions or circumstances a person's data may be shared. All care employers are subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="b.1239W.2/5">Where the NHS care records service is supporting SAP as an initial step in establishing joint services that contribute to the patient record, information sharing will be possible on the basis of implied consent subject to the requirements outlined above. Where SAP is supported by other systems, whether paper or electronic, explicit consent will normally be required and it will additionally be necessary to ensure that there are appropriate safeguards in place to protect patient confidentiality.</p>
	<p pid="b.1239W.2/6">These arrangements are currently being supported by some 46 electronic SAP systems, and over 50 community patient record systems that have been delivered through the national programme for information technology, accessible by an estimated 114,000 authorised NHS users. These figures are continuing to grow rapidly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1243W.5/1">Since 2004 the Home Office has provided more than &pound;1 million of funding to the Action Against Business Crime Group (AABC) to set up 120 new business crime reduction partnerships in towns and cities across England and Wales. It has also, in partnership with stakeholders, produced a booklet to enable businesses to undertake a crime prevention survey of their premises. More than 125,000 copies of this booklet have so far been printed and distributed. A set of top tips postcards have also been produced giving more general advice to retailers and others on how to reduce the risk of being a victim of crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.1243W.5/2">A new strand of the forthcoming Crime Reduction Strategy will include a renewed focus on working with business to see what more can be done to tackle crime problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1243W.5/3">Measures will be taken to raise the profile of business crime among Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) by highlighting the need to tackle this in the Public Service Agreement Delivery Plan. The Home Office will also seek to raise the profile of crime against businesses, to ensure that CDRPs consult and engage with the business community as part of their wider community consultation to identify local priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1243W.5/4">Neighbourhood policing has been introduced across England and Wales to deal with low-level crime and antisocial behaviour and in some communities this will include, for example, Police Community Support Officers working in partnership with local businesses.</p>

	<p pid="b.1253W.3/1">The Government have developed a range of offender programmes with a number of partners across the prison estate, including HMP Moorland, which are successfully tackling the root causes of re-offending and working to reduce social exclusion. Recently published figures show that we have reduced proven adult re-offending by 6.9 per cent. comparing 2004 to 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.1253W.3/2">&quot;Reducing Re-offending Through Skills and Employment: Next Steps&quot; (December 2006) set out our plans to put in place an increased focus on training offenders and helping them get jobs. The initiative at HMP Moorland is part of that strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1253W.3/3">The West Coast rail scheme is a high quality practical based programme, paying a decent wage and providing close to release prisoners at Moorland, through a 12 week training programme including full safety training, with the rail industry specific NVQ level 2 qualification enabling them to work in the rail industry on release. Job vacancies in this sector have given rise to sustainable employment opportunities for prisoners, thereby reducing the likelihood of re-offending.</p>

The Act also placed a range of other local agencies, such as health, educational, social and housing services, under a duty to co-operate with the Responsible Authority.

	<p pid="b.1254W.6/1">All convicted child sex offenders are liable to management under the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA). Most will be subject to notification requirements (sex offender registration) on release from prison, and those who were sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment or more will generally be subject to licence conditions, breach of which can lead to recall to prison. In addition, some may be subject to Sexual Offence Prevention Orders (SOPOs), which can be imposed where a court deems that the offender poses a risk of serious sexual harm. As with licence conditions, SOPOs can impose restrictions on behaviour, such as staying away from the victim or from schools. Breach of a SOPO is a criminal offence and would make the offender liable to a maximum of five years' imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1254W.6/2">The twin aims of the MAPPA are to protect the public and to prevent re-victimisation. While offenders will generally be released to their home area, where the offence may have been committed, consideration will be given to an exclusion zone, in the light of specific risks to the victim and also to the impact the return might have locally.</p>

	<p pid="b.1260W.2/1">Responsibility for placing young people under 18 within the secure estate lies principally with the Youth Justice Board. Children under 15 may be placed in a secure children's home or a secure training centre. Young people under 18 may also be accommodated in those establishments, but most are placed in a young offender institution. In deciding which sort of placement is appropriate, the board has regard to the young person's age and sex and to his or her individual needs. Having taken account of those factors, the board's policy is to place the young person as close to home as possible. But the chief consideration is that the establishment should be of a type that is able to meet the young person's particular needs.</p>

The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations establish basic requirements so that people can no longer be denied jobs because of prejudice; so that harassment can be tackled promptly and effectively; and so that people have an equal chance of training and promotion whatever their age. Furthermore, we recognise that many older workers would remain in work past their normal retirement age if given that opportunity. For the first time employees have a statutory right to request this opportunity under new procedures in the legislation. We believe that this will precipitate a culture change in which retirement decisions are discussed in the light of the needs of the individual and of the business.</p>

	<p pid="b.1269W.0/1">Following the public inquiry into the A303 Stonehenge Improvement scheme, the Department has led an inter-departmental review of the scheme and alternative options. The review was necessary because of a significant increase in the cost of the proposed tunnel past Stonehenge. Detailed work on the assessment of options has been carried out by the Highways Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1269W.0/2">As well as the published scheme heard at the public inquiry (with its proposals for a 2.1 km long twin-bored tunnel), the options chosen for detailed review included:</p>
	<p pid="b.1269W.0/3" class="indent">a (cheaper) cut-and-cover tunnelled scheme;</p>
	<p pid="b.1269W.0/4" class="indent">surface routes for upgrading the A303 passing to the north and south of Stonehenge; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1269W.0/5" class="indent">partial solutions, comprising various combinations of closing the local A344 road (which runs immediately adjacent to Stonehenge), improving the junctions on the A303 either side of Stonehenge at Amesbury and Longbarrow (at the boundaries of the World Heritage Site) and providing a bypass for the local village of Winterbourne Stoke (to the west of Stonehenge).</p>
	<p pid="b.1269W.0/6">The Review Group submitted its report to Ministers last summer. However, in order to understand more fully the effects of the partial solutions on the operation of the A303 and the local road network, it was clear that further detailed analysis based on up-to-date traffic information was needed. Fresh traffic surveys were carried out by the Highways Agency last autumn to provide the basis for further analytical work which is currently being undertaken. The results from this work will be considered alongside the findings of the Review Group to inform our decision on the way forward for this scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1273W.5/2">Bushmeat is covered by HMRC's powers to deal with animal products that are imported outside the veterinary checks regime under the products of animal origin (&quot;POAO&quot;) regulations. These powers are limited to imports into Great Britain; responsibility in Northern Ireland rests with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/3">Bushmeat of animals listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (&quot;CITES&quot;) may also breach the restrictions on import created by Council Regulation 338/97 and Commission Regulation 865/2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/4">HMRC's approach is to deter and detect illegal imports of products of animal origin from entering Great Britain, continuing to target traffic from high risk countries based on risk assessment and intelligence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/5">In order to discharge this role HMRC have:</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/6" class="indent">deployed extra front line detection staff supported by detector dogs. All HMRC's detection staff are deployed flexibly according to risk and include POAO among their multi-functional responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/7" class="indent">undertaken a range of publicity and awareness raising initiatives to inform travellers and the UK public of the regulations. These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/8" class="indent">distribution of leaflets at points of entry, including leaflets produced in 10 languages;</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/9" class="indent">high visibility posters displayed at major ports and airports;</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/10" class="indent">advertising on ticket wallets issued by travel agents;</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/11" class="indent">a press and radio publicity campaign in Nigeria;</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/12" class="indent">videos to be shown on selected inbound international flights; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/13" class="indent">information in the ABTA members' handbook.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/14" class="indent">worked in partnership with DEFRA in publicising the rules relating to POAO, for example a 60-second television filler advert; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/15" class="indent">reported a number of cases for prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/16">HMRC records POAO seizures as &quot;bushmeat&quot; where this was how the owners described the meat to customs officials. In order to test how much seized meat might have come from CITES-listed endangered species, HMRC and DEFRA jointly sponsored a study by Wildlife DNA Services Ltd to identify species composition.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/17">The summary report is available at the following web address:</p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/18" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/resprog/findings/bushmeat-summary.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/resprog/findings/bushmeat-summary.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1273W.5/19">Further information on the Government's work regarding illegal imports of products of animal origin is contained in DEFRA's annual reports. The latest report is available at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/illegali/pdf/review0405-0306.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/illegali/pdf/review0405-0306.pdf</a> and is also in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.1275W.2/2">Following the Economic Secretary to the Treasury's statement about counter terrorism and the licensing system, in which he announced that benefit paid to members of the households of listed persons fall within the prohibitions on making funds available to listed persons, four spouses of persons listed by the UN under the Al-Qaida and Taliban financial sanctions regime had their benefit suspended in mid July 2006.

	<p pid="b.1275W.2/4">A significantly greater number of individuals than this have been listed or designated under the Terrorism Order but no current action is required because they are not in receipt of benefit. This is commonly because the individual is being held on remand in prison.</p>

	<p pid="b.1277W.4/1">The Department recognises that chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis is a real and potentially debilitating condition that can affect individuals' capability for work and their chances of finding and retaining employment. However, our work to engage and support employers and tackle discrimination is not focused on specific conditions but looks at health conditions and disabilities in the round.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277W.4/2">DWP has, in recent years, run a number of campaigns aimed at raising the general awareness of disability issues among employers and is currently developing an employer-led campaign to better engage employers with the recruitment and retention of disabled people. The campaign will address issues at both corporate and local delivery levels. It will also seek to influence the attitudes and behaviour of expert advisers and job market intermediaries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277W.4/3">Meanwhile, changing employer perceptions on health problems has been identified as a key priority for the cross-government Health, Work and Well-being Strategy. The strategy's National Stakeholder Council, which comprises senior members of key stakeholder groups such as the Confederation of British Industry, Federation of Small Businesses, Trades Union Congress and Association of British Insurers, has decided that one of its four areas of focus will be on &quot;engaging employers as leading advocates of change&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.1282W.0/2">Since 1997, the Government have introduced or strengthened a number of safeguards to protect and regulate defined benefit occupational pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282W.0/3" class="indent">In August 1998 the Financial Services Regulator announced a further stage of the review covering those not in the priority categories to identify cases where people were badly advised to opt out of, not join, and/or transfer funds from an occupational pension scheme in favour of a personal pension.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282W.0/4" class="indent">From <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-30">30 December 2005</phrase> new scheme funding requirements require trustees to develop prudent scheme funding strategies, on a scheme specific basis, for meeting their scheme's pension commitments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282W.0/5" class="indent">A series of other Regulations between 2002 and 2005, strengthened the employer debt for schemes in wind-up, resulting in a 'full buy-out' debt for schemes sponsored by solvent and insolvent employers, or where an employer withdraws from a multi-employer scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1282W.0/7" class="indent">The Pensions Regulator, which replaced Opra from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase> this has a broad range of powers to help fulfil its statutory objectives. These include protecting the benefits of occupational pension scheme members. The Regulators act quickly to anticipate and tackle any risks to the benefits of those members.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282W.0/8" class="indent">The Pension Protection Fund, which provides protection to members of eligible defined benefit occupational pension schemes where the employer becomes insolvent (after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>) and leaves the scheme under-funded. The Pension Protection Fund went live on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282W.0/9" class="indent">The Financial Assistance Scheme, which provides support to members of defined benefit occupational pension schemes which started to wind up, under funded (between <phrase class="date" code="1997-01-01">1 January 1997</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April 2005</phrase>).

	<p pid="b.1282W.3/2">The regulator has already provided trustees and their advisers with extensive guidance on a range of governance issues such as internal controls and risk management through codes of practice and other guidance. The regulator has also established a free e-learning programme for trustees, the 'Trustee toolkit', providing easily accessible information which has been well received.</p>

Uniform telephony data on numbers of calls, average length of calls and calls terminated after the automated answering service will not be available until this modernisation programme is complete. When this process is complete the new telephony system will provide more comprehensive management information and this will enable us to more effectively manage the telephone service to our customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284W.0/5" class="indent">We do not have data on the length of calls to telephony teams. If the benefit enquiry becomes complicated then the telephony team would make arrangements for a benefit specialist to call the customer back. The cost (set by BT) which begins once the customer has pressed the number on the automated response is between 1p and 3p per minute (from a landline) depending on the time of day. Call charges from mobile telephones vary depending on the service provider.</p>
