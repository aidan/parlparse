	<p pid="a.252W.2/1">At this time no estimate has been made within the Department of adding an additional brigade to the Army. To provide an indicative costing would be unrealistic since it would depend on what role any such brigade was designed for. There are significant differences in the composition of a Heavy Brigade as opposed to a Light Brigade or an Airborne Brigade in terms of manpower, training, equipment and accommodation. For this reason it is not possible to give an indicative figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.2/2">The Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) will bring defence policy, plans, commitments and resources into balance, and produce over time a transformative change to British defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.2/3">At the heart of Defence contribution to the SDSR will be a thorough examination of our force structure, looking at the overall shape, size and role of armed forces personnel and MOD civil servants, including the reserve forces. Depending on the outcome of the SDSR, some capabilities may be reduced in order to enhance others and provide the most effective suite of measures for defending the UK's interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.252W.2/4">This will not be a salami-slicing review but one which provides coherent long-term policy direction and takes the tough choices required to produce the armed forces and wider defence capabilities the country will need in the decades ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.262W.8/1">People's expectations of their library services have changed and local authorities need to be responsive to the needs and wants of their customers. Responsibility and accountability for day to day management of individual library services, including opening hours and providing local authority information, is devolved to local authorities and their communities. However, DCMS is committed to helping local government find solutions to the problems it faces. A new support programme led by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council and Local Government Association Group will support councils, especially those who want to work in partnership with each other, to drive efficiencies and deliver an effective service. The learning and experience from that programme will be shared widely across the sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.280W.6/2">An effective TB testing audit process has already been drawn up and used to audit Animal Health staff engaged in TB testing. Consideration is currently being given as to how best to extend the audit process to all TB testers on an ongoing basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.6/3">The tuberculin skin test has a specificity of 99.9%, which means that when applied to cattle without TB in Great Britain, there is a one in 1,000 chance that a non-infected animal will be wrongly classified as a reactor. The probability of false positives is therefore 0.1%.</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.6/4">A failure to detect lesions of TB through post-mortem inspections or to culture M.bovis (the causative organism of the disease) in the laboratory does not imply that a test reactor was not infected with bovine TB. In the early stages of the disease it is not always possible to observe lesions during post-mortem examination and, due to the fastidious nature of this organism it is very difficult to isolate it from tissue samples without lesions. The primary purpose of post mortem inspections and culture is not to establish the presence or absence of disease, but rather to identify the severity and strain of infection. It is therefore not possible to say what percentage of cattle slaughtered following positive bovine tuberculosis tests are found to be free of tuberculosis when tested after slaughter.</p>
	<p pid="a.280W.6/5">During the last 12 months 42,262 cattle herds that were not under movement restrictions were tested for bovine Tuberculosis in England. Of these herds 7.9% had at least one animal test positive.</p>

These sums mostly relate to payments made by DARD and funded by the Commission during EU financial years 2005-07 (i.e. <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-16">16 October 2004</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-15">15 October 2007</phrase>) that concerned the Extensification Premium Scheme (Scheme Year 2004) and the Single Payment Scheme (Scheme Years 2005 and 2006). The UK formally recorded its continued concerns with the Commission that these financial corrections are wholly disproportionate to any actual risk to the Fund and that the Northern Ireland Authorities are therefore actively considering referring the case to the European Court of Justice. Discussions with the Commission on proposed financial corrections covering later financial years remain ongoing.</p>

	<p pid="a.285W.9/1">The information required to answer this question is not collected routinely. The latest Home Office estimates of the costs of crime were published in Home Office Online Report 30/05. They relate to crimes committed against individuals and households in the year 2003-04, and are broken down into a range of cost categories, some of which cover public sector expenditure or the use of public sector resources. Table 4.1 of Home Office Online Report 30/05 indicates that crime committed against individuals and households in 2003-04 was estimated to have resulted in criminal justice system costs of &#163;7,096 million and health service costs of &#163;2,356 million. It was also estimated to have cost &#163;4,253 million in lost output due to time off work, and some of this is likely to have been borne by the public sector. Financial transfers are not included in these estimates, so they do not include compensation paid to victims of crime through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. Costs to the public purse due to crime committed against businesses and the public sector itself, as well as a result of anti-social behaviour, are also not included in these estimates.</p>

	<p pid="a.288W.2/1">The UK passport is one of the most secure documents of its kind, fully meeting rigorous international standards. This security is delivered through a combination of physical and electronic security features. Since 2006 individuals have been biometrically linked to their passports through their photograph contained in an electronic chip embedded in the document. The chip cannot be altered without Border Control officers becoming aware that the passport has been tampered with. UK passports also have a range of physical security measures designed to prevent forgery and tampering. A new design of UK passport will be issued from <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-05">5 October 2010</phrase>. It will contain new security printing features to combat fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.288W.2/2">The Identity and Passport Service also has a range of measures in place to detect and deter passport fraud which led to the IPS preventing around 17,000 fraudulent applications in the last two years. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.288W.2/3" class="indent">checking biographical information to ensure that the identity claimed on the application form is real, living, and can be linked to the customer through checks against a range of public and private sector databases;</p>
	<p pid="a.288W.2/4" class="indent">the development of facial recognition systems to check applicant images against a database of images of suspected fraudsters;</p>
	<p pid="a.288W.2/5" class="indent">checking applicants against increasingly sophisticated internal watch files including databases of infant deaths and passports reported lost or stolen;</p>
	<p pid="a.288W.2/6" class="indent">strengthening its business processes for identity authentication, and training and support for passport examiners and specialist fraud units; and</p>
	<p pid="a.288W.2/7" class="indent">interviews for all first-time adult customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.288W.2/8">These measures are continuously assessed and attempted frauds and forgeries analysed to ensure security is maintained and to identify opportunities for further strengthening of the passport and passport issuing processes.</p>

	<p pid="a.292W.2/12">The Government are concerned about the UK's increasing contributions to the EU budget. The EU budget for the period 2007-13 was agreed by the previous Government in 2005, meaning the UK's contributions cannot easily be reduced. But at a time of painful fiscal consolidation across many EU member states, it is only fair that the EU budget play its part. As the Chancellor told a recent meeting of EU Finance Ministers, a freeze in EU spending should be considered. And looking ahead to the negotiation of the EU budget for the period 2014-20, the Government will strongly defend the UK's national interests, and ensure the EU budget is focused on those areas where the EU adds value.</p>

	<p pid="a.295W.8/2">Before the start of the new tax year, HMRC worked to identify and review cases where incorrect coding notices could have been issued. They corrected where necessary the underlying records through a mix of automated repairs and clerical reviews. They ensured that no codes were issued to employers or pension providers until they had conducted these reviews in order to prevent incorrect codes leading to incorrect tax deductions.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.8/3">HMRC completed reviewing the bulk of the cases in time for the start of 2010-11. Where no new code was issued employers continued to operate the code that applied in the old year which is a normal part of the PAYE process. HMRC continues to correct codes, where necessary, as part of its day to day work.</p>
	<p pid="a.295W.8/4">HMRC has provided advice on its website about these issues and continues to be in regular contact with employers, pension providers and their representative bodies to ensure they are kept properly informed.</p>

	<p pid="a.310W.2/1">Information on the number of prisoners transferred to undertake rehabilitation as part of their parole conditions is not centrally recorded, and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost by checking the files of all prisoners at each establishment who may have been transferred.</p>
	<p pid="a.310W.2/2">Prisoners often present a broad range of risks and needs which potentially need to be addressed to reduce their risk of re-offending on release. Every prison provides a variety of services, but significant resources would be required if each prison were capable of holding every category of prisoner and to deliver all the required services to prevent prisoners being transferred. Prisoners are transferred for a variety of reasons including, for example, to access particular activities or specialised services, promote family ties, to provide an opportunity to demonstrate reduced risk in a lower category establishment, or to maintain good order and control. It is however recognised that transfers should be kept to a minimum where practicable to support continuity of care. The National Offender Management Service continues to routinely review the provision of services across the estate in order to provide the most effective use of resources.</p>

	<p pid="a.311W.0/1">Our thoughts remain with the families of the victims of Lockerbie. My right hon. Friend, the Foreign Secretary, made clear his view at the time, that Mr Al-Megrahi's compassionate release by Scottish Ministers was a mistake. However, the question of whether it was appropriate, including any public inquiry, is for the Scottish authorities. I note the Scottish Parliament's Justice Committee published a report on <phrase class="date" code="2010-02-05">5 February 2010</phrase> examining the process followed by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill MSP, in making the decision that led to Mr Al-Megrahi's release.</p>

We have a regular dialogue with the Afghan Government on human rights, including on the need to ensure the security of all Afghans, regardless of religion. In addition, we will raise particular cases of concern with the Afghan Government. We have not received any confirmed reports of Afghan Christian converts being prosecuted or put on trial.</p>

We continue to raise these concerns both bilaterally with the Government of Sri Lanka and through the EU. We repeatedly call upon the Government of Sri Lanka to investigate reports of human rights abuses wherever they occur.</p>

	<p pid="a.326W.2/2">The proposed changes to local housing allowance rates from next year, including the introduction of upper cap limits in April 2011, would not affect housing benefit subsidy levels for private sector leased temporary accommodation before April 2012. This is because, under existing legislation, housing benefit subsidy levels for this type of temporary accommodation are based on a formula that uses local housing allowance rates for the January preceding each relevant financial year. Therefore subsidy levels until April 2012 would be based on local housing allowance rates before the proposed changes take effect.</p>

	<p pid="a.328W.7/1">In 2008, there were estimated to be 1,600 lone parents in West Lancashire. This figure has been rounded to the nearest 100. The estimate is based on the Household Annual Population survey (HAPS). The latest available wave for the HAPS is 2008. It is important to note that as with any sample survey, estimates from the HAPS are subject to a margin of uncertainty as different samples give different results. At the constituency level the group in question is very specific and the estimate is based on very small sample sizes. Therefore, the margin of uncertainty is very large for this estimate and the figure is deemed unreliable and would not be used by the Department for Work and Pensions for practical purposes.</p>

	<p pid="a.334W.5/1">The Pensions Act 2008 will be implemented from October 2012, with employers being brought under the duties gradually, over a four year period. Employers are due to be brought within the scope of the employer duties in a series of monthly stages, starting with the largest firms, with the majority of the smallest companies being brought in from August 2014.</p>
	<p pid="a.334W.5/2">Staging is essential to ensure the reforms are implemented safely and fairly. Following extensive work with our delivery partners, we have determined that staging in multiple tranches over four years strikes the right balance between managing operational risks and getting people into saving quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.334W.5/3">We consulted widely on our implementation approach and have discussed whether to avoid staging during certain times of year, to reduce burdens on businesses. Based on advice from stakeholders, we have ensured that employers will not be staged in during December.</p>
	<p pid="a.334W.5/4">In addition, to provide maximum flexibility, employers scheduled for the month of August will be free to bring their date forward to an alternative month, provided this is not before October 2012.</p>

As an island nation we have outstanding wind resources and wind energy is an indigenous source of energy which is needed to meet our renewable energy and climate change goals.

	<p pid="a.340W.9/2">A study was commissioned in 2007 into a noise phenomenon known as aerodynamic modulation (AM), which it is was thought could be a cause of noise disturbance for nearby residents. The study found that the incidence of AM resulting from wind farms in the UK is low. Out of the 133 wind farms in operation at the time, there were four cases where AM appeared to be a factor.

Equally significant is information from the 2009 health profile for the West Midlands, which covered a wide range of indices including life expectancy, infant deaths, violent crime and drug misuse. The profile shows that, of all the indices, only those for tooth decay and road injuries and deaths in the West Midlands were below the national average.

	<p pid="a.349W.2/1">From July 2007 the implementation of smokefree legislation, there has been consistently high rates of compliance and public support. Opinion surveys suggest that over eight in 10 people are in support of the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.349W.2/2">According to the Office for National Statistics publication 'Smoking-related Behaviours and Attitudes' in 2008-09, 69% of people said that smoking was not allowed at all in their home, since 2006 when 61% of people said this. A copy of this publication has already been placed in the Library. Research evidence from England and internationally also demonstrates that smokefree legislation is effective in reducing exposure to second hand smoke (SHS) in adults and in children, and that there is no significant evidence that introducing smokefree legislation for public places displaces smoking into the home.</p>
	<p pid="a.349W.2/3">Research evidence has shown that bar workers' exposure to SHS has reduced substantially and that the health of these workers has improved. (Semple, S. et al. (2010).

	<p pid="a.353W.5/3" class="indent">As the Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, I have been asked to respond to your written Parliamentary Question on the inquiry report we published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-10">10 June 2010</phrase>, in which we did not disclose the name of the charity involved or its chief executive, trustees or the complainants.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.5/4" class="indent">As you may know, the Charity Commission has powers to open a statutory inquiry under Section 8 of the Charities Act 1993. We only use these powers in the most serious of cases, instead dealing with most complaints and concerns through working with charity trustees to rectify problems and put charities back on the right track. For reasons of transparency and accountability, and in order to disseminate &quot;lessons learnt&quot; to the wider sector, it is our usual and established policy to publish a report at the conclusion of a statutory inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.5/5" class="indent">In the case in question, the legal advice was clear that, as a public body, the Commission's obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998 and the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998 prevent us from being able to disclose the identity of the charity or those connected to it. Regretfully, I cannot, therefore, answer your question directly. The decision not to name the charity is not in any way to absolve the trustees of any responsibility and, as you would expect, we continue to monitor the situation carefully. Although this is not the first time we have decided not to identify a charity we have investigated, I should emphasise just how exceptional it is for us to take this step.</p>
	<p pid="a.353W.5/6" class="indent">I hope this helps to explain our position. If you would like to discuss this further our Director of Legal Services and Compliance, Kenneth Dibble, would be happy to do so. Do contact my office to make arrangements.</p>
