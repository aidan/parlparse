The process for making changes to airspace is governed by the CAA's airspace change process. Under this process it is for airspace change sponsors, for example NATS, to develop and consult upon proposals. Detailed guidance is given on what impacts are to be taken into account, how they should be measured and who should be consulted. Informed by the consultation, the sponsor submits the proposal to the CAA's directorate of airspace policy for assessment against regulatory requirements. In determining whether to accept or reject a proposal, the CAA's process reflects the Secretary of State's directions and guidance to the CAA on the exercise of its statutory duties and environmental objectives.</p>

	<p pid="e.796W.2/3">In December 2007 the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) considered the potential for TSE risks associated with future options for permitting processed animal protein (PAP) into livestock feed, arising from the European Commission's TSE Roadmap. The scientific papers are available on SEAC's website. SEAC is preparing a statement for publication.</p>
	<p pid="e.796W.2/4">There is also an EU-coordinated test development project (SAFEED-PAP) under way to develop and validate official testing methods capable of reliably identifying PAP from different species in feed samples. Such tests may provide the necessary control tools to allow consideration of future proposals to use non-ruminant-derived PAP in the feeding of non-ruminant livestock. Improved testing methods will also support EU-wide monitoring for compliance with the current controls. DEFRA is contributing to SAFEED-PAP through the funding of research at the Veterinary Laboratory Agency (SE1797) and the Central Science Laboratory (SE1798).</p>

In addition the Animal Welfare Act 2006, makes it an offence to cause an animal under the control of man unnecessary suffering. In addition, the Act places a 'duty of care' on any owner or keeper to ensure that the welfare needs of their animals are met. Meeting the needs of animals includes the provision of a suitable environment (place to live); a suitable diet; ability to exhibit normal behaviour patterns; to be housed with, or apart from, other animals (if applicable); and to be protected from pain, injury, suffering and disease.</p>

The strategy, which splits England into priority areas, is designed to be flexible, taking into account the delivery of vaccine, take-up in the existing protection zone, epidemiological information and the location of new disease, when it recurs. The strategy is available on the DEFRA website.</p>

We cannot specify at this stage when vaccination will be rolled out into Cumbria.

Merial anticipate delivering vaccine in regular batches over the summer, which, alongside DEFRA's existing contract with Intervet, will ensure that sufficient doses are available for vaccination to be rolled out across England and Wales by September.</p>

During financial years 2006-07 and 2007-08 this Department spent &pound;14.8 million and &pound;49 million respectively, on the funding of voluntary early departures under the two voluntary early departure schemes.</p>

	<p pid="e.805W.5/37">The increase in numbers of strandings presented in the table in part reflects the increase in reporting effort with the operation of the Strandings scheme. It would therefore not be meaningful to compare stranding numbers collected before 1990 (which were ad hoc reports) with those collected since the scheme started. A very active cetacean strandings volunteer group also operates in the south-west which has increased effort into reporting of cetacean strandings.</p>

	<p pid="e.808W.5/1">No. The Hill Farm Allowance will only be paid on land in the 'Severely Disadvantaged Areas' (SDA) from 2008. This decision was taken following a public consultation in 2006 on the future of uplands support, in which the majority of respondents on this issue were in favour of restricting the hill farm allowance to the SDA only. Land in the 'Disadvantaged Areas' (DA) is generally more accessible, higher grade agricultural land with more options for diversification. The model of the single payment scheme adopted in England will also, over time, tend to favour DA farmers in comparison to those in the SDA.</p>

	<p pid="e.809W.8/2">In 2004, DEFRA funded the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) launched Recycle Now, with key objectives to change behaviour and encourage more of us to recycle more things, more often. Recycle Now encompasses an integrated mix of national advertising website support, and an integrated, broad-based national and regional PR campaign. 90 per cent of local authorities in England are now using the Recycle Now identity.</p>
	<p pid="e.809W.8/3">According to WRAP'S research, the campaign has had a significant impact and more than six out of every 10 people (61 per cent. or 25.5 million) in England were committed recyclers by 2007. The equates to 16 per cent. more people (8.5 million) being committed recyclers, compared to when the Recycle Now campaign was launched in England in September 2004, when the number of committed recyclers stood at 45 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="e.809W.8/4">Local authorities are responsible for the collection of recycled materials by their residents. The Government do not specify what materials local authorities must collect for recycling. However, Government initiatives such as performance indicators, local area agreements and the landfill allowance trading scheme should encourage local authorities to provide schemes that will increase recycling among their residents.</p>

	<p pid="e.813W.0/2">The Government are deeply concerned by the overall human rights situation in Iran, including the treatment of the Baha'i community. The Baha'i faith is not officially recognised as a minority religion and consequently Baha'is are subject to institutional discrimination and persecution, for example restrictions on employment and education, anti-Baha'i propaganda campaigns in the state-run media and arbitrary arrests. We are particularly concerned that all the members of the informal group which co-ordinates Baha'i activities in Iran were arrested last month and we understand that further arrests of Baha'is have taken place in Esfahan and Ghaemshahr. The Government urges the Iranian government to address human rights concerns and uphold the international human rights standards that it has signed up to freely and regularly raises concerns about the treatment of the Baha'is with the Iranian authorities both bilaterally and through the EU. We have done so at least five times already this year. Most recently, following a recommendation by the UK, the EU issued a public declaration on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-21">21 May</phrase> expressing serious concern about the treatment of the Baha'is in Iran and calling for the release of the detained individuals.</p>

	<p pid="e.819W.3/1">The July 2007 announcement increases the means-testing threshold below which full-time students are entitled to a full maintenance grant up from &pound;17,910 for entrants in 2007/08 to &pound;25,000 for entrants in 2008/09. The threshold for a partial grant will increase from &pound;38,330 for entrants in 2007/08 to &pound;60,005 for entrants in 2008/09. These thresholds relate to household income.</p>
	<p pid="e.819W.3/2">This will mean that around one third of all eligible students in England entering higher education in the academic year 2008/09 are expected to be entitled to a full non-repayable grant worth &pound;2,835 and around another one third are expected to be entitled to a partial grant of between &pound;50 and &pound;2,835. Until students apply for support for 2008/09 we do not know the number of students within each of the specified bands. However, a third of new eligible students in 2008/09 is equivalent to around 100,000 students meaning we expect this number to be entitled to a full grant and the same number entitled to a partial grant.</p>

	<p pid="e.821W.3/1">Communities and Local Government is responsible for housing policy in England, both rural and urban, and therefore much of the work commissioned by the Department on housing policy is relevant to all areas of the country, including rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="e.821W.3/2">Specifically on rural housing, in 1997 DETR commissioned a report from DTZ Pieda Consulting, published in 1998 on 'The Nature of the Demand for Housing in Rural Areas'. In July 2005, ODPM and DEFRA set up the Affordable Housing Commission to identify ways of improving access to affordable housing for people in rural areas. Most recently (December 2007) the Prime Minister asked <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> to conduct a review on how land use and planning can better support rural business and deliver affordable housing. The hon. Member is due to report on this next month.</p>

	<p pid="e.821W.6/1">Milton Keynes opted to deliver decent homes through a stock retention strategy using their existing funding streams.</p>
	<p pid="e.821W.6/2">The funding streams that the Department awards for spending on the improvement of council housing are supported borrowing and the major repairs allowance (introduced in 2001-02). Supported borrowing is where the Government pays the interest on local authority borrowing, allowing it to borrow for capital works to the stock.</p>
	<p pid="e.821W.6/3">Prior to 2006-2007 private sector renewal funding was included in the local authorities supported borrowing. This has since moved to a capital grant and is therefore no longer recorded in this data which explains the reduction in between 2005-06 and 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="e.828W.3/2">I receive a number of representations on fuel poverty from Members of Parliament, members of the public, and a range of stakeholder organisations with an interest in fuel poverty.</p>
	<p pid="e.828W.3/3">Since 2000 the Government have spent around &pound;20 billion on fuel poverty programmes and benefits. Most recently my Department has secured the individual agreement of the six major energy suppliers to increase their collective spend on social programmes for low income households from &pound;50 million to &pound;150 million year by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="e.828W.3/4">The Government also announced a one-off additional payment to the winter fuel payment for this coming winter of &pound;50 for the over 60s and &pound;100 for the over 80s. And the recent Ofgem-led Fuel Poverty summit resulted in a package of measures that will help vulnerable households access the best available tariffs. Our research has shown that switching suppliers and payment method can bring savings of up to &pound;200.</p>
	<p pid="e.828W.3/5">The Government's Warm Front programme provides a range of insulation measures and energy efficiency advice to households in receipt of certain benefits. Between 2000-08 the Government will have committed &pound;1.6 billion to Warm Front providing support to 1.7 million households.</p>
	<p pid="e.828W.3/6">The carbon emissions reduction target places an obligation on energy suppliers to deliver energy efficiency measures to householders, including insulation. Under this scheme it is expected that &pound;1.5 billion will be directed to low income and elderly consumers over the three years of the programme.</p>
	<p pid="e.828W.3/7">Progress is also being made in improving the insulation of social housing under the Decent Homes standard. The Decent Homes standard is a minimum standard below which homes should not fall in England, and includes thermal comfort. The Government expect 95 per cent. of social homes to meet the Decent Homes standard by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="e.828W.3/8">We have no plans at present to extend the range of energy efficiency programmes.</p>

	<p pid="e.831W.12/1">Neighbourhood policing provides high visibility, reassurance policing in all communities, establishing local priorities with local people by engaging with the community on the issues which matter most to them.</p>
	<p pid="e.831W.12/2">We know that a neighbourhood policing approach works. The Home Office evaluation of the National Reassurance Policing Programme (NRPP)&mdash;the precursor to neighbourhood policing which was trialled in 16 sites in England between 2003 and 2005&mdash;demonstrated that crime and antisocial behaviour were positively affected by a neighbourhood policing approach and that public confidence increased fivefold.</p>
	<p pid="e.831W.12/3">There are now around 3,600 dedicated teams in place across England and Wales consisting of over 13,500 sergeants and constables and 16,000 police community support officers. For the first time ever, every household across the country now has a dedicated police team to solve local problems and has a name and contact number for their local team.</p>
	<p pid="e.831W.12/4">The Home Office is monitoring and evaluating these new teams across England and Wales, through a three-year research programme, due to be completed in autumn 2009.</p>
	<p pid="e.831W.12/5">Early indications show the positive impact of neighbourhood policing on crime and antisocial behaviour, as well as feelings of safety and confidence in the police. The Home Office also continues to assess police performance, including the impact of neighbourhood policing, through the Assessments of Policing and Community Safety (APACS) framework, while inspections by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary also provide a qualitative assessment of neighbourhood policing delivery.</p>

However, the Home Office is currently sponsoring a series of regional seminars/road shows, designed to engage with a wide range of professionals and communities to raise awareness of the problem of honour based violence, which includes tackling the practice of FGM. The aim of these forums is to enable local partnerships to develop strategies to identify and protect vulnerable victims for honour based violence.</p>
	<p pid="e.832W.5/3">As part of our commitment to address FGM we are engaging with a number of third sector agencies that work within the support and research sector of this field.</p>
	<p pid="e.832W.5/4">We will soon set up a national Black and Minority Ethnic working group of Government, statutory agencies and the third sector that will promote a partnership approach to a range of issues including FGM.

	<p pid="e.844W.5/1">There is nothing in marriage legislation that refers specifically to the subject of photography at the wedding and arrangements are at the discretion of the local superintendent registrar.</p>
	<p pid="e.844W.5/2">Following articles in the media, the Registrar General has written to registration officers in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid="e.844W.5/3">The Registrar General believes that all registration officers will share his view that our objective should be to ensure that the marriage ceremony is a joyous occasion for the couple involved and that they should be able to properly record it without undermining the solemnity or dignity of the occasion. He understands that it is the usual practice to discourage still photography during the ceremony but allow ample opportunity after the register has been completed. He accepts that this avoids any disruption of the proceedings but is also aware that there is nothing in law to prevent photographs being taken at any stage in the proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="e.844W.5/4">However, he is clear that this is a decision for superintendent registrars to make locally. He also accepts that the usual practice of allowing the couple to pose for photographs with a blank register or register page protects the register from any inadvertent damage without detracting from the traditional posed photograph. This practice also conceals the information in the register itself. Although this is not subject to data protection laws, it is a common-sense way of avoiding any identification of the couple or third parties, particularly where the image may be published on social networking websites.</p>
	<p pid="e.844W.5/5">The Registrar General is confident that all registration officers will also continue to ensure that all couples have a memorable and happy day with full opportunity to have the photographs they wish to provide a lasting memento.</p>

All other personnel receive letters, packets and parcels at a subsidised rate which means that the sender only pays the UK domestic inland postage charge regardless of where in the world an item is sent. A six week free service is available in the pre-Christmas period for many locations that do not have an enduring free service, such as deployed ships, the Falkland Islands and Diego Garcia.</p>

	<p pid="e.848W.2/1">Mail posted from anywhere within the United Kingdom typically takes three to seven days to reach Iraq and Afghanistan. All British Forces Post Office addressed mail is delivered several times daily to the British Forces Post Office depot at Northolt for sorting and onward transmission to its final destination. All mail for Iraq and Afghanistan is bagged, loaded daily onto road transport and driven to Royal Air Force Brize Norton or Royal Air Force Lyneham for loading on to military or charter flights to the operational theatres.</p>
	<p pid="e.848W.2/2">The British Forces Post Offices in the theatres seek to clear the mail daily. This is usually achieved in Iraq due to the collocation of the majority of British forces in the Basra base. However, in Afghanistan the onward transmission of mail can be delayed because mail for units deployed to forward positions has to be transported by helicopter for the final leg of delivery. Although all steps are taken to ensure timely delivery, mail transported by helicopter comes behind ammunition, medical supplies and food in order of priority.</p>

	<p pid="e.851W.3/6" class="indent">As my answer indicated, all units will deploy at the strength required for the tasks that they are asked to fulfil during their operational tour. The table, attached at ANNEX A, lists the main formed units which deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan from November 2006 to April 2008 and the total troop numbers which these units deployed. The equivalent information is not held for subunits, so the totals will not match the overall numbers which deployed on each roulement. As you know, it is not unusual for a roulement to be configured from elements of a number of units, each of which are contributing a small number of troops in support of the main formation. All units that are tasked to deploy on each operational tour are listed in the relevant announcement laid before Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="e.853W.9/1">An assessment was made by the Department in 2001 which concluded that the Future Lynx aircraft likely offered the best through-life approach to the delivery of the Army's battlefield light utility helicopter (BLUH) and Royal Navy's surface combatant maritime rotorcraft (SCMR) requirements and a sole source assessment phase was launched. We continued to benchmark the Future Lynx approach against other opportunities, including within the analysis that underpinned the future rotorcraft capability programme during 2004-05, where the Army's requirement was described as the battlefield reconnaissance helicopter (BRH).</p>
	<p pid="e.853W.9/2">The analysis concluded that the delivery of the BRH and the SCMR requirements through a single helicopter type (Future Lynx) provided the best combination of through-life military capability, time to deliver into service, cost and risk. As such, we decided not to launch a competition.</p>

Where translation spending can be identified it amounted to &pound;1,413 in 2007-08, subject to any necessary adjustments following the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit of the 2007-08 HM Treasury Resource Account. This spending represented the Treasury's share of the cost of the provision of interpreters at European Commission working group meetings in Brussels attended by Treasury officials and cannot therefore be broken down by language.</p>

	<p pid="e.867W.5/1">We have urged the government of Israel to ensure that, in line with its own public commitments, its actions do not result in an humanitarian crisis in Gaza. For example the Foreign Secretary and I issued a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-08">8 February</phrase> expressing our grave concern over the fuel situation. We also fully support the EU presidency statement in April urging &quot;regular and unrestricted delivery of fuel supplies to the Gaza Strip in order not to aggravate further the humanitarian situation&quot;. We are conscious that Palestinian militants have deliberately also aggravated the humanitarian situation, including through the attacks on the Nahal Oz and Kerem Shalom crossings. We condemn such actions which can only lead to more misery for the people of Gaza. The violence needs to stop and basic humanitarian supplies, including fuel, should be allowed in and properly distributed to those who need them.</p>
	<p pid="e.867W.5/2">There is a shortage of all types of fuel in Gaza. At present, Gaza experiences about six to eight hours of daily power cuts. Power cuts paralyse daily life and stop essential services, including health care, being delivered effectively. Fuel supply to the Gaza power plant is sourced by the European Commission (EC) and delivered directly and has not been affected by the association's strike. The Israeli authorities only allow delivery of about 2.2 million litres of the 3.5 million litres that the power plant needs to operate at full capacity. The UK has provided &pound;15 million to the EC's Temporary International Mechanism and &pound;15.45 to its successor PEGASE for basic services to ordinary Palestinians, including delivery of fuel to the Gaza power plant.</p>

	<p pid="e.868W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="e.868W.2/2">We believe strongly that UN personnel must uphold the highest standards of behaviour. The vast majority of UN peacekeepers uphold those standards while doing important work in difficult and dangerous circumstances. They are working to build the conditions for sustainable peace.</p>
	<p pid="e.868W.2/3">The UK takes all allegations of misconduct by UN and other peacekeepers extremely seriously. The UN is responsible for tackling any individual allegations of misconduct with troop contributing countries. We will continue to work closely with the UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other partners to ensure that its 'zero tolerance' policy towards incidents of abuse is implemented in full. We have been instrumental in instigating some recent policy changes at the UN aimed at preventing and tackling sexual exploitation and abuse. These include: a more robust Model Memorandum of Understanding between the UN and Troop Contributing Countries; an upgraded Welfare and Recreation Strategy for peacekeeping and related personnel; a Victim's Assistance Strategy to provide assistance to survivors of sexual violence perpetrated by UN personnel; and a resolution on 'Criminal accountability of UN officials and experts on mission'.</p>
	<p pid="e.868W.2/4">We are also helping to support the UN's efforts to assess, prioritise and respond to the sexual exploitation and abuse of children by UN peacekeepers and aid workers. This has involved taking concrete measures to address both the military and civilian branches of peacekeeping support operations. One such measure, the UN's Conduct and Discipline Units, is funded by the UK's Conflict Prevention Pool. These teams work to ensure that all peacekeeping personnel undergo training on UN standards of conduct relating to sexual exploitation and abuse, and that all allegations of wrongdoing are reported upon and followed up with appropriate action. In the UN Mission in Liberia, for example, the number of cases reported to the UN was reduced by half from 2006 to 2007.</p>
	<p pid="e.868W.2/5">The UK supports all efforts to protect the world's most vulnerable children from sexual abuse. To strengthen the UN's approach further, the UK supported the UN Secretary-General's recent recommendation to include, where appropriate, child protection advisors within the mandates of peacekeeping missions. As an active member of the UN Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, we will continue to work to improve the effectiveness of existing UN monitoring, reporting and disciplinary mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="e.868W.2/6">Through its Conflict Prevention programme, the UK also helps to train military personnel for peacekeeping operations. Good conduct and respect for human rights is an integral part of all training courses. The UK will continue to provide training on peace support operations for troops from other countries, which covers conduct and discipline, particularly the importance of protecting civilians (including women and children) in accordance with international law.</p>
	<p pid="e.868W.2/7">Save The Children (the non-governmental organisation) raise some important concerns in their report about abuse committed not just by UN personnel but aid workers employed by non-governmental organisations. We need to carefully consider with the UN and the non-governmental organisation community how best to ensure children are not subject to abuse.</p>

The UK funded the Investment Climate Assessment conducted by the World Bank in 2007, which was critical to identifying the challenges and needs for business to recover in the OPTs.

With DFID support, investment projects totalling &pound;1 billion were prepared for the conference. These have the potential to create 50,000 new jobs, which is critical to economic recovery and a sense of hope, particularly among young people. 10 investment agreements were signed for a total of over &pound;700 million, primarily in housing, infrastructure and telecommunications with Arab companies. At the conference, I launched a new private sector initiative&mdash;the &pound;3.7 million New Market Development Initiative&mdash;to support Palestinian businesses to compete in new markets and enhance exports.

The second stage takes the allocations proposed by the model and considers how other country level considerations like the likelihood of that country getting into conflict or their progress in reaching the millennium development goals may affect their allocations.</p>
	<p pid="e.870W.2/2">In addition, DFID is committed to improving distribution of aid through the multilateral system by strengthening the evidence base for multilateral effectiveness. DFID produces multilateral development effectiveness summaries which measure multilateral organisations according to their country level and global results, how they manage resources and partnerships with others, and how they build for the future. DFID is also working with other donors through the multilateral organisations performance assessment network (MOPAN) to develop a method of measuring the effectiveness of multilateral for use by the joint donor group.</p>
	<p pid="e.870W.2/3">Further information on aid allocation and distribution is available in chapters five and 10 of the DFID annual report 2008; copies of which are in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="e.882W.0/1">In December 2007, we published &quot;Putting People First&quot;, a cross-sector concordat establishing the collaboration between central and local Government, the sector's professional leadership, providers and the regulator. It set out the shared aims and values which transform adult social care and people's experience of local support and services. At that time we also announced the Social Care Reform Grant, a new, ringfenced grant of &pound;520 million over the three years from 2008-09 to 2010-11. The expectation is that in the next three years councils will have made significant steps towards redesigning and reshaping their adult social care services, with the majority having most of the core components of a personalised system in place by 2011.</p>
	<p pid="e.882W.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-10">10 June</phrase> we published the new carers strategy, &quot;Carers at the heart of 21<sup>(st)</sup> century families and communities: a caring system on your side, a life of your own&quot;. The Strategy sets an ambitious vision focusing on providing greater services and support for carers over the next 10 years. Specifically, in the short-term, to kick-start the process of improving support for carers, we are investing an additional &pound;150 million in providing breaks for carers, up to &pound;38 million in helping carers combine paid employment and caring and over &pound;6 million in support for young carers. Furthermore, we are committed, in the longer-term, to reviewing the structure of the benefits available to carers in the context of wider benefit reform and the fundamental review of the care and support system.

	<p pid="e.886W.5/1">We have noted the findings and comments in the judgment of the election court. Since 2005, the Government have introduced a range of new measures to strengthen the integrity of our electoral system, and there have been very few proven incidences of fraud since the new measures were brought into force. They include:</p>
	<p pid="e.886W.5/2" class="indent">Clear new powers for electoral administrators to cross-check applications to register to vote against other information the council holds.</p>
	<p pid="e.886W.5/3" class="indent">New requirement for electors to provide personal identifiers (signature and date of birth) if they wish to have a postal vote. The identifiers must be replicated by electors when they subsequently cast their postal vote, and will be cross-checked with the original samples to ensure the postal vote is valid.</p>
	<p pid="e.886W.5/4" class="indent">Administrators get more time to check postal vote applications because people have to apply for a postal vote a minimum of 11 working days before the close of poll (the previous minimum was six days).</p>
	<p pid="e.886W.5/5" class="indent">Postal vote applicants have to specify a reason if they want their postal vote to be sent to an address other than that at which they are registered.</p>
	<p pid="e.886W.5/6" class="indent">Electoral administrators write to everyone who has applied for a postal vote at their registered address acknowledging receipt of their application and confirming the outcome&mdash;this will alert people to any applications for postal votes made falsely on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid="e.886W.5/7">The Government are working to improve the electoral register and agree in principle with individual registration. However, the ground needs to be prepared; unlike Northern Ireland, where there had been a perception of over-registration, in Great Britain there is an issue of under-registration&mdash;with in the region 3.5 million eligible electors not on the electoral register. A rapid and unplanned move to individual registration would exacerbate that situation.</p>
	<p pid="e.886W.5/8">We will take account of the election court's judgment in any further development on electoral registration and postal voting processes and legislation.</p>

	<p pid="e.886W.8/1">Overall, the incidence of postal voting fraud remains relatively low. It is also apparent that the cases that have arisen only relate to a small number of authorities across the country.</p>
	<p pid="e.886W.8/2">However, the Government take the risk of electoral fraud extremely seriously. We have put in place a range of measures to safeguard the security of postal voting. These include the introduction of a system of personal identifiers for postal voters to ensure that postal votes counted at an election are valid. We are also continuing to work closely with the Electoral Commission, police, political parties and returning officers to raise awareness and strengthen systems to ensure that fraud is detected and prosecuted.</p>

	<p pid="e.887W.2/1">The Government have not made any estimate of the number of people eligible but not registered to vote in each of the last 11 years, as such information is not available for all of that period. However, the Electoral Commission estimated that 3.5 million eligible electors were not registered to vote in their report, 'Understanding Electoral Registration', which was published in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="e.887W.2/2">It is not known what the average rate of voter registration is in the 100 <i> (a)</i><i> </i>least and <i> (b)</i> most deprived wards, as this information is not collected but we are aware that any new system of electoral registration in GB would need to be tailored to current circumstances, and in particular would need to address the challenge of under-registration.</p>
	<p pid="e.887W.2/3">The Government are committed to the principle of individual registration.

	<p pid="e.892W.5/2">No immediate assessment has been made concerning the effects of the time taken to process and register an LPA. LPAs are not designed for immediate use but as a method for people to plan ahead for a time when they may lack capacity. The OPG will be making an assessment of how the new legislation is operating from October 2008 once the Act has been in operation for a full year. A key element of this review will be an evaluation of how well lasting powers of attorney are meeting people's needs and the impact of the new forms, practices and procedures on the people they are intended to support.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-06-17e.211752.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2008-06-17e.893W.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1682" speakername="Bridget Prentice" colnum="893W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080617/text/80617w0024.htm#08061796002359">
	<p pid="e.893W.0/1">The current fee regulations for both Lasting Powers of Attorney and Enduring Powers of Attorney require a fee to be paid upon an application to register the power with the Office of the Public Guardian. No refund is automatically payable either if the target for registering the power is missed, or if the target is missed and the person who lacks capacity, or the applicant, dies before it is registered.</p>
	<p pid="e.893W.0/2">If an applicant, or the person who lacks capacity, feels that they have suffered significant worry, distress or financial loss as a result of an unreasonable delay then they may be entitled to financial redress.</p>
	<p pid="e.893W.0/3">The Office of the Public Guardian's business plan outlines the targets that have been agreed with the Ministry of Justice. For Lasting Powers of Attorney, these targets, together with the statutory waiting period, give a maximum expected end-to-end processing time of nine weeks. This includes two weeks to process and check the application, a six weeks statutory waiting period during which objections to registration can be made and a further week to notify parties of registration. For Enduring Powers of Attorney the maximum expected end-to-end processing time is six weeks, which includes a five week statutory waiting period followed by a week to notify parties of registration.</p>
	<p pid="e.893W.0/4">Since 2003 the Public Guardianship Office and from October the Office of the Public Guardian would have met this timescale for Enduring Powers of Attorney in virtually all cases (between 99-100 per cent of cases) except in 1996 when 96.3 per cent. of cases met those timescales.</p>
	<p pid="e.893W.0/5">Since October 2007 the OPG has seen increasingly large numbers of applications to register powers of attorney, which has lead to delays in the process for Lasting Powers of Attorney. For example, in both April and May this year total applications to register both types of powers of attorney were approximately three times as many as for the same period last year.</p>
	<p pid="e.893W.0/6">This has meant that Lasting Power of Attorney applications are currently taking an average of 12 weeks to process&mdash;three weeks longer than we would expect. I regret the delays that are occurring in this area and which are due to the increased volumes of business the Office is seeing. Additional resources have already been put into place to address this. The Office of the Public Guardian expects to see delays reduced over the coming weeks for service standards to begin to be brought back within targets.</p>

	<p pid="e.900W.2/1">The Tribunals Service inherited a network of hearing venues of varying quality across the UK. Many of these venues are in the same towns/cities. An examination of venue usage showed a substantial under-utilisation of courtrooms in many areas. The Tribunal Service aims to rationalise this network to unify services and operate more efficiently, by introducing a network of multi-jurisdictional hearing centres which more accurately reflect the varying demand of appeal caseload across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="e.900W.2/2">Work to deliver some Tribunals Service venue rationalisation has already begun, where estate opportunities have allowed. The following table provides details of the changes which have taken place.</p>

	<p pid="e.902W.2/1">The Tribunals Service have inherited a network of hearing venues of varying quality across the UK, many of which were in the same towns and cities. An examination of venue usage showed a substantial under-utilisation of courtrooms in many areas. The Tribunal Service aims to rationalise this network to unify services and operate more efficiently, by introducing a high quality network of multi-jurisdictional hearing centres which more accurately reflect the varying demand of appeal caseload across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="e.902W.2/2">The proposed future network multi-jurisdictional hearing centres and the associated rationalisation plans have not yet been finalised and are currently subject to internal consultations and funding approval. The internal consultation process is due to be finalised by the end of the summer.</p>

	<p pid="e.902W.5/1">A survey conducted across the Ministry of Justice and a sample of our agencies and non-departmental bodies shows variable levels of demand for service provision in the Welsh language, depending in part on the services provided and whether they are provided directly in Wales.

	<p pid="e.902W.5/2">In accordance with the Welsh Language Act 1993, the Ministry of Justice has prepared a Welsh Language Scheme, which will be put out to public consultation once it has been cleared by the Welsh Language Board.
