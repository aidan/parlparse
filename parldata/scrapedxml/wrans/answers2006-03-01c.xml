	<p pid="c.700W.5/1">Yemen is the only low-income country in the middle east, with social indicators reflecting very low levels of human development&mdash;female primary school enrolment and completion rates and adult illiteracy rates are among the worst in the world, as are infant and maternal mortality rates. With a population of 20 million the poverty levels are high&mdash;10.7 percent. of population below US$1 a day and 45 percent. below US$2 a day.</p>
	<p pid="c.700W.5/2">DFID's support to Yemen goes back to 1997 with a &pound;2 million per year programme focusing on strengthening economic and financial management. DFID extended the programme in 2003 also to include work on education and health, and opened an office in Yemen in 2004. DFID has increased its programme in Yemen from &pound;2.5 million in 2001-02 to &pound;12.5 million in 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="c.700W.5/3">The Government of Yemen's 3rd five year development plan for poverty reduction (DPPR) is due to be finalised in the next few months. DFID will support the implementation of this and encourage a more effective, harmonised donor response through a joint donor framework for action. This will help donors achieve focus and prioritisation in their work.</p>
	<p pid="c.700W.5/4">This approach has given DFID the time to focus our engagement in strategic areas that we believe will bring about positive change; for example, supporting improvements in public financial management and improving aid harmonisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.700W.5/5">The current DFID programme includes support for basic education (with the aim of expanding access to quality basic education, focussing on the inclusion of girls), maternal and neonatal health (improving health services and health sector planning and policy making), community development through a social fund, support to elections reform, improved donor harmonisation and alignment, public financial management, and the development of the new development plan for poverty reduction. DFID is also exploring options for working with the Yemen Government on improving access to justice for the poorest.</p>
	<p pid="c.700W.5/6">The Yemen Government have recently announced a package of reforms to improve governance, and DFID are supporting the development and implementation of these through all of our work, through our dialogue with Government, and through our funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.700W.5/7">DFID is drafting its country assistance plan for Yemen detailing our development strategy in the country over the next three years which will be published in September 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.702W.2/1">Corruption is both a symptom and a cause of poor governance. DFID supports a wide range of governance reforms to prevent, detect and take action against corruption. For example, DFID is helping countries to reform their judicial system in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. DFID also supports public financial management reforms in Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, DFID also provides technical and financial support to dedicated anti-corruption commissions in Sierra Leone, Uganda, Nigeria and Zambia. DFID also helps civil society hold African governments to account for the proper use of public resources. For example, DFID supports the international NGO Transparency International and its country chapters.</p>
	<p pid="c.702W.2/2">In addition, African countries are working together to tackle corruption regionally as well as in their countries. For example, DFID is helping the East and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) to build capacity in the region to prevent and detect money-laundering.</p>
	<p pid="c.702W.2/3">Both developed and developing countries must play their part to reduce corruption in Africa. In 2005 at Gleneagles, G8 countries committed to a set of actions at home to help stop corruption in Africa. DFID is working with other Government Departments to meet these commitments in the UK. For example, secondary legislation is now in place to enable the UK to ratify the UN convention against corruption, the first global anti-corruption standard. We expect to ratify imminently.</p>

For example, in our humanitarian activities we are supporting Medecins Sans Frontieres to improve primary and secondary healthcare services in Bie and Uige provinces (&pound;547,850). To promote peace and democracy we have provided &pound;765,812 to the Electoral Institute of Southern Africa (EISA) to educate citizens on their role in the electoral process. We fund the Luanda Urban Poverty Programme (LUPP), a coalition of local and international NGOs which works to reduce urban poverty (&pound;8.9 million). On HIV and AIDS, we support programmes to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS, offer voluntary counselling and testing, and market condoms through the BBC World Service Trust, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Population Services International and GOAL (over &pound;2.5 million). To ensure continued peace and stability in Angola we also support a number of peacebuilding projects through Christian Aid, the African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD) and the Centre for Common Ground, totalling over &pound;2 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.704W.5/3">Mine action is still required in Angola and we currently support projects in partnership with Mines Advisory Group (MAG) and the HALO Trust. We are providing MAG with &pound;1 million over the period 2005&ndash;07 for road and bridge demining in Mexico province and HALO Trust with &pound;400,000 in 2005&ndash;06 for road clearance in Cuando Cubango province. Angola will remain a focus country for DFID mine action funding for the foreseeable future. We are working to strengthen Angolan Disabled People's Organisations through World Vision (&pound;274,705).</p>

In 2005 UNICEF spent a total of $20 million in Angola, just over US$1 million was in Cabinda province, supporting education, health, and water and sanitation programmes. In addition DFID, together with the FCO and the MOD, is supporting peace building in Cabinda using funds from the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (&pound;40,000 this year). Young people representing civil society organisations in Cabinda are being given the opportunity to do work placements with human rights, democratisation or peace building organisations in South Africa. The intention is that the expertise obtained in these important areas will be reinvested in peace building efforts in Cabinda.</p>

	<p pid="c.707W.5/1">DFID is active in assessing the role of remittances in development and poverty reduction, and uses the resulting findings to inform its aid programming.</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.5/2">In general, studies indicate that remittances reduce poverty in developing countries. For example:</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.5/3" class="indent">Recent research from Guatemala and the Philippines show that remittances reduce the level, depth and severity of poverty. Households receiving remittances were found to spend around 50 percent. more than households with no remittances.</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.5/4" class="indent">In Bangladesh, remittances from internal migration can represent the majority of household income. Households receiving remittances have higher nutritional and health status, higher levels of educational investment, and pools of money available for emergencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.5/5">At the level of the economy, research suggests that remittances provide valuable foreign exchange for developing countries, and strengthen the balance of payments situation. Unlike other financial flows, remittances are counter cyclical, thus alleviating macroeconomic shocks. Remittances can also provide investment capital for economic activity, contributing to economic growth. Where remittance flows are saved rather than spent, they provide a higher deposit base for the banking system, which is necessary for economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.5/6">DFID has funded a number of studies and also analyses relevant research by other organisations such as the World Bank. DFID funded a study in 2003 on remittances to developing countries in general which found a positive poverty reduction role for remittances. This finding was supported by DFID studies in 2004 and 2005 in Nigeria, Ghana and Bangladesh. DFID funded a household survey in the UK amongst the Bangladeshi community last year, which explored the impact on recipients of remittances to Bangladesh. DFID has recently commissioned a wider household survey to better understand the volume and value of remittance flows from key ethnic minority communities within the UK, and their impact on respective recipient countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.5/7">DFID also funded a study to determine the contribution of UK based diasporas to development and poverty reduction. The study noted wider benefits from remittances and other forms of assistance from diasporas and migrant communities. These benefits were in the form of relief from war and disaster and in post war reconstruction (e.g. Somalia, Sri Lanka), and in education and health. .</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.5/8">DFID has used this research to design aid strategies in reducing barriers to remittance flows and further enhance their developmental impact. In particular, DFID has initiated remittance country partnerships programmes with Bangladesh, Nigeria and Ghana. These partnerships include work to extend access to remittances to poorer and more rural people, encourage greater competition and lower remittance prices, and improve data. This will be achieved by working with the private sector to extend access and outreach, and working with central banks and government, to address regulatory, data, competition and consumer issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.5/9">In terms of work in the UK, DFID has recently set up a taskforce comprising of banks and money transfer companies, in order to lower remittance prices and improve the services they provide to low income migrants. The taskforce will implement recommendations from a public/private sector working group report that DFID launched late last year.</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.5/10">DFID has also initiated a website (<a href="http://www.sendmoneyhome.org">www.sendmoneyhome.org</a>) for those wishing to send remittances to developing countries from the UK. This provides easily available comparative information on remittance prices and providers. The aim is to improve choice and stimulate competition, leading to lower prices and a better service for low income migrants.</p>

	<p pid="c.708W.2/2">In addition to providing support for food relief in life threatening situations, we are tackling chronic hunger by supporting the development of national safety nets that better deliver timely, adequate and guaranteed transfers of cash and/or food to the poorest. These programmes protect livelihoods and safeguard against destitution by helping people to keep their key assets&mdash;like land and livestock&mdash;through periods of hardship and crisis. For example, we have now provided a total of &pound;43 million to Ethiopia's safety net. This has helped take five million people out of year-on-year emergency assistance.</p>

	<p pid="c.709W.5/1">Core staff are needed to ensure the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) fulfils its mandate: raising money, disbursing funds and reporting to the board and other stakeholders on how that money has been used. In addition staff are required to ensure the Global Fund works effectively with others in tackling these three diseases.</p>
	<p pid="c.709W.5/2">Each year the Secretariat proposes appropriate numbers of staff to fulfil its duties. The Board's Finance and Audit Committee reviews this and makes a recommendation to the board. The UK's line as a board member is to ensure that staffing levels are fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="c.709W.5/3">In 2005 the Secretariat comprised 199 staff members including 150 fixed-term posts (contracts up to two years) and 49 short-term positions (contracts up to 11 months). The use of short-term contracts gives flexibility to adjust the numbers and skills mix of staff efficiently. At the twelfth meeting of the Global Fund's Board in December 2005, the Secretariat proposed an increase in staff numbers from 199 to 252 in 2006. The Secretariat argued that the Secretariat has been asked to devote more time to collaboration with partners at country and global levels, and that staffing levels were insufficient. After discussing whether savings could be made from more efficient processes, the board approved the proposed 2006 operating expense budget.</p>

	<p pid="c.710W.5/1">I have not had any such discussions, but the most important conservation issue that currently affects Lake Victoria is the rapid fall in water levels. This is in part due to an extended period of drought in the region. In addition, the release of water from Lake Victoria for power generation has recently been in excess of the amounts set out in a formula agreed with the Government of Egypt. The fall in the level of the lake has already had consequences for the agricultural sector and transportation.</p>
	<p pid="c.710W.5/2">The Government of Uganda have re-assessed the extraction of water from Lake Victoria for power generation. Although the country faces a serious energy shortfall, it has agreed with the Government of Egypt and with development partners in Kampala, including the UK, to revert to the agreed formula for the extraction of water immediately. However, lake levels will only begin to rise when the drought ends.</p>
	<p pid="c.710W.5/3">DFID has invested &pound;5.75 million in the Nile Basin Initiative, which is a multi country agreement and programme to manage sustainably the resources of the greater Nile Basin, including Lake Victoria. DFID's support for this initiative is specifically helping to establish arrangements for improved management of water resources in all Uganda's lakes. A separate DFID project has helped Uganda's Department of Fisheries improve the management of fisheries resources in Lake Victoria. DFID is helping the government develop an environmental and natural resources sector investment plan which includes the protection of wetlands around the shores of Lake Victoria and the regulation of the discharge of pollutants.</p>

Preliminary results show that the cost effectiveness from a supplier's perspective was about 0.7 pence per fuel-standardised lifetime-discounted kilowatt hour of saved energy including indirect costs, or 0.5 pence per fuel-standardised lifetime-discounted kilowatt hour excluding indirect costs.

	<p pid="c.718W.9/1">Substantial progress has been made towards achieving our target of eradicating fuel poverty in vulnerable households in England, as far as reasonably practicable, by 2010. The number of vulnerable households in fuel poverty in England fell from four million in 1996 to one million in 2003, a decrease that was due to increasing household incomes, lower fuel prices and increased domestic energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="c.718W.9/2">However, recent rises in energy prices will have had an adverse affect on progress. We are continuing to analyse the impact of these rises and the implications for the level of resource that will be necessary to meet our target. This process will continue over the period of the Energy Review, which is due to conclude later this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.718W.9/3">The Government remains committed to achieving our targets. To underline this commitment, it was announced in the 2005 pre-Budget report that an additional &pound;300 million would be made available to tackle fuel poverty across the UK over the 2005&ndash;08 period. In England, this means that total fuel poverty funding over the same period will exceed &pound;800 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.722W.0/2">In England and Wales, water resources are the responsibility of the Environment Agency, which produced in 2001 Water Resources for the Future&quot;. This strategy document considers four different future scenarios for water use, based on the Environmental Futures' framework from the DTI's Foresight programme. Annual updates to the strategy keep it up-to-date. For example, the 2004 update draws from water company projections of water use that take account of population increase. Water Resources for the Future also considers demand from increased housing, which is to some extent associated with population increase. Increases in housing might also be expected to impact on rural areas and the environment. In 2004 Defra published the Entec report, Study into the Environmental Impacts of Increasing the Supply of Housing in the UK&quot;, which was partly driven by anticipated population increase. The ODPM also have an interest in housing supply increases, through their work on buildings and sustainable communities. Defra's Horizon Scanning and Futures team is currently preparing the groundwork for a study on the environmental impacts of increasing population. T his work will look at impacts on both urban and rural environments. Other elements of Defra's work include human population growth as a component: for example, population increase is factored into our air quality and emission projections.</p>

This is scheduled to be completed by autumn 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.730W.2/4">There are seven RCCs which monitor conditions on the motorway and trunk road network within their regions of England and allocate resources such as traffic officers to manage incidents. They set messages on VMS for safety reasons, to inform drivers and to assist with incident management. Incidents (and VMS settings) are monitored from control rooms and messages displayed on VMS are reviewed and removed as necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.730W.2/5">VMS messages are also set by an automated system which uses information from the motorway incident detection and automated signalling (MIDAS) system. MIDAS works from loops in the road surface, which detect slow moving or stationary traffic. The automated message system then sets messages to warn drivers and to protect the backs of queues. This safety system has been shown to save 13 percent. of tail-end collisions. Messages are automatically cancelled as traffic flows return to normal.</p>

	<p pid="c.733W.0/1">The 2004 baseline figure for improving roads procurement in local authorities is equal to the local authority 2004&ndash;05 highways budget. As it is the decision of the local authorities how they divide their budget and only local authorities who choose to claim highways efficiencies calculate baselines, a precise baseline covering all local authority roads spend is unavailable.

The baseline for efficiencies as a result of improvements in London Underground running and capacity from Public private partnerships (PPP) is &pound;1 billion of the total TfL baseline from 2003&ndash;04. Due to the start date of the PPP contracts in December 2002 and April 2003, the most appropriate baseline for measuring these gains is 2003&ndash;04. In 2004&ndash;05 TfL realised efficiency gains of &pound;119 million.

	<p pid="c.734W.3/1">For transport infrastructure projects, a range of appraisal information including assessments using the New Approach to Transport Appraisal system apply to all schemes submitted to the Department for funding. Appraisal will cover the practicality of a scheme and this may involve a specific feasibility study. The Department does not hold a comprehensive record of all of the infrastructure projects where a specific study on feasibility was undertaken.

	<p pid="c.738W.0/1">The United Kingdom has supported the continuation of F136 as a competitive alternative to the Fl35 and as a through life risk reduction measure for the JSF programme. However, JSF is being designed so that the F135, Pratt and Whitney and F136, General Electric/Rolls-Royce engines would have been fully interchangeable, so the UK's requirements for JSF will continue to be met by the F135 alone if the United States decides to stop development of the F136 due to budget pressures. Our preference, however, was for the dual engine approach and strong representation was made to the US administration supporting this.</p>

	<p pid="c.740W.0/1">The DTI commissioned two reports in 2004 in relation to hydrogen: Hydrogen Energy Support in the UK&quot; and A Strategic Framework for Hydrogen Energy Activity in the UK&quot;. These reports have been published on the Department's website. The second report identified six potential hydrogen energy chains for the use of hydrogen as a transport fuel. One route is to produce hydrogen biomass (with optional carbon capture and storage).</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-15">15 June 2005</phrase>, I announced the Government's response to the second report A Strategic Framework for Hydrogen Energy Activity in the UK&quot; which included a funding package of &pound;15 million over four years for a UK wide hydrogen and fuel cell demonstration programme. The details of the demonstration scheme is currently being developed, and requires EC State Aid approval.</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.0/3">Basic research in universities is supported through the UK Research Councils. The EPSRC is funding two relevant SUPERGEN consortia:</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.0/4" class="indent">1. The SUPERGEN biological fuel cell consortium. This was announced in December 2005. This is a &pound;2 million investment over four-year period. This is a consortium of teams from six universities aims to achieve major advances in a technology that potentially produces electricity directly from sustainable biological materials and air, in devices known as biological fuel cells. The Consortium programme involves a combination of expertise drawn from the research areas of microbiology, enzymology, electrochemistry, materials science and computational modelling. A Biofuel Cells Industrial Club&quot; is to be formed, with industrial partners active in water management, porous materials, microbiology, biological catalysis and fuel cell technology.</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.0/5" class="indent">2. SUPERGEN UK Sustainable Hydrogen Energy (UKSHEC): part of its remit is to advance the scientific understanding of the biological generation of sustainable hydrogen. UKSHEC was established in 2003 and will continue until 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.0/6">In addition the following projects were funded by EPSRC:</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.0/7" class="indent">(i) The project Unmixed reforming of vegetable oil for hydrogen production&quot; investigated the viability of vegetable oil as the fuel for a novel steam reforming process. This project was completed in December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.0/8" class="indent">(ii) The project Sustainable biohydrogen production&quot; investigated optimising hydrogen yields from biomass by continuous fermentative processes operating on mixed microflora on any substrate. This project was completed in October 2004.</p>

	<p pid="c.744W.11/1">Competition issues associated with newspaper distribution arrangements have been the subject of extensive public consultation in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="c.744W.11/2">Between June 2003 and early 2004, the Government consulted on proposals concerning the treatment of exclusions and exemptions from competition law&mdash;including vertical agreements such as those relating to newspaper and magazine distribution. A copy of the consultation document may be found on the DTI website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/ccp/consultpdf/modconsult1.pdf">www.dti.gov.uk/ccp/consultpdf/modconsult1.pdf</a> Section 4 of that consultation document dealt with vertical agreements and the question of whether the order made in 2000 excluding vertical agreements from prohibition under UK competition law should be repealed. Parties from the newspaper and magazine supply chain were among those that submitted views to the consultation. The Government's response may be found on the DTI website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/ccp/consultpdf/compmodresp.pdf">www.dti.gov.uk/ccp/consultpdf/compmodresp.pdf</a> (section 7).</p>
	<p pid="c.744W.11/3">In 2004, following repeal of the domestic exclusion for vertical agreements, a number of industry parties sought advice from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) on the continued compatibility with competition law of agreements relating to the distribution of newspapers and magazines and requested the OFT recommend a new block exemption to cover such agreements. The OFT received representations from across the newspaper and magazine supply chain about the operation of the market. A number of the parties that made representations to the OFT wrote separately to DTI Ministers expressing their views. The OFT published its preliminary opinion on the matter in May 2005 for consultation. A copy can be found on the OFT website at <a href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F7299676-BAAC-439B-A5A7-2A7AB3191B50/0/oft450.pdf">www.oft.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F7299676-BAAC-439B-A5A7-2A7AB3191B50/0/oft450.pdf</a> The OFT received a number of further representations which it has since been considering. Again, a number of the parties that made representations to the OFT have written separately to DTI Ministers expressing their views. Ministers have also received letters on the matter from a number of hon. Members writing on behalf of constituents and from a small number of private individuals.</p>
	<p pid="c.744W.11/4">I understand the OFT intends to outline the next steps in this case in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="c.746W.0/2">The Renewables Obligation requires generators to provide Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) as evidence that 5.5 per cent. of their electricity supply has been generated from eligible renewable sources in the period from April 2005 to March 2006 and 6.7 per cent. in the period from April 2006 to March 2007. ROCs issued for co-firing biomass with fossil fuel can be used as evidence for 25 per cent. of a supplier's obligation for the period from April 2005-March 2006 and 10 per cent. of a supplier's obligation for the period from April 2006 to March 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.746W.0/3">The Department does not make estimates of the amount of biomass co-fired with coal in the periods mentioned. A publication (available by entering reference URN 05/1159 at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/publications">www.dti.gov.uk/publications</a>) in August 2005 from the Co-firing of Biomass at UK Power Plant project under the DTI's Carbon Abatement Technologies Programme indicated potential maximum co-firing levels of 4.4TWh in the period from April 2005-March 2006 and 2.2TWh from April 2006-March 2007 based on the caps set by the Renewables Obligation.</p>
	<p pid="c.746W.0/4">The precise carbon dioxide savings will depend on the level of fossil-fuel substitution, the nature of the biomass and the operating conditions of the fossil-fuel generating station.</p>
	<p pid="c.746W.0/5">Average figures for carbon dioxide emissions from power generation given on the DTI Energy Statistics website are 910g/kWh for coal-fired generation and 360g/kWh for gas-fired generation. The Renewables Innovation Review indicated net carbon dioxide emissions for a range of biomass fuels of 22-45g/kWh.</p>

	<p pid="c.746W.3/2">Science infrastructure is funded by the DTI through a number of routes. Universities are funded directly via the Science Research Investment Fund. Other investments are channelled through the Research Councils, who fund infrastructure both within the university sector and within their own institutes. Councils can also draw on the centrally-held Large Facilities Capital Fund for the largest new capital projects. The Research Councils or individual universities and research institutes are responsible for taking decisions on investments in science including new scientific infrastructure. Each Research Council has mechanisms for ensuring decisions are taken impartially in the best interests of the UK scientific community, overseen by a governing Council. The Department organises periodic prioritisation exercises carried out by the Research Councils to inform on the allocations of the Large Facilities Capital Fund. All the decisions and processes of the Department and the Research Councils are subject to scrutiny by the National Audit Office.</p>

	<p pid="c.747W.9/2">Government have introduced a variety of measures to support parents and carers in various aspects of their lives. These include a range of benefits and increased access to pensions that have and will continue to benefit many women.</p>
	<p pid="c.747W.9/3">Many non-working mothers have benefited substantially from measures introduced by the Government since 1997, such as tax credits. Child tax credit provides support to families with children, which is payable alongside child benefit to the main carer (usually the mother), regardless of whether they are in work or not. Budget 2005 announced a commitment to increase the child element of child tax credit at least in line with average earnings up to and including 2007&ndash;08. From April the child element of child tax credit will be worth up to &pound;1,765 a year for each child.</p>
	<p pid="c.747W.9/4">Also the introduction of Home Responsibilities Protection (HRP) and the state second pension have both been successful in helping women who care for their children full-time to secure a better income for their retirement. Around 1.8 million of the 1.9 million carers who will benefit from the state second pension are women.</p>

	<p pid="c.753W.6/44">2. Patient counts</p>
	<p pid="c.753W.6/45">Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier hospital episode statistic identification(HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and national health service number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.</p>

	<p pid="c.754W.2/1">The Government have commissioned several reviews of the safety and carcinogenicity of aspartame.</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.2/2">Aspartame was first reviewed in 1982 by the United Kingdom's committee on toxicity (COT), a committee of independent experts who advise the Government on the safety of food chemicals. New data on aspartame was reviewed by COT in 1992 and by the committee on the carcinogenicity (COC) in 1996. COT was satisfied that aspartame was acceptable for use in food and COC considered there was no link between brain tumours and aspartame.</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.2/3">At the request of the Food Standards Agency (FSA), in 2001, the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food revisited its previous safety assessment of aspartame and concluded that there is no evidence to suggest a need to revise the outcome of their earlier risk assessment.</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.2/4">In response to new findings on the potential carcinogenicity of aspartame published by the Ramazzini Institute the FSA commissioned a review by COC. The Committee made initial observations on the data and will be undertaking a further review of more detailed data from the study in March 2006. The FSA will forward the COC advice to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which is undertaking a full evaluation of the study in the context of previous safety data. EFSA hopes to complete its evaluation by May 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.757W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-02">2 February 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.757W.5/2">The evidence for an increased risk of breast cancer in women who use oral contraceptives (OCs) has been under constant review by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, in conjunction with the independent expert advisory committee the Commission for Human Medicines.</p>
	<p pid="c.757W.5/3">In studies, a slightly higher number of cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in women who were OC users than in women of the same age who were not. The most important factor for this increased risk was found to be the age at which women stopped using oral contraceptives&mdash;the length of time for which women used OCs was less important. In women who stopped using oral contraceptives, their increased risk of having breast cancer diagnosed disappeared after 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.757W.5/4">Currently available evidence suggests that for every 10,000 women who use oral contraceptives for up to five years, the number of cases of breast cancer that would be diagnosed for up to 10 years after stopping OCs is as shown in the table.</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid="c.757W.5/7"> <th>Age at stopping OCs</th> <th>Number of cases of breast cancer in 10,000 women who have never used OCs</th> <th>Number of breast cancers in 10,000 women after five years OCs use and up to 10 years after stopping</th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.757W.5/10"> <td>25 years</td> <td>16</td> <td>17.5</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.757W.5/11"> <td>30 years</td> <td>44</td> <td>48.7</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.757W.5/12"> <td>35 years</td> <td>100</td> <td>111</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.757W.5/13"> <td>40 years</td> <td>160</td> <td>181</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.757W.5/14"> <td>45 years</td> <td>230</td> <td>262</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.757W.5/17">However, even at these higher ages the increase in risk, attributable to OCs, for individual women remains very low.</p>
	<p pid="c.757W.5/18">Like all effective medicines, OC is not without side effects and it is very important that both prescribers and women are fully aware of these potential side effects when considering which method of contraception is the most appropriate for individuals.</p>
	<p pid="c.757W.5/19">The Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment made a statement on alcohol consumption and risk of developing breast cancer in women in November 2004, which is available on the Department's website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.757W.5/21">The committee both evaluated all the available published research on the association between alcohol consumption and breast cancer and commissioned some specialist research to aid in reaching a conclusion. The committee concluded that it is prudent to assume that drinking alcoholic beverages may result in breast cancer in women&quot;.</p>

The Exercise Referral Systems: National Quality Assurance Framework commissioned by the Department and published in 2001 stated that exercise referral programmes may incur initial higher resource costs, but may be more cost-effective in the longer term if higher risk patients can reduce their risk of morbidity and mortality.</p>
	<p pid="c.760W.8/3">An assessment of four commonly used methods to increase physical activity in primary care, including exercise referral schemes, is currently being undertaken by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. The findings currently out to consultation, are broadly supporting the effectiveness of exercise on referral at increasing physical activity levels in the short-term.</p>

	<p pid="c.767W.5/2">The Department has a range of ongoing initiatives to tackle obesity in both children and adults. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has been commissioned to prepare definitive guidance on the prevention, identification, management and treatment of obesity due in early 2007. Pending NICE guidance, tools are being developed to support the national health service in tackling obesity including an obesity care pathway for both adults and children, a weight loss guide and an obesity toolkit. Guidance on measuring children's height and weight was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-11">11 January 2006</phrase>. An obesity social marketing campaign is being developed to be launched in the autumn of 2006, mainly targeting children and their parents.</p>
	<p pid="c.767W.5/3">In addition, specific action on diet and physical activity includes healthy start, school food, food in hospitals/prisons/armed forces, work on salt, fat and sugar, promotion of foods especially to children, five a day, local exercise action pilots, football and health, pedometers, and sustainable travel towns.</p>

	<p pid="c.768W.6/1">The development of services for people with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections continues to be undertaken within the context of devolving decisions about the allocation of resources to strategic health authorities and primary care trusts (PCTs).

	<p pid="c.768W.6/5">Improving access to and awareness of post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) also forms part of our broader, national, sexual health policy and HIV prevention work, which targets those most at risk of infection. We have funded the Terrence Higgins Trust to do national awareness-raising of PEP for men who have sex with men, which is the group most at risk of HIV transmission occurring in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="c.770W.11/1">The Department has not commissioned any recent research. A useful summary of relevant research is contained in the article Dietary Effects on Dental Disease&quot; published in volume four of the journal Public Health Nutrition (pages 569&ndash;91).</p>
	<p pid="c.770W.11/2">Although sugars are not directly related to the development of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, increased consumption could increase the intake of food energy. Energy intake in excess of energy expended can lead to obesity. In predisposed people, foods high in sugar could have undesirable metabolic effects such as elevation of blood glucose and insulin concentrations. Furthermore, sugar is the most important cause of tooth decay.</p>

	<p pid="c.771W.0/1">The Stewart Report in 2000 comprehensively reviewed the scientific literature and concluded that</p>
	<p pid="c.771W.0/2" class="indent">the balance of evidence to date suggests that exposures below [international] guidelines do not cause health effects to the general population&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.771W.0/3">More recently, Mobile Phones and Health 2004&quot;, reiterated the Stewart Report's conclusions noting that</p>
	<p pid="c.771W.0/4" class="indent">there is a lack of hard information showing that the mobile phone systems in use are damaging to health.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.771W.0/5">Both the above reports, however, recommended a precautionary approach to the use of mobile phone technology pending the availability of more robust scientific research results. The reports are available on the Health Protection Agency's radiation protection division's (HPA-RPD) website at <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.771W.0/6">The HPA-RPD periodically evaluates the worldwide scientific research relating to mobile phone technology and health including that relevant to new and emerging technologies such as third generation (3G) mobile phones. In response to the Stewart Report recommendations, the independently managed Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research (MTHR) programme is supporting a number of studies into the possible health effects of mobile phone technology in general and these are described on the MTHR website at <a href="http://www.mthr.org.uk">www.mthr.org.uk</a>. Following the results of Dutch research, in 2003, on 3G base station exposures apparently showing a health effect, the MTHR programme decided to support work at the University of Essex into the symptoms experienced by 3G base station exposures on volunteers. Similar studies of 3G exposures are also being replicated in other countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.771W.0/7">All mobile phones and base stations in this country comply with international guidelines that are based on comprehensive reviews of the scientific literature. Measurements undertaken by both the HPA and by Ofcom (<a href="http://www.ofcom.org.uk">www.ofcom.org.uk</a>) have consistently shown that exposures to radio signals from base stations, including those from 3G stations, are lower than the international guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="c.771W.3/2">Information resources in support of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunisation programme have been available for many years. Since January 2002 the Department has produced a leaflet in support of the BCG vaccination school campaign, entitled 'A guide to BCG and TB for school years 5&ndash;9' and a BCG factsheet. In October 2003, the Department produced a leaflet entitled 'BCG and your baby' to be given to parents when their babies were given BCG vaccine. All of these resources were available free from the Department's publications line and on the <a href="http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk">www.immunisation.nhs.uk</a> website.</p>
	<p pid="c.771W.3/3">The Department produced a leaflet, factsheet, poster and information card in support of World Stop TB day in March 2005, working in partnership with the charity TB Alert. These resources were sent to general practitioner surgeries, community pharmacies, NHS Direct and walk-in centres, and tuberculosis (TB) clinics and nurses. The Department also created a web page on <a href="http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk">www.immunisation.nhs.uk</a> with information on TB.</p>
	<p pid="c.771W.3/4">The chief medical officer announced changes to the BCG programme via a letter to the medical profession and primary care trusts on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July 2005</phrase>. In support of these changes an updated leaflet, factsheet, and poster were produced and sent directly to the aforementioned groups. All of these resources were aimed at raising awareness of TB, and also informing health professionals and the general public alike, of the changes to BCG policy. All these resources were also made available to order free-of-charge via the Department publications line.</p>
	<p pid="c.771W.3/5">The <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July 2005</phrase> policy changes also meant that the tuberculin skin test was given in a different way, with the Mantoux test replacing the Heaf test. The Department produced a flip chart and DVD for training purposes. These were made available to order free-of-charge via the Department publications line and sent directly to all TB clinics. Following these changes, the Department held a meeting of immunisation co-ordinators who are responsible for implementation of the BCG programme within their localities. The public information materials were shared with the co-ordinators and their views obtained.</p>
	<p pid="c.771W.3/6">The Department has also carried out public awareness testing on matters relating to TB and its control, and all information materials on TB and BCG are pre-tested with members of the public.</p>

The widespread introduction of targeted BCG vaccination means that the majority of children at high risk of tuberculosis will now be vaccinated in early life.</p>

	<p pid="c.781W.8/1">The Chief Executive of Roads Service (Dr. Malcolm McKibbin) has been asked to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="c.781W.8/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Dr. Maclcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.781W.8/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question about whether there are plans to implement toll payments for road usage in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="c.781W.8/4" class="indent">As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.781W.8/5" class="indent">You may be aware that the Regional Transportation Strategy (RTS) for NI 2002&ndash;12, whose strategic direction and underlying principles were endorsed by the Assembly in July 2002, contains no proposals to introduce road tolling in Northern Ireland. This position remains, however, the RTS did contain a commitment to monitor the impacts of fiscal demand management measures, such as congestion charging. This is reflected in both the Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan and the Regional Strategic Transport Network Transport Plan, launched by the Minister in November 2004 and March 2005 respectively, where commitments are given to review this position, in the light of experience in other parts of the UK, during the period of the Plans.</p>
	<p pid="c.781W.8/6" class="indent">Roads Service is continuing to monitor developments in the use of road user charging in Great Britain. In the last two years, for example, officials have been actively involved in the development of the Department for Transport's (DfT) Road Pricing Feasibility Study and in the out workings of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs' Lorry Road User Charging proposals.</p>
	<p pid="c.781W.8/7" class="indent">The DfT Road Pricing Feasibility Study recommended that a series of pilot local, or regional, road pricing schemes as the best way to test the various approaches to congestion charging. The DfT's Transport Innovation Fund (TIF) will be the basis for pump priming such schemes in England. We will wait with interest to see what sort of schemes may evolve from the TIF.</p>
	<p pid="c.781W.8/8" class="indent">You may be aware that the Secretary of State, in his speech to the Fabian Society on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January 2006</phrase>, stated</p>
	<p pid="c.781W.8/9" class="indent">I will . . . be ensuring that Northern Ireland is fully signed up to the work being done in other parts of the UK on congestion charging and road pricing to help tackle congestion and reduce traffic pollution.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.781W.8/10" class="indent">Roads Service is continuing to engage with the Department for Transport and the County Surveyors' Society to ensure this commitment is addressed.</p>
	<p pid="c.781W.8/11" class="indent">I hope this information is helpful</p>

EHS has not identified, on the basis of these investigations, a widespread problem of illegal disposal of toxic sludge along the border with the Republic of Ireland. There is currently one active investigation into a County Armagh site close to the border. Prosecution files have been prepared regarding two additional sites at which sludge wastes from the Republic of Ireland were deposited. Residues arising from illegal diesel laundering operations are dealt with by local government, or other statutory agencies such PSNI or HM Revenue and Customs. EHS records indicate that 170 tonnes of illegal fuel laundering waste were re-consigned for authorised disposal since January 2003. Most originated from the Armagh, and Newry and Mourne council areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.791W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-22">22 November 2005</phrase> the Urban Task Force, chaired by Lord Rogers, launched its report Towards a Strong Urban Renaissance&quot; reviewing progress to date on delivering the original task force vision set out in 1999 in its previous report Towards an Urban Renaissance&quot;. It is an independent report based on the personal experience of the Urban Task Force members on the ground, designed to stimulate public debate and encourage new thinking&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.791W.2/2">This new report acknowledges that there have been some notable successes, and that English cities are very different places from the post-industrial centres of unemployment and failing public services of 20 years ago. The report also identifies challenges to the continuation of the urban renaissance and provides recommendations on steps necessary to strengthen the progress already made.</p>
	<p pid="c.791W.2/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has welcomed the task force's new report as a useful contribution to our ongoing work on urban design and the cities and regional policy agenda, and will take full account of the report's recommendations in the context of other research and analysis undertaken by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and elsewhere. For maximum effectiveness any new approaches must also be integrated with policy developments emerging from, for example, the December 2005 EU Ministerial informal, the Government response to Kate Barker's review of Housing Supply and the consultation on the draft PPS3 document and the Code for Sustainable Homes.</p>

	<p pid="c.795W.5/1">The 2000 Act extended voting rights in relation to such persons. Previously they could not register to vote from a mental hospital. The current provisions, implemented under the Representation of the People Act 2000, do restrict a person liable to be detained under section 7 of the RPA 1983, to voting by post or proxy.</p>
	<p pid="c.795W.5/2">The good reasons in support of the current provisions include for example, whether there would be a question as to whether it would be appropriate for any particular patient at the time of an election to be given leave from hospital to vote at a polling station.</p>

This issue was also covered in more detail in the Government's Respect Action Plan. We want to make sure that we build on good practice and promote a dialogue between local people and local services by ensuring that CDRPs hold regular face the people&quot; briefings&mdash;question and answer sessions open to the public, media and community groups.

	<p pid="c.804W.15/2">On part <i>(b)</i> there are a number of safeguards for communities during these investigations. The Government guidance for local agencies dealing with child protection, 'Working Together to Safeguard Children' (1999), makes clear that they should consider the needs of other children who may be affected, (e.g. siblings and other children in contact with alleged abusers), when planning how inquiries should be handled and deciding what action is needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.804W.15/3">More recently, The Sexual Offences Act 2003 provided for risk of sexual harm orders (RoSHOs) which are civil, preventative orders that the police can apply to a magistrates court for in respect of a person over the age of 18 who, on at least two occasions, has engaged in sexually explicit conduct or communication with a child or children under the age of 16. The defendant may or may not have a conviction for a sexual or any other offence. The order may contain any prohibitions that the court considers appropriate but typically would include prohibitions on unsupervised contact with children.</p>
	<p pid="c.804W.15/4">In November 2005 the Department for Education and Skills published guidance on dealing with allegations of abuse against teachers and other staff, which was developed in co-operation with the Home Office and Crown Prosecution Service. The guidance is intended to provide effective protection for children, but at the same time to support school staff by ensuring that cases are dealt with as fairly and quickly as possible. It includes indicative target time scales for different parts of the process.</p>
	<p pid="c.804W.15/5">The Government plans to extend this approach to cover people who work with children in other settings. Implementation will be overseen by the Local Safeguarding Children Boards, to be set up in all local authority areas by April 2006. The guidance can be found at: <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/teachernet/childprotection">www.dfes.gov.uk/teachernet/childprotection</a></p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-03-01c.47497.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-03-01c.805W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1802" speakername="Hazel Blears" colnum="805W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060301/text/60301w32.htm#60301w32.html_spnew7">
	<p pid="c.805W.2/1">Closing the Gap was informed by a confidential national assessment of police forces carried out by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. The assessment was conducted against standards for the delivery of protective services which were agreed with ACPO and piloted in a number of forces. The forces included both metropolitan and rural forces to give a representative sample and to ensure that standards were applicable to both.</p>
	<p pid="c.805W.2/2">The national assessment was that no force achieved the highest standard overall, and only the two largest forces (in terms of officers) were rated as demonstrating significant proactive capability overall. On the basis of their analysis, which addressed the delivery of policing in all existing forces, HMIC recommended a reconfiguration to strategic forces of 4,000 or more officers as the best business solution&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.805W.2/3">The primary focus of restructuring is to improve the delivery of policing in all areas and to effectively protect the public. The creation of strategic forces with improved capacity and resilience will help to safeguard local policing by reducing the need to abstract officers from neighbourhood policing teams, and by allowing for greater investment to pro-actively address some of the level 2 criminality which in turn can impact on local neighbourhoods. This will improve the policing service to all communities, both rural and non-rural.</p>

	<p pid="c.807W.0/1">The Home Office Trends in Crime model is an empirical model which attempts to explain annual changes in recorded crime in England and Wales by reference to annual changes in a number of economic, demographic, and criminal justice variables. It has been developed by joint external and internal research effort with the purpose of providing the Home Office with a tool for identifying those determinants of crime that are both within and outside of its control.</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.0/2">The model is robust, but highly aggregated. As such it cannot account for all the factors that impact on crime rates. It has nonetheless demonstrated that economic and demographic factors have been important determinants of changes in crime over time.</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.0/3">The model has not been used to attribute annual changes in crime to each of the explanatory variables. However, the model predicts that, if other factors remain constant, a permanent 1 per cent. increase in the growth rate of consumption expenditure reduces the growth rate of crime by about 1.7 per cent. On a similar basis, an increase of 1 per cent. in the growth rate of the proportion of young males in the population would increase the growth rate of crime by about 0.5 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.812W.5/1">The information is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="c.812W.5/2"><i>(a)</i> Elder abuse is not a recorded offence category and incidents of elder abuse could be recorded under various offence categories (e.g. serious wounding, common assault, harassment, criminal damage etc). Elder abuse, depending on the specific nature of the incident, can be classified as domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="c.812W.5/3">Although domestic violence is also not a recorded offence category, police forces are asked to 'flag' domestic violence incidents as they are assessed on their pro-active response to domestic violence incidents through the Police Performance Assessment Framework (PPAF).</p>
	<p pid="c.812W.5/4"><i>(b)</i> No Secrets&quot;, jointly published by the Department of Health and the Home Office in 2000, provides a complete definition of abuse and a framework for councils to work with the police, the NHS and regulators to tackle and prevent abuse occurring. It was the product of a multi-agency steering group, led by the Department of Health, with the full co-operation of the Home Office, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Directors of Social Services, the voluntary sector and academic bodies. The aim of No Secrets is to ensure that key local agencies, particularly but not solely health, social services and the police, are able to work together to protect vulnerable adults from abuse, by developing local multi-agency policies and procedures. No Secrets gives local councils the lead for development of adult protection committees. A copy is available in the Library.</p>

This includes charges for the depreciation and amortisation of capital assets purchased during the set-up of the scheme. Additionally, not all assets required to set up and deliver the scheme will be purchased up front, some will be charged by regular payments over time, and these charges are also included in the figure of &pound;584 million.</p>

A name is one element of a person's identity, but there are others such as date of birth, address and, with the development of technology, biometric information which can uniquely identify an individual. We are committed to reducing identity fraud and this is one of the reasons why we want to establish a national Identity Cards Scheme. The scheme will utilise biometrics and provide people with a highly-secure means of protecting their identity.</p>

	<p pid="c.822W.11/1">Parenting is strongly relevant to juvenile antisocial and criminal behaviour and can be associated with increased risk or it can be a factor which protects children and young people from being involved in such behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="c.822W.11/2">There is evidence, particularly from the United States, that parenting interventions which include the improvement of parenting skills can be effective in reducing antisocial and criminal behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="c.822W.11/3">An independent evaluation of the Youth Justice Board's parenting programme included parents who were subject to parenting orders. This evaluation, published in 2002, found that most parents valued the parenting programmes they had undertaken and wished they had received such support earlier. The study observed a reduction in offending but the lack of a comparison group meant that this could not be attributed to parenting programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.822W.11/4">Youth Offending Teams have adapted programmes underpinned by evidence of effectiveness and some have developed their own programmes based on such evidence. Since 2002 the Youth Justice Board has introduced an effective practice quality assurance review process as part of a management system to improve the quality and volume of parenting interventions being delivered by Youth Offending Teams.</p>

	<p pid="c.828W.5/1">At present, all police forces in England and Wales pay pensions to retired officers from their general funding. This arrangement suffers from volatility and does not enable the cost of pensions in payment to be kept separate from operating costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.828W.5/2">With effect from April 2006, a new system of financing police pensions will be introduced in England and Wales, based on officers' contribution and a new employer contribution that will be paid by the police authority into a separate pensions account. Any shortfall in the account will be met by central Government, which will also receive any surplus. The new system will protect police forces' operational capability by ensuring that any future rise in the cost of pensions as a result of increased numbers of pensioners will not be paid for at the expense of policing.</p>

	<p pid="c.836W.5/1">Parenting is a core element of the Respect programme and is essential for creating a strong society based on mutual respect. Over the next two years we will invest an additional &pound;52 million to start a national programme of change in the way that public services respond to parents.</p>
	<p pid="c.836W.5/2">Nationally all local authorities will receive funding through the roll-out of children's centres and extended schools&mdash;a key aim within this being to improve parenting provision. The Respect programme will also include investment in early intervention measures to support vulnerable children and young people and their families, including pathfinders which develop leading practice in supporting parents.</p>
	<p pid="c.836W.5/3">A further &pound;28 million of new funding will be used to set up a national network of intensive family support programmes. Intensive family support projects will be available in areas where they are needed. They will provide intensive parenting support to the most problematic families that are targeted by the projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.836W.5/4">To support parenting professionals a National Parenting Academy will be established to ensure that they have the necessary skills to delivery high quality parenting support.</p>
	<p pid="c.836W.5/5">Further announcements on these projects will be made shortly.</p>

To meet the resource needs of the Probation Service under the new sentencing framework of the 2003 Act, most of the provisions of which were implemented in April 2005, Probation Officer numbers rose from 6,376 in September 2004 to 6,529 by September 2005 and are projected to rise again to 7,244 by September 2007. By this time the new custodial sentence of Custody Plus will be in operation, completing implementation of the new sentences. Current Probation Officer projections go as far as September 2009 and a figure of 7,344 by that date. Numbers of the more junior practitioner grade of Probation Service Officer are also increasing significantly.</p>
