	<p pid="b.1728W.6/1">The vaccination of poultry offers potential benefits in disease control, but currently available vaccines are too limited to provide a general solution. Crucially, although these vaccines protect against disease, they will not prevent birds from becoming infected and shedding virus, hiding the symptoms of disease.</p>

	<p pid="b.1730W.6/2">In 2001, Defra granted &pound;10,000 to create the Heritage Gene Bank which was set up to preserve semen and embryos from breeds considered to be at-risk due to the FMD outbreak of the time. The Herdwick was one of those breeds considered to be at-risk because the majority of its breeding population were in or near to areas heavily affected by FMD.</p>
	<p pid="b.1730W.6/3">Defra recognises the need to have a long term view on managing the genetic health of our livestock breeding population and the need for a co-ordinated effort to support initiatives that will encourage the characterisation, conservation and utilisation of our livestock genetic resources&mdash;which includes rare, mainstream and heritage livestock breeds. The National Steering Committee for Farm Animal Genetic Resources is about to report to Ministers with a national action plan to identify what the Government, industry stakeholders and other organisations can do to improve the management of Farm Animal Genetic Resources and this plan will help inform our future policy in this area.</p>

	<p pid="b.1731W.8/1">Digital switchover does not require any equipment to be thrown away. However, as the regulatory impact assessment on the timing of digital switchover acknowledges, there may be a temporary acceleration in the disposal of some secondary televisions that people choose not to adapt after switchover in each region. In light of this, Defra and the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) have jointly commissioned the Market Transformation Programme to establish and quantify any changes in patterns of disposal of consumer equipment, including televisions, due to digital switchover. This project is due to report in June.</p>
	<p pid="b.1731W.8/2">Televisions disposed of following digital switchover will be subject to regulations implementing the EU Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment (WEEE) Directive, which aims to prevent electronic and electrical waste and promote reuse, recycling and other forms of recovery in order to reduce the amount of such waste going to landfill. The directive requires producers, or those acting on their behalf, to set up systems for treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE.</p>
	<p pid="b.1731W.8/3">Transposition of the majority of the WEEE directive is the responsibility of the DTI. However, Defra is drawing up regulations amending the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994, to transpose the treatment-permitting requirements of article 6 of the directive. Defra also intend to introduce exemptions from the need to obtain a waste management licence for those storing waste electrical equipment prior to its recovery and those repairing such equipment to promote its reuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.1731W.8/4">These regulations will help ensure that less waste electrical equipment ends up in landfill. They will also help to ensure that more of it is either reused or recycled in an environmentally sound manner.</p>

	<p pid="b.1736W.5/39">2. Data based on ticketing system supplied by the train operator. All such data may be subject to adjustment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1736W.5/40">3. The Esk Valley line was used by passengers on trains run by the North Yorkshire Moors Railway during the summer of 2005 this adds approximately 5,000 to the total passengers shown in the table).</p>
	<p pid="b.1736W.5/41">4. The St. Ives line figures as presented have been adjusted to account for a ticketing system error which led to an under-reporting of journeys in financial years 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="b.1736W.5/42">5. Several lines have had periods of closure for engineering work. These include closures of a week or more on the Esk Valley and West Country branches and a closure to allow the commissioning of the new link between the Skegness Line and the East Coast Main Line last Autumn. These closures can reduce loadings significantly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1736W.5/43">6. The number of trains used to calculate the average number of passengers per train is based on an analysis of the public timetable and generally reflects trains running the whole length of the line with the following exceptions:</p>
	<p pid="b.1736W.5/44">St. Ives includes trains terminating at Lelant Saltings</p>
	<p pid="b.1736W.5/45">Tamar Valley includes trains terminating at Calstock</p>
	<p pid="b.1736W.5/46">Skegness is based on all trains on the section of line east of Grantham (some start/terminate at Boston or Sleaford) (as the Middlesbrough&mdash;Nunthorpe services do not run the whole length of the Esk Valley these are also excluded).</p>
	<p pid="b.1736W.5/47">7. No allowance is made for engineering closures or other similar disruption. Where buses are included in the public timetable rail tickets are valid on the bus, these are included trains for the purposes of calculating the averages.</p>

	<p pid="b.1740W.10/1">Based on the UK's experience of the recent accession of eight countries in May 2004, the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union is likely to make a positive contribution to growth of the UK labour force and employment. It is very difficult to estimate the exact impact on employment trends and public expenditure of potential migration flows from Bulgaria and Romania, and even more difficult to estimate these impacts at the sub-regional level. However, some assessment can be made based on UK experience, particularly from the accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Slovenia in May 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1740W.10/2">With respect to the labour market, since May 2004 employment levels in the UK have risen to record highs, in part due to the expansion of the work force from immigration. A paper entitled The Impact of Free Movement of Workers from Central and Eastern Europe on the UK Labour Market&quot; (2006) published by the Department for Work and Pensions, suggests that the impact of migration from the new EU member states has been broadly positive, reflecting the flexibility and speed of adjustment of the UK labour market. The authors also found no discernible statistical evidence supporting the view that the inflow of A8 migrants is contributing to a rise in claimant unemployment in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1740W.10/3">With respect to potential effects on public expenditure, evidence from the most recent Home Office Accession Monitoring Report suggests</p>
	<p pid="b.1740W.10/4" class="indent">nationals from the Accession 8 countries continue to come to the UK to work, contributing to the success of the UK economy, whilst making very few demands of our welfare system or public services.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.1741W.2/1">The most recent information available that allows assessment to be made of the number of households with no access to a bank account is the family resources survey from 2002&ndash;03. This indicates that 8 per cent. of households in the United Kingdom had no bank account of any kind. This equated to 1.9 million households containing around 2.8 million adults. The data are broken down to Government Office regional level. This shows 10 per cent. of households in the West Midlands were unbanked.</p>
	<p pid="b.1741W.2/2">In 1997&ndash;98, the family resources survey was collected on a Great Britain basis, excluding Northern Ireland. 9per cent. of households in the West Midlands were unbanked at that time compared to 8 per cent. of households in Great Britain as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.1741W.2/3">In December 2004, the Government and the banks agreed to work together towards the goal of halving the number of adults in households with no access to a bank account of any kind and of making significant progress within two years. The Financial Inclusion Taskforce has been asked to monitor progress. The taskforce recently made its first annual report, which concluded that steady progress has been made towards the goal but also encouraged banks to continue to address the difficulties faced in opening a bank account.</p>

	<p pid="b.1743W.2/1">The Treasury does not provide any nursery or cr&egrave;che facilities. The Department is a member of the Westminster holiday play-scheme, which operates during school holidays and is open to children aged four years and nine months up to 12 years of age. The Treasury has two bespoke play-scheme rooms, which can cater for up to 18 children. The cost per child is &pound;24.89 per day and the Treasury subsidises the costs by 51.78 per cent. The total subsidy to Treasury parents using the play-scheme from February 2005 to February 2006 inclusive has been &pound;8,947.</p>
	<p pid="b.1743W.2/2">The Treasury also supports the child care cost of eligible staff. Staff who work full-time receive child care vouchers up to the value of &pound;40 per week per family, part-timers receive a pro-rated amount. Currently 103 members of staff receive child care vouchers. The cost of child care vouchers, since the scheme was introduced in January 2004 up to and including April 2006 is &pound;354,300.</p>

	<p pid="b.1748W.6/2">Yesterday we laid amendments to Chapter 6, Part 15 of the Bill in order to give effect to changes to the content of companies' business reviews. As part of our proposals, we also intend to clarify the position on liability for disclosures under the Companies Act and for implementation of the EU Transparency Obligations Directive. Draft clauses on a proposed regime for liability have been published via the DTI website (at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/cld/facts/clr.htm">http://www.dti.gov.uk/cld/facts/clr.htm</a>) for a short period for public comment. This package of proposals represents consistent and balanced policy after considering carefully the responses to the consultation and engaging in discussion with interested parties on the whole range of options for narrative reporting.</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.6/3">The requirements for narrative reporting have been streamlined so that the requirements for quoted companies are closely aligned to those for unquoted companies. The proposed new narrative reporting arrangements include the requirement that all companies will need to produce a business review, as required by the EU Accounts Modernisation Directive. The amendments make clear that the purpose of the review is to inform shareholders of the company and help them assess how the directors have performed their duty under section 156 (duty to promote the success of the company). Quoted companies will need to ensure that, to the extent necessary for an understanding of the development, performance or position of the company's business, their business review includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.6/4" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development, performance and position of the company's business; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.6/5" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> information about:</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.6/6" class="indent">(i) environmental matters (including the impact of the company's business on the environment),</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.6/7" class="indent">(ii) the company's employees, and (iii) social and community issues, including information about any policies of the company in relation to those matters and the effectiveness of those policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.6/8" class="indent">Directors will need to state in their Review if they do not think it necessary to include information about (i), (ii) or (iii) above.</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.6/9">The new system will also mean that for all companies:</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.6/10" class="indent">Auditors will continue to be required to report on the consistency of the directors' report with the annual accounts (as is required by the Accounts Modernisation Directive) but there will not be any additional requirement to check for other inconsistencies;</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.6/11" class="indent">All companies will be exempted from disclosing in the business review information which is seriously prejudicial to the company's interests. This exemption was previously only provided for companies that had to produce an OFR; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.6/12" class="indent">There will be no statutory reporting standards for the Business Review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.6/13">The draft clauses on liability cover:</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.6/14" class="indent">Provision for liability under Part 15 of the Bill for directors' reports, directors' remuneration reports or summary financial statements derived from them;</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.6/15" class="indent">Provision for liability for disclosures under Transparency Obligations Directive implementation;</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.6/16" class="indent">Liability for untrue or misleading statements or omissions made in bad faith or recklessly or where there is deliberate and dishonest concealment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1748W.6/17">The Government's aim has always been to encourage meaningful strategic, forward-looking information to assist shareholder engagement, while avoiding disproportionate burdens on business. The Government have decided that the additional burden imposed by the statutory OFR requirement is not justified in light of the competitiveness of UK businesses. The changes to narrative reporting requirements announced yesterday will add value to the quality of reporting without imposing unnecessary costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1749W.5/2">The Company Law Reform Bill contains a power to enable my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State through secondary legislation, to prescribe, stand-alone model articles for different types of company. The model articles are to replace the Companies Act 1985 Table A for companies formed under the Bill and we intend to make sure that regulations made under this power will be in place by the time that the Bill comes into force.</p>
	<p pid="b.1749W.5/3">A draft of the model articles for private companies limited by shares, and draft guidance notes on those model articles, was published in the March 2005 White Paper and we will shortly publish a draft of the model articles for public companies. We will then turn to the draft model articles for private companies limited by guarantee.</p>
	<p pid="b.1749W.5/4">We look forward to receiving comments on the draft model articles for public companies and are working with interested parties to make sure that the final versions of the various model articles are both useful and relevant to people who rely on the model articles: the owners and managers of companies. There will be full public consultation before regulations are made.</p>

The purpose of both these obligations is to enable a release of stocks onto the global oil market when there is collective agreement that this is necessary. The release of stocks following Hurricane Katrina by EU and other states, co-ordinated through the IEA, showed that the system was able to respond well to the disruption which occurred.</p>

	<p pid="b.1754W.8/1">The Northwest Regional Development Agency is working with Blackpool borough council to retain TVR within the immediate vicinity. They are working on the latest requirements outlined by the company. A previous specific offer of new premises was rejected and a more suitable location has now been identified. TVR has indicated that this offer is more in line with their future operational requirements and further discussions will take place next week, when Mr.Smolenski, the owner of TVR, next visits Blackpool.</p>

	<p pid="b.1757W.0/1">Equal pay audits or reviews can identify unlawful pay inequalities between men and women. The Equal Opportunities Commission has developed a useful toolkit which describes a model equal pay review process. This is available on their website at <a href="http://www.eoc.org.uk">www.eoc.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1757W.0/2">The merits of equal pay reviews in addressing the gender pay gap were most recently independently examined by the Women and Work Commission. The commission found that there were pros and cons to undertaking an equal pay review depending on the issues or activities which have most potential impact on women's opportunities and pay in a particular company or sector. For example, there may not be any unlawful inequality in pay between men and women but greater access to flexible working could enable more women to reach higher and better paid positions in an organisation or company.</p>

	<p pid="b.1757W.7/2">By the end of 2007&ndash;08 the Department will have committed &pound;455 million through the standards fund to the AST programme, made up of &pound;310 million in government grant and &pound;145 million in required local authority contributions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1757W.7/3">Since April 2004 the level of grant funding specifically for ASTs has been fixed nationally to reflect the number of posts in existence in each local authority at the start of that financial year. New local funding flexibilities mean that schools and local authorities can chose to fund additional AST posts either using delegated funding or other appropriate grant funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.1757W.7/4">In addition to this the Department funds the external assessment of teachers against the AST standards which applicants for AST posts must meet. Total funding for AST assessment up to and including financial year 2004&ndash;05 is &pound;3.4 million. Figures for 2005&ndash;06 are not yet available.</p>

	<p pid="b.1764W.8/1">While the ultimate responsibility for considering the professional suitability of recruits lies with the individual governing bodies and with the local authorities as the employers of teachers, the Department plays a key role in supporting them in this process. We have provided comprehensive guidance highlighting the importance of thorough checks on anybody who will be working in schools, emphasising the need for governing bodies and local authorities to employ appropriate rigour in ensuring unsuitable people cannot obtain positions in our schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1764W.8/2">All initial teacher training providers are required to interview applicants for teacher training, enabling them to explore their personal qualities and potential to meet the professional values and practices of those aspiring to teach. These values include respect for other people, a positive attitude towards learning, respect for cultural diversity and social responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.1764W.8/3">The Terrorism Act which gained royal assent on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March</phrase> makes it an offence to 'encourage terrorism' and we have made it clear in successive guidance that CRB checks are strongly recommended as part of the appointment process on anybody who will be working in schools. In addition, the Secretary of State recently announced that existing arrangements will become compulsory for schools through proposed amendments to regulations to be made under sections 35 and 36 of the Education Act 2002 (and section 72 of the School Standards and Framework Act (SSFA) 1998)&mdash;this will affect amendments to the current School Staffing (England) Regulations 2003 and will make an 'on appointment' CRB check compulsory for all new appointments to the schools workforce.</p>
	<p pid="b.1764W.8/4">We place great trust in the professionalism and dedication of teachers and the wider school workforce and expect that they will leave personal prejudices at home. Where we find that teachers have not behaved professionally the General Teaching Council (GTC) has the necessary power to remove those teachers from schools. Through their Statement of Professional Values and Practices and their Code of Conduct and Practice for registered teachers they have the means to ensure that a person espousing support for terrorism could be prevented from entering the profession or, if already a registered teacher, called before a disciplinary hearing. The sanctions available to the GTC include prohibition from practice as a registered teacher.</p>

	<p pid="b.1765W.2/1">A decision by an educational establishment on whether or not to appoint an individual into its workforce should take into account, in addition to a list 99 check, the standard previous employers' references, qualifications check and (in the case of teachers) General Teaching Council for England registration, as well as a criminal records check from the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB).</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.2/2">Individuals who have been convicted of certain offences will be automatically barred from working with children in an education setting, under the Department's list 99. In other cases, the Secretary of State, taking advice from Sir Roger Singleton's expert panel, may decide to bar an individual convicted of other offences, even if those offences do not result in an automatic bar.</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.2/3">Where an individual is not barred from working with children in an education setting, and following receipt of the CRB disclosure, an offer of employment is at the discretion of the employer. The Department cannot advise employers whether or not they should employ a particular person but in deciding the relevance of convictions current guidance <sup>1</sup> states a number of points should be considered:</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.2/4" class="italic">The nature of the offence</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.2/5">In general, convictions for sexual, violent or drug offences will be particularly strong contra-indications for work with children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.2/6" class="italic">The nature of the appointment</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.2/7">Often the nature of the appointment will help to assess the relevance of the conviction. For example, serious sexual, violent, drug or drink offences would give rise to particular concern where a position was one of providing care. Driving or drink offences would be relevant in situations involving transport of children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.2/8" class="italic">The age of the offence</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.2/9">Offences which took place many years in the past may often have less relevance than recent offences. However, convictions for serious violent or sexual offences or serious offences involving substance abuse are more likely to give cause for continuing concern than, for instance, an isolated case of dishonesty committed when the person was young. The potential for rehabilitation must be weighed against the need to protect children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.2/10" class="italic">The frequency of the offence</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.2/11">A series of offences over a period of time is more likely to give cause for concern than an isolated minor conviction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.2/12">The CRB has also produced guidance for employers on judging the suitability of applicants.</p>

	<p pid="b.1766W.2/1">The Department has reduced the number of websites for schools over the last 2 years. It now manages just three main portals (TeacherNet, GovernorNet and the Standards Site) which contain important information and resources for members of the schools workforce. Extensive work is currently being undertaken to rationalise and migrate these three portals into a single new online service. This is due to be fully completed in mid-2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1773W.5/17">The MRC does not normally allocate funds to particular topics. Research proposals in all areas compete for the funding available. When appropriate, high quality research in particular areas of strategic importance may be given priority in competition for funds, but research excellence and importance to health continues to be the primary considerations in funding decisions. The MRC always welcomes high quality applications for support into any aspect of human health and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.1776W.5/1">The new general medical services contract was introduced in April 2004. Part of the contract is the quality and outcomes framework (QOF), which rewards practices for the work they do rather than simply the number of patients they treat. High achievement in the first year of the QOF (over 91 per cent., average achievement of points) means that patients are receiving a higher standard of care and treatment from their local general practitioner practices.</p>
	<p pid="b.1776W.5/2">Research by the national primary care research and development centre at the University of Manchester (published in the Journal of Quality and Satisfaction in Healthcare in 2004) shows that significant health gains could result from achieving the quality targets in the QOF. The research estimated the amount of cardiovascular events, including heart attack and death, which could be prevented over five years in a general practice population of 10,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1776W.5/3">Reaching the cholesterol reduction targets could prevent, in an average practice, 15 events in people with coronary heart disease, seven events in people with a history of stroke and seven events in people with diabetes. Achieving blood pressure control targets in hypertensive patients without those conditions could prevent 15 cardiovascular events.</p>
	<p pid="b.1776W.5/4">The amount of health gain is sensitive to current quality of care, prevalence of conditions and risk factors. Nevertheless, it is clear that achievement of QOF targets across the country could prevent thousands of serious events, including deaths, from cardiovascular disease.</p>

	<p pid="b.1777W.2/1">In 1988, a special payments scheme was introduced for haemophiliacs infected with HIV through blood products. This scheme is administered by the Macfarlane Trust. In 1991, as part of a settlement of court proceedings a further lump sum payment was made under the scheme for haemophilia patients infected with HIV. From that time, all beneficiaries of the Trust have been required to sign a waiver undertaking not to take legal action against the Department or any other public body in respect of infection from HIV, or hepatitis viruses. It is usual in litigation that when a settlement is reached, claimants cannot then reopen the proceedings.</p>

	<p pid="b.1778W.2/1">Applications to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for product licences should be handled within the timescales established by legislation. The medicines directive implemented into United Kingdom legislation requires us to take all appropriate measures to ensure that authorisation procedures are completed within 210 days of submission of a valid application.</p>
	<p pid="b.1778W.2/2">However, the legislation also establishes additional timescales, which must be met where the authorisation is to be granted following European procedures amongst one or more other member states or within the entire community. For example, within the so-called mutual recognition procedure, we must make sure to have completed our scientific evaluation within 90 days. And within the community-wide centralised procedure, we must complete our scientific assessment within 80 days.</p>
	<p pid="b.1778W.2/3">These tighter European procedural timescales do dictate that such applications receive some priority within the MHRA since to do otherwise might mean that we were obliged to allow marketing of the product in the UK regardless of any concerns we may have for its quality, safety or efficacy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1779W.5/1">Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of a naturally occurring hormone (prostaglandin). As a licensed medicine, the uses and effects of misoprostol are evaluated by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p>
	<p pid="b.1779W.5/2">Misoprostol is licensed for the treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal ulcers induced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It can be given alone, or combined with NSAIDs such as diclofenac or naproxen, and is effective in reducing gastric acidity, which may be the cause of ulcers. Misoprostol is especially suitable for the frail and elderly who need to take long-term NSAIDs for arthritic conditions, and who are therefore at risk of ulcers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1779W.5/3">As with all medicines, misoprostol may be associated with side effects in some patients, and safety is continually monitored by the MHRA. The known side effects of this drug are described in product information for healthcare professionals and patients. When used for the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal ulcers, the recognised adverse effects of misoprostol include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia (indigestion), flatulence, nausea and vomiting, skin rashes and dizziness. As prostaglandin hormones also have effects on the lining of the uterus in women, misoprostol can also lead to vaginal bleeding.</p>
	<p pid="b.1779W.5/4">Doctors may decide to use a medicine outside the terms of the marketing authorisation, on their own responsibility, if they consider that it is in the best interests of their patients. Unlicensed uses of misoprostol include the induction of labour and medical abortion, where it is sometimes used in combination with other drugs such as mifepristone. This is in line with the advice of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in its evidence based clinical guideline. Side effects of misoprostol in unlicensed indications have been documented to include abnormal uterine contractions and haemorrhage, retained placenta, release of amniotic fluid into the circulation (embolism), incomplete abortion and premature birth.</p>

	<p pid="b.1780W.5/1">Since its inception in 1998, NHS Direct has grown from small-scale pilot sites to a substantial national service. The increased funding reflects the increased popularity of the service and the wider range of services provided. For example, the NHS Direct telephone service, launched in 1998, and nationally available from 2000, is now complemented by the NHS Direct Online website (1999) and the NHS Direct Interactive digital TV service (2004).

	<p pid="b.1783W.6/1">Our current plans are to aim to launch the next sexual health campaign later this year. This will target 16 to 34-year-old men and women but with a concentration on the key 16 to 24 year age bracket. The campaign will focus on the risks of unprotected sex and the benefits of using condoms to avoid sexually transmitted infections including HIV and unintended pregnancies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1783W.6/2">Also, the national chlamydia screening programme provides opportunistic screening for genital chlamydia infection and is offered to all sexually active women and men aged between 16 and 24 years old attending a variety of health and non health care settings in England. Every young person who accepts a chlamydia test is given an information leaflet which explains that using condoms every time they have sex can reduce the risks of getting or passing on chlamydia and other sexually transmitted infections including HIV.</p>
	<p pid="b.1783W.6/3">This programme is linked to the implementation of the teenage pregnancy strategy, led by Department for Education and Skills, which seeks to both encourage young people to delay early sex and to improve their access to sexual health advice and services when they do become sexually active.</p>
	<p pid="b.1783W.6/4">The teenage pregnancy strategy is achieved through a national media campaign; improved delivery of sex and relationships education in schools, and by making services more young people friendly and delivered closer to the point of need&mdash;in schools, further education colleges and other youth settings. Since the start of the strategy, the under-18 conception rate has fallen by 11.1 per cent., to its lowest level since the mid-1980s.</p>

Those organisations with a second or third year project will receive an interim amount equivalent to the first quarter payment, which will enable them to continue the project without interruption.

	<p pid="b.1784W.9/2">The UK has signed and ratified both the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict and encourages all other states to do likewise.</p>
	<p pid="b.1784W.9/3">The UK actively supports work in the UN Security Council on this issue. UN Security Council resolution 1612 of July 2005 on children and armed conflict established a mechanism to monitor and report on grave violations against children, including the recruitment and use of child soldiers and a Security Council Working Group to make recommendations to the Council on possible measures to promote the protection of children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1784W.9/4">Security Council resolution 1612 also reaffirms the Security Council's intention to consider imposing multilateral sanctions against parties to situations of armed conflict which are on its agenda and are in violation of applicable international law relating to the rights and protection of children in armed conflict. Multilateral sanctions are usually applied taking into account a broad range of factors and have already been applied in relation to several conflict situations where the recruitment of child soldiers is a serious concern, such as those arising in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Sudan and Cote d'Ivoire. Relevant Security Council resolutions also call for those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law to be brought to justice, including where appropriate by the International Criminal Court (ICC). I welcome the transfer of the first individual indicted by the ICC, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, a national of the DRC, to The Hague on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-17">17 March</phrase>. He is charged with conscripting and enlisting children under the age of 15 and using them to participate actively in hostilities. The UK also works through the EU to promote the protection of children affected by armed conflict, including through Troika de&quot;marches.</p>

	<p pid="b.1785W.2/2">Many developing countries already have poverty reduction strategies or other national poverty plans, which set the agenda for development assistance from donors. We are working with the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme both to encourage developing countries to build these poverty plans into 10-year strategies for achieving the millennium development goals by 2015; and to ensure that donors agree with partner countries the increased development assistance necessary to finance them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1785W.2/3">Longer-term planning by developing countries and support by donors is particularly important in education and health. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-10">10 April</phrase>, I and my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that the UK Government will provide $15 billion (approximately &pound;8.5 billion) funding for education by 2015. This will help to give our partner countries confidence to prepare 10 year plans to achieve the education goals. DFID will be working with governments and through existing collective donor arrangements to support the development of these plans. In particular the Fast Track Initiative for education provides assistance with education planning and long-term predictable finance in support of plans to achieve education goals. DFID has doubled the UK's contribution to the Fast Track Initiative's Programme Development Fund to &pound;5 million, and will be providing an additional &pound;100 million to the Fast Track Initiative for education over the next two years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1786W.2/1">The 25 EU member states and the European Commission are together the largest donors in Africa and in 2003&ndash;04 spent over &pound;1.4 billion on water and sanitation. The EU Water Initiative (EUWI) was created to increase the impact of this aid, by co-ordinating efforts to ensure that the sector receives appropriate political profile and increased levels of investment. This is why we have been keen to make the Initiative work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1786W.2/2">DFID has been actively involved since the outset with the EUWI but like others, has been disappointed with slow progress. We are currently working with Tearfund and WaterAid to strengthen commitment to the Initiative across the EU and in particular to improve monitoring and accountability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1786W.2/3">One of the aims of the EUWI was to catalyse additional funding for water and sanitation and the African, Caribbean and Pacific Countries (ACP)&mdash;EU Water Facility (EUWF), was established in 2004 in response to this aim. In contrast to the EUWI, the EUWF is a funding mechanism. Although progress has been slow, mainly due to lengthy procurement procedures, approximately &euro;230 million is now committed to co-fund 97 projects in ACP countries, which are valued at &euro;412 million. An initial analysis of these selected proposals by the EUWF has found that by 2010 approximately 10 million people will benefit from access to drinking water and approximately 5 million people will benefit from access to basic sanitation. A second call for proposals has been launched this year and the full &euro;500 million of the EUWF will be committed by 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1790W.2/2">Of the additional $50 billion per year by 2010, $25billion will go to Africa. The best resource needs estimates have only considered global needs to 2008 and these suggest a resource gap of around $18 billion from 2006&ndash;2008 for AIDS-related programmes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1791W.2/1">Since 2003, DFID and other donors have worked hard to restore water supplies in Iraq. We estimate that 4 million more Iraqis have access to safe drinking water than before the conflict. In most cases, the main barrier to access to safe drinking water is the condition of the pipelines, rather than the water supply itself. This is partly due to the tendency for insurgents to target water, electricity and oil pipelines, as well as the reconstruction staff working to repair them. However, the poor condition of many pipelines is primarily the result of decades of underinvestment under Saddam's regime, which has left Iraq with crumbling infrastructure in desperate need of maintenance, and a shortage of trained engineers who know how to carry out repairs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1791W.2/2">DFID's bilateral support for improving water and sanitation has been provided in southern Iraq, where our regional office is located and where UK military efforts to provide security are also focused. As Halabja is in the north of Iraq, DFID has! not been directly involved in supporting projects in the city. DFID's funding to the water sector in central and northern Iraq has been provided through the United Nations Trust Fund for Iraq, to which we contributed &pound;30 million in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1791W.2/3">Significant donors in the water sector have been the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the United Nations Development Programme, and UNICEF. The US recently completed a water well project to restore water supply to Halabja. They have also recently completed a broad assessment of the water and sewage services in Sulaymaniyah province, where Halabja is situated, to help plan future assistance to this sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1791W.2/4">In the south of Iraq, DFID is providing the following assistance to improve water and sanitation systems:</p>
	<p pid="b.1791W.2/5" class="indent">We have built a water training centre in Basra, which I opened in March this year. The training centre will help train water engineers from all four southern provinces. The expertise they gain will strengthen the ability of the local water directorates to deal with the huge amount of maintenance that is now required.</p>
	<p pid="b.1791W.2/6" class="indent">We are building three water towers in one of the poorest areas of Basra. These will ensure a steady availability of water to over 250,000 people.</p>

(This means that the number of subtypes of the virus in circulation is steadily decreasing, indicating that the immunity of the general population is increasing.)

	<p pid="b.1793W.2/51">There are two main reasons why progress on interrupting transmission of the polio virus in Nigeria is so slow. First, over decades of military rule the routine immunisation services, which should be a central component of the primary health care system, were allowed to collapse. The polio eradication effort has therefore had to depend on supplementary immunisation activities alone, with door-to-door campaigns repeated five or six times every year. However, the second reason for slow progress is that these door-to-door campaigns are not well accepted by the general population in northern Nigeria and so large numbers of children are missed by every campaign as their parents refuse to allow them to be immunised.</p>
	<p pid="b.1793W.2/52">The Government of Nigeria is firmly committed to eradicating polio and DFID is working intensely with the WHO, UNICEF and other international partners to help Nigeria address the current problems. DFID lobbied successfully for a greater emphasis to be placed on rebuilding routine immunisation services that address several childhood diseases, instead of the exclusive emphasis on polio campaigns. Routine services provided from fixed sites are much more acceptable to the general public than single- disease door-to-door campaigns. DFID Nigeria has designed a &pound;20 million project to support the reviving of routine immunisation in several low-coverage northern states. This project is expected to go live later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1793W.2/53">DFID also financed a consultative workshop in Kano in January this year which was very successful in getting key opinion leaders from across northern Nigeria to give their full support to polio eradication activities in the context of greater attention being paid to other childhood diseases at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1793W.2/54">Another recent development is the decision to convert polio-only national immunisation days into what are being termed immunization plus days&quot;. DFID and other international partners, especially the European Commission, the US Government and UNICEF, had been pressing for this for some time. During immunization plus days&quot; BCG <sup>1</sup> , DPT <sup>2</sup> and measles vaccines will be provided alongside the polio vaccine, and children will also be given vitamin A and anthelmintic <sup>3</sup> tablets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1793W.2/55">These tactics are necessary in order to increase the acceptability of the polio vaccine among the general population, especially in northern states where the transmission of the wild virus has not been checked. Children cannot be immunised against their parents' will and so it is necessary to win over people's hearts and minds so that they accept the polio vaccine. DFID is financing various advocacy initiatives in this regard, and has also funded anthropological research by the Institute of Development Studies in Sussex into the reasons for non-acceptance of the oral polio vaccine in northern Nigeria. The results of this research are now informing Nigerian government strategy at national, state and local levels.</p>

	<p pid="b.1795W.2/1">The UN currently has 23 agencies working on some aspect of water and sanitation. The agencies have different functions and only a handful have significant programmes in the provision of water and sanitation services to developing countries. Both UN agencies and donors recognise the need to improve harmonisation and have agreed a proposal for a co-ordinating body, UN Water&quot;. This will provide a mechanism for co-ordinating the work of the existing agencies. DFID is working with others to establish UN Water, and will be providing financial support to a Secretariat in the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA).</p>
	<p pid="b.1795W.2/2">DFID is also proposing that, in discussion with national governments, the UN should decide which UN agency is best placed to lead on water and sanitation in any country.

	<p pid="b.1795W.5/1">The 25 EU member states and the European Commission are together, the largest donors in Africa and in 2003&ndash;04 spent over &pound;1.4 billion on water and sanitation. The EU Water Initiative (EUWI) was created to increase the impact of this aid, by co-ordinating efforts to ensure that the sector receives appropriate political profile and increased levels of investment. This is why we have been keen to make the initiative work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1795W.5/2">DFID has been actively involved since the outset with the EUWI but like others, has been disappointed with slow progress. We are currently working with Tearfund and WaterAid to strengthen commitment across the EU and in particular to improve monitoring and accountability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1795W.5/3">The EU Water Facility (EUWF), in contrast to the EUWI, is a funding mechanism. It was established in 2004 in response to the clear need for more money in the water sector. Although progress has been slow, mainly due to lengthy procurement procedures, approximately &euro;230 million is now committed to co-fund 97 projects, which are overall valued at &euro;412 million. A second call for proposals has been launched this year and the full &euro;500 million of the EUWF will be committed by 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.1796W.2/1">Chad is one of the poorest countries in Africa. UK development aid is provided indirectly through multilateral organisations. When oil reserves were discovered in the 1990s, the industry asked the World Bank to invest in the building of a 1,070 km pipeline to carry Chad's petroleum to the Atlantic coast for export. The World Bank saw this as a unique opportunity for Chad to climb out of extreme poverty. Before it became involved, the World Bank obtained assurances that the new revenues would be used to lift the population out of deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1796W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-06">6 January 2006</phrase>, the World Bank announced that it would withhold new loans and grants to the Government of Chad and suspend disbursement of International Development Association (IDA) funds allocated to the country. The value of funds suspended was approximately $124 million. This action followed passage of amendments to the country's Petroleum Revenue Management Law by the National Assembly. These changes substantially weakened programmes to improve the lives of poor people, which the World Bank had been supporting.</p>
	<p pid="b.1796W.2/3">The World Bank offered to assist the Government to address their financial difficulties by analysing and helping to address them, including how public finances had been managed. It had also proposed a review of how the Petroleum Revenue Management Law had been implemented to identify which, if any, amendments to the law might be warranted. The World Bank has remained open to dialogue with the Government on the best ways to address their current financial crisis while protecting poverty reduction programmes. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-26">26 April</phrase>, the World Bank and the Government announced that they had completed a third round of discussions and reached an interim agreement. Based on this, the World Bank has agreed to resume some loan disbursements for education, health, community development, HIV/AIDS, agriculture, electricity, water and infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1796W.2/4">The Government of Chad have agreed to pass a 2006 budget law specifying that 70 per cent. of the oil revenues will be used for priority poverty programmes. This allocation excludes security spending, which is to be funded from general revenues. If the Bill does achieve this, as soon as the oil consortium submits payments owed, the World Bank will release one third of the total amount on deposit in the escrow account over each of the next three months, with the understanding that the World Bank and the Chad Government will work on a further, more permanent agreement during that period. The Chad authorities have also agreed to parallel actions to strengthen the monitoring, transparency and accountability of direct and indirect oil revenues and development aid.</p>
	<p pid="b.1796W.2/5">We welcome the steps which the Government of Chad have taken to restore the confidence of the international donor community. While a final agreement is still to be reached, we welcome the Government's efforts to address the issues. We believe the steps agreed provide a way forward to ensure that the people of Chad see the benefits of the aid and oil revenue their country receives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1796W.2/6">I have not discussed with the US Administration its offer of mediation in this dispute.</p>

	<p pid="b.1797W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January 2006</phrase> in Sydney, Australia and East Timor concluded the terms of a Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea&quot; (CMATS Treaty) which provides for an interim agreement to allow exploitation of the Greater Sunrise gas reservoirs to proceed while suspending maritime boundary claims for 50 years and maintaining the current treaty arrangements in place. Under this creative solution, Australia has agreed to share equally (50:50) the upstream revenues from the resource.</p>
	<p pid="b.1797W.2/2">DFID has not made a direct assessment of the impact of the discovery of oil on poverty reduction in East Timor, apart from noting that once the Greater Sunrise project proceeds, it could result in transfers of revenue to East Timor of as much as US$4 billion over the life of the project. The revenue will be paid to East Timor's Petroleum Fund, the balance of which is already around $330 million derived from the 90 per cent. share of production East Timor receives from the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA). The exact benefit to East Timor will depend on the economics of the project but we hope that it will assist in securing East Timor's development and economic stability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1797W.2/3">From the outset the Government of East Timor has pursued a rigorous approach to transparency with revenues and contracts in the public domain. The Government have conducted thorough public consultations on several initiatives on transparency and management of oil and gas revenues. Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri stated Timor's official support for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) at the Lancaster House conference in June 2003. He also set out a policy to ensure transparency. We encourage this approach which will help promote poverty reduction along with good governance and transparency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1797W.2/4">Within Africa, DFID has assessed the oil revenue management measures promoted by the World Bank in Chad and supports the Bank's efforts to ensure that these revenues are used to improve the lives of poor people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1797W.2/5">The World Bank has also promoted the adoption of the EITI in a number of resource rich African countries. We encourage this since effective implementation of the Initiative will help promote poverty reduction along with good governance and transparency.</p>

The LSC takes action to deal with people who abuse the system, including referring them to the police where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1799W.2/2">In order to improve the verification of means of applicants for civil legal aid, the LSC set up the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) in 1996. This unit considers cases of apparently wealthy individuals applying for civil legal aid. Following the successful introduction of the SIU for civil legal aid, its role was extended to cover Criminal Legal Aid from 1998.</p>

Already in the North West &pound;9.7 million has been allocated to the Open Market Homebuy scheme, delivering 340 units.</p>
	<p pid="b.1801W.12/2">Furthermore, the Government have increased investment of &pound;970 million through the Housing Corporation's Affordable Housing programme to deliver 35,000 homes by registering social landlords over the next two years. In the North West &pound;201 million has been allocated for the Affordable Housing programme for 2006&ndash;08 delivering 2,248 affordable homes for rent, 1,573 low cost home ownership options with an additional 205 improved homes for rent. In Warrington &pound;1.7 million over the same period has been allocated, providing 40 units and affordable housing in one of the most deprived wards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1801W.12/3">The scale of the task is not underestimated and that is why the Chancellor announced the establishment of a joint Office of the Deputy Prime Minister/Treasury Shared Equity Task Force in the Budget. The taskforce, led by myself and my hon. Friend financial secretary John Healey, will consider the case for Government intervention in the housing market to assist 'intermediate' households into home ownership using shared equity products. The taskforce will report at the end of the year, to inform comprehensive Spending Review decisions in summer 2007.</p>

Over 300 separate references to water ensure that planning authorities take account of the availability of water in their planning decisions, making more efficient use and re-use of water to minimise the need for new resources and avoid placing additional demands on the environment.

	<p pid="b.1806W.3/1">In May 2005 defence industry representatives attended an inaugural meeting organised by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London to discuss the concept of an International Arms Trade treaty. Since then we have engaged with industry groups as part of our regular briefings on export control issues, and in meetings to specifically discuss work towards a treaty. We will continue to do so as this initiative progresses. The industry remains supportive, judging that a treaty will create a more level playing field for export control standards.</p>

	<p pid="b.1806W.6/1">Yes. There have been frequent contacts between Government officials and private sector staff in the period since March 2003. The Government of Iraq has been fully responsible for policy on the development of its oil sector since it assumed sovereignty in June 2004. All decisions on the future of the Iraqi oil sector will be taken by the elected Government of Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="b.1806W.6/2">The UK is keen to play a role supporting the Iraqi Government as it moves forward with oil sector development. To do this we need to consult a wide range of views in order to understand the workings of the sector and the challenges it faces. To this end, we maintain contact with a range of stakeholders in order to form a UK Government view. These include non-governmental organisations, parliamentary groups, technical and constitutional experts as well as private sector groups.</p>

In the 2005&ndash;06 financial year funding from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Global Conflict Prevention Pool allocated approximately &pound;174,000 to promote peaceful co-existence between the Palestinians and the Israelis. This supported projects such as the Executive Action Team water project, which works with Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian officials to manage shared water resources to limit pollution.</p>

	<p pid="b.1808W.0/1">The United Kingdom ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1993. The United Kingdom ratified the Kyoto protocol in 2002. It is open to the Government to extend the ratification of the convention and the protocol to include overseas territories. In practice the Government would do so only at the request and with the consent of the territory concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.1808W.0/2">The Kyoto protocol's flexible mechanisms, international emissions trading, clean development mechanism (CDM) and joint implementation (JI), would be available to an overseas territory (OT) that had the UK's instrument of ratification extended to it and would therefore become part of an Annex I Party. As part of an Annex I Party it cannot host CDM projects and therefore be eligible for carbon credits since these are only available to non Annex I Parties, generally developing countries. However, it may invest in non Annex I countries and purchase credits that it could sell on the international carbon market.</p>
	<p pid="b.1808W.0/3">There is also the possibility that an OT could take part in JI projects between two Annex I Parties, but the detailed arrangements to provide for this would peed to be agreed between the Government and relevant OT.</p>

Therefore, the applicant must meet the full cost of processing an entry clearance application. The visa application fee for each category of entry clearance is the same, wherever in the world an individual applies. The application fee is payable in local currency at the consular rate of exchange, which is within 10 per cent. of the commercial rate.

	<p pid="b.1813W.0/1">The Ministry of Defence provides the following childcare support for its civilian and military employees:</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.0/2" class="indent">46 work place nurseries offering circa 1,750 full day care places for children aged three months to five years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.0/3" class="indent">36 creches (benefiting 700 children) providing occasional care and 70 pre-schools (benefiting over 2,000 children) providing education on a sessional basis, primarily for Service families.</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.0/4" class="indent">14 wrap-around care schemes for five to 12 year olds (benefiting 350 children) providing after school care to match the working day.</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.0/5" class="indent">15 holiday play schemes providing full day care for five to 12 year olds during school holidays (three are shared with other government departments) benefiting 550 children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.0/6" class="indent">Four salary plus childcare voucher schemes for civilian employees at the Army Pay Centre Glasgow, Defence Science Technology Laboratory (DSTL) staff, Warship Support Agency Rosyth and Defence Bills Agency Liverpool. The schemes benefit circa 240 parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.0/7">Within MOD responsibility for childcare is delegated to the main budget areas. Initial funding can be from a variety of sources:</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.0/8" class="indent">the central budget allocation;</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.0/9" class="indent">MOD's grant from the Civil Service Modernisation fund;</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.0/10" class="indent">local authorities;</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.0/11" class="indent">benevolent funds or raised by the parents themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.0/12">The business case then determines how much direct or indirect subsidy the MOD gives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.0/13">MOD nurseries are usually run by contractors, as commercial enterprises. Charges vary and competitive rates occur where indirect subsidies in the form of a peppercorn rent are provided. In addition about 10 per cent. of the nurseries offer direct subsidies, which can reduce the fees by around a third. Some play schemes also receive direct subsidies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1813W.0/14">MOD's four voucher schemes provide employees with varying amounts of support, ranging from a flat rate &pound;50 for after school care and &pound;75 for pre-school care per month in Liverpool to around a third of actual costs on a sliding scale for the registered care of their choice in Glasgow, Rosyth and for DSTL staff. These schemes offer the advantage of supporting parents to make their own choices about where and what type of childcare support they want for their child. In total the four voucher schemes cost the Department circa &pound;30,000 a month.</p>

	<p pid="b.1817W.2/1">Current sources of prosecutions and convictions data do not include the necessary background information to facilitate the identification of offences relating specifically to domestic violence. The PSNI have continued to improve the methods by which domestic incidents and crimes are recorded; clearance rates by PSNI District Command Unit for recorded crimes with a domestic motivation were published for the first time in June 2005 in the PSNI Statistical Report 2004&ndash;05. The report is available on the PSNI website address <a href="http://www.psni.police.uk">www.psni.police.uk</a> In 2004&ndash;05 there was a total of 8,508 recorded crimes with a domestic motivation; the clearance rate was 72.9 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1817W.2/2">Civil measures can also be taken in relation to domestic violence cases, that is, an individual can obtain a non-molestation or occupancy order. These are protective orders and not offences in their own right; however breach of such an order is an offence though it is again not possible in such instances to identify solely those which relate to domestic violence. In 2003, the most up-to-date information currently available, there were 239 persons convicted for breach of a non-molestation order and 39 convicted for breach of an occupation order.</p>

	<p pid="b.1818W.2/1">The West Belfast and Greater Shankill (WBGS) Task Forces produced a joint report in February 2002 detailing over 150 recommendations covering a wide range of issues. Early progress was made in a number of areas including work by Invest NI to regenerate the Forth River (former Mackies) complex. The Department for Employment and Learning also piloted the Targeted Initiatives programme in the task force areas, working closely with a local stakeholders' forum, the Employment Services Board.</p>
	<p pid="b.1818W.2/2">In 2004, through the Integrated Development Fund (IDF), &pound;21.7 million was allocated, subject to positive economic appraisal, to support 17 projects aimed specifically at addressing the social and economic problems in the task force areas. The economic and social environment has changed since the Task Force Report was published and, apart from the IDF initiative, there have also been a number of other policy initiatives, not least the Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy, which will have had a positive impact on the task force areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1818W.2/3">Through its Belfast Regeneration office the Department for Social Development continues to work with all sectors associated with the task force areas to tackle disadvantage in a strategic and integrated way primarily through Neighbourhood Renewal and, more recently the Renewing Communities initiative with the aim of achieving tangible outcomes in terms of community, economic social and physical renewal. The Department also continues to deliver a variety of other programmes which, while not specific to the task force area do nevertheless, impact on the Greater West Belfast and Shankill areas.</p>

In respect of houses that have been awarded, information is only available from the 2003&ndash;04 financial year. The figures for the 2005&ndash;06 year are not yet compiled.

	<p pid="b.1821W.2/1">Targeting social need, along with equality and promoting good relations, are central to the work of government. This is fully reflected in the process for determining our overall expenditure priorities and allocations through Priorities and Budget, which is consistent with the first three years of the Investment Strategy for Northern Ireland (ISNI) published in December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1821W.2/2">In formulating investment priorities during the development of the Strategy, departments gave due consideration to these principles to ensure that opportunities were taken to tackle disadvantage, and to promote equality including in the labour market and in health, education and housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1821W.2/3">As the ISNI is delivered, the opportunities to tackle disadvantage and promote equality will be kept under review as programmes and projects are rolled out. The Investment Strategy itself will be reviewed in parallel with the Comprehensive Spending Review, and in line with the development of the government's approach to tackling poverty and social need.</p>

	<p pid="b.1822W.2/1">There are no plans to collect and collate statistics on literacy levels in Northern Ireland at <i>(a)</i> ward and <i>(b)</i> sub-ward level. Measurement of literacy scores involves the administration of specific tests, and estimates of literacy levels in the population have depended on sample surveys (for example, the International Adult Literacy Survey which was carried out in Northern Ireland in 1996). Sample sizes for this type of survey are not large enough to enable the reporting of results at ward level or lower. Proxy information such as the proportion of the population with no qualifications is available at this level of detail for Northern Ireland (e.g. 2001 Census).</p>

The new works at Larne was completed in early 2006 and, in addition, Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey are scheduled for completion in mid-2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1824W.2/25">In addition work has commenced on the new North Coast WWTW to resolve compliance requirements at Portrush, Portstewart and Coleraine. In addition, Water Service is pursuing the use of Public Private Partnership investment to complement conventionally funded programmes. Initial PPP programmes for wastewater and sludge treatment, currently estimated at some &pound;122 million, are being taken forward for detailed planning and procurement.</p>

	<p pid="b.1833W.2/1">The Government have put into place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.2/2">Between March 1997 and March 2005 the number of police officers in the Metropolitan Police area increased by 4,396 from 26,677 to 31,073. The Government's introduction of community support officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 2,053 CSOs on the streets in the Metropolitan Police Service area to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Metropolitan Police will receive &pound;1,818 million in general grants for 2006&ndash;07, an increase of 3.1 per cent. (&pound;54.7 million) over the comparable figure for 2005&ndash;06. General grants funding to Metropolitan Police has increased by 20.8 per cent. between 1997&ndash;98 and 2006&ndash;7 (Figures are not directly comparable, due to boundary changes, adjustments to pay centrally for NCS and NCIS, and the transfer of pensions and security funding from general grant to specific in 2006&ndash;07. All have reduced general grant for Metropolitan Police Authority compared with 1997). In addition to general grants, Metropolitan Police will also receive an estimated &pound;394.5 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives and capital provision in 2006&ndash;07. The Metropolitan also gains &pound;5.3 million from the amending reports for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the Police Authority and the Chief Officer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.2/3">The Crime Reduction programme (CRP) was a &pound;340 million intervention programme running for three years from April 1999. Figures are not available for constituency or local level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1833W.2/4">In Islington a total of 20 Antisocial Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) have been issued (The latest figures available).</p>

	<p pid="b.1836W.2/1">The Government have put into place policies in the areas of crime reduction, antisocial behaviour, policing and active communities that are yielding considerable benefits for the constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1836W.2/2">Between March 1997 and March 2005 the number of police officers in the Lancashire Police area increased by 339 from 3,247 to 3,586. The Government's introduction of Community Support Officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 159 CSOs on the streets in the Lancashire Police Service area to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.1836W.2/3">Lancashire Police will receive &pound;187 million in general grants for 2006&ndash;07, an increase of 3.1 per cent. (&pound;5.6 million) over the comparable figure for 2005&ndash;06. General grants funding to Lancashire police has increased by 27.3 per cent. between 1997&ndash;98 and 2006&ndash;07. (Figures are not directly comparable, as adjustments to pay for NCS and NCIS centrally, and the transfer of pensions and security funding from general grant to specific in 2006&ndash;07 have reduced General Grant for Lancashire Police Authority compared with 1997). In addition to general grants, Lancashire police will also receive an estimated &pound;33.8 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives and capital provision in 2006&ndash;07. Lancashire will also gain &pound;0.6 million from the Amending Reports for 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the Police Authority and the Chief Constable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1836W.2/4">The Crime Reduction Programme (CRP) was a &pound;340 million intervention programme running for three years from April 1999.</p>
	<p pid="b.1836W.2/5">Figures are not available for constituency or local level. In West Lancashire a total of 14 antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) have been issued. (The latest figures available).</p>

	<p pid="b.1838W.5/1">The Home Office is committed to achieving the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate energy targets; namely to reduce absolute carbon, from fuel and electricity used in buildings on our estate, by 12.5 per cent. by 2010&ndash;11, relative to 1999&ndash;2000 and to increase the energy efficiency of the buildings on our estate, measured in terms of kWh of fuel and electricity use per square metre of buildings floor area by 15 per cent. over the same period.

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-05-04b.63146.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-05-04b.1842W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="1842W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060504/text/60504w32.htm#60504w32.html_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.1842W.2/1">The National DNA Database (NDNAD) currently uses SGM Plus profiling technology which tests for 10 areas of DNA (known as short tandem repeats or STRS) at each of which there are two markers (i.e. a total of 20 markers). The Government have every confidence in the SGM Plus profiling system but recognises that it should keep its reliability and level of discrimination under review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1842W.2/2">The NDNAD contains the profiles of over 3 million individuals. We are not aware of any chance match between two full SGM Plus profiles for unrelated individuals having been obtained to date. However, as the size of the NDNAD grows and as more international comparisons are made with other countries' DNA profiles, the probability, although remaining very small, will increase.</p>
	<p pid="b.1842W.2/3">Subject samples taken from persons on arrest are very unlikely to be degraded or limited in quantity. The probability of a chance match between full SGM Plus profiles from samples from two unrelated subjects is less than one in a thousand million. If the subjects are related, the likelihood of a match by chance is higher; for siblings it is of the order of one in 10,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1842W.2/4">Approximately half of all crime scene samples yield a partial profile i.e. a profile with less than 10 STR areas. This is because the DNA collected at crime scenes is either limited in quantity or degraded. Developments inDNA technology now allow DNA profiles to be obtained from small amounts of DNA although these may often prove to be partial profiles. The probability of a chance match of a partial crime scene sample profile with a profile from someone other than the true offender will vary, depending on how many markers are present in the partial crime scene profile and whether the innocent person involved in the chance match is related to the offender.</p>
	<p pid="b.1842W.2/5">Recent research studies by the European DNA Profiling Group (EDNAP) and the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI) have demonstrated that the success rate for analysis of degraded samples (which yield partial profiles) improved by using recently developed tests for markers based on shorter lengths of DNA (mini STRs).</p>
	<p pid="b.1842W.2/6">The international scientific community have agreed that the best way forward would be to develop a new test system using 13 or 16 STR areas, including some mini STRs. This would also need to take account of the divergent requirements of the different European countries. The time scale for the development and introduction of a new test system would be a commercial decision by the companies that make the new test system and it is estimated that this development could take around two years. Home Office officials are actively involved in taking forward this work which will help in obtaining fuller profiles from limited or degraded samples, hence reducing the probability of chance matches occurring.</p>

	<p pid="b.1844W.2/1">All European economic area (EEA) nationals have a right of free movement and residence in the United Kingdom. Accession state nationals are not subject to immigration control, and if they are working for less than 30 days, have no requirement to register with the workers registration scheme (WRS). As such there are no reliable estimates of the numbers of accession state nationals who have worked for less than 28 days.</p>
	<p pid="b.1844W.2/2">The WRS does not measure net migration (inflows minus outflows). Rather, it gives gross figures for the number of workers applying to the scheme. An individual who has registered to work and who leaves employment is not required to de-register, so some of those counted will have left employment and some are likely to have left the UK.</p>

On the basis of the positive evaluation findings, Ministers announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-07">7 April 2006</phrase> additional funding of &pound;2.4 million over two years to expand the excellent service provided through the POPPY scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1848W.11/1">The Prison Service makes every effort to ensure that as much purposeful activity as possible is available to prisoners and the additional workshops that are coming on stream in establishments are one example of increasing levels of activity hours available to prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="b.1848W.11/2">Purposeful activity in prisons consists broadly of education, work and resettlement activity. Specific activities include basic skills and vocational education, workshop activity, tackling substance abuse, offending behaviour programmes and pre release training. These activities reflect the work that is taking place in establishments to rehabilitate prisoners and prepare them for release.</p>
	<p pid="b.1848W.11/3">There is currently little information about the impact of imprisonment on people with mental health problems. The National Forensic Mental Health R&amp;D Programme is currently funding a research project on factors mediating the effect of prison on mental health. This is due for completion in summer 2008. Further details are available on the programme's website at <a href="http://www.nfmhp.org.uk">http://www.nfmhp.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1848W.11/4">On physical health, the National Audit Office (NAO) report Serving Time: Prisoner Diet and exercise (HC939) found that prisons met their statutory obligations to provide opportunities for exercise, and that prisoners' average level of physical exercise is close to the number of hours recommended by the Chief Medical Officer. A copy of the report is available in the Library, and on the NAO website at <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/nao_reports/05-06/0506939.pdf">http://www.nao.org. uk/publications/nao_reports/05&ndash;06/0506939.pdf</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1854W.5/1">Equal standards of behaviour are expected from both the settled community and the Gypsy and Traveller community, and the police are responsible for the investigation of crime and antisocial behaviour wherever this occurs. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Home Office have jointly published several documents which deal with enforcement against Gypsy and Traveller sites, and a specific document addressing antisocial behaviour will be issued later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1854W.8/1">When HMYOI Ashfield opened in 1999 it held both young offenders and juveniles. In February 2004 the establishment was re-roled to hold juveniles only. The increased cost per place since that time is a reflection of the more intensive regime and level of intervention that juveniles receive.</p>
