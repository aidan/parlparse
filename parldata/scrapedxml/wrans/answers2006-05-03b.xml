	<p pid="b.1556W.3/1">All children, including those with disabilities or living in difficult circumstances, should have the opportunity to fulfil their right to access and complete a good quality education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1556W.3/2">Tackling exclusion, including exclusion based on disability within the education system, is part of our work with partner governments. Copies of DFID's policy paper entitled 'Reducing poverty by tackling social exclusion' which sets out our broad based approach to tackling social exclusion across all sectors, have already been deposited in the Libraries of the House. This strategy highlights specific issues of discrimination which explain a large part of the disadvantages faced by children with a disability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1556W.3/3">DFID provides its funding for poverty reduction in support of partner governments' own plans for poverty reduction. In fulfilling our financial commitments to partner governments, including the significant commitment announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-10">10 April</phrase> that DFID will spend some &pound;8.5 billion in support of education in developing countries over the next 10 years, the UK Government have taken a significant step forward in improving the opportunity for inclusive education to become a realistic goal for partner governments. We encourage partner governments to ensure that as wide a range as possible of stakeholders participate in the consultations on national poverty reduction strategies, including groups representing disabled people. Issues of social exclusion and targeted interventions for excluded groups will be addressed in the discussions our Country Offices will have with governments on developing 10 year plans for education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1556W.3/4">DFID's social exclusion strategy also emphasises the importance of the role of civil society in tackling all forms of social exclusion and the importance of DFID's partnerships with organisations involved in advocating for the rights of disadvantaged groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.1557W.2/1">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Guide on Resource Revenue Transparency defines 45 developing countries (and eight developed countries) as rich in hydrocarbons or mineral resources. Of these, 19 countries have committed to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The Government are presently in discussion with a further ten countries who have not yet begun implementation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1557W.2/2">The Government believe that improved transparency over revenue management will bring a number of benefits to any resource rich country&mdash;in terms of improved governance, greater economic and political stability and an improved investment climate. The EITI International Advisory Group, which is supported by a Secretariat housed in the Department for International Development, is currently considering other incentives to encourage participation in EITI, and how these might be strengthened.</p>

	<p pid="b.1557W.8/1">DFID has engaged extensively with the pharmaceutical industry as part of our work to increase access to medicines in developing countries. In January 2005, we published a set of recommendations for the industry, that specifically looked at pricing policies, investment in research and development for diseases affecting developing countries, and ways of working in developing countries. These recommendations built on existing good practice in the industry. Many companies have made significant progress in making their medicines more available and affordable in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1557W.8/2">To date, our discussions have focused on major communicable diseases such as HIV, malaria and TB, and on neglected tropical diseases, such as sleeping sickness. However, discussions with the industry have also emphasised the degree to which treatments for non-communicable diseases such as cancers really should also be the subject of differential pricing offers given the significant public health needs in developing countries. There are in fact higher rates of cervical cancer deaths in Ghana than in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1557W.8/3">This is an area we will continue to work on with the industry.</p>

	<p pid="b.1558W.2/2">The Government are fully aware of the social, environmental, commercial and energy security issues associated with this project.

	<p pid="b.1560W.6/1">The Department has had discussions with both the horticultural and farming industries on this subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.1560W.6/2">The horticulture sector is making efforts on a number of fronts to reduce carbon emissions. Under the new Climate Change Agreement, growers will be entitled to an 80 per cent. discount on the levy provided they meet prescribed energy saving targets. Under the new Energy Scheme, it is possible for businesses to claim capital allowances on items such as thermal screens and insulation, variable speed pumps, certain heating equipment (including combined heat and power plant) and lighting. In addition, both Defra and the Horticultural Development Council carry out research into energy efficiency issues and the Carbon Trust (funded by Defra) provides advice and organises free energy services to assist in the identification of energy saving steps that can be implemented in nurseries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1560W.6/3">The Government are very much aware of the link between farming and the environment. The Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food (SFFS) was launched in England in 2002 and sets out the basis for a new relationship in which Government works in partnership with the farming industry in England to make farmers more market, and less subsidy focused, while managing their businesses in more environmentally and socially responsible ways.</p>
	<p pid="b.1560W.6/4">Achievements under SFFS include: CAP reform which, by breaking the link between subsidy and production, means there is no incentive to overproduce; the cross compliance element of the Single Payment Scheme where subsidies are linked to the delivery of environmental and animal welfare standards; the launch of Environmental Stewardship to which all farmers are eligible to apply to earn payments for undertaking environmental management of their land; and the launch of the Rural Developments Service Farm Advice Unit which oversees delivery of technical and environmental advice to farmers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1560W.6/5">In addition, the Department is working closely with the agricultural industry to reduce it's contribution to climate change. The Department has set up the Agricultural Change and Environment Observatory to monitor, and where possible anticipate, changes in agriculture and at farm level, and to asses consequent implications for the environment. A Stakeholder Advisory Group has been set up with the aim of advising priorities for the work of the programme, providing feedback on emerging results and their implications, identifying new and emerging areas on which the Observatory could usefully focus their work and to provide a channel of communication with a wider stakeholder community. Further information can be found on Defra's website at: <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/observatory/background.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/observatory/background.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1560W.6/6">A vital element of Defra's policy on agriculture and climate change is to raise awareness within the industry of the issues and possible actions to be taken. The Rural Climate Change Forum has been established to provide a high level forum for dialogue with Government, and authoritative advice and leadership to rural stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="b.1563W.0/1">British farming is valued for the contribution it makes to the economy and to the environment, through producing our food, safeguarding and enhancing our landscapes, and increasingly to contribute to tackling the problems of a changing world&mdash;such as meeting our energy needs. Through the strategy for sustainable farming and food, the Government have put in place a comprehensive and long-term plan to deliver a profitable and sustainable future for farming in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1563W.0/2">Key to successful delivery of the strategy is the partnership between Government and industry, based on a commitment to shared goals. Through this partnership much has already been achieved, including: the delivery of CAP reform which, by breaking the link between subsidy and production, will help bring farmers closer to their markets; the cross compliance element of the single payment scheme through which subsidies are linked to the delivery of environmental and animal welfare standards; the launch of environmental stewardship, for which all farmers are eligible to apply to earn payments for undertaking environmental management of their land; and launch of &quot;Partners for Success&quot; a regulation and charging strategy for the farming sector, through which Government will continue to work with industry to regulate better and smarter.</p>
	<p pid="b.1563W.0/3">An independent delivery group chaired by Sir Don Curry will continue to oversee and drive forward delivery of the strategy over the next three years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1564W.5/1">The Department is in regular contact with the Department of Trade and Industry to discuss a whole range of issues related to bio-energy, including the impacts on biodiversity. Most transport biofuel feedstocks will be grown in rotation as part of a mix of several crops on the farm. Production from a mix of feedstocks and replacing crops for food would have a neutral effect on biodiversity. Any replacement of spring sown break crops with winter oilseed rape would have a negative effect on crop diversity and farmland birds. If arable crops replaced natural-regeneration set-aside, this would reduce habitat diversity. In the longer term, as technology improves, straw and wood could be used for bioethanol production without significantly affecting biodiversity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1564W.5/2">Research suggests that, in comparison with arable crops, energy crops such as short rotation coppice grown for heat and power generation can encourage biodiversity, particularly for birds and insects.</p>

In order to reflect the creation of the single equality body the Commission for Equality and Human Rights and also reduce the burden to the business DEFRA has decided to do this as a joint equality scheme (JES) that will fully address both race and disability issues. The JES can be adapted to include other legislation as it comes on line, for instance gender and age.</p>
	<p pid="b.1565W.5/5">DEFRA's diversity and equality unit (DEU) wrote to all business units earlier this year seeking information on the impact of the equalities legislation on their areas of work and the actions they would take to address this. The information provided has been used to develop a draft JES, including a departmental action plan covering a three-year period from 2006&ndash;09. At the end of the three year period, DEU will have responsibility for reviewing the scheme. As a result of the review the DEU will launch a revised scheme, which will run for a further three years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1567W.2/1">A Regulatory Reform Order to amend the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 and the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 was laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March 2006</phrase>. The order is currently going through the parliamentary scrutiny process, but, if adopted, the amendments should make it easier for tenant farmers to diversify. In particular, the amendments would enable potential successors to a tenancy to carry out diversified activities on a holding with the consent of the landlord, without jeopardising the right to succession to the tenancy. The amendments should also facilitate tenant diversification by encouraging landlords to agree to improvements to the holding and by making it easier to restructure holdings held under a 1986 Act tenancy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1567W.2/2">In addition to the proposed, Defra in conjunction with the Tenancy Reform Industry Group, has published a Code of Good Practice for agri-environment and diversification projects within agricultural tenancies. This sets out a framework to help tenants and landlords come to agreement on proposals for diversification or participation in an agri-environment scheme. Where tenants and landlords are unable to agree in accordance with the Code of Good Practice, Defra has provided funding for an adjudication scheme, free at the point of use, to enable the proposal to be considered by an independent adjudicator. The adjudication scheme is administered by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. The Code of Good Practice is available on the Defra website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/tenancy/trig/trig-cogp.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/tenancy/trig/trig-cogp.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1567W.2/3">The Tenancy Reform Industry Group put forward its recommendations to Government in June 2003 and has not since put forward any further proposals for change. The Government responded to the Group's recommendations in December 2003. The Government keeps in close contact with the Tenancy Reform Industry Group on landlord/tenant issues and will continue to do so.</p>

The initiative was therefore not established as a national funding programme, but as a means of enabling regional partnerships to target towns in their region according to regionally agreed selection criteria.

	<p pid="b.1570W.2/2">No. The options for proposed changes to veterinary supervision arrangements within the meat hygiene service (MHS) are set out in the 12-week public consultation launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-11">11 April 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1570W.2/3">Development of the proposals has been informed by Professor Wall's independent inquiry into the failure of the MHS in 2004 to ensure all relevant at risk 24 to 30 month bovines had been tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and recommendations to minimise the risk of failure recurring (with three recommendations in particular directed towards improving the veterinary structure). The proposals have also been informed by two subsequent reports commissioned by the Food Standards Agency and the MHS from DNV Consulting and the independent advisory group's requirements relating to the over 30 month rule change.</p>
	<p pid="b.1570W.2/4">The various reports are publicly available and comments are invited on the proposed changes as part of the consultation process. A regulatory impact assessment will be completed in light of comments received during the consultation and from more detailed engagement with those stakeholders that are directly affected by the proposed changes, such as veterinary contractors.</p>

	<p pid="b.1573W.12/1">Accommodation charges for service personnel are recommended annually by the independent Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB), and a copy of their 2006 report has been placed in the Library of the House. Where levied, charges vary depending on the type and grade of accommodation occupied and, for service families accommodation (SFA) whether it is furnished, part furnished or unfurnished. Single living accommodation (SLA) charges include a rental element plus heating and lighting; whereas SFA charges include a rental element, but occupants are responsible for heating and lighting payments. In Germany, SFA fuel charges are protected by MOD's fuel and light scheme which aims to ensure that occupants of SFA are no better or worse off financially than they could reasonably expect in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1573W.12/2">UK civil servants, including schoolteachers, on normal tours of duty in Germany, are provided with accommodation without charge as part of their overseas terms and conditions of service. Heating and lighting are also provided without charge up to a specified annual consumption limit. Any usage over and above this limit is charged for at actual rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1573W.12/3">The exception to this is UK civil servants, including schoolteachers, specially recruited for overseas service on or after <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-01">1 September 2001</phrase>. The 2001 review of overseas terms and conditions of service withdrew the provision of free accommodation and utilities for these staff five years after taking up their appointment. The first staff affected by this rule will arise on or after <phrase class="date" code="">1 September 2006</phrase>. The charges for accommodation and utilities will be broadly the same as those that are applied to service personnel, and details of these charges are to be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1583W.2/1">The Highways Agency is responsible for about 2200 Variable Message Signs (VMS) on England's motorway and trunk road network.</p>
	<p pid="b.1583W.2/2">About 350 'information' VMS are located at key decision points (i.e. before major junctions). They are used to inform drivers about major incidents and advise diversion routes. These VMS are operated by the National Traffic Control Centre (NTCC) in Birmingham. The NTCC gathers information on conditions on the network from its control centre in Birmingham. This is a 24/7/365 operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1583W.2/3">About 1850 'safety' VMS are located mostly on motorways to manage traffic locally in the event of incidents and emergencies, and to provide warnings of slow moving or stationary traffic in order to protect queuing traffic. Operation of these signs is currently transferring from the police to the Highways Agency's Regional Control Centres (RCCs).</p>
	<p pid="b.1583W.2/4">There are seven RCCs which monitor conditions on the motorway and trunk road network within their regions of England and allocate resources such as Traffic Officers to manage incidents. They set messages on VMS for safety reasons, to inform drivers and to assist with incident management. Incidents (and VMS settings) are monitored from control rooms and messages displayed on VMS are reviewed and removed as necessary. Currently only one RCC, the West Midlands RCC, is working at full capacity and it has an established system for monitoring consistency and timeliness of sign setting to support the Agency's goal of demonstrably improving the accuracy of VMS. The system involves checking timeliness of response both when incidents are identified and when cleared. Results are used to identify and implement improvements.</p>

	<p pid="b.1584W.0/1">The Department for Transport has not made any general estimate of safe or desirable limits on peak aircraft noise for all airports.</p>
	<p pid="b.1584W.0/2">The departure noise limits at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, set by the Secretary of State, are 94 dBA Lmax between 0700 and 2300; 89 dBA between 2300 and 2330, and 0600 and 0700; and 87 dBA in the night quota period, 2330&ndash;0600. The noise limits relate to a fixed reference distance 6.5 km from start-of-roll. The full reasons for applying these limits are set out in the document 'Noise limits for aircraft departing from Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports: decision of December 2000' which is available in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1584W.0/3">At other airports noise management is the responsibility of the airport operator. All civil aircraft operating in the UK must comply with relevant international noise certification requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1584W.0/4">The Department for Transport has not set limits on equivalent continuous noise level (Leq). However, based on research, the Government use various levels of Leq as indicators of disturbance or of potential annoyance, or as criteria for mitigation measures, including advice for land use planning purposes. For example, the Government use 57 dBA Leq as the level of daytime noise marking the approximate onset of significant community annoyance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1584W.0/5">Daytime noise contour criteria for mitigation schemes were set out in the 'Future of Air Transport' White Paper. In particular, we expect operators of larger airports (those with over 50,000 air transport movements per year) to offer relocation assistance to households subject to daytime noise of more than 69 dBA Leq and to offer acoustic insulation to non-domestic noise-sensitive buildings, such as schools and hospitals, exposed to daytime noise levels of 63 dBA Leq or more.</p>

	<p pid="b.1585W.0/1">The Government sets departure noise limits at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports which are designated for the purposes of section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982. We will consider exercising similar powers at other airports if there is evidence that a major noise problem is not being dealt with adequately through local controls; otherwise, such limits are the responsibility of the airport operator.</p>
	<p pid="b.1585W.0/2">The present noise limits at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted have applied since early 2001 and have been subject to further review. The results were published in the Civil Aviation Authority's Environmental Research and Consultancy Department (ERCD) Report 0207, &quot;Departure Noise Limits and Monitoring Arrangements at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted Airports&quot;, in April 2003. The main findings were summarised in our April 2003 consultation paper on night flying restrictions, together with a broad indication of how we would take them into account. This has been taken forward in the Stage One and Stage Two consultation papers on night flying restrictions published in July 2004 and June 2005 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1585W.0/3">In the Stage Two consultation, we proposed possible changes to the departure noise limit applying in the night shoulder periods (11 pm to 11.30 pm and 6 am to 7 am). We also proposed that two additional noise monitors should be sited at Heathrow. We will announce our conclusions in due course. Copies of all the consultation papers and of ERCD 0207 were placed in the House Library.</p>

	<p pid="b.1592W.5/1">The total overall spend on all adult programmes for 2004&ndash;05 was reported in the Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) Annual Report and Accounts as &pound;2,999 million. Our planned funding for the LSC's major programmes only for adults for 2005&ndash;06 is &pound;2,942 million and for 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;2,946 million. Estimated spend on smaller programmes and experience of the previous two years suggests final funding for adults will be in the order of &pound;3.2 billion each year. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-01">1 October 2005</phrase> the Government set out their priorities for post-16 education and training. This established our priorities for the learning and skills sector and the impact on funding in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. While overall spend on adult learning will remain broadly constant the pattern of that learning will change. To meet our national priorities, we need to shift the pattern so that we provide a greater number of longer and more expensive courses for adults, to equip them with the range of skills they need for employability and further progression to higher levels of training. We have consistently said that public funding alone cannot and should not pay for all the training necessary in a competitive economy. To support this shift, there has to be a new balance of responsibilities between Government, employers and learners so we do not accept that withdrawal of LSC funding means that courses automatically have to close. Where provision is valued by learners, where it is high quality, and where learners and employers are prepared to pay more, we expect colleges to consider providing courses on a full-cost recovery basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1592W.5/2">The Department's guidance to the LSC on the deployment of its funding allocations is outlined in the Secretary of State's annual grant letter to the LSC Chairman and for 2006 to 2008 in Priorities for Success the document that sets out our funding strategy for the next two years. This document is available on the LSC's website.</p>

	<p pid="b.1599W.9/1">Current housing benefit and income support regulations require that a person must have a right to reside and be habitually resident in the United Kingdom, The Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or the Republic of Ireland (generally known as the Common Travel Area). If a person does not have a right to reside then they are not habitually resident and are not entitled to those benefits. A person who has a right to reside must also show that they are habitually resident in the Common Travel Area unless they fall into an exemption category such as EU workers. There is no set time limit for being habitually resident and each case is considered on its own merits and the claimant's individual circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1599W.9/2">From <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-30">30 April 2006</phrase> persons who claim an income-related benefit including income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, state pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit will still be required to have a right to reside as well as being habitually resident in the Common Travel Area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1599W.9/3">The Social Security (Persons from Abroad) Regulations 2006 which come into force on that date will amend the 'right to reside' aspect of the test. This is to ensure economically inactive EU nationals who only have a right to reside under Directive 2004/38/EC for the first three months of their stay in the Common Travel Area, will not be entitled to those benefits. EU work seekers will have a right to reside and once they are habitually resident will be entitled to claim income-based jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit but they will not be able to claim income support or state pension credit. EU workers will have a right to reside and will continue to be exempt from the habitual residence test.</p>

	<p pid="b.1602W.5/1">Since income support was introduced in 1988, a single person aged 18 to 24 has been paid at a lower rate than single people aged 25 and over. It would be a new initiative and not a restoration to pay single customers aged 18 to 24 at the same rate as single customers aged 25 and over.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.5/2">I am not aware of any reports that have been produced, that give consideration to payment of the full rate of income support to single young people under the age of 25.</p>

	<p pid="b.1602W.8/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. She will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.8/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Lesley Strathie</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.8/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking how many Jobseeker's Allowance applicants have taken <i>(a)</i> more than 12 days, <i>(b)</i> more than 18 days, <i>(c)</i> more than 24 days and <i>(d)</i> more than 48 days to process in the last month for which information is available; and if he will make a statement. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.8/4" class="indent">The information you have asked for is not available. Jobcentre Plus measures the time taken to process a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance as the Actual Average Clearance Time. This is measured against a Key Management Indicator which is agreed at the beginning of each year. For 2005/06, this was set at 12 working days. Latest figures show that for the year to February 2006 claims were processed in an average of 14.3 working days.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.8/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is transforming the service it provides by making it available via the telephone, via the Internet and through the personal service offered to people in Jobcentre Plus offices. With change on this scale there can be difficulties at the beginning and, as a consequence, average clearance times have increased. This is clearly causing unacceptable delays for customers and we have taken action to address the delays.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.8/6" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase> we launched a National Action Plan designed to reduce clearance times. The plan requires that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.8/7" class="indent">all delivery units work through a Health Check and address the areas where they are under-performing;</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.8/8" class="indent">senior managers regularly review and address poor performance; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.8/9" class="indent">delivery units performing below the required level develop a recovery plan to improve performance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.8/10" class="indent">Senior Operational Managers were required to provide a formal assurance at the end of February that all elements of the plan are being complied with, although it has been acknowledged that concentration on backlogs of work may initially cause average clearance times to rise. The Chief Operating Officer is monitoring performance very closely.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.8/11" class="indent">In order to focus management attention on this issue, the Actual Average Clearance Times measure, which will remain at 12 days for Jobseeker's Allowance claims, has been added to the suite of Jobcentre Plus Targets for 2006/07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1602W.8/12" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

Based on our current planning assumptions, we expect that just under one half of our financial savings will come from improvements in transactional processing, around one quarter will come from the direct payment of benefits to customers, over one quarter of savings will come from improvements in central services and around one tenth from improved value for money in procurement.

These were implemented in the United Kingdom on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January 2006</phrase>. There are new provisions on framework agreements, competitive dialogue for complex procurements, central purchasing bodies and electronic procurement methods such as e-auctions and dynamic purchasing systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1610W.5/3">The directives allow contracts to be reserved for supported factories and businesses, and provide greater clarity on the extent to which social and environmental issues can be incorporated into procurements. There is also a requirement for the mandatory exclusion of companies that have been convicted of offences related to fraud and corruption. The rules applying to purchases by utilities now incorporate an exclusion mechanism where a sector is subject to normal competition.</p>
	<p pid="b.1610W.5/4">Concerning the effects on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the new directives, and the regulations that implement them, apply rules directly to purchasers rather than to suppliers. There are, therefore, no compliance costs to business from these new rules. The new procurement methods that the rules provide for, including electronic systems, together with the simpler and clearer rules generally, reduce the burdens of the procurement process and should encourage suppliers, including SMEs, to participate in public procurement opportunities either directly or as sub contractor.</p>

	<p pid="b.1614W.2/1">We take the issue of child protection very seriously and we make every effort not to place children at risk. Where there are child protection concerns within a family whom we intend to remove, we would not remove a child with the potentially abusive family member(s). Instead will liaise with the authorities in the receiving country to see if other appropriate care arrangements can be made and to ensure that the appropriate Social Services are aware of any concerns in a particular case.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.2/2">All operational and case working staff involved in the family removal process have been advised that if an officer suspects at any time that a child is or has been the victim of abuse, the police must be alerted immediately. In such cases where a police investigation is ongoing, removal may be stayed pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings.</p>

	<p pid="b.1614W.5/1">Peterborough is one of 50 Action Areas in the country where the local authority, police and other agencies have agreed to provide a high level response to tackling antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.5/2">Peterborough Youth Offending Service works closely with Cambridgeshire Constabulary on a range of strategies and partnerships to reduce crime and antisocial behaviour by young people. These include the Prolific and Priority Offender (PPO) Strategy, joint work to reduce vehicle crime and criminal damage by young people, Safer School Partnerships (police in schools), and the monitoring of high risk young people on community sentences. In addition, Peterborough Youth Offending Service is working with the police on a Knife Amnesty and Weapons Awareness Week (w/c <phrase class="date" code="">20 May</phrase>) in support of the National Knife Amnesty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.5/3">The Police have made effective use of dispersal powers to tackle youth crime and have used these most recently in the Gladstone Street area of the town. Police will use these powers to move people on from this area when they are behaving in an antisocial way. In all cases of youth disorder the young person will be referred to an antisocial behaviour support worker, which will ensure that young people are provided with both support and enforcement to tackle and change bad behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.1614W.5/4">The Respect Action Plan is central to the Government's drive to go broader, deeper and further on antisocial behaviour by tackling its root causes; preventing it occurring in the first place for example by ensuring better parenting provision, while not letting up on stopping antisocial behaviour that blights many communities. The Respect Task Force is currently working with all Action Areas on ensuring they understand their new enhanced responsibilities in delivering the Respect Action Plan. Key partners from Peterborough will be invited to attend the forthcoming Respect Academies to hear more about how the Action Plan can best be implemented.</p>

	<p pid="b.1615W.2/1">Section 53 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Services Act 2000 introduced new provisions for dealing with the breach of various community orders. It was repealed under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which introduced a new sentencing framework including a single community order for adults, to replace all previous individual community sentences, and a new suspended sentence order. This meant that the section 53 regime was no longer appropriate. However, elements of it are incorporated in the enforcement provisions for these new sentences, including statutory warnings for failures to comply with the requirements of the sentence and the presumption of imprisonment for breach of a suspended sentence order.</p>

	<p pid="b.1616W.3/1">To highlight the need for sustained local authority action, and demonstrating that domestic violence is not an issue for the criminal justice system alone, in 2005 a revised Best Value Performance Indicator for domestic violence was published. This indicator is owned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.1616W.3/2">BV 225 aims to assess the overall provision and effectiveness of local authority services designed to help victims of domestic violence and prevent further domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1616W.3/3">The indicator covers metropolitan authorities, London boroughs, unitary authorities, district councils, council of the Isles of Scilly and the common council of the City of London. The indicator is measured as a percentage score of the number of questions to which a local authority can answer 'yes':</p>
	<p pid="b.1616W.3/4" class="indent">1. Has the local authority produced a directory of local services that can help victims of domestic violence?</p>
	<p pid="b.1616W.3/5" class="indent">2. Is there within the local authority area a minimum of one refuge place per 10,000 population?</p>
	<p pid="b.1616W.3/6" class="indent">3. Does the local authority employ directly or fund a voluntary sector-based domestic violence co-ordinator? (For district councils of fewer than 35,000 households, the responsibility for co-ordinating domestic violence can be designated within the job description of an existing senior officer. For district councils that contribute to a county-wide co-ordinator, see the BVPI definition).</p>
	<p pid="b.1616W.3/7" class="indent">4. Has the local authority produced and adopted a multi-agency strategy to tackle domestic violence developed in partnership with other agencies?</p>
	<p pid="b.1616W.3/8" class="indent">5. Does the local authority support and facilitate a local multi-agency domestic violence forum that meets at least four times a year?</p>
	<p pid="b.1616W.3/9" class="indent">6. Has the local authority developed an information-sharing protocol and had it agreed between key statutory partners?</p>
	<p pid="b.1616W.3/10" class="indent">7. Has the local authority developed, launched and promoted a 'sanctuary' type scheme to enable victims and their children to remain in their own home, where they choose to do so and where safety can be guaranteed? (For smaller district authorities, of fewer than 35,000 households this can be arranged in partnership with neighbouring authorities).</p>
	<p pid="b.1616W.3/11" class="indent">8. Has there been a reduction in the percentage of cases accepted as homeless due to domestic violence that had previously been re-housed in the last two years by that local authority as a result of domestic violence?</p>
	<p pid="b.1616W.3/12" class="indent">9. Does the council's tenancy agreement have a specific clause stating that perpetration of domestic violence by a tenant can be considered grounds for eviction? (For local authorities that have transferred their housing stock, the clause should be contained in the LSVT organisations' tenancy agreement).</p>
	<p pid="b.1616W.3/13" class="indent">10. Has the local authority funded and developed a domestic violence education pack in consultation with the wider domestic violence forum?</p>
	<p pid="b.1616W.3/14" class="indent">11. Has the local authority carried out a programme of multi-agency training in the last 12 months covering front-line and managerial staff in at least two of the following groups: housing staff, social services staff providing services in the local authority area; education staff; health staff; and front-line police officers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1620W.2/1">Assessing the true level of mobile phone theft and the false reporting of such theft is not straightforward. This is because these are not distinct offence categories. Rather they are subsumed under broader headings such as 'theft' or 'wasting police time'. As a consequence, specific figures for mobile phone theft and successful prosecutions for false reporting are not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1620W.2/2">In 2001 the Government invested in, and published, a major study of mobile phone theft (Harrington and Mayhew, 2001). Drawing on the British crime survey and youth surveys, the study estimated 710,000 mobile phones were stolen in 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid="b.1620W.2/3">The British crime survey (BCS) routinely collects information which assesses the rate of theft among adult mobile phone users. According to the latest published figures, based on the 2002&ndash;03 BCS 6.9 per cent. of adult mobile phone users had experienced a theft in the previous 12 months. Younger people, those from a black and minority ethnic background, and those living in areas of high deprivation were significantly more likely to have their mobile phones stolen.</p>

	<p pid="b.1626W.2/1">The national Violence Reduction Strategy was launched in May 2004. The national strategy requires each establishment to have in place a local Violence Reduction Strategy appropriate to needs. A whole prison approach is encouraged, with the aim of reducing violence and fear of violence. A focus on personal safety, supporting victims, and repairing the physical and emotional harm caused by violence or abuse, links closely with the suicide prevention strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1626W.2/2">Prisons are audited against Prison Service Standard 53, Violence Reduction, which identifies strengths and areas for improvement at each establishment. This evidence suggests that many establishments have implemented thorough local strategies, which were formulated with the close involvement of focus groups of staff and prisoners. A revised violence reduction strategy is planned for 2007 to reflect expected learning from the forthcoming report of the inquiry into the death of Zahid Mubarek and from a recent research study, which was undertaken to identify good practice in implementing the violence reduction strategy in the first year. There has also been an operational review of violence reduction, many of the recommendations from which have already been adopted in prisons.</p>

	<p pid="b.1628W.6/1">The public sector Prison Service launched its People Strategy in January 2006. The People Strategy will be delivered locally through Local People Plans developed from Listen to Improve groups. These are staff consultation and involvement groups to gather staff views on what should be addressed in the Local People Plan, with staff volunteering to take part. The direct costs of facilitating the Listen to Improve groups were &pound;140,500 in 2005&ndash;06 and are forecast to be &pound;222,000 in 2006&ndash;07. A breakdown of full costs, by prison establishment, could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Implementation of the People Strategy is overseen by a programme board and subject to regular review by the Prison Service's Change Management Board.</p>

The results of these interviews are currently being analysed and will inform the future development of the JES.

	<p pid="b.1631W.5/1">The UK retains two reservations from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The first of these relates to mixing of children and adults and states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1631W.5/2" class="indent">Where at any time there is a lack of suitable accommodation or adequate facilities for a particular individual in any institution in which young offenders are detained, or where the mixing of adults and children is deemed to be mutually beneficial, the United Kingdom reserves the right not to apply article 37<i>(c)</i> in so far as those provisions require children who are detained to be accommodated separately from adults.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1631W.5/3">The second reservation refers to Immigration and Nationality and states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1631W.5/4" class="indent">UK reserves the right to apply such legislation, in so far as it relates to the entry into, stay in and departure from the UK of those who do not have the right under the law of the UK to enter and remain in the UK, and to the acquisition and possession of citizenship.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1631W.5/5">UK law honours the spirit of the Convention in relation to the standards of care and treatment available to children in the UK, including asylum-seeking children. We believe it is necessary to retain this reservation because it preserves the integrity of our immigration laws. The UK has entered other, similar reservations in respect of other human rights instruments. We are satisfied that asylum-seeking children in the UK receive adequate care, protection and support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1631W.5/6">Regarding children mixing with adults: we have made great progress in achieving separation of under and over-18s in custody, for example by placing girls under 17 in non-prison service accommodation and by providing new, special units for 17 year old girls. We will therefore be considering whether there is a continuing need for the Reservation against Article 37<i>(c)</i> of the Convention; and this review is due to begin shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1636W.6/46">2. The figures shown on average sale price of new terrace properties are taken from NI Housing Statistics, but this taken in isolation does not represent the housing market for terrace properties.

	<p pid="b.1636W.6/48">Earnings</p>
	<p pid="b.1636W.6/49">1. The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) is a UK wide survey that provides a wide range of information on hourly, weekly and annual earnings by gender, work patterns, industry and occupation inter alia. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) carry out ASHE in Great Britain and it is carried out by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1636W.6/50">2. ASHE is a sample survey and uses the Inland Revenue's PA YE system as the main sampling frame. To improve coverage and hence make the survey more representative, supplementary information was collected since 2004 on businesses not registered for VAT and for people who changed or started new jobs between the sample selection and the survey reference period. The improvements have caused a discontinuity with earlier available data (1997&ndash;2003) when no supplementary data was collected. The data on earnings is obtained not from the employees, but from their employers under the authority of the Statistics of Trade and Employment (Northern Ireland) Order 1988. Information collected is treated as strictly confidential and is used only for statistical purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1636W.6/51">3. A recent National Statistics review of earnings statistics recommended that median values (the figure below which 50 per cent. of values fall) are used in preference to mean values (the sum divided by the number of values) when reporting earnings. The mean and the median measure different things and can both be appropriate measures depending on what the user is trying to measure. The mean measures the average amount earned by individuals but in a skew distribution such as earnings this measure is susceptible to small numbers of very high earners, whereas the median measures the amount earned by the individual in the middle of a ranked distribution. However, in this instance the mean values have been used to ensure equivalence with the average used to report on house prices in the response.</p>

	<p pid="b.1651W.8/2">In August 2005, the Government revised the position adopted in 2002 on our policy regarding the export of nuclear related items to India.

	<p pid="b.1651W.8/5">We will also consider all applications to export other items assessed as licensable, including those assessed as licensable under the weapons of mass destruction end-use control, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the risk of use in, or diversion to, unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle or nuclear explosive activities, or acts of nuclear terrorism; the risk of possible onward transfer of these items to other states for proliferation purposes, including the recipient state's export control performance; and the potential utility of the items concerned for, and contribution that they would make to, such activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1651W.8/6">We will continue to consider applications for exports which will contribute to the physical protection or security of civil or military nuclear facilities or assets in India. Licences may be issued in exceptional cases, consistent with our obligations and commitments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1651W.8/7">We will encourage contacts between UK nuclear scientists, academics and those working in or with the UK nuclear industry with their Indian counterparts, except where we consider that such contacts might be of assistance to the weapons-related aspects of its nuclear programme. Where such contacts involve the transfer of technology, which require export licences, we will continue to consider applications for such licences in accordance with the provisions of UK export control legislation, on a case-by-case basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.1660W.3/1">The Law Commission recommended changes to the law relating to limitation periods, in its 2001 report on Limitation of Actions (Law Com. 270).</p>
	<p pid="b.1660W.3/2">Under the Law Commission's proposed regime, there would be a primary limitation period of three years from the date that the claimant knows the relevant facts. These are <i>(a)</i> the facts which give rise to the cause of action; <i>(b)</i> the identity of the defendant; and <i>(c)</i> that the injury was significant. An injury would be considered significant if a reasonable person would think that it was worth making a claim, assuming the defendant does not dispute liability and is able to satisfy a judgment. The impecuniosity of the defendant may therefore prevent time running. In addition, in personal injury cases, the court would have a discretion to disapply the limitation period if it would be equitable to do so. There would be no time limit on the exercise of this discretion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1660W.3/3">The Government have announced their acceptance in principle of the Law Commission's recommendations, subject to further consideration of certain aspects of the report, 16 Jul 2002, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/.272W"><i>Official Report</i>, column 272W</phrase>. This work is now well advanced and we hope to be able to conclude it shortly. We will then seek a legislative opportunity to reform the law.</p>

	<p pid="b.1660W.6/1">In order to make the 1911 census returns accessible to as many people as possible and to prevent its reading rooms being overwhelmed by demand, The National Archives intends to make the available on the internet for the first working day of 2012. Digitisation of the records will take approximately five years. In this context TNA has considered the administrative impact of making returns available in response to specific requests before the online service is launched.</p>
	<p pid="b.1660W.6/2">In line with Treasury policy, TNA intends to use a commercial supplier to digitise the records. Allowing the public to access records during this process would cause repeated disruptions to the scanning process, and make it highly unlikely that any reputable commercial organisation would wish to embark on this large scale programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1660W.6/3">As is the case for any paper records nearly 100 years old, the 1911 returns are in fragile condition. Repeated handling by staff and members of the public would cause rapid deterioration in their condition. In some cases the original record could become unreadable and the unique information in the lost forever.</p>
	<p pid="b.1660W.6/4">TNA estimates that a significant number of staff might have to be diverted from other work to deal with requests for census records. This would severely impact on its ability to provide a service to its many other customers.</p>

The NAO found examples of good practice and the recommendations will help improve performance. We are working with the police and the CPS to improve performance in the magistrates courts.

	<p pid="b.1678W.8/1">An independent evaluation of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister-funded choice-based lettings (CBL) pilot scheme was carried out and a report published in May 2004. The evaluation report showed that the pilots were successful in offering increased choice to social housing applicants and that applicants largely welcomed the move to CBL, feeling that it gave them greater choice and control and increased the transparency of the lettings process. Local authorities were also very positive about their experience of CBL. In order to build on the evaluation and assess the longer term impacts of CBL, ODPM has commissioned Heriot Watt University to undertake further research which is currently underway and scheduled to complete by summer 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1678W.8/2">ODPM is committed to producing statutory guidance to local authorities on choice based lettings. This will include advice on how to frame a CBL scheme which offers applicants a choice of accommodation while continuing to meet the statutory obligation to ensure that priority for social housing goes to those in greater housing need. The guidance will also be issued for consultation later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1680W.8/1">Support under the Government's neighbourhood renewal initiative is targeted at the most deprived parts of England, as determined by indices of deprivation which were last updated in 2004. Havering does not rank sufficiently high on the indices to qualify. Nevertheless, Havering is now beginning to prepare its Local Area Agreement (LAA), to be implemented from April 2007. While this does not involve additional funding, it is a powerful tool for driving forward regeneration and renewal, and provides an opportunity to focus on the needs of priority areas within Havering.</p>

	<p pid="b.1683W.5/1">Ordnance Survey has been making mapping and geographic information available to the public for over 200 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1683W.5/2">As a government trading fund focused on the collection,maintenance and dissemination of geographic information, it is a core component of Ordnance Survey policy to ensure that its data is readily available to all who wish to use it. In recent years, there has been a steady growth in the use of such data in commerce, government and leisure activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1683W.5/3">Ordnance Survey, like all trading funds, is charged with delivering a financial return to government. Consequently it charges for the provision and maintenance of its data. It is also expected to invest for the future to meet the increasingly sophisticated requirements of its customers and partners. Ordnance Survey does not receive any funds voted directly by Parliament. Instead it generates its revenue from the licensing of its data into the market place. This business model has helped underpin the efficiency, quality and service improvements that ensure the sustainability of the organisation.</p>

These figures are provided by local authorities. The figures for 1999&ndash;2000 are not directly comparable to those for subsequent years because they are based on gross expenditure whereas later years are based on gross total cost.

	<p pid="b.1685W.2/2">The North West Regional Housing Strategy recognised the impact of rising house prices in the region and made theprovision of affordable houses its second priority after urban regeneration. The Government have allocated around 45 per cent. of the region's housing resources to providing affordable housing, which includes first time buyers. Within Warrington, the Housing Corporation has allocated &pound;1.7 million to help provide affordable housing in the Robson street scheme. Warrington council has also made use of the Private Finance Initiative to provide affordable housing for rent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1691W.8/1">The information is not held centrally in the form requested. However, table 1 shows expenditure on residential and nursing care placements made by Bristol City unitary authority in 2004&ndash;05 for the various adult client groups, including older people. This shows gross expenditure, income received from sales, fees and charges and the resulting net expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1691W.8/3">Information on the percentages of the various ways costs are paid is not collected. According to the 2005 market survey by the independent analysts, Laing and Buisson, approximately 67 per cent. of the cost of residential care in the United Kingdom is funded by social services, or by the national health service to cover nursing care. It is estimated that approximately 100,000, or around 25 per cent., of residents nationally are privately or self funded.</p>

	<p pid="b.1695W.5/1">A number of studies regarding water fluoridation and bone cancer have been published. The weight of the scientific evidence, as assessed by independent committees of experts, comprehensive systematic reviews, and review of the findings of individual studies, does not currently support any association between water fluoridated at levels optimal for oral health and the risk for cancer, including bone cancer, in children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1695W.5/2">We are aware that an observed association between exposure to fluoride in drinking water and the incidence (new cases) of osteosarcoma in young males has recently been reported in a paper in the United States (Age-specific fluoride exposure in drinking water and Osteosarcom (United States) Bassin et al., Cancer causes control (2006) 17: 421&ndash;428). No apparent association was observed in females. The author has described this research as an exploratory analysis and has acknowledged that further research is required to confirm or refute the observed association.</p>
	<p pid="b.1695W.5/3">In 2000, the Government commissioned a systematic review of public water fluoridation from the University of York. In this study, no clear association between osteosarcoma and fluoridation was found. In 2002, the Medical Research Council (MRC), commissioned by the Government to consider further research requirements on water fluoridation, agreed with the York findings that overall, the evidence does not suggest that artificially fluoridated water increases the risk of cancer. The Department will keep any further publications from the recent United States study under review and is committed to a continuing programme of research in line with the MRCs recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1697W.4/1" qnum="62229">To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to the Answer of 2 March 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, column 915W, on health reform in England: update and next steps, whether the Tariff will apply to a patient requiring acute services for a potentially terminal illness, as opposed to palliative care for a patient in whom the same illness has progressed beyond a point where acute services can reasonably be expected to contribute to the patient's recovery; and whether it will be <i>(a)</i> the patient's GP, <i>(b)</i> the hospital consultant and <i>(c)</i> the primary care trust which makes the judgement that acute, rather than palliative care is required for a patient at any stage of the patient's care.</p>

	<p pid="b.1697W.5/1">The national tariff is structured around healthcare resources groups (HRGs), which represent clinically relevant groups of diagnoses and treatments that consume similar average levels of healthcare resource. In this way, the tariff applies on the basis of a patient's diagnosis and treatment combination rather than the severity of a patient's condition, for example terminal illness, albeit that these issues are related.</p>
	<p pid="b.1697W.5/2">A list of treatments currently excluded from the tariff are set out in Payment by Results: Implementation support guide 2006&ndash;07 (Technical Guidance), which is available on the Department's website. Funding for treatments outside the scope of payment by results continues to be negotiated locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1697W.5/3">Whether, or when, a patient should be given acute care or palliative care is a matter for the clinical judgement of the doctor responsible for the patient's care.</p>

	<p pid="b.1702W.0/3">The safety of all medicines in the United Kingdom is continuously monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Since initial licensing in 1991, the safety of mifepristone (Mifegyne, RU-486)&mdash;a medicine used for abortion has been carefully monitored through review of reports of suspected adverse drug reactions and through periodic safety reports submitted by the manufacturer. Such reviews have evaluated both suspected complications and deaths relating to this medicine.</p>
	<p pid="b.1702W.0/4">In 2005, following new advice from the United States Food and Drug Administration, where this product is used in combination with another medicine that is not licensed for this purpose in the UK, reports of suspected serious adverse reactions associated with mifepristone, including cases of serious bacterial infection, were thoroughly reviewed. The regulatory authorities within Europe, including the UK, did not identify any new safety issues in this review. No additional enquiry is necessary. Regulatory action to withdraw this medicine in the UK, equivalent to that proposed in H.R. 1079 (Holly's Law) in the United States, is not appropriate since European Union advice, including UK expert advice, is that the balance of risks and benefits of mifepristone remains positive.</p>

	<p pid="b.1704W.0/2">The primary outcome measure for assertive outreach teams is not a reduction in hospital admissions. The principal purpose of assertive outreach teams is to provide intensive support for people with severe mental illness, and who might not otherwise engage with mainstream mental health services, in their own homes or in other community settings. In December 2005, 17,000 people were receiving care from 262 assertive outreach teams, representing a 14 per cent. increase in caseload compared to 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1704W.0/3">In addition to assertive outreach teams, crisis resolution services are designed to respond promptly to people in crisis, providing assessment and effective home treatment, including medication in their own home or in other community settings. At the end of March 2005, there were 343 crisis resolution teams. In the first three quarters of the financial year 2005&ndash;06, crisis resolution teams provided 61,000 home treatment episodes for patients who would otherwise have been admitted.</p>

Further information on this appraisal can be found on NICE's website at <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk">www.nice.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1704W.6/3">In the interim, there are no national restrictions on or guidelines for prescribing bortezomib on the national health service for patients who fit the licensed indication. Funding for licensed treatments should not be withheld because guidance from NICE is unavailable. In these circumstances, we expect primary care trusts to take full account of available evidence when reaching funding decisions. This is confirmed in Health Service Circular 1999/176&quot;, which asks NHS bodies to continue with local arrangements for the managed introduction of new technologies where guidance from NICE is not available at the time the treatment or technology first became available.</p>

Over this time period, 3.7 per cent. of these calls were abandoned, representing those occasions when the called person answers and it appears no-one is there, due to the slight delay before an operator comes on the line. The NBS continues to improve its abandonment rates, which have dropped to three per cent, in January 2006. These levels are within Ofcom's guidelines of no more than 5 per cent. silent calls.</p>

	<p pid="b.1711W.2/1">The weighted capitation formula has separate components for hospital and community health services (HCHS), prescribing and primary medical services to reflect the services for which primary care trusts (PCTs) receive funding. Each component has its own age and additional need weightings which are applied simultaneously to the population to produce a weighted population for each PCT, When expressed as an index centred around one for each PCT, the weightings in the HCHS component range from 0.85 to 1.25 for age and 0.71 to 1.52 for additional need.</p>
	<p pid="b.1711W.2/2">Estimated expenditure in 2003&ndash;04 on HCHS was 2,073 for a person over 65 years and 517 for a person under 65 years. It is not possible to estimate this expenditure in deprived and non-deprived areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1712W.3/4" class="indent">Average earnings are estimated from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), and are provided for full time employees on adult rates whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence. This is the standard definition used for ASHE. The ASHE does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1712W.3/5" class="indent">I attach tables showing Average Gross Weekly Earnings by place of work for the years 2000 to 2005 for Full Time Employees on Adult Rates.

	<p pid="b.1717W.3/2">The integration of the HR functions in Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise is only partially complete. The first phase of change was to implement a virtual service centre in three locations. These locations were selected as existing technology platforms could be utilised. The costs to date are related to the set up of a contact centre in two of the locations (the third already operated in this way) and are in the region of &pound;100,000. The project, when completed in 2008, will lead to savings of 702 staff and an HR to total departmental staff ratio in line with Gershon proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.1717W.6/1">Before HM Revenue and Customs was created, both the Inland Revenue and Customs andExcise were in the process of transforming their HRservice delivery models. Both Departments were committed to changes with attendant improvements in both service delivery and efficiency. As the two legacy Departments had different supporting technology, processes and working practices a simple merger of the two HR functions would not provide the service required to support the business during a time of considerable change.</p>

	<p pid="b.1720W.4/1">The Government keep all taxes under review and have been looking at how they can focus their support on groups with the poorest access to technology, following the publication of the Digital Strategy paper in April 2005 which indicated that the Home Computer Initiative was poorly targeted.</p>

The Office of Fair Trading will continue to issue directions under the Consumer Credit Act, providing it is in the hirer's interest to do so, until <phrase class="date" code="">5 September 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1720W.4/5">Further to the Digital Strategy, the Government published its 'Inclusion through Innovation' report in November 2005, which looked at where Information and Communication Technology (ICTs) might deliver most benefit to excluded groups and considered how that might be achieved. In addition, the Government have written to representatives from industry inviting suggestions on the best way of refocusing our support on these target groups. Over the next few months the DTI will review the options put forward and consider how they would meet the Government's objectives.</p>

CHIEF is likely to be the system used to implement most (but not all) of the Change Programme but until our preparatory work is complete it is by no means certain, and therefore it is not possible to provide accurate costs for updating CHIEF at this time. Each project within the EU Change Programme will be subject to a full and robust Business Case, which will include identification of the most appropriate VFM technology for delivery, reducing the compliance burden and improving customer experience.</p>

	<p pid="b.1726W.8/1">The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, together with the other potential lenders to the Sakhalin II project, have undertaken an extensive and detailed assessment of the risks to the western gray whales. This assessment has drawn on the views of an independent panel of world-renowned whale experts, convened by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). This panel produced a series of recommendations on whale protection measures relating to noise, construction schedules, vessel movements, monitoring and other relevant issues, and it is hoped that these measures, together with Sakhalin Energy's own whale protection plans, will minimise the level of disruption to the whale's habitat. To date there is no evidence of Sakhalin Energy's activities resulting in any whale deaths, and recent research has indicated that the whale population is showing signs of recovery.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726W.8/2">Further comfort is drawn from the establishment of an independent western gray whale Advisory Panel that will oversee and advise on ongoing whale conservation activities and research. Sakhalin Energy has agreed to implement all reasonable recommendations that this panel produces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1726W.8/3">Whale protection measures and commitments would be contractual obligations under any loan agreements between Sakhalin Energy and the potential lenders, and these commitments would be monitored and publicly reported on.</p>
