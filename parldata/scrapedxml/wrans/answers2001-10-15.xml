	<p pid=".799W.3/1">The UN estimates that there are at least 5.3 million vulnerable people inside Afghanistan. This is expected to rise by a further 2.2 million in coming weeks, bringing the total of vulnerable people in need of assistance inside the country to 7.5 million. In addition, there were already some 4 million Afghan refugees in neighbouring countries due to over 20 years of conflict and four years of harsh drought conditions.</p>
	<p pid=".799W.3/2">The UN and their non-governmental organisation (NGO) partners have launched an appeal for $584 million to cover the period October 2001 to March 2002. Donors, including the UK and the EU, have so far responded with commitments of $301 million. $29 million has also been pledged to humanitarian agencies outside of the UN Donor Alert. In addition, donors announced pledges of a further $407 million in support for humanitarian assistance for Afghans. However, it is not yet clear how these additional funds will be allocated. Information is not available on what proportion of funds have actually been released to humanitarian agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".799W.3/3">My Department has set aside a sum of &pound;40 million to respond to the current crisis affecting Afghans in Afghanistan and in neighbouring countries. We have also set aside a further sum of &pound;11 million for immediate short-term support to the poorer communities of Pakistan, especially those most directly affected by the influx of refugees from Afghanistan. Our top priorities are to help meet immediate life-saving needs (food, water, health care, shelter) within Afghanistan, as best as possible and for as long as possible, through the national staff of relevant agencies; support refugee needs in neighbouring countries; help host populations through programmes which benefit them, for example in health care, food, water and sanitation provision; and strengthen international humanitarian agency capacity and co-ordination.</p>
	<p pid=".799W.3/4">These funds are being made available now through UN agencies, the Red Cross movement and NGOs. Their programmes include particular emphasis on children. For example, &pound;3 million has been provided to the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) for disease control, nutrition supplementation, safe water and sanitation, and psychosocial support to traumatised children.</p>

Although some people may have collected goods that they would like to give to those in need, it is better to find some way of turning collected or donated goods into cash, and then to donate the proceeds to a humanitarian agency's public appeal. The logistics involved in despatching donated goods (cleaning, sorting, packaging and freighting) are time consuming and expensive, and cash donations are a faster and more economical way to provide assistance to those in need.</p>

There is some evidence that in those areas where there is good humanitarian access, malnutrition rates have eased recently, but this represents only temporary respite for a limited number. There remains a pressing need for a negotiated and inclusive end to the conflict. The UK has contributed &pound;2.82 million this year to the humanitarian relief effort through UN agencies and NGO's as well as our contribution through the EC. We continue to monitor the situation through the UN, NGOs, the Red Cross societies, and by undertaking regular visits.</p>

To date, we have committed &pound;120,000 to the UN Regional Centre in Lima, Peru to assist in the practical implementation of regional and international agreements to combat illicit weapons trafficking. Also, under the strategy we are planning to commit &pound;7.5 million to supporting the UN Development Programme in a global programme for weapons collection, management and destruction.

	<p pid=".804W.7/1">It is for each Government to apply the European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (known as the Valetta Convention 1992) in ways that fit in with national practice and legislation. In broad terms, current measures in place in the UK already meet the convention's requirements. The Government do not believe that additional legislation, requiring a licensing system, is necessary to fulfil article 3. Much archaeological work is already controlled through existing mechanisms. In England, English Heritage will be taking forward consultations with appropriate bodies representing all parts of the archaeological community on any necessary improvements to the operation of existing systems of control and on the development of a voluntary Code of Conduct for those who wish to undertake archaeological work outside those existing systems. They will begin work on this during the autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".805W.2/2">It is for each Government to apply the European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (known as the Valetta Convention 1992) in ways that fit in with national practice and legislation. In broad terms, current measures in place in the UK already meet the Convention's requirements. The Government do not believe that additional legislation, requiring a licensing system, is necessary to fulfil Article 3. Much archaeological work is already controlled through existing mechanisms. In England, English Heritage will be taking forward consultations with appropriate bodies representing all parts of the archaeological community on any necessary improvements to the operation of existing systems of control and on the development of a voluntary Code of Conduct for those who wish to undertake archaeological work outside those existing systems. They will begin work on this during the autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".805W.5/3">This falls within the provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the Treasure Act 1996.

	<p pid=".805W.5/4" class="indent">'prior authorisation of the use of metal detectors or &quot;any other detection equipment&quot; applies only to &quot;archaeological investigation&quot; and therefore not to the normal use of metal detectors'.</p>

The Human Rights Act 1998 gives further effect in the UK to the rights guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The Act itself does not have any force outside the UK, but clearly the ECHR does. Both the Valetta Convention and the ECHR are treaties of the Council of Europe with many of the same signatory states. We have no reason to believe that the two conventions are incompatible.</p>

	<p pid=".807W.8/1">Most of this Department's funds are allocated through non-departmental public bodies. It is for those bodies to determine how their funds will be used, in accordance with their funding agreements with the Department.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.8/2">The funding system for the arts will be reformed to create a single funding organisation with regional arts councils and considerably enhanced levels of local government involvement. The new system will enable the regions to be active drivers of the funding system, rather than merely clients of a national body. It will result in a more streamlined organisation which will offer up savings that can be ploughed back into the arts, as well as providing a structure that is simpler and more consistent for those applying for funds and support. The Arts Council of England is currently consulting on the detail of the proposed changes.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.8/3">In relation to national lottery funding, we have asked the community fund to target &pound;100 million and the new opportunities fund an additional &pound;50 million to some 50 areas which are both deprived and have received less lottery funding than other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.8/4">There are no current plans to change the system in relation to funds which are allocated directly by this Department.</p>

	<p pid=".808W.2/1">Sport England has decided that the remaining 18 Sport Action Zones will be designated following a bidding process which it proposes to launch in January next year. The bidding process will focus on the top 20 per cent. of deprived areas in the country and the criteria to be taken into account in assessing the applications will relate to the degree of socio-economic deprivation; the scope for working with other partners and initiatives in the area; and the level of sporting need and deprivation. It is anticipated that each region will have at least one zone and a maximum of five. Sport England expects to announce its decisions in October 2002.</p>

	<p pid=".808W.5/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that everyone who currently receives the main public service channels broadcasting on analogue will continue to do so digitally after the switchover to digital television, whether by terrestrial, cable or satellite means. The BBC and ITC, who are responsible for the digital terrestrial television (DTT) network, are considering, in consultation with the digital broadcasters, manufacturers, consumer groups and Government, how to improve the core coverage of all digital television multiplexes across the UK. Maps showing the current predicted DTT coverage from each of the UK DTT transmitter sites have been placed in both Houses on CD-ROM and maps are also available on the Digital Television Group website: <a href="http://www.dtg.org.uk">www.dtg.org.uk</a>. These show that most of Essex is served by the Crystal Palace, Sudbury and Bluebell Hill transmitters. Cable services are available in Essex, although coverage concentrates on areas of dense population. It is for cable operators to decide on the roll out of their digital services and viability of extending services to non-urban areas.</p>

	<p pid=".812W.0/1">This Department has not been consulted by the Department for Education and Employment, or its successor, on the implications for the tourism industry of proposed changes in the duration and number of school terms. Last year the Local Government Association established the Independent Commission on the Organisation of the School Year, whose report &quot;Rhythms of Schooling&quot; was published in September 2000. The Commission's remit was to consider the wide-ranging effects of current arrangements and it made various recommendations, including about the duration and number of school terms. It has since received feedback from an extensive consultation and published its response earlier this month. Tourism bodies have been involved throughout the process and were included among the consultees, as was the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Decisions about the number, length and dates of school terms and holidays are taken by each local education authority and not by central Government, and we have no plans to change this. The Government will look carefully at the LGA's final recommendations (expected in December). However, we would need to be convinced that there was widely based support for a change before considering legislating to impose a new uniform format.</p>

As announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-09">9 April</phrase> this year, we propose to introduce preserved rights to this concession for existing beneficiaries, in cases where changes to the social mix or the level of warden cover mean that the accommodation no longer meets the full qualifying criteria. Consultations between officials and the BBC about the necessary amendments to the television licence fee regulations are currently underway. We intend to bring forward these amendments as soon as we can but it is important that in doing so we do not create any new anomalies or unnecessary administrative burdens.</p>

This does not affect our sovereignty of the Falkland Islands or our commitment to the Islanders' rights to determine their own future. There will be no change in the status of the Islands unless that is the wish of the Islanders themselves.</p>

	<p pid=".826W.5/1">To date we have received and paid over 1 million retrospective Winter Fuel Payment claims for the first three years of the scheme: 1997&ndash;98; 1998&ndash;99 and 1999&ndash;2000. A possible 1.9 million people, the large majority of whom are men, could be eligible for a backdated payment in respect of these years. However, there are no time limits on claiming payments for these winters and we continue to receive and pay claims.</p>
	<p pid=".826W.5/2">From April 2000 an information campaign ran to ensure that existing and potential customers knew about changes to the scheme and what, if anything, they needed to do to get a payment. It is up to the individual to choose whether to claim payments for past winters. There is no time limit on claiming payments for previous years of the scheme. This year, the Winter Fuel Payment information campaign began in June and will continue throughout the year.</p>

	<p pid=".831W.5/1">The changes we are introducing to Incapacity Benefit are designed to help people with poor health and disability to achieve their own aspirations by helping those who want to work to do so. People making new or repeat claims to Incapacity Benefit in Jobcentre Plus pathfinder offices will therefore be required to attend a work focused interview to ensure they get the right level of support. These interviews will provide disabled people with the opportunity to discuss with their personal adviser the help, benefits and opportunities available to them. We will not force people with disabilities into work. People who are still eligible for Incapacity Benefit will get it and the existing exemptions from medical testing will not be removed.</p>

	<p pid=".834W.4/1">Information of this nature, which would require judgments to be made about the potential savings and VFM improvements available from very different types of projects across government, is not held centrally. However, a great deal of central guidance and support are available to Departments contemplating the use of PFI&mdash;from the Treasury, the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) and Partnerships UK (PUK). This draws upon reports by the National Audit Office and Parliamentary Select Committees.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.4/2">As with other elements of their business, it remains the responsibility of individual Departments and agencies to ensure that value for money for the taxpayer is demonstrated before any PFI deal is signed. In carrying out investment and option appraisals, Departments are required to follow Treasury guidance contained in the Green Book &quot;Appraisal and Evaluation in Central Government&quot;. For PFI deals, Departments are also required to construct a Public Sector Comparator (PSC), which is a costed estimate based on the assumption that the required service would be acquired through conventional funding. Guidance on PCSs is contained in Policy Statement No.2: Public Sector Comparators and Value for Money, and Technical Note 5: How to construct a Public Sector Comparator. The latter notes that the PSC should not be regarded as a pass/fail test, but as a quantitative way of informing judgment. These documents and a list of signed PFI deals are available in the Library of the House and are accessible on the website of the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) <a href="http://www.ogc.gov.uk">www.ogc.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.4/3">By June 2001 some 450 PFI deals had been signed by central, regional and local government authorities in the United Kingdom. To date the NAO has published 20 value for money reports on PPP/PFI deals. A list of these reports is available on the NAO website <a href="http://www.nao.gov.uk">www.nao.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.4/4">As evidence is gained of projects' progression through the OGC gateway process, which is designed to assist central civil departments in the successful delivery of projects (whether PFI or not), this will increasingly inform central data collection, analysis and guidance. The OGC will also draw upon UK's work to increase central knowledge of PFI and other PPP projects.</p>

	<p pid=".848W.8/2">During the last Parliament, a number of reforms were put in place, including the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit, the Children's Tax Credit and the Minimum Income Guarantee for pensioners. In the next stage of reform, the Government intend to introduce a new system of payable tax credits from 2003 which will help to support families, make work pay and tackle child poverty. In addition, the Pension Credit, which will be introduced from 2003, will help reward saving, support pensioners on low to modest incomes and tackle pensioner poverty.</p>

	<p pid=".858W.9/1">The scheme for enhanced capital allowances for energy-saving investments is a tax relief for businesses that invest in designated energy-saving technologies. It is not a scheme that relies on a fund that is ring-fenced. The scheme enables businesses to write off immediately the whole of their qualifying spending against their taxable profits and thereby receive the benefit of a useful cash-flow boost.</p>

	<p pid=".859W.2/1">The Government gave a commitment in the House of Commons during the passage of FSMA that there would at any time be a single RAO. This commitment could be interpreted as meaning that we should remake the RAO each time we needed to change it.</p>
	<p pid=".859W.2/2">The normal practice when amending a statutory instrument is to make textual amendments only to the particular provisions affected, unless the changes are so substantial or widespread as to justify revoking the original instrument and re-making it (with amendments) in its entirety. Re-making the entire RAO every time we need to amend it (however minor the changes) would differ from that usual practice. From time to time we will need to adjust the RAO, for example to reflect developments in the market, or changes to European legislation. If we remade the entire RAO each time, this would impact on the numerous other Statutory Instruments, together with rules made by the Financial Services Authority, which refer to the RAO, and would be likely to necessitate consequential changes to these. The overall effect might be to make the body of law of which the RAO is a part less rather than more clear to the regulated community.</p>
	<p pid=".859W.2/3">Another disadvantage of re-making the entire order is that it would be difficult for readers to tell readily what had changed. Each time the order was remade the general reader would have to buy the complete new version.</p>
	<p pid=".859W.2/4">Having consulted the industry and received its general support, we intend following standard practice and amending the RAO rather than completely re-making it, for changes to the RAO that do not involve a wholesale revision of the order. This will reduce the number of consequential amendments to other legislation (including FSA rules) as compared to remaking the entire order. To aid users of the order further we will provide an &quot;unofficial&quot; consolidated version on the HMT website, which will give the up-to-date version of the complete order as amended, at any given time. We will consider re-making the RAO only in the event of a wholesale revision of the order, and in such circumstances we would then take the opportunity to consolidate earlier orders amending the RAO.</p>

The Government have issued strengthened guidance to local planning authorities on control of development in flood risk areas, and are reviewing the financial and institutional arrangements under which the flood defence service is delivered.

	<p pid=".869W.3/1">Proposals for transport infrastructure and housing development, which are likely to have significant effects on the environment come within the scope of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive (85/337/EEC as amended). The DTLR is the lead Department responsible for implementation of the Directive. The EIA procedure requires a developer to compile an Environmental Statement, which includes detailed information about the proposed development, the main effects it is likely to have on the environment, and the mitigation measures envisaged to deal with adverse effects. This information must be taken into account by the competent authority in reaching a decision on the proposal. For most projects falling within the scope of the Directive, for which planning permission is needed, the local planning authority is the competent authority, though in cases that are called in or subject to appeal the Secretary of State has to ensure compliance with EIA requirements. For some projects, for example proposals for new national roads, the Secretary of State is the competent authority.</p>

	<p pid=".874W.5/1">Under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as substituted by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991, a planning obligation may be agreed between a Local Planning Authority and a developer. A planning obligation may require or restrict specified activities to be carried out and may require payments to be made to the authority either in a single sum or periodically. Such obligations could therefore cover provision of new shop fronts; payment for repairs to pavements; contributions towards local education provisions; and the fixing of rents, if this amounted to a restriction on the use of land. However, planning obligations should only be sought where they are necessary to make a proposal acceptable in land-use planning terms. In addition, they must be: relevant to planning; directly related to the proposed development; fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the proposed development; and reasonable in all other respects.</p>

	<p pid=".877W.2/1">My Department seeks information about local authorities' activities under the homelessness provisions of the Housing Act 1996 on the quarterly P1 (E) housing returns. Data, which relate to households rather than individuals, include the number of households being temporarily housed by the authority, and separately distinguish those in bed-and-breakfast hotels, as well as other types of property such as hostels or privately leased accommodation. This information is summarised in a quarterly Statistical Release, the most recent of which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-12">12 September 2001</phrase> covering results up to the end of June 2001. Copies are available in the Library of the House and are on the DTLR website.</p>
	<p pid=".877W.2/2">Annual Housing Investment Programme (HIP) returns also seek basic data on the total number of homeless households accommodated on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March</phrase>, and this year additionally asked for confirmation of those in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. As in previous years, the 2001 HIP return also sought a range of summary information about the number of households on local authorities' housing registers. HIP data are made available on the DTLR website normally in December once the data have been checked and confirmed by the authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".885W.2/1">National Air Traffic Services (NATS) remains committed to investing in the New Scottish Centre (NSC) at Prestwick as part of its two-centre strategy. However, the events of <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-11">11 September</phrase> have led to a review of the phasing of NATS' capital investment plan, and my officials have been in close and continuing discussion with NATS and the Airline Group on these matters.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.2/2">As a result of this review, and in the light of reduced traffic demand, the Government have agreed to a proposal to delay work on the NSC, which will result in a later operational date than originally planned. Work on the building will be suspended, following completion of the building design and piling contracts at the end of 2001. However, work will continue on evaluating systems solutions for this new centre. NATS will keep the position under review, and launch further work as soon as traffic forecasts make it prudent to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".890W.8/1">My Department has undertaken a review of the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre, which has been an Executive Agency since 1989. The review considered all the organisational aspects for the agency, taking into account its role and past performance, its fit with wider objectives, and the relationship with other bodies in the public and private sectors. Staff and trade unions have been consulted as part of the review.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.8/2">The key findings of the review were:</p>
	<p pid=".890W.8/3" class="indent">There have been substantial improvements in the centre's performance over the last 5 years, with a 30 per cent. increase in turnover. Current performance is considered to be near the optimum for conference use.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.8/4" class="indent">Most of the centre's business derives from the private sector and associations.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.8/5" class="indent">The centre is seen as an important London facility, attracting considerable business tourism.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.8/6">The review does not recommend contracting out or privatisation, which it considers may be difficult to implement, and would be poor value for money. It also concluded that any market interest in the site is likely to relate to redevelopment for uses other than a conference centre.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.8/7">In the light of the review findings, I have decided that the public sector status and role of the QEII conference centre should not be changed. I have, however, asked officials, over the longer term, to keep under review options for ownership of the QEIICC within the public sector.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.8/8">A summary of the review findings is being placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

The Government have also given the go-ahead for a further 23 bypass schemes on local authority roads in the last two years as part of the Local Transport Settlement. Bids for further schemes are currently being considered and decisions will be announced in December.</p>

Although these dues may be set as the authority sees fit, they are subject to a statutory right of objection under section 31 of the Harbours Act 1964 which gives the Secretary of State the power to direct an authority to review dues if, after proper consideration, he considers that they are unreasonable.</p>

	<p pid=".898W.3/1">A stock transfer proposal from a local authority with overhanging housing debt is required to meet the same criteria as other applicant authorities in order to obtain a place on the Large Scale Voluntary Transfer (LSVT) Programme and, if tenants support the proposal, the Secretary of State's consent to transfer. The receipt from the transfer must be sufficient to meet the premium payable to the Public Works Loan Board (PWLB) for early repayment of the authority's PWLB debt.</p>
	<p pid=".898W.3/2">To date, four one-off payments have been made by the Exchequer to meet overhanging housing debt. In 1999&ndash;2000 a payment was made to Burnley borough council. In 2000&ndash;01 payments were made to Coventry city council, Calderdale borough council and Blackburn with Darwen borough council.</p>
	<p pid=".898W.3/3">Six local authorities on the 2001&ndash;02 transfer programme (Bradford city council, Carlisle city council, Dudley metropolitan borough council, Knowsley metropolitan borough council, St. Helens metropolitan borough council and Walsall metropolitan borough council) will potentially require a one-off payment to meet their overhanging housing debt. I have held open a place on the 2001&ndash;02 Programme for Birmingham city council, subject to agreeing its stock valuation. If Birmingham is accepted onto the programme, it too will require a one-off payment from the Department.</p>
	<p pid=".898W.3/4">To date, all proposals meeting the Secretary of State's criteria and gaining the support of a majority of tenants have been granted consent to transfer. It has not been necessary to prioritise transfer applications.</p>

The Act provides that all use of the animals covered by its licensing controls must be justified, and that consequent animal suffering should be minimised. The terms of the Act are sufficiently broad and flexible to take account of scientific developments, without compromising the protection it affords to the animals concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.3/2">No specific guidance has been issued on the assessment of applications under the 1986 Act to produce animals by nuclear transfer cloning, though general guidance to applicants applies as much to this area of scientific research as to any other. All such applications are however considered at a central point within the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate. This ensures consistency of approach and identifies any cases that may need to be drawn to the attention of Ministers, who may seek further advice as required from the Animal Procedures Committee (APC), external assessors and others.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.3/3">We have no plans at present for consultation on the subject of genetic modification of non-human primates. No applications to conduct such work have so far been made under the 1986 Act&mdash;either to produce such animals in the United Kingdom or to use such animals imported from elsewhere. Any applications would be considered in the light of advice from the Inspectorate and the APC.</p>

The expected cost of this project is &pound;1,040,000 and it is expected to be completed in November 2001. This work has not involved loss of accommodation.</p>
	<p pid=".906W.0/3">Capital works in A Wing to remove asbestos, renew the heating system and install in-cell electricity at a total cost of &pound;520,000 have been completed during September 2001 and the accommodation is being brought back into use in a phased programme to be completed by mid-October.</p>
	<p pid=".906W.0/4">Twenty-five work places in Workshop 3 have been temporarily closed for a six-week period for essential electrical maintenance.</p>
	<p pid=".906W.0/5">Most of B Wing remains out of use. There are no plans to return this accommodation to use. B Wing is a listed building and, as a result of the conditions required by CADW/Welsh Historic Monuments, the cost of the works needed to bring it up to current standards, including in-cell sanitation, mean it is not viable to restore it.</p>
	<p pid=".906W.0/6">A capital project to the value of &pound;147,000 has been authorised in the health care centre to provide improved cells and a lift for disabled prisoners. The contract for this work has not yet been let and there is therefore no definite timetable for it. It will not involve taking prisoner accommodation out of use.</p>
	<p pid=".906W.0/7">It is also expected that various roofing repairs will take place at Swansea in the current financial year. The details have not yet been finalised. This is also not expected to involve the loss of accommodation.</p>

	<p pid=".907W.2/2">There are three ways in which contractors can incur financial penalties. The contracts for privately managed prisons require the contractor to operate to a range of standards measuring the performance of the prison. Failure to reach any of these standards results in the accumulation of penalty points; the number of points incurred depends on the seriousness of the failure. If these accumulated penalty points exceed a specified threshold, financial penalties are imposed by means of deductions from the fee payable to the contractor. There is an upper limit to the level of financial penalties that can be imposed. In some contracts an escape attracts a fixed fine.</p>
	<p pid=".907W.2/3">Additionally contractors can be penalised for unauthorised overcrowding, if the contractor holds more than a specified number of prisoners in a cell, and for unavailable places, the criteria for which include levels of security, control of prisoners and physical requirements such as lighting and heating.</p>

For comparison purposes the figures have been converted to 1997&ndash;98 prices.</p>
	<p pid=".910W.6/2">The Isle of Wight prisons fall within the Thames Valley, Hampshire and Isle of Wight area. This area has been in existence only since April 2000 when the area structure of the Prison Service was revised to bring it into line with other criminal justice agencies. The area figures for earlier years have been adjusted so that they cover the same group of prisons. The figures for the Thames Valley, Hampshire and Isle of Wight area and for the three Isle of Wight prisons cover only capital spend incurred locally; they do not include any major capital projects which would have been funded centrally by Construction Unit in Prison Service headquarters.</p>

	<p pid=".911W.2/1">From April 2000, the Youth Justice Board took responsibility for commissioning and purchasing all secure accommodation including Prison Service accommodation for children and young persons sentenced to custody.</p>
	<p pid=".911W.2/2">The creation of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales sees for the first time a single organisation with oversight and responsibility for the care and well-being of 10 to 17-year-old offenders. The board's purpose is to monitor the operation of the youth justice system, to identify and promote good practice and to advise the Home Secretary how to deliver the statutory aim of preventing offending by children and young people. The board is also responsible for commissioning services for young offenders in secure facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".911W.2/3">In response to these changes the Prison Service has created a new distinct estate for 15 to 17-year-old boys, comprising both designated juvenile units in young offender institutions. For the first time, the vast majority of under-18s are held in dedicated under-18 establishments, or in dedicated under-18 living units within other establishments.</p>
	<p pid=".911W.2/4">As part of the Juvenile Estate three special units have been opened at Castington, Huntercombe and Hollesley Bay offering enhanced regimes for the more vulnerable boys who have been convicted of serious offences and have been given longer sentences under section 90 or 91 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (formerly section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933).</p>
	<p pid=".911W.2/5">Improvements are being made to the quality of accommodation, the level of care and to regime standards. The new regimes are underpinned by a Prison Service Order (PSO 4950), which defines the principles upon which governors must build and operate regimes.</p>
	<p pid=".911W.2/6">From <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase>, a new Operational Manager (Assistant Director, Juveniles) has taken direct responsibility within the Prison Service for the operational management of four establishments holding juveniles (Ashfield, Huntercombe, Werrington and Wetherby) and for the regimes and performance of the juvenile side of young offender institutions holding both juveniles and young offenders.</p>
	<p pid=".911W.2/7">There is a manifesto commitment to build on the Government's youth justice reforms to improve the standard of custodial accommodation and offending programmes for 18 to 20-year-olds. I am currently considering with others what is needed for young adult offenders and how best to deliver it.</p>

The completion of a new education facility for under-18s means that the original facility is now exclusively available to Feltham B prisoners, providing up to 70 places a day. &pound;500,000 is being invested from the Custody to Work programme to help the employability of young people on release, and &pound;575,000 is being spent to convert existing buildings into a new gymnasium.</p>
	<p pid=".918W.8/3">Four bedded units have been reduced to two-person occupancy, and doubling in cells intended for one has ended. In-cell electricity has been installed in four units with a fifth under way.</p>
	<p pid=".918W.8/4">I am taking a close personal interest in developments at Feltham and I am determined to see that progress is maintained.</p>

	<p pid=".922W.0/1">The production of genetically modified animals (as well as their use in experiments or other scientific procedures) is controlled under the terms of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The production and use of such animals allows new areas of medical and other scientific research to be explored; provides the potential for investigating a wide variety of conditions including cancer, cystic fibrosis and multiple sclerosis; and allows the quality of the science in many areas of research and testing to be improved.</p>
	<p pid=".922W.0/2">Table 3 of the Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals Great Britain 2000 (Cm 5244) provides comprehensive data on scientific procedures by species of animal, primary purpose (including breeding) and genetic status. Paragraph 12 of the Introductory Notes to the statistics explains that details of procedures on animals in foetal, larval or embryonic form are collected but not enumerated because it may be impracticable in some cases to count such procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".922W.0/3">Foetal deaths in the species that are commonly genetically modified are difficult or impossible to enumerate as a result of resorption of the foetal material and there may be no outward sign that this has happened. It may never have been established that the animal was pregnant, it will not have been known how many embryos were conceived, nor how many reached halfway through gestation. It would not therefore be feasible to collect the information in question. Embryonic forms do not become protected animals under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 until they are beyond halfway through gestation.</p>

	<p pid=".927W.8/1">In calculating the amount of compensation to be awarded to victims of miscarriages of justice, the independent assessor applies principles analogous to those governing the assessment of damages for civil wrongs. He must, therefore, give effect to any developments which may occur in the law and have regard to such judicial authority as there may be at the time of making an assessment. To that extent, the background against which he has to assess compensation is changing all the time. There has recently been a change of assessor (Lord Daniel Brennan succeeded Sir David Calcutt with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-27">27 July</phrase>) but that does not mean that there has been a change in how compensation is calculated because, whoever is the assessor, the same principles will be applied.</p>
	<p pid=".927W.8/2">The basis on which compensation is assessed is made clear in statute (section 133(4A) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988); in the Home office &quot;Compensation for Miscarriages of Justice&mdash;Note for Successful Applicants&quot; (copies of which have already been placed in the Library); and in individual Assessments.</p>
	<p pid=".927W.8/3">As at <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-20">20 September 2001</phrase> there were 112 cases where a decision had been made to pay compensation but for a variety of reasons the claim had yet to be settled. These range from the many cases where successful applicants have yet to submit the details of their claims to the few where a final assessment has been made but not yet accepted.</p>

	<p pid=".928W.2/1">The available information on the number of searches is set out in the table. Prisoners are required to undergo strip searches in a number of circumstances, including whenever they pass through reception on their way into or out of prison establishments; prior to providing a sample of urine for a mandatory drugs test (MDT); and in connection with routine and targeted strip searches. A percentage of prisoners are strip searched before and after visits, and prisoners may also be strip searched at any time when it is believed that they may be concealing unauthorised articles. Prisoners in the Health Care Centre and Detox Units at Holloway prison may also be strip searched if staff believe they may be concealing articles which could be used to harm themselves or others.</p>
	<p pid=".928W.2/2">In my written answer on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-03">3 July 2001</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2001-07-03.99W"><i>Official Report,</i> column 99W</phrase>, to my hon. Friend, I referred to the consideration being given to upgrading the prisoner database to provide statistical recording and monitoring of strip searches. That work is still continuing. In the meantime, the position at Holloway is that a register is maintained of strip searches associated with visits. A separate register is maintained of prisoners undergoing MDT. Cell searches are recorded on the appropriate form. However, while movement through reception will be recorded against the individual prisoner's record on the Local Inmate Database System, there is no requirement to record strip searches conducted in reception.</p>
	<p pid=".928W.2/3">It is not possible to identify the unauthorised articles for every find, but the principal finds at Holloway have been of drugs and tablets, tobacco, jewellery, telephone cards, cash, confectionery and unauthorised correspondence. In 1998 and 2000, there were also instances of weapons being discovered in searches prior to MDT.</p>

Life sentenced prisoners have their own sentence planning system. Juveniles (under 18s) have equivalent training plans.</p>
	<p pid=".932W.5/2">The Prison Service sentence planning system is designed to co-ordinate the efforts of different individuals and agencies involved with the prisoner. It is used to help prepare prisoners for safe release and to make best use of the prisoner's time. It does this by encouraging them to address the reasons for their offending behaviour and by giving planned experience of work, training and education. Targets are set and progress reviewed at specified intervals. All prisoners involved in sentence planning are subject to a period of supervision under licence by the probation service after release.</p>
	<p pid=".932W.5/3">Short-sentence prisoners, not covered by sentence planning, are still subject to various assessments. All prisoners have a health care assessment on reception and then, during induction, staff will begin to assess prisoners for drug treatment needs, education and resettlement needs.</p>
	<p pid=".932W.5/4">A new system to assess prisoner risk and need, target interventions and plan for prisoners' release is currently being piloted.</p>

	<p pid=".937W.8/1">The system of military law, delivered through the Services' disciplinary processes which include courts martial, upholds the discipline structure inherent throughout the armed forces, and underpins tri-Service doctrine and the military chain of command that are both necessary for good order and operational effectiveness to be maintained. The military courts martial system has the statutory power and capability to deal with all but the most serious of criminal cases in the UK, subject to discussion over jurisdiction rights with appropriate civilian law agencies. Overseas, the military courts martial system has the power to deal with all military and civilian criminal cases, subject to agreement with the local authorities over jurisdiction rights. The benefit of transferring the most serious criminal cases to the ordinary courts allows a balance to be maintained between the military and civilian judicial systems. The costs of service courts martial accrue across the entire military system and are part of the running costs of each of the Services. It is therefore not possible to quote a figure separately for the military courts martial system.</p>

	<p pid=".937W.11/1">The system for administering discipline in the armed forces is kept under review, with the principal vehicle for any legislative changes that may be necessary being the five-yearly Armed Forces Acts. The Armed Forces Act 1996 made substantial changes in order to reinforce the independence of courts martial, and these came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-01">1 April 1997</phrase>. Further changes on this scale were not considered necessary as a result of the most recent review, which led to the Armed Forces Act 2001, not least because the procedures introduced in 1997 have worked very well.</p>
	<p pid=".937W.11/2">We have announced the intention to replace the present legislative framework for the armed forces, particularly the separate discipline Acts for each of the three services, with a single tri-service Act. The work on this will provide a further opportunity to consider whether changes are required to the overall system of discipline, including courts martial, but the key consideration will be to ensure that it continues to underpin operational effectiveness.</p>

Funds are bid for against (a) upgrade projects and (b) planned and response repairs. DHE's Areas and Regions produce planned maintenance programmes for a minimum of three years ahead and funds secured are delegated to Regions and thence the Areas according to a number of factors including numbers and condition of properties and levels of statutory and mandatory work. Area Property Managers manage expenditure using the services of a commercially contracted Works Services Management company.

The subsequent survey, completed in 1998, revealed that the extent of the work required was considerably more than originally estimated. It was therefore agreed that DHE would be set an achievable but challenging key target of achieving Standard 1 for Condition for core properties by November 2005.

The latest figures available, for August 2001, indicate that 529 properties were overdue for testing. This is due to problems with gaining access to carry out the necessary inspections. The figure tends to vary over the year due to factors such as holiday seasons or during military operations when families left behind often take the opportunity to visit relatives.</p>

RAF Menwith Hill is also the site for the European Relay Ground Station, which is part of the US Space Based Infra-Red System (SBIRS). SBIRS will be a world-wide satellite based system designed to provide early warning of ballistic missile launch. It will replace the ageing US Defence Support Programme (DSP) satellite system, which has for some years contributed to the security of the UK and NATO. Information on detailed operations at the base is withheld under Exemption 1 (Defence, Security and International Relations) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.</p>

Normal retirement age is dependant upon grade, and an extract from MOD's Personnel Manual follows which lists them. About two-thirds of the work force, mainly those in support, technical and industrial grades, can retire at 60 but have the option to work to age 65. The balance, mainly managerial and professional grades, have a normal retirement age of 60.

	<p pid=".946W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Robert Walmsley to Mr. Mike Hancock, dated <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-15">15 October 2001</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".946W.2/3" class="indent">I am replying to your questions to the Secretary of State for Defence on the British Army's next generation anti-armour weapon programme. The programme to which you refer is the Next Generation Light anti-Armour Weapon, known as NLAW. These matters fall within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".946W.2/4" class="indent">The companies, which have submitted bids to meet this requirement, are SAAB Bofors Dynamics AB and Matra BAe Dynamics (UK) Ltd. Neither are wholly UK owned companies, however, Matra BAe Dynamics (UK) Ltd. is a UK registered company jointly owned by BAE Systems and EADs. BAE Systems also have a shareholding in SAAB Bofors Dynamics parent company.</p>
	<p pid=".946W.2/5" class="indent">The final cost of the NLAW contract is subject to negotiation, but it is expected to be in the order of &pound;400m. The tender closing date was <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-21">21 September 2001</phrase> and it is anticipated that the contract will be let next year. The contract could run for up to 25 years, if all the in-service support options are selected, but it is expected that the Development and Production elements will be complete by 2009.</p>

	<p pid=".949W.2/2">The Ministry of Defence values the views of the Independent Assessor and has taken on board the three recommendations he made in his latest Report. Details of compensation awards as a result of helicopter activity are now sent to the Commander of the Joint Helicopter Force (Northern Ireland) so that pilots can be made aware of the financial impact their actions can have. Headquarters Northern Ireland (HQNI) are also considering how best the Community Awareness Training might be evaluated by an independent body and are looking at a number of agencies that may be able to carry out this task. The emphasis on informal resolution of complaints remains a priority for HQNI and they continue to work closely with the Civil Representatives from the Northern Ireland Office in achieving this goal.</p>

	<p pid=".950W.2/1">I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on <phrase class="date" code="2001-07-19">19 July 2001</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2001-07-19.334W"><i>Official Report,</i> columns 334&ndash;5W</phrase>, to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1001" name="Helen Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones)</phrase> in which I advised the House that, in parallel with the work on the Defence Training Review, the Naval Recruiting and Training Agency had conducted a comprehensive review of its training estate. As a result, work has been started on the development of the Integrated Maritime Warfare School at HMS Collingwood, in Fareham, which will deliver maritime warfare training from a single site and encompass the warfare training currently undertaken at HMS Dryad. Under this programme, as I advised the House at the time, HMS Dryad will become surplus to requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".950W.2/2">The target date for closure is no later than 2011, but it is planned to transfer elements of training from HMS Dryad to HMS Collingwood progressively over the next few years, with a view to achieving an earlier closure if possible. This will help us to maximise the operational and financial benefits from the Naval Recruiting and Training Agency's estate rationalisation programme. While the closure of Dryad is expected to result in a reduction of some 70 Service and 40 MOD civilian posts in the NRTA, this will be more than offset by the proposed move of elements of Fleet to HMS Excellent, which will take place before the closure of HMS Dryad. Taken together these two proposals are expected to produce a net increase of about 25 Service and 60 civilian posts in the Portsmouth area.</p>
	<p pid=".950W.2/3">Detailed proposals for all the above measures will be subject to normal consultative procedures at the appropriate time.</p>

	<p pid=".957W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence has no special plans to agree compensation provisions for fishermen excluded from the fishing grounds in Luce Bay, Wigtownshire. When compensation claims are submitted, they are considered on the basis of whether or not the Ministry of Defence has a legal liability to pay compensation. Where there is a legal liability to pay compensation, we do so.</p>
	<p pid=".957W.2/2">One claim for compensation has been received from a fisherman alleging a loss of earnings caused by his exclusion from fishing grounds in Luce Bay. On investigation, it was determined that in excluding this individual from the area for reasons of safety, the range authorities were acting within their legal rights as laid down in the relevant local bye-laws. As a result, liability was denied and no compensation has been paid.</p>

	<p pid=".960W.6/1">The employment of qualified lawyers and support staff in the armed forces, and the organisation of the individual service legal branches, varies greatly.</p>

	<p pid=".960W.6/13">The Royal Navy does not have a dedicated legal branch. Instead, qualified naval barristers are employed in legal posts throughout the service. In the year 2000, there were 21 legal posts of which 17 were filled by barristers. The remaining 16 lawyers will have been employed in normal naval duties afloat and ashore. Unfortunately, no such statistics exist for the years 1980 and 1990. It is estimated that between one third and one half of the qualified legal personnel will have been involved in court martial proceedings as a part of their duties.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.6/14">As the naval service does not possess a dedicated legal department, there are no dedicated support staff. It is estimated that about 12 senior and junior RN ratings would have supported the various naval barristers whose work included court martial proceedings. In 1996, a dedicated court martial management cell was established specifically to administer courts martial, consisting of five service and civilian support personnel.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.6/15">The Army&mdash;in both 1980 and 1990, the lawyer strength of the Adjutant General Corps Army Legal Services (AGC(ALS)), formerly the Army Legal Corps, was approximately 53, with the number of these involved in court martial related work estimated as 32. The lawyer strength for 2000 is 97. It is estimated that about 25 to 30 support staff existed in the years 1980 and 1990, and that there were approximately 72 support staff in the year 2000. The exact figures cannot be quoted as a number of the support staff were locally employed personnel at overseas stations, and the figures are not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".960W.6/16">In April 1997 the Army Prosecuting Authority (APA) was formed, with two branches&mdash;one in the UK, the other in Germany. The total strength of the APA during the year 2000 dealing with courts martial was:</p>

It is estimated that the number of RAF legal support staff has remained constant at approximately 13 (one NCO and 12 civilians) for each of the dates requested.</p>

	<p pid=".972W.5/1">We are committed to pursuing concrete steps to counter terrorism in a number of international fora, including the UN, NATO and the European Union. As the Prime Minister said in the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-04">4 October 2001</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2001-10-04.671"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 671&ndash;75</phrase>, he and the Foreign Secretary have been in intensive contact with foreign leaders from every part of the world over the past few weeks. The Prime Minister visited Berlin, Paris, New York and Washington on 19&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-09-21">21 September</phrase>; Moscow, Islamabad and New Delhi on 4&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">6 October</phrase>; and Oman and Cairo on 10&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">12 October</phrase>; and the Foreign Secretary visited Jordan, Iran, Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt on 24&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">27 September</phrase> as part of the effort to build a strong international coalition against terrorism.</p>
	<p pid=".972W.5/2">We are also taking action in international institutions:</p>
	<p pid=".972W.5/3">UN Security Council resolution 1368 was adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-12">12 September</phrase>. The Council unanimously expressed its readiness to take all necessary steps in response to the attacks. The resolution also stated that the Council would hold accountable those indirectly responsible for these acts&mdash;those who aid, support or harbour the perpetrators&mdash;as well as those directly responsible. On <phrase class="date" code="">28 September</phrase>, the Council adopted resolution 1373, which contained a series of measures to tackle the roots of terrorism. In particular, it stated that all countries should target terrorist finances and ensure that no safe haven is provided to any known terrorist organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".972W.5/4">Also on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-12">12 September</phrase>, the North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed that if the attack against the US was directed from abroad it should be regarded as an action covered by Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Article 5 is the collective self-defence commitment at the core of NATO, under which the Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them shall be considered an attack against them all. On <phrase class="date" code="">2 October</phrase> the US briefed the NAC on the results of their investigations. Lord Robertson, the NATO Secretary General, concluded that it was now clear that the attack had been directed from overseas and that Article 5 was therefore now operational. This is the first time in the history of NATO that Article 5 has been invoked, and is the strongest possible signal of Allied solidarity in the face of the attacks on the US. NATO's North Atlantic Council has now agreed material assistance to the US, including the use of AWACS early warning aircraft.</p>
	<p pid=".972W.5/5">The Heads of State and Government of the European Union at the Special European Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-21">21 September</phrase> expressed their total support of the American people in the face of the deadly terrorist attacks. They agreed to co-operate with the US in bringing to justice and punishing the perpetrators, sponsors and accomplices of such barbaric acts. The Council also approved a concrete set of measures to combat terrorism, including enhancing police and judicial co-operation, developing international legal instruments, putting an end to the funding of terrorism and strengthening aviation security. The General Affairs Council on <phrase class="date" code="">8 October</phrase> confirmed the EU's strong support for US and UK military action.</p>
	<p pid=".972W.5/6">We will continue our diplomatic effort in the coming weeks to strengthen international efforts against terrorism.</p>

	<p pid=".975W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, is in regular dialogue with her counterparts in the European Union and candidate countries on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. I frequently raise the importance of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy with European Union and other Governments, as do other members of the Government including the Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.</p>
	<p pid=".975W.2/2">Our goals are reduction of the costs of the Common Agricultural Policy and better delivery of policy outcomes. We want to reduce the overall burden of the Common Agricultural Policy, align European Union and world prices more closely, and target support measures on the rural economy and the environment. These are also important for our ambitions for a new World Trade Organisation round for enlargement of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid=".975W.2/3">There has been progress. In the 1980s spending on the Common Agricultural Policy was over 60 per cent. of European Community budget. In 2001 it will be around 45 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".975W.2/4">As a result of the Agenda 2000 package agreed by Heads of State at the 1999 Berlin European Council, spending on the Common Agricultural Policy will decline in real terms for 2002. Mid-term reviews of the Common Agricultural Policy are scheduled for 2002&ndash;03. The Government's objective is to secure changes that benefit consumers, taxpayers, the rural economy, the farming community and the environment. There is increasing recognition within the European Union of the need for reform.</p>

We have established the Learning and Skills Council to drive this forward and have put in place a number of measures which provide the support and incentives young people need to take up and succeed in learning. We are introducing the new Connexions Service to provide advice and guidance to young people on the full range of learning options open to them and to help them progress within their chosen learning environment. We are also addressing the financial barriers to participation through piloting the Education Maintenance Allowance Scheme; providing Discretionary Funding targeted at specific learner needs, and the Connexions Card, which offers discounts on transport and learning materials.</p>

It is the responsibility of LEAs to set term dates and to ensure that schools must deliver a minimum of 380 half day sessions in the school year and that they must open for at least 190 days in each year. Under exceptional circumstances where school opening has been delayed for a short time, as a result of delayed building works or other urgent health and safety related grounds, we would expect LEAs to encourage schools to use training days to avoid defaulting on the number of sessions delivered. We expect LEAs and schools to programme building works in a way that minimises disruption; however, building work can still be delayed through unforeseen problems or inclement weather.</p>

	<p pid=".992W.9/1">Our network of 685 specialist schools shows that applicant schools across the country, including those from rural and inner city areas, have raised the sponsorship required, but we are aware some schools find this more difficult than others. It would not be practicable to make an estimate of the number of schools that have been unable to raise the funds but we have taken steps to ensure all schools have reasonable opportunity to do so. In 1999, the sponsorship requirement was halved to &pound;50,000 and my Department grant-aids the Technology Colleges and Youth Sport Trusts, to provide advice to schools about raising sponsorship and raise funds themselves to support applicant schools. In addition we will continue to keep the sponsorship criteria under review.</p>

Registration will be a requirement if a teacher wishes to be employed in a maintained school or non-maintained special school; those who are not registered will be unable to teach in these categories of school. The GTC is responsible for regulating the conduct of teachers, an important element in raising the profession's self esteem and standing with the general public and promoting the profile of teaching. The GTC also provides advice on a range of professional issues to Government and others. In framing advice, we expect it to consult its members, thus providing an opportunity for registered teachers to influence education policy development. The GTC's advice on teachers' professional development and workload has already proved valuable.</p>

	<p pid=".997W.0/1">The conduct of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service in respect of Mr. Sweeting is as follows. On <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-16">16 April 2001</phrase>, at 0220 hours, Mr. Sweeting was arrested after being found in possession of an air rifle in a public place. The police charged him with an offence, contrary to section 16A of the Firearms Act 1968, of possession of a firearm with intent to cause another to believe that unlawful violence would be used.</p>
	<p pid=".997W.0/2">Mr. Sweeting appeared before Torbay magistrates court later that morning. The police provided the Crown Prosecution Service with a file relating to the arrest of Mr. Sweeting. The Crown Prosecutor, in accordance with his duties under the code for Crown Prosecutors, determined that there was not a realistic prospect of a conviction in respect of the offence charged, and the charge was accordingly replaced with one under section 4A of the Public Order Act 1986, using threatening behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress.</p>
	<p pid=".997W.0/3">Mr. Sweeting's case was adjourned until <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-15">15 May 2001</phrase>, and the Crown Prosecutor requested further information from the police. Upon receipt of that information, the file was reviewed again, and the Crown Prosecutor decided that there was no realistic prospect of convicting Mr. Sweeting of the offence contrary to section 4A of the Public Order Act. After discussion with the police, it was decided that the case should, therefore, be discontinued, and formal discontinuance was effected by a letter of <phrase class="date" code="2001-05-14">14 May 2001</phrase>.</p>

We have made efforts to publish bills in draft so that they can be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny, which in itself allows greater public involvement in the legislative process.

In assessing a proposal, due regard is given to the scale and nature of the improvements as well as the length of the tenancy, whether a farm business tenancy or Agricultural Holding Act tenancy.</p>

	<p pid=".1005W.6/3">There have been no cases of foot and mouth on any of the Duchy Estates although one farm in Whitewell was culled owing to a 'dangerous contact'. Form D Notices restricting animal movements have affected a number of Duchy tenants. The Duchy has maintained a close watch on tenants who are considered to be vulnerable throughout the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Duchy officials are always available to talk and discuss a tenant's concerns on a confidential basis.</p>
	<p pid=".1005W.6/4">The Duchy of Lancaster maintains a policy of sympathetic treatment of any tenant who is in genuine difficulty owing to external circumstances beyond their control and adversely affecting their business. Each individual case is looked at on its own merits and circumstances. Measures that have been taken include rental reduction, rebates and deferrals. The Duchy is also assisting some tenants financially who have chosen to take early retirement rather than continue within the agricultural industry.</p>

	<p pid=".1011W.2/1">Information on the normal retirement age and on compulsory early retirement or severance for my Department and for the executive agencies and public sector bodies for which it is responsible is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.2/2">The normal age of retirement for staff in all grades below the Senior Civil Service is 60 years. This is also the minimum age at which there can be retirement with full superannuation benefits. Retention beyond age 60 is possible subject to departmental needs and the continued health and efficiency of the individual member of staff.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.2/3">Staff in the most junior grades who satisfy these criteria may continue in service until they reach the age of 65 years. Others who have not completed 20 years' reckonable service at age 60 may continue in post until they reach the age of 65 or complete 20 years' service, whichever occurs first.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.2/4">Service beyond these limits to a maximum of 70 years is possible at management discretion. The Cabinet Office does not retain permanent employees beyond age 70 although it may be willing to consider a case in exceptional circumstances to meet an essential departmental need.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.2/5">The Senior Civil Service has a common compulsory retirement age of 60 years in all departments. Retention beyond this age may be allowed if in the public interest and subject to departmental needs and the continued health and efficiency of an individual.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.2/6">Government Office regional staff continue as members of their parent Departments and as such remain subject to their retirement policies in respect of age, compulsory early retirement or severance.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.2/7">Retirement policies in the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Government Car and Despatch Agency and the Central Office of Information closely follow the Cabinet Office model, with analogous discretions allowing for extensions of service.</p>
	<p pid=".1011W.2/8">As a pre-redundancy measure volunteers may be offered retirement on compulsory terms to avoid compulsory redundancy procedures. Staff may also be retired on compulsory early retirement or severance terms on grounds of structure, and on compulsory early retirement terms on grounds of limited efficiency. Early retirement applies to staff aged 50 or over; early severance applies to staff aged under 50.</p>

	<p pid=".1021W.5/1">There are no new build or refurbishment projects for the HQ estate in the current year (excluding general fit out and maintenance work). There is however, one project due to start in the next financial year, this will be to refurbish Clive House in London. The contract is due to be let in May 2002, with works to be undertaken between November 2002 and November 2003. The budget for this refurbishment is &pound;24 million, including works, fees and VAT, although this is being funded by the landlord under a private developer scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.5/2">Within the Court Service and associated offices, building and refurbishment schemes planned for the current financial year are in table 1.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.5/3">The programme for 2002&ndash;03 has yet to be determined but schemes that will be carried forward from this financial year are listed.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.5/4">Financial support is also provided to local authorities who have procured Private Finance Initiative contracts for the delivery of new and refurbished magistrates courthouses. During the current year, six new courthouses (arising from two contracts signed in 1999&ndash;2000) have already, or will be, opened at Beverley (new build); Kidderminster (refurbishment); Worcester (new build). During 2002&ndash;03 the extensive refurbishment of Redditch Magistrates Court will be completed. The total capital investment by the private sector in these facilities is &pound;48 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.5/5">The Department also provides funding to local authorities in the form of capital grant to undertake maintenance and necessary refurbishment works within magistrates courts. This funding is allocated to local authorities, so the Department does not undertake the works, nor are they directly benefited. The funds allocated in the current year for refurbishments in magistrates courts in England and Wales are in table 2.</p>
	<p pid=".1021W.5/6">The capital allocations for 2002&ndash;03 have yet to be determined, however there is a further &pound;427,000 allocated to support the schemes approved in 2001&ndash;02.</p>

	<p pid=".1023W.8/1">The Legal Services Commission continues to support mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) for both family and non-family disputes. The number of mediations has been increasing steadily, and there were 9,076 family mediations in the period April 2000 to March 2001. The Funding Code's decision-making guidance encourages the use of ADR, especially where it avoids lengthy, contested proceedings in court.</p>
	<p pid=".1023W.8/2">The Legal Services Commission has worked with Mediation UK and other bodies to develop a quality standard for both family and community mediation services. The Mediation Quality Mark standard has been published for consultation. The closing date for responses is <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-02">2 November 2001</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1023W.8/3">There is also a leaflet on ADR in the recently issued series of Community Legal Service information leaflets.</p>

	<p pid=".1024W.8/1">In general there are no particular problems recruiting or retaining enough magistrates. Over 5,000 applied to be Justices last year. However, it is harder to recruit or retain people in some areas than in others and it is necessary to encourage people from all walks of life to apply. That is why my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor's officials are considering how to develop a national strategy that will encourage more people to apply from as wide a cross section of the community as possible. Advisory Committees try to be flexible to accommodate magistrates having difficulties and considering resigning, and the Lord Chancellor expects courts to try to accommodate Justices who may be seeking to combine public service with family or work commitments. The minimum requirement is for 26 half- day sittings, that being the minimum number of sittings to ensure magistrates keep their knowledge and skills current.</p>
	<p pid=".1024W.8/2">Training is of course necessary to equip magistrates to discharge their responsibilities effectively. The amount of training required differs from person to person and depends on identified needs but there is a core syllabus delivered to all magistrates locally.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-10-15.6768.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2001-10-15.1033W.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/737" speakername="Hazel Blears" colnum="1033W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmhansrd/vo011015/text/11015w61.htm#11015w61.html_spnew0">
	<p pid=".1033W.0/1">A health needs assessment tool (HNAT) was developed by Parkside Health national health service trust for use by health visitors to assist in the prioritisation of workload. An initial stage of development included focus groups that included both health visitors and their clients, prior to its piloting with 452 clients.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/2">The HNAT does not require the recording of a client's name and address; instead it uses a master patient index number to link information gathered using this tool with the client's case notes, with which it is retained. No information from the HNAT is entered on Parkside Health NHS trust's electronic Community Information System. For a five-month period, a paper-based report which included master patient index numbers was compiled for monitoring purposes. In April 2000 this practice was identified locally as a potential breach of patient confidentiality and was discontinued immediately, and all documentation destroyed. All NHS trusts have been issued guidance relating to patient confidentiality and to the Data Protection Act 1998 and in upholding the Act are accountable to the Data Protection Registrar.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/3">Parkside Health NHS trust commissioned an independent evaluation of the HNAT from Professor Sarah Cowley of the Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery, King's College, London. Professor Cowley presented her findings to the trust and its staff on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-15">15 March 2001</phrase>. The trust established a working group of health visitors that informed the development of an action plan to address issues identified by Professor Cowley; the NHS London Regional Office is monitoring implementation of this action plan.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/4">As part of that action plan, Parkside NHS trust and its partner organisations are planning a conference for staff and clients that will explore the health visitor's role including needs assessment issues.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/5">Any specific evidence of poor management practice at an NHS trust not being resolved through local policies and procedures brought to the Department's attention would elicit prompt, appropriate action to remedy the situation. I have asked the NHS London Regional Office to follow up with Parkside Health NHS trust whether there are any identifiable issues within what I understand to be one of Professor Cowley's working papers rather than a formal report and to advise me whether such action is necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/6">Following Professor Cowley's report, Parkside NHS trust wrote to all health visitor staff on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-26">26 April 2001</phrase> indicating that HNAT was still in a developmental stage and that they may choose to use it as part of their assessment and prioritisation of client needs but are under no compulsion to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".1033W.0/7">The trust has a policy on violence in the workplace that specifically addresses safety on home visits; this has recently been updated. There have been no reports made to the trust of violence connected with use of the HNAT; any such report would be taken seriously and investigated as required under trust policies.</p>

These issues can be raised by and with the national health service nurse at the time that the registered nursing care contribution is carried out.</p>

	<p pid=".1045W.2/1">There is much published information to show that the successful treatment of anaemia in renal disease can improve patients' well-being and their quality of life. The majority of renal patients require epoetin to attain recommended haemoglobin levels. Data on the availability of epoetin are collected in surveys commissioned by the Department of Health. The last survey was conducted in 1998 and the results were published last year in the 3rd annual report from the United Kingdom Renal Registry (copies available in the Library). This showed that 74 per cent. of all dialysis patients were being prescribed epoetin.</p>

	<p pid=".1048W.6/2">The climate change levy, including climate change agreements, is expected to deliver reductions of 5MtC per annum by 2010. The levy is, overall, revenue neutral in that the receipts are being recycled to business through a 0.3 percentage point reduction in national insurance contributions and a programme of assistance to business to improve energy efficiency. The levy was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-01">1 April 2001</phrase> and it is therefore too early to monitor impact. The operation of the levy will be kept under review.</p>

The UK's baseline projections, that include the effect of some policies that have been introduced since Kyoto in 1997, estimate that the UK's emissions could be about 15 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010.

	<p pid=".1049W.2/3">The Government have also made good progress towards implementing the policies and measures that were set out in the climate change programme. For example, the climate change levy package has been introduced, the Carbon Trust and the Climate Change Projects Office have been set up; substantial funds have been made available to support renewable energy projects; and a draft framework for a greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme was published in May, with trading due to begin in April 2002. The Government are also offering an incentive of &pound;215 million over five years to companies joining the scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".1050W.0/1">The Royal Society's report is a valuable contribution to the debate on how to respond to the threat of climate change. In particular we share the Society's view that, because of the finite size, uncertainty and potential reversibility, sink enhancement should not divert resources from technologies which reduce emissions. We also agree with the Society that steps should be taken to manage forests and crops in a way that protects and enhances their role as a carbon sink in a manner compatible with other goals of sustainable development, and accept the need to increase accuracy of monitoring and verification of land sinks. The Society's conclusions are consistent with the policy that the UK pursues in the international climate negotiations, and with UK policies for sustainable agriculture and forestry. We congratulate the Society on timely publication of the report shortly before the successful resumption of the climate change negotiations in July.</p>

The rates are based on figures published in the &quot;OECD Environmental Data, Compendium 1999&quot;. The OECD publication does not include recycling rates and the figures given have been estimated from the information available. Comparisons between countries should be made with caution. There are doubts about comparability for a number of countries because of missing data, differences in the year, coverage and definitions (e.g. of recycling, municipal waste). Such differences, where they are known, are set out in the notes to the table.</p>

	<p pid=".1053W.2/1">We have put in place statutory performance standards on recycling that all local authorities must achieve by 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06. We have also said that we would look again at longer-term targets in the light of what local authorities are able to achieve and in the light of any technological developments.</p>
	<p pid=".1053W.2/2">The Spending Review 2000 announced the framework for the Government's support to local authorities for the next three years up to 2003&ndash;04. This included an annual increase in the revenue support to local authorities for Environmental Protection and Cultural Services (EPCS), which includes waste management efforts. By 2003&ndash;04 this support will have risen by &pound;1.1 billion over the 2000&ndash;01 provision. Consistent with the general local authority financial framework, it is for Essex County Council to decide the proportion of their budget that should be directed to waste management work.</p>
	<p pid=".1053W.2/3">In addition to general support to local authority revenue expenditure, the spending review provided &pound;140 million of Government grant for waste management work and &pound;220 million for Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) resources, for waste projects. We will shortly consult on how the &pound;140 million grant should be distributed. At this stage it is not possible to identify what funding Essex County Council might receive from this source.</p>
	<p pid=".1053W.2/4">Local Public Service Agreements also provide opportunities for authorities to commit themselves to exceeding the statutory recycling targets and to be rewarded with additional resources for doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".1053W.2/5">We have also established the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to promote sustainable waste management by working to create stable markets for recycled materials and products and remove barriers to waste minimisation, re-use and recycling. A stable and efficient market for recycled materials will help local authorities in their efforts to meet their statutory performance targets.</p>

	<p pid=".1054W.5/3">Blisters or vesicles are normally caused by the foot and mouth disease virus. It is the presence of ulcers and other mouth lesions that may cause difficulties in diagnosis. This is because lesions caused by the foot and mouth disease virus heal quickly in sheep and may not be present to aid a diagnosis whereas lesions due to other causes take longer to heal. To aid the diagnosis of foot and mouth disease, descriptions of some of the more common mouth lesions found in sheep, not caused by the foot and mouth disease virus, have been published in recent months in the veterinary literature.</p>
	<p pid=".1054W.5/4">Because of the need to cull animals believed to have foot and mouth disease within 24 hours to prevent the spread of disease, cases of foot and mouth disease must be confirmed on clinical grounds, without the benefit of laboratory results. A veterinary officer may order the slaughter of susceptible livestock on suspicion of disease in circumstances where the symptoms are suggestive of foot and mouth disease but not sufficiently consistent to confirm disease on clinical grounds.</p>

	<p pid=".1057W.5/2">There is no evidence on which to base a level at which dioxins are potentially lethal to humans. Studies on humans who have been exposed to high levels of dioxins as a result of accidents or occupational exposure have reported a range of effects such as chloracne, an increased risk of cancer, changes in biochemical parameters such as enzyme levels and increases in mortality from cardiovascular disease, although there remains uncertainty about the direct causal link with dioxins. It is not known exactly what level of dioxins the people in these studies were exposed to but body burdens were at least one order of magnitude higher than in the general population. The Committee on Toxicity (COT) is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the toxicity of dioxins and will report their findings later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".1057W.5/3">A mixture of dioxins is produced in incineration of waste&mdash;they are formed on particles as the gases leaving the incinerator cool down. The gas treatment system reduces the particles and dioxins levels to the limits prescribed in the Waste Incineration Directive (total concentration of dioxins and furans 0.1ng toxic equivalents/m <sup>3</sup> averaged over 6&ndash;8 hours). Disposal of material contaminated with dioxins&mdash;such as fly ash&mdash;is normally to special landfill where they are contained, do not leach, and will pose no risk to health or the environment.</p>

The UK Government have an additional domestic goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. The Government have not yet set any targets for later years.</p>

	<p pid=".1060W.9/1">The report from the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution recommends that the Government should now adopt a strategy that puts the UK on a path to reducing carbon dioxide emissions by some 60 per cent. from current levels by about 2050. The UK Climate Change Programme recognises that emissions reductions of 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. globally may be needed to avoid dangerous climate change, and that developed countries may eventually have to make even greater emissions reductions. Emissions reductions of this magnitude can only be achieved by international action involving a series of commitments of which the Kyoto agreement is but the first step. The Government have provided a clear signal of the UK's intentions by setting a domestic goal of reducing CO <sub>2</sub> emissions by 20 per cent. below the 1990 by 2010. This goal goes well beyond the UK's obligation under the Kyoto Protocol and signals the UK's commitment to the long term process. The measures that could achieve the 20 per cent. CO <sub>2</sub> reduction are set out in the UK's Climate Change Programme published in November 2000. The Government are currently conducting a wider review of energy policy which encompasses technologies for emissions reduction in the longer term. The energy review is due to be completed at the end of 2001 and will contribute to the Government's response possibly early in 2002 to the specific recommendations in the report from the Royal Commission.</p>

The study includes a direct investigation of the effects of the herbicide management systems associated with the GMHT crops on soil-dwelling invertebrates such as spiders, beetles and Collembola, and indirect investigation of the effects on the activity of some species of earthworms.</p>

	<p pid=".1065W.9/2">Liability for any loss that might arise as a result of the use of GM crops is an important issue, which is being addressed at both European and UK levels. The European Commission issued a working paper in late July with proposals for an environmental liability regime to cover a range of activities, including for GMOs. We are considering these proposals, which cover damage to biodiversity and damage that creates serious harm to human health. Given the support expressed at last December's Environment Council by member states to the principle of a directive in this area and to the idea of including GMOs, it is likely that GMOs, and therefore the cultivation of GM crops, will be covered by any new directive.</p>
	<p pid=".1065W.9/3">I am also considering the issue of any domestic liability provisions for GM crops that might be needed in the light of the Commission's wider proposals. I am not in a position to provide any further detail at present.</p>

	<p pid=".1066W.5/3">The GM rape and beet in the evaluations are being grown in England under research (Part B) consents issued by this Department. The consents specify the disposal arrangements. The GM Inspectorate act on behalf of the Secretary of State to monitor compliance with these conditions. They have powers to require applicants to comply and to take remedial action to safeguard human health and the environment if necessary. There are also powers to prosecute where it seems an offence has occurred.</p>
	<p pid=".1066W.5/4">The GM maize in the evaluations has a Europe-wide approval for cultivation under Directive 90/220; this does not impose any conditions on the growing or disposal of the crop. Under the farm-scale evaluations agreement, SCIMAC, the industry body, has responsibility for the disposal of the GM crops in the evaluations and to ensure they are not used as fodder for animals. At harvest the maize plants are removed from the site and then either taken to landfill or chopped up and incorporated into the soil away from the trial site.</p>

	<p pid=".1068W.5/2">The Government have set challenging statutory recycling targets for local authorities. It is likely that in order to meet these targets many more local authorities will decide to introduce kerbside separation of household waste. In light of that, we will decide later whether or not to make separation at source mandatory.</p>

	<p pid=".1068W.8/2">The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) leads on renewable energy issues. In its Preliminary Consultation on the Renewables Obligation, it proposed that although it will make only a small contribution, energy from the biodegradable fraction of waste, including waste incineration, should count towards the renewable energy target. However, this would not receive support under the Renewables Obligation. In view of the Select Committee's comments, DEFRA is currently reconsidering this and other issues with DTI. DTI will shortly publish the Statutory Consultation document detailing the revised proposals.</p>

	<p pid=".1069W.3/2">Fly ash containing air pollution control residues is generally classified by the Environment Agency as a &quot;special waste&quot;. This means that its consignment from an incinerator, and any subsequent transfers as a waste, are subject to the requirements of the Special Waste Regulations 1996 and the duty of care imposed by section 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.3/3">Under the Special Waste Regulations, each consignment of special waste must be pre-notified to the Environment Agency and must be accompanied by a consignment note which describes its hazardous properties.</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.3/4">The Environment Agency does not have a legal duty to enforce the duty of care under section 34 of the 1990 Act but has a right of access to the records held by those subject to it. The guidance in DOE Circular 19/91 (paragraph 35) envisages that the Agency will pursue breaches of section 34 and seek access to these records where it suspects (a) that waste has not been transferred to an &quot;authorised person&quot; or (b) an actual or potential breach of section 33 of the 1990 Act.</p>
	<p pid=".1069W.3/5">However, there are circumstances in which waste may cease to be a waste (eg it is used in the manufacture of building products) and at this point the Environment Agency's responsibilities for the enforcement of waste management controls also cease.</p>

This problem is being tackled through the recruitment of additional installers and the training of 800 new engineers to work under the scheme. These measures have led to major improvements in the speed of work with over 2,800 boiler installations completed in June 2001, compared to 590 in January.</p>

	<p pid=".1078W.6/1">We are very conscious of the need to reduce bureaucracy. While some regulation is unavoidable if the Government are to safeguard public and animal health, environmental matters or public funds, the aim is to keep regulation to a minimum. A major programme of work to streamline processes has been under way for the last 18 months since my right hon. Friend the former Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food asked the industry to identify particular problem areas. In Europe, too, we continue to seek greater simplification of regulations affecting farmers.</p>
	<p pid=".1078W.6/2">Money has been saved in direct costs to industry as well as time saved in paperwork&mdash;for example, by implementing a simplified procedure for granting &quot;own-use&quot; approvals for imports of pesticides with a reduced fee, by streamlining intervention procedures and by better co-ordinated cattle inspections. We continue to implement the remaining recommendations from the Red Tape Reviews and the Better Regulation Task Force report on Environmental Regulation and Farmers.</p>

	<p pid=".1080W.8/2">Landfill site operators can contribute a proportion of landfill tax revenue to a range of projects via the landfill tax credit scheme. Under the rules of the scheme, local authorities cannot receive funding from this source. However, the hon. Member may be interested to note that up to <phrase class="date" code="2001-08-31">31 August 2001</phrase>, 15 Environmental Bodies (EB's) based in the county of Essex had spent approximately &pound;1.2 million on sustainable waste management related projects.</p>
	<p pid=".1080W.8/3">The Government's policy, as set out in 'Waste Strategy 2000', is that the landfill tax credit scheme should be delivering an increase in recycling. The Treasury has subsequently issued indicative guidelines which said spend on sustainable waste management projects should increase to 65 per cent. of the credits available through the scheme, with at least a third of this being spent on recycling projects.</p>
	<p pid=".1080W.8/4">In the 2001 Budget statement the Chancellor said that in the longer term the Government are attracted to replacing the scheme, in whole or in part, with a public expenditure programme. That remains the position, although we have made no decisions yet about abolishing or radically changing the existing scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".1084W.0/1">The development and testing of fish deterrent systems has been carried out by those interested in the operational side of power station cooling plants. The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science has not therefore been directly involved. Neither are we aware of the extent to which mitigation measures are applied around the country. This is a matter for the power station operators themselves.</p>
	<p pid=".1084W.0/2">The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science has worked with staff of the former CEGB and the Environment Agency in monitoring fish impingement in a number of coastal power stations since the early 1970s. In general, this monitoring has indicated that the mortality caused in marine fish by power stations is small by comparison with the widespread distribution of these species and the overriding impact of natural mortality and additional fishing mortality.</p>
	<p pid=".1084W.0/3">In 1983, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science conducted an investigation to estimate the losses of commercial fish species (sprat, herring, cod, whiting, dab, sole and plaice) at Sizewell 'A' power station. These fish kills were calculated to the between 0.01 and 0.08 per cent. of commercial catches in the southern North Sea. A further study of the mortality of juvenile bass at Kingsnorth power station in the Medway Estuary in 1987&ndash;88 concluded that the mortality of first year bass during peak impingement in autumn and winter was around 15 per cent. of the population in the immediate vicinity of the power station. This is significantly less than the percentage of juveniles which die as a result of predation, disease and even starvation in their first winter. The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science has since withdrawn from such monitoring.</p>
	<p pid=".1084W.0/4">To date, the Secretary of State has not held any meetings with her international counterparts about this particular problem.</p>
	<p pid=".1084W.0/5">The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science is not responsible for enforcement of the legislation relating to bass nursery areas. This is conducted by the Sea Fisheries Inspectorate, Sea Fisheries Committees and the Environment Agency.</p>

	<p pid=".1085W.8/2">Both the Over-30-Months (Slaughter) Scheme (OTMS) and the Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme are administered by the Intervention Board (IB).</p>
	<p pid=".1085W.8/3"><i>(a)</i> No applications are required to be made to IB in respect of OTMS. Entry to the scheme is via a booking system operated by participating abattoirs. The latest survey of this list shows that approximately 50,000 head have been booked in and are awaiting slaughter. This represents around three weeks throughput at current levels.</p>
	<p pid=".1085W.8/4"><i>(b)</i> All applications under Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme (LW(D)S) received at the Intervention Board are scrutinised by a team of experts from the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service (ADAS) within seven days of receipt. Each application is checked for eligibility and, if acceptable under the scheme, is prioritised for slaughter. An application for which no additional information is required will normally be slaughtered within about 14 days. In the most urgent of welfare cases slaughter can be arranged within 48 hours of application. Where there is insufficient information supporting the application or further clarification is required, the applicant is asked to provide this. In turn this may require applicants to seek information from other sources. The application will be approved or rejected once this information is available. The length of time it takes to reach that stage is dependent on the speed with which applicants reply to any request for further information.</p>

	<p pid=".1086W.2/1">When the Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme was opened in March, the Intervention Board said it would aim to make payments within 21 days of slaughter. There has been enormous demand for the scheme, with over 1.5 million animals having been slaughtered and over 15,000 claims amounting to &pound;175 million paid. The number of applications far exceeded all forecasts at the time the scheme was introduced. In addition, the increasing complexity of the eligibility rules as movement restrictions were lifted and the large number of points in the disposal chain from which documentation had to be returned have contributed to delays in payments of claims. These delays are regrettable but in the circumstances unavoidable.</p>
	<p pid=".1086W.2/2">I am pleased to say that the Intervention Board has now cleared its backlog of claims and is making payments on over 90 per cent. of claims which do not require any further investigation within 28 days of slaughter. Against the background of logistical difficulties and unanticipated volumes already referred to, payment of interest is not considered appropriate.</p>

To allow thorough assessment of these species throughout the year, several different national surveys are carried out regularly and are complemented by occasional special surveys.</p>

Several wetland birds, such as the bittern, aquatic warbler and reed bunting, are regarded as priority species under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, and Species Action Plans have been agreed that outline the conservation actions needed. The Government have taken a variety of steps to conserve wetland habitats, including designation as Ramsar sites, Special Protection Areas, and Sites (or Areas) of Special Scientific Interest.

	<p pid=".1092W.7/1">Our policy on the transport of live animals is rigorously to enforce the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 and to negotiate for the highest possible animal welfare standards on an EU-wide basis. We are currently pursuing this objective in EU Council Working Groups on both the EU Directive on the protection of animals during transport and the Regulation on the standards for vehicles used for the long distance transport of livestock. But where possible, we believe that meat, rather than live animals, should be transported over long distances.</p>

	<p pid=".1094W.0/1">We understand that the results of a study by the University of Wales at Aberystwyth into metal levels in river sediments deposited on floodplains in Swaledale have not yet been published. However, from the information so far available it appears that the lead levels found are similar to those found in previous studies in this area, where elevated levels of lead are sometimes found as a result of natural geology and historical mining activities. This is well known in the area and has been the subject of advice to local farmers in the past which has proved effective. Farmers can minimise risks to livestock from these deposits by simple good husbandry practices, to minimise the ingestion of soil by animals as they feed. The Food Standards Agency's standing advice is that these measures should also be effective in minimising any risks to consumers of foods produced by animals in these areas. The Veterinary Laboratories Agency have recorded no increases in livestock health problems that could be linked to the recent flooding.</p>
	<p pid=".1094W.0/2">A new European Commission Regulation ((EC) 466/2001), setting maximum limits for lead and cadmium in food and due to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-05">5 April 2002</phrase>, will introduce limits for cadmium in offal for the first time in the UK, and a lower limit for lead in offal than the current UK limit. The Food Standards Agency will be carrying out formal consultation on these proposals later this year. In parallel, it will be consulting Government and other stakeholders on whether any further guidance to farmers may be appropriate to help minimise any risks that offal from animals raised in areas where elevated levels of lead in soil occur could exceed these new limits.</p>
	<p pid=".1094W.0/3">The Department will assess the full results of this study when they are available, seeking advice from the Food Standards Agency on food safety issues. A risk assessment will be completed, and all the appropriate public authorities will be involved in the consideration of the findings.</p>

Among affected businesses, 44 per cent. describe the impact as severe or very severe, with 21 per cent. reporting the loss of over half normal sales revenue between March and August. While most affected businesses report that they remain profitable, 13 per cent. report that an expected profit has turned to loss due to foot and mouth disease.

	<p pid=".1098W.8/2">The Settle/Clitheroe outbreak began in the middle of May. The Department's epidemiologists' initial assessment was that the outbreak was caused by infection established in sheep and/or cattle from the movement of people, vehicles etc. from an infected area. However, further epidemiological investigation of the cases making up this outbreak suggests that infection has been present in the sheep population in the northern part of this cluster for some time. Infection is now believed to have been spread to the area by sheep via untraced sheep from Hawes market, or untraced sheep from Longtown market or via an intermediary market, holding or dealer in which disease was not manifested clinically or in which clinical signs were not observed.</p>
	<p pid=".1098W.8/3">This re-appraisal of the cause of the outbreak has not been influenced by the spread of disease down the Ribble and Aire river valleys. Following the initial introduction of infection, normal, seasonal sheep husbandry activities resulted in infection being transmitted to cattle making infection in the area obvious.</p>
	<p pid=".1098W.8/4">Further spread is thought to have been caused by the movements of people, vehicles and licensed movements of animals.</p>

	<p pid=".1105W.11/1">All cloven-hoofed animals, including deer, are susceptible to foot and mouth disease. Wild deer tend to show mild or inapparent disease, resembling the disease in sheep, although some species (eg roe deer and muntjak deer in the UK) may be severely affected.</p>
	<p pid=".1105W.11/2">Deer can be carriers of the foot and mouth virus, and could transmit foot and mouth disease to susceptible livestock during the clinical stages of the disease. However, the Department's current veterinary risk assessment indicates that the risk of wild deer playing any significant part in the spread of foot and mouth disease is very low. There are therefore no plans at this stage to control wild deer populations, although as more information becomes available about the epidemiology of the disease in areas where there are wild deer, the risk assessment will be updated.</p>

However, there is no direct evidence of such spread in the current outbreak. The mechanical transmission of the FMD virus by rats and birds was the subject of research in the late 1960s/early 1970s. The risks were considered to be negligible if not zero.</p>

	<p pid=".1106W.8/1">Vaccination against foot and mouth disease remains an option that is kept under continuous review. Ring vaccination is one possible approach, which aims to control the spread of infection within and outside an infected area. It reduces the amount of virus circulating in the area, as the vaccinated animals will be less infectious.</p>
	<p pid=".1106W.8/2">We did not ring vaccinate at the start of the outbreak because it was apparent that the virus had potentially been spread across a wide area, owing to the large number of movements that had taken place before the first case of foot and mouth disease was identified. This made ring vaccination an impractical option.</p>

The Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBR) has provided a forum for high level and strategic co-ordination, chaired by Ministers.

Any breaches in these standards will be treated with the utmost seriousness.</p>

Detailed planning has continued to address the possibility of any resurgence of disease in Yorkshire. A revised version of the contingency plan was prepared in September. Following the success of the Thirsk Restricted Infected Area (RIA) the plan includes, among other things, provision for the establishment of further RIAs should they be needed.

	<p pid=".1112W.6/2">Community legislation does permit the importation of meat and meat products from certain countries where foot and mouth disease is endemic but only where the disease is restricted to specific areas. Imports are only permitted from parts of the country that are free of disease or under conditions that ensure the meat does not represent any health risk. These provisions are in line with the recommendations of the Northumberland Committee following the 1967 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".1112W.6/3">All meat and meat products imported from third countries must be accompanied by veterinary certification, which includes confirmation that the meat is derived from animals which have been subjected to an ante-mortem inspection during the 24 hours prior to slaughter in order to confirm, among other things, that the animal shows no signs of foot and mouth disease.</p>
	<p pid=".1112W.6/4">If there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health such as foot and mouth disease, Community legislation allows us to ban imports of meat from all, or parts, of the country concerned. Recent examples include Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Swaziland, Uruguay and Zimbabwe, and within the EU, France, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".1112W.6/5">All meat and meat products imported into the UK from third countries must enter at designated UK Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) where they are subject to veterinary inspections. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks and at least 20 per cent. of consignments undergo physical checks. These ensure import conditions are met and that the products remain in a satisfactory condition. They are carried out by Official Veterinary Surgeons (OVSs) employed by the local authority in which the BIP is located.</p>

	<p pid=".1114W.14/1">Once foot and mouth disease has been eradicated, we will continue to be vigilant, in order to prevent a recurrence of the disease.</p>
	<p pid=".1114W.14/2">Imports of meat and meat products into the United Kingdom, as into other member states of the European Union, take place within the framework of European law. The UK imports livestock under EU or national rules only from countries or areas officially recognised as being free from foot and mouth disease.</p>
	<p pid=".1114W.14/3">The control of meat and meat product imports into this country involves the inspection of commercial imports at border inspection posts, controls on personal imports and action in shops and other food premises against sales of illegally imported food. The Government are taking action in all of these contexts to build on existing controls.</p>
	<p pid=".1114W.14/4">Where farms have been culled due to foot and mouth disease, certain rules apply before restocking can take place to minimise the risk of recurrence of the disease. Alternatively, if the farmer does not wish to restock at once, restrictions are lifted four months after the full and final C and D, subject to a final inspection. If it has not been possible to complete a full C and D to DEFRA's satisfaction, 12 months must elapse after the preliminary C and D before restocking can take place.</p>
	<p pid=".1114W.14/5">Biosecurity measures are also vital in helping to prevent the spread and resurgence of foot and mouth disease. As part of the ongoing campaign to provide timely and accurate information and advice to all concerned we have mailed biosecurity guidelines, leaflets and letters and placed adverts in local, national and specialist publications. In addition, local veterinary inspectors have contacted their clients to discuss biosecurity and other aspects of the disease.</p>
	<p pid=".1114W.14/6">The Department has contingency plans to deal with all notifiable exotic animal diseases, including foot and mouth disease. These are regularly updated and tested by the state veterinary service.</p>
	<p pid=".1114W.14/7">The Government in addition have announced two independent inquiries to look into the lessons to be learned from the current outbreak of foot and mouth, and a public commission to examine how the Government can create a sustainable, competitive and diverse farming and food sector which contributes to a thriving rural economy while at the same time advances environmental, economic health and animal welfare goals. We want to learn the lessons for the future, quickly and without great expense.</p>

	<p pid=".1118W.5/1">European Community legislation does permit the importation of meat and meat products from certain countries where foot and mouth disease is endemic but only where the disease is restricted to specific areas. Imports are only permitted from parts of the country that are free of disease or under conditions that ensure the meat does not represent any health risk. These provisions are in line with the guidelines set out in the Office International des Epizooties International Animal Health Code 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".1118W.5/2">All meat and meat products imported from third countries must be accompanied by veterinary certification, which includes confirmation that the meat is derived from animals which have been subjected to an ante-mortem inspection during the 24 hours prior to slaughter in order to confirm, among other things, that the animal shows no signs of foot and mouth disease.</p>
	<p pid=".1118W.5/3">All meat and meat products imported into the UK from third countries must enter at designated UK border inspection posts (BIPs) where they are subject to veterinary inspections. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks and at least 20 per cent. of consignments undergo physical checks. These ensure import conditions are met and that the products remain in a satisfactory condition.</p>
