	<p pid="b.1903W.6/1">Offsetting should be set in a hierarchy of actions. The most effective way to avoid and reduce emissions is by changing behaviour. When it is not possible to avoid or reduce emissions, consumers should consider offsetting. When carried out in this context, we support the use of offsets generated by robust and verifiable mechanisms bound by international regulation</p>
	<p pid="b.1903W.6/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-18">18 January</phrase>, DEFRA launched a consultation on a voluntary Code of Best Practice for the provision of carbon offsetting to customers. The purpose of this code is to provide clarity to customers and, thereby, confidence in a growing market.</p>

	<p pid="b.1904W.0/1">The integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) directive applies only to poultry installations with places for more than 40,000 birds and to installations with places for more than 2,000 production pigs or 750 sows. Since they are set in the directive, those thresholds cannot be changed unilaterally by the UK. Large units are those greater than 10 times the lower threshold, that is, those greater than 400,000 birds, 20,000 production pigs or 7,500 sows.</p>
	<p pid="b.1904W.0/2">Under the Environment Agency's (EA) scheme of charges, intensive livestock installations will be charged &pound;3,331 for a permit application and then annual charges of &pound;2,229 for a small installation and &pound;2,794 for a large one. The EA is obliged to consult annually on the scheme of charges, before seeking the Secretary of State's approval.</p>
	<p pid="b.1904W.0/3">In England, the total capital costs of meeting the requirements of the IPPC directive were estimated by the Rural Development Service, in February 2006, to be &pound;64.6 million with annual costs of &pound;20.2 million. This includes permitting and improvements likely to be necessary over the next few years. However, there are significant uncertainties about these estimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1904W.0/4">A regulatory impact assessment was carried out on the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 prior to their making. However, this did not consider in detail each individual industry sector in terms of the transposition of the IPPC directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1904W.0/5">My noble Friend, the Lord Rooker recently met representatives of the industry to discuss permit charges and in particular how annual charges might be reduced through streamlined approaches to inspection. The EA and the National Farmers Union are currently considering options including what greater use might be made of assurance scheme visits.</p>

	<p pid="b.1905W.2/1">Under section 89 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, railway undertakers and operators have a duty to keep their 'relevant land' clear of litter and refuse. This includes station areas to which the public have access, tracks that are within 100 m of platforms (provided that the public have access to the platforms) and tracks in urban areas. Where this duty is not complied with, local authorities (LAs) may issue a litter abatement notice on the railway undertaker or operator, requiring the clearance of the litter and refuse and prohibiting further defacement of the land. Any member of the public can also take action via the magistrates court, seeking a litter abatement order to get the litter cleared.</p>
	<p pid="b.1905W.2/2">There is no duty on rail undertakers or operators to keep other track areas clean. However, where such land becomes defaced by litter and refuse and this is detrimental to the amenity of the area, LAs can issue a litter clearing notice on the occupier or owner (if unoccupied), requiring the clearance of the litter and, if necessary, reasonable steps to be taken to prevent future defacement. This power was introduced by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 and commenced on <phrase class="date" code="">6 April</phrase> last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1905W.2/3">It is an offence to fail to comply with a litter abatement notice, a litter abatement order or a litter clearing notice.</p>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.1906W.6/11">The House does not retain information for earlier years. As a percentage of total staff costs, the cost of agency staff varies between 2.6 per cent. (2005-06) and 5.2 per cent. (current year). The increase in the current year is due mainly to the transitional arrangements for the development of the Parliamentary ICT Service (PICT) as a joint body serving both Houses. The use of agency staff is expected to moderate next year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1909W.3/30">The 2007-08 allocation is the previously published planning guideline with an uplift of 12.5 per cent. because the council's local transport plan for 2006 to 2011 was assessed as excellent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1909W.3/31">In addition, the total capital highway maintenance funding allocation for City of York council for 2007-08 is &pound;1.419 million, all of which is formula funding. We have also provided &pound;0.750 million for capital works on the detrunked sections of the A1079 and A1237. This is in addition to the maintenance allocation outlined above.</p>
	<p pid="b.1909W.3/32">Major schemes are no longer included in the local transport settlement. We responded separately in July to the advice from the regions about their priorities for major transport projects&mdash;including those promoted by local authorities&mdash;up to 2015-16. The Yorkshire and the Humber region is getting &pound;175million over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1909W.3/33">Nationally, &pound;683 million is being provided for highways capital maintenance in 2007-08. Most (&pound;634 million) is being distributed formulaically. The formula reflects the size and condition of local roads, bridges and street lights. &pound;47 million is being allocated response to bids for major maintenance and strengthening on the primary route network and for smaller authorities' exceptional maintenance schemes, and &pound;2 million is to be allocated at a future date.</p>
	<p pid="b.1909W.3/34">We are providing &pound;571 million for integrated transport in 2007-08. Its distribution is influenced by three factors: a formula representing local pressures, the previous pattern of distribution and how well authorities have planned and delivered their transport objectives. Indicative allocations of &pound;1,760 million are also being made for the three year period from 2008-09 to 2010-11 to provide increased certainty and stability for local authorities to plan ahead. These are subject to the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

	<p pid="b.1910W.2/1">As part of the 2006 local transport settlement, each of the 82 local transport plans in England (outside London) has been assessed against benchmarks grouped into nine criteria. These criteria cover areas such as road safety and congestion as well as how the plan fits in with wider transport policy aims and reflects local priorities. They are based on the central Government and the Local Government Association agreed set of shared priorities for transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.1910W.2/2">For each of the criteria, each plan is assessed as being weak, fair, good or excellent. Plan classifications are derived from the balance of the criteria classifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.1910W.2/3">The City of York council's second local transport plan (for 2006-11) was assessed as 'excellent'. The 'excellent' classification means that the Department found evidence of a very high standard of transport planning. The plan builds on the foundations of the first plan-(for 2001-06), which has delivered a wide range of benefits for local people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1910W.2/4">These include the development of very successful park and ride systems and the new 'Overground' bus network, which will evolve into a comprehensive public transport network for local users. The City of York council has already reported a growing number of people using the bus network, in addition to the increasing numbers of people making use of the improved facilities for walking and cycling.</p>
	<p pid="b.1910W.2/5">Together with a robust parking management policy and the introduction of the urban traffic congestion management system, these improvements have delivered a significant reduction in traffic and cars parked in the city.</p>

	<p pid="b.1912W.0/3">Disability Discrimination Acts&mdash;The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 covers all functions of public bodies, not just services and, therefore, includes the provision of public footpaths and other rights of way. It requires public bodies to promote disability equality and to have had Disability Equality Schemes in place since December 2006. A Disability Equality Scheme needs to:</p>
	<p pid="b.1912W.0/4" class="indent">i. Explain how equality for disabled people will be promoted</p>

	<p pid="b.1912W.0/7">The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000&mdash;Under section 60 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (the CROW Act), local highway authorities are required to prepare and publish a Rights of Way Improvement Plan by November 2007. They are also required to review it not less than 10 years after publication. In developing the plan, the needs of disabled people must be taken into consideration. Further advice on what this involves is contained in the statutory guidance issued to local highway authorities by DEFRA in November 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.1912W.0/8">In addition, under section 69 of the CROW Act, to be commenced later this year, highway authorities must consider the needs of disabled people when authorising the erection of stiles and gates or other works on footpaths or bridleways.</p>
	<p pid="b.1912W.0/9">Local highway authorities also have a duty to prevent, as far as possible, the stopping up or obstruction of public rights of way. Failure to do so can have a significant effect on accessibility for disabled people.</p>

	<p pid="b.1922W.8/1">The Government will organise a series of events around the country to promote the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. In order to maximise the impact and sustainability of these events, the Government's intention is to link this work as far as possible to the launch of the new Commission for Equality and Human Rights, which is scheduled for October of this year. The overall budget and the final plans for the year will depend on the level of co-financing from the European Commission, which is expected to be around &pound;450,000. The Government intend to contribute a similar amount. Confirmation of the level of the European Commission's contribution is expected in March. Activities in the UK to promote the year should start in April. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Equalities (Meg Munn) intends to attend the Equality Summit being held by the German presidency of the EU in Berlin 30 to <phrase class="date" code="">31 January</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.1925W.8/1">Following the Electoral Commission's report &quot;The cycle of local government elections in England&quot; which, after consultation with stakeholders, recommended a move to all out elections for all local authorities in England, we have received inquiries about changing electoral cycles from 21 per cent. of shire district councils that currently elect by thirds. To date three of those local authorities have made a formal request to amend their cycle. The Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill provides that, in future, all councils, including metropolitan district councils that are currently barred from whole council elections, which elect by thirds can, by council resolution, move to whole council elections.</p>

	<p pid="b.1930W.9/1">The Sustainable Communities Plan set out a long-term programme of activity designed to achieve a step change in our policies for delivering sustainable communities for all by increasing housing supply, housing market renewal, providing more decent and affordable homes for all, ensuring the right infrastructure is provided, delivering on new growth areas and improving the countryside and local environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1930W.9/2">We have made considerable progress and are going further still to meet the challenges outlined in the plan. For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.1930W.9/3" class="indent">We have reduced the number of non-decent social homes by more than 1 million, and increased the proportion of vulnerable households in the private sector who have a decent home by 66 per cent. In total over &pound;20 billion of public money has been invested in improving council housing since 1997, and over &pound;40 billion in total will have been invested by the end of 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.1930W.9/4" class="indent">Across the country, we are more than doubling investment in affordable housing through the Housing Corporation to &pound;2 billion per year by 2008. By 2010 we will have helped 120,000 households into low cost home ownership through our Homebuy scheme and over 160,000 households to access home ownership through private or public shared equity schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1930W.9/5" class="indent">Combined with London, the four growth areas and the 29 new growth points have the potential to deliver an extra 300,000 homes above previously planned levels by 2016.</p>
	<p pid="b.1930W.9/6" class="indent">Around &pound;400 million is to be allocated by 2008 (since 2003-04) from the Communities and Local Government's Growth Area Fund (GAF) to support the objectives of sustainable development in the three newer growth areas and we are providing &pound;40 million in 2007-08 for a first round of infrastructure projects and to support growth-related studies, masterplanning and capacity-building in the new growth points.</p>
	<p pid="b.1930W.9/7" class="indent">Since 2003 we have allocated &pound;850 million to accelerate the growth of the Thames Gateway. Most of these funds are committed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1930W.9/8">Kate Barker, in her Review of Housing Supply (published in 2004), concluded that the housing market had not responded sufficiently to meet the needs of the country's ageing and growing population and recommended a step change in housing supply. In its response, published in December 2005, Government set out an ambition to increase the supply of new homes to 200,000 per year by 2016. Alongside the Barker response, the Government announced a cross cutting review of funding for infrastructure to support housing growth, and stronger measures for environmental sustainability. In December 2006 we further enhanced our commitment to protecting and enhancing the environment and tackling climate change by introducing a number of new environmental initiatives such as the Code for Sustainable Homes and PPS on climate change that aim to deliver more sustainable development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1930W.9/9">This work continues and Communities and Local Government is tasked with delivering prosperous and cohesive communities, offering a safe, healthy and sustainable environment for all.</p>

	<p pid="b.1937W.0/2">The development of current and future types of body armour has been and continues to be supported by a wide range of research and analysis. This includes: biomedical research focusing on armour placement and coverage, as well as the medical treatment of casualties; the assessment of the protective properties of individual materials; and the use of war-gaming models to determine overall combat effectiveness of particular body armour designs. No specific data has been collated to determine scientifically the success of new designs in reducing injury and saving lives. Anecdotal evidence, however, points clearly to the effectiveness and popularity of these systems.</p>

	<p pid="b.1945W.6/1">Abu Sayyaf was listed as an entity belonging to or associated with al-Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden or the Taliban by the Committee of the UN Security Council charged with the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1267 on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-06">6 October 2001</phrase>. UN member states are obliged to implement a world-wide asset freeze against all groups designated as terrorist organisations by the UN Security Council. Once a terrorist entity is added to the 1267 list we do not make specific representations to EU partners regarding their listing in the EU, as these groups are automatically added to the EU's list of terrorist organisations. This process was followed in the case of Abu Sayyaf.</p>

	<p pid="b.1948W.9/2">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office spent approximately &pound;28.9 million on foreign travel by officials in 1996-97.

	<p pid="b.1948W.9/3">Because we do not retain detailed records of expenditure from as long ago as 1996-97, and .because of differences between the accounting systems in use then and now, it is not possible to give a complete explanation for the increase in expenditure. Reasons include:</p>
	<p pid="b.1948W.9/4" class="indent">global inflation over a period of nine years and its impact on the cost of travel;</p>
	<p pid="b.1948W.9/5" class="indent">the redesign of our overseas network so that more staff are posted in the Far East and Asia at the expense of posts in Europe, with higher travel costs; and</p>

We expect Maoists to take their place in an interim government to be formed following sufficient arms separation.

	<p pid="b.1952W.5/1">The UK has not made any representations on the unrest in south eastern Nepal. However, we are deeply concerned about the recent riots and civil unrest in the Terai and urge the Government of Nepal and Maoists to take positive steps to demonstrate their commitment to inclusion as outlined in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The lack of inclusion felt by many marginalised groups was one of the key causes of the conflict in Nepal. The UK played a leading role in drafting UN Security Council Resolution 1740 on Nepal which was adopted unanimously on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-23">23 January</phrase>. We worked hard to ensure in particular that this Resolution recognises the need to pay special attention to the needs of women, children and traditionally marginalised groups in the peace process. Failure now to acknowledge the demands of Madeshis. and other groups based in the Terai risks further flare-ups which have the potential to undermine the prospects for elections to the Constituent Assembly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1953W.2/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) does not have a central record of the numbers of staff under contract from agencies. The annual financial accounts have provided the cost of agency staff since 1997. The reason for the increase was a recruitment freeze during 2004. The FCO started to recruit permanent staff again during 2005-06, filling gaps caused by security clearance delays with temporary agency staff. There will be a reduction to agency staff during 2007. Agencies have been selected subject to the availability of suitably security cleared staff, the performance of staff and negotiated rates.</p>

	<p pid="b.1955W.3/1">As at January 2007, a total of 838 individual cluster bomb strike locations have been identified by the UN Mine Action Co-ordination Centre South Lebanon (UNMACC) from the conflict last year. UNMACC have estimated that there may be up to 1 million unexploded cluster munitions in south Lebanon. The then UN Secretary-General has reported that four de-miners were injured in November 2006 when they stepped on Israeli-manufactured anti-personnel mines in south Lebanon. The Secretary-General noted that the incident took place in an area considered safe prior to the summer 2006 conflict, which raised the possibility that the mines were laid during the conflict. We fully support the Secretary-General's call for any party that laid such mines to provide information as to where they have been laid to prevent similar tragic incidents occurring in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.1956W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-18">18 January 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1956W.5/2">The UK agrees with the emphasis in paragraph 12 of the Western European Union (WEU) Recommendation 780 on dismantling the European trafficking networks. The UK is a partner nation to the Afghan Government on counter narcotics and is providing support on developing their capacity to tackle drug-trafficking networks. Separately, the UK is pursuing policies aimed at disrupting these networks in Europe through bilateral and multilateral co-operation, including engaging with Europol, and the Police Chiefs Task Force. The focus is on interdiction activity against drugs flowing into the EU and money flowing out.</p>
	<p pid="b.1956W.5/3">The UK supports a visible and strong role for the EU in Afghanistan and enhanced co-ordination of EU assistance (as advocated in paragraph 13 of WEU Recommendation 780). It welcomes the announcement by the Commission of its intention to spend &euro;40 million on justice sector reform in Afghanistan. The UK supports the deployment of a European Security and Defence Policy mission to Afghanistan focusing on policing, but with linkages to the wider rule of law. Protecting EU civilian personnel in Afghanistan is a priority. However, a Battlegroup cannot be used to protect them as this is a rapid response capability for use in a crisis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1956W.5/4">There are many existing opportunities for dialogue between the US and European countries on Afghanistan, both bilaterally and multilaterally. The UK therefore does not intend to call for dialogue between the US and WEU, as proposed in paragraph 15 of the WEU Recommendation 780.</p>
	<p pid="b.1956W.5/5">Purchasing the poppy crop, as proposed in paragraph 16 of WEU Recommendation 780, is not a realistic or sustainable solution. It does not form part of the Afghan Government's National Drug Control Strategy, which the UK fully supports. The UK agrees with the Afghan Government's position that licensing opium cultivation for medical use is not a realistic solution to the problems of the opium economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1962W.0/4" class="indent">As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1962W.0/5" class="indent">As you will be aware, National Car Parks Ltd (NCP) is responsible for managing machine faults and their repair, which normally relate to ticket jams and coin jams. I am advised that in the first month after installation, all 70 new pay and display machines were reported as experiencing faults. This was as a result of a specific unforeseen problem identified with the newly installed machines relating to the ticket paper quality, which resulted in a much greater number of ticket jams than would usually be expected. I understand that NCP trialled a number of different types of ticket paper to resolve this issue and, while doing so, provided a sufficient maintenance resource to deal with these additional faults. These teething problems have since been resolved and the newly installed machines are now operating to a satisfactory level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1962W.0/6" class="indent">I would add that the satisfactory maintenance of pay and display machines is a Key Performance Indicator in our enforcement contract with NCP. NCP performance in this area is being measured against fault response times detailed in the contract and will be continually monitored by Roads Service's Parking Enforcement Unit.</p>

In addition, the East Midlands Trade Association, a project supported by UKTI EM and emda, held a market information event in September 2006 focusing on key South American markets including Brazil. To allow companies to pursue their interest in Brazil, and again supported by emda, we will be taking 30 company representatives on a high profile market visit to Sao Paolo in March this year. Our visit will be led by Mrs. Pat Zadora, Chair of the East Midlands Business Forum and Deputy Leader of the East Midlands Regional Assembly. It will also be accompanied by representatives of three key sectors in the region, Biomedical, Creative Industries and Engineering, who will be commissioning research in Brazil to identify future opportunities for companies in the region</p>

	<p pid="b.1966W.4/2">The Government recognise that Cumbria, with a GDP per capita of 73.2 per cent. of the UK average, faces significant economic challenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.1966W.4/3">Cumbria did not qualify to receive the highest level of Structural Funds support under the Convergence Objective for 2007-13. It also narrowly missed out from receiving transitional Convergence funding for regions in the older member states who would have received full Convergence funding if enlargement had not taken place. Cumbria's GDP was slightly higher than the threshold to receive this funding (77.2 per cent. of the EU15 average, compared with the 75 per cent. threshold).</p>
	<p pid="b.1966W.4/4">Cumbria will be eligible to receive a proportion of the North West's allocation of Competitiveness funding, which is &euro;1,164 million (in 2004 prices) in 2007-13. The Government believe that their allocation formula for the Competitiveness Objective provides an accurate measure of each region's economic needs. The Government have also decided to apply a 20 per cent. cap and safety net to each region's allocation. This means that no region will receive an increase or reduction in its proportion of funding of more than 20 per cent. in comparison with its proportion of mainstream Objective 2 European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) receipts in 2000-06.</p>
	<p pid="b.1966W.4/5">In making the regional allocations, the Government used sub-regional data in their allocation formula to take account of economic performance at the sub-regional level, including Cumbria. Within the North West, Cumbria had a GDP per head of 77.2 per cent. of the EU15 average and 84.6 per cent. of the EU25 average, compared with 92.5 per cent. and 101.3 per cent. for the North West region. These figures help to explain why the North West will receive the second highest allocation of mainstream Competitiveness funding of all the English regions. It has also benefited from the application of the safety net for the ERDF.</p>
	<p pid="b.1966W.4/6">The Government have noted the arguments of Cumbrian stakeholders for additional funding for their sub-region. However, the Government have decided not to top-slice the totals to provide specific funding for any sub-regions. The allocation of the Funds will be a matter for the Operational Programme, which is currently the subject of consultation in the North West.</p>

	<p pid="b.1969W.2/1">Management consultants and some professional advisors are engaged via a specific framework agreement (known as CIPHER). The framework agreement itself was established following a competition process conducted in accordance with the EU Consolidated Procurement Directives. In addition, individual contracts let within the framework agreement are subject to a separate mini competition where all the suppliers within the relevant lot on the framework agreement are invited to bid. In this way DWP is assured that all exercises can demonstrate value for money. Professional advisers covered via the framework agreement are in the fields of HR, IT, procurement, finance and programme and project management, others such as legal and property advisers are not covered.</p>
	<p pid="b.1969W.2/2">In addition, the DWP internet audit unit are responsible for providing independent assurance on the procurement system processes, including compliance with the CIPHER framework. With regard to specific value for money (VfM) studies, over the last five years there was a review in 2006 covering the use of external resources, although VfM is a consideration in all internal audit reviews.</p>
	<p pid="b.1969W.2/3">Management information on the number of exercises is available with effect from April 2004, the date the CIPHER agreement went live, details available are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="b.1974W.2/69">HSE inspectors have a range of tools at their disposal to help secure compliance with the law, and to ensure a proportionate response to criminal offences. Inspectors may offer duty holders information, and advice, both face to face and in writing. This may include warning a duty holder that in the opinion of the inspector, they are failing to comply with the law. Where appropriate, inspectors may also serve improvement and prohibition notices, or they may prosecute. The choice of enforcement action is proportionate to the breach.</p>
	<p pid="b.1974W.2/70">Improvement notices are served when in the opinion of the inspector an offence has been committed, but which, in the opinion of the inspector, can be remedied within a given timescale.</p>
	<p pid="b.1974W.2/71">HSE's enforcement policy is normally to prosecute those who fail to comply with an improvement notice. However, there are occasions when it is not appropriate to prosecute and no further action is taken in relation to the notice. This would normally occur where prosecution is not in the public interest (for example, the client has ceased trading or, they have done enough work to essentially comply but there may be a minor deficiency which does not give rise to a health and safety risk). However, it should be noted that HSE will continue to monitor and enforce health and safety standards in these cases.</p>

	<p pid="b.1978W.2/1">No DWP Ministers have received such representations during the last five years. However, if organisations or individuals have concerns they are welcome to write to the HSE.</p>
	<p pid="b.1978W.2/2" class="italic"> Background:</p>
	<p pid="b.1978W.2/3">1. In marshalling HSE's inspection resource, HSE seeks to target poor performers. The key criteria in establishing the frequency of inspections are the risks presented by particular duty holders, premises or industries and the ability and willingness of duty holders to manage those risks. Where the risk is low and duty holders' ability high, visits are less frequent than where the risk is high and duty holders are failing to manage those risks. In targeting the inspection resource in this way, HSE believes it has the greatest impact on reducing work-related deaths, injuries and ill-health.</p>
	<p pid="b.1978W.2/4">2. In 2003, HSE ceased to set targets for the number of inspection contacts. Such targets encouraged short visits to low risk places, whereas the Health and Safety Commission's strategy for workplace health and safety 2010 sought a sharper focus on injury and ill-health priorities, and more substantial contacts with a carefully selected range of duty holders. Over the last five years or so, the actual time HSE inspectors have spent interacting with and encouraging duty holders has increased by 23 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1978W.2/5">3. Important as inspection is, the frequency of inspections is not a particularly useful metric. The Health and Safety Commission's strategy fully recognises the importance of inspection, and the threat of enforcement, as a powerful motivator for improved standards. But to be most effective, they need to sit alongside other interventions, such as encouraging partnership working, communications, and so on.</p>
	<p pid="b.1978W.2/6" class="italic"> Inspection in Higher Education</p>
	<p pid="b.1978W.2/7">4. HSE sees higher education as a mature sector. The risks are for the most part well known (including those associated with laboratory work with hazardous chemicals), well understood, well managed and there are well-established networks and institutions for their management. In line with the approach set out in paras 1-3 above, HSE has therefore no general proactive inspection programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1978W.2/8">5. However, this year, some proactive inspection will take place examining higher education institution's management of work-related stress&mdash;HSE Inspectors will visit about 120 universities. Work related stress is one of the priority topics identified in the Commissions strategy for workplace health and safety 2010</p>
	<p pid="b.1978W.2/9">6. This inspection activity follows a series of seminars in the autumn of 2006, to which all higher education institutions were invited&mdash;and which nearly 50 per cent. of all institutions attended&mdash;designed to equip institutions with knowledge and skills to tackle work-related stress through the use of HSE's Stress Management Standards. This programme of inspection will look at whether the Management Standards (or any equivalent approach) is being used, or if it is, assist in ensuring action is maintained.</p>
	<p pid="b.1978W.2/10">7. A second programme of inspection activity will look at the management of slipping and tripping hazards&mdash;a hazard the sector recognises as a particular issue&mdash;another of the Commission's priority topics. These inspections will follow a series of nationwide seminars run by HSE, in partnership with the sector, which will equip attendees with the knowledge and skills to manage slips and trips.</p>

In line with Afghanistan's needs, DFID humanitarian funding has gradually decreased from &pound;44 million in 2001-02 to &pound;1.3 million this year (2006-07). Funding this year has been channelled towards the drought in the North and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Helmand.</p>
	<p pid="b.1989W.3/3">The drought in Afghanistan is predominantly in the northern areas and is affecting 2.5 million people. The Government of Afghanistan and the UN jointly launched an appeal in October. DFID has contributed &pound;1 million towards the UN appeal for drought mitigation. This will be used for water and sanitation projects in the most affected areas. The money will be used to fund NGOs working with the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD), the main government partner of the UN drought appeal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1989W.3/4">DFID has also provided assistance to IDPs in Helmand. The UN has estimated that around 2,800 families have been displaced in Helmand. UK officials are monitoring the situation. We are currently assured that basic needs are being met. The UK has provided funding (&pound;30,000) for food aid and essential items like soap and blankets for these displaced families.</p>

All funding is routed through Maxwell Stamp plc., the managing agents for the programme: about 70 per cent. is passed to 30 local non-governmental organisations (NGOs), which transfer cash stipends and assets (such as cows, poultry and vegetable seeds) to poor and destitute women and, fund the raising of households above normal flood levels; the remaining 30 per cent. goes through five local government offices to provide cash for public works which create employment opportunities for poor communities on the island chars. We expect to spend a further &pound;10 million per year on the CLP in each of the next three financial years.</p>

	<p pid="b.2002W.14/1">We continue to support the UN's group of experts in its important role monitoring the UN arms embargo on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), including the linkages between the funding of armed groups and the exploitation of natural resources in the DRC. However, it is action by the Congolese government that will determine progress on improving natural resource management for the benefit of the Congolese people. We continue to press the authorities for action and will provide support, with international partners, where we can.</p>
	<p pid="b.2002W.14/2">The international community has made clear in UN Security Council resolutions that civilian protection (including humanitarian personnel, under imminent threat of physical violence) is an integral part of MONUC's (the UN Mission to the DRC) Chapter VII mandate. MONUC has undertaken military operations against the Forces Democratiques de Liberation du Rwanda (FDLR) and other Congolese and foreign and Congolese militias. We continue to encourage MONUC to take a robust stance against these groups, including in support of responsible Congolese army actions. But we are also clear that the solution to the problem requires other measures as well as military pressure, including political leadership by the new government.</p>

	<p pid="b.2003W.5/1">We are very concerned at the increasing numbers of people fleeing the sectarian violence in Iraq. The United Nations estimate that the total number of Iraqi refugees living in neighbouring countries has risen to 1.8 million, with 492,000 displaced since the Samarra bombing in February 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.2003W.5/2">I have just announced a &pound;4 million contribution to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to provide emergency assistance, including water, medical supplies and rehabilitation of health infrastructure to vulnerable people, including IDPs inside Iraq. We are also considering UNHCR's appeal, which includes help to refugees in neighbouring countries. This brings our total humanitarian contribution for Iraq to over &pound;120 million since 2003, including &pound;85 million for the UN's 2003 Humanitarian Appeal and &pound;36 million to the International Red Cross. Additionally, DFID provided &pound;70 million to the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI), which provides support to internally displaced persons.</p>

	<p pid="b.2003W.8/1">DFID works with partners in poor countries and other donors to promote integration of the environment into country-led policies, planning and programmes. For example DFID supported the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Poverty Environment Initiative (PEI) and its environmental integration programmes in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Vietnam, and Cambodia, and we will co-operate with a similar new joint UNDP and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) PEI. DFID is working with other OECD donors to develop and promote best practice on integrating natural resource management into country-led planning. We have also directly helped some partner countries, such as Tanzania, Uganda, Bangladesh, Nepal and China. DFID is producing a case study of successful Tanzanian experience for use by other donors and partner countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.2004W.2/1">The amounts lost to corruption cannot be easily identified due to its hidden nature. The World Bank's public website summarises the situation well:</p>
	<p pid="b.2004W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;Corruption is a cancer and no country, rich or poor, is immune ... Fraud and corruption have undoubtedly occurred in [Bank-funded] projects, but it would be nearly impossible to determine how much [Bank] money might have been lost. Corruption on a world-wide, country by country basis has not been measured by anyone, given the difficulties and enormous costs of collecting quantitative data on the subject&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.2004W.2/3">However, while corruption is impossible to assess fully, DFID is working actively to combat it domestically in the UK, with partners at the country level and internationally. Where instances of fraud or corruption do come to light, our policy is one of zero tolerance and action will be taken to recover any funds that have been lost.</p>
	<p pid="b.2004W.2/4">We have a range of preventative controls and procedures in place to minimise the risk of DFID funds being lost to corruption. With partner countries, we support them to improve national systems and reduce the risk of funds being wasted or misused. Together with other international partners, we are providing ongoing support for long term programmes to strengthen the public financial management systems of many partner governments, for example in Malawi, Mozambique and Rwanda. These programmes typically address a range of public financial management issues from budget planning and design (e.g. helping to establish medium term expenditure frameworks); to improving infrastructure (computerised financial management information systems); to helping strengthen key institutions such as the National Audit Office. We also support many initiatives with civil society, parliaments and anti-corruption bodies to increase the demand for accountability and better governance.</p>

This explains the figure for the City of London police &mdash; the force has a very small resident population and almost all those sampled live elsewhere. Previous statistics on the number of individuals on the Database were calculated on the basis that 11 per cent. of the profiles were replicates, i.e. the number of individuals was 11 per cent. less than the number of profiles. The Database has recently advised that the replication rate is now 13.7 per cent. so the figures have now been calculated on this basis.</td> </tr>

The number plates of those who leave the country without being dealt with can be recorded on a database and so be detected and dealt with on return here. We have also taken a number of measures to improve enforcement action against the drivers of foreign registered vehicles. These include a provision in the Road Safety Act 2006 which will allow the exchange of driver licensing and vehicle registration information with other countries. Further help will be provided by the European framework decision on the mutual recognition of financial penalties, which will allow courts in one member state to have the penalties they impose enforced in another and by the international convention on the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications.</p>

	<p pid="b.2032W.6/1">No breakdown of the overall spend on eating disorders by the Department has been made, nor has an estimate been made of the economic cost of eating disorders.</p>
	<p pid="b.2032W.6/2">The Department launched a tobacco control media campaign in December 1999 and the approximate spend on this in 2006-07 was &pound;12.25 million. This amount does not include helpline running costs. We also fund the national health service stop smoking services and has allocated &pound;56 million each year for this in 2006-07 and 2007-08, with &pound;10 million of this heavily weighted towards spearhead primary care trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.2032W.6/3">No estimate of the overall economic cost of smoking has been produced. However, regulatory impact assessments have been made of the impact of smoke free legislation, new pack warnings and the forthcoming rise in age of purchase from 16 to 18. Copies of these reports have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.2032W.6/4">We are spending &pound;1.7 million in 2006-07 on the &quot;Know your Limits&quot; campaign, which seeks to prevent binge drinking. The Home Office is contributing additional funding. In 2006-07, the Department is also spending &pound;1.5 million on the alcohol identification and brief advice trailblazer programme. This research programme into the effectiveness of screening and brief intervention techniques will run over two years and an equal amount of additional funding will be supplied by the Department in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.2032W.6/5">The Department estimates the net cost of alcohol abuse to be &pound;20 billion per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.2032W.6/6">In 2005-06, we allocated &pound;300 million to the pooled drug treatment budget, and a further &pound;208 million local funding was made available. This money is allocated to drug action teams across the country to use to meet local action plans. The Department has estimated that for every &pound;1 spent on drug treatment, at least &pound;9.50 is saved in crime and health costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.2032W.6/7">We do not set targets for hospital or primary care trust (PCT) spending. Decisions about spending are made by each PCT. It is for PCTs, in conjunction with their strategic health authorities, to plan and develop services according to the needs of their local communities.</p>

The results, which do not have the status of official or national statistics but are available on the 18-weeks website (<a href="http://www.18weeks.nhs.uk">www.18weeks.nhs.uk</a>) suggest that, nationally, in early 2006, the pathway of 35 per cent. of admitted patients and 70-80 per cent. of non-admitted patients met 18 weeks.</p>

	<p pid="b.2051W.5/1">Robust information on waiting times from referral to treatment will be collected by the national health service for the very first time this month. Publication of the data for admitted patients is likely to be available in the spring and data for the non-admitted patients is likely to be available in the summer. This will help frontline staff to manage patient pathways properly and to track progress towards the 18-week maximum target wait.</p>
	<p pid="b.2051W.5/2">The current waiting time standards include a maximum six-month wait for in-patient treatment from the decision to admit. At the end of November 2006, there were six patients waiting over six months for in-patient admission in East Sussex Downs and Weald Primary Care Trust.</p>
