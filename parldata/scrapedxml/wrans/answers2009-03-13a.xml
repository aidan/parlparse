	<p pid="a.761W.0/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.0/2">The English Tourism Council's report 'Sea Change' was published in 2001. I have made no recent assessment of the impact of that report on seaside towns, but it remains the case, as the report concluded, that seaside towns make a significant contribution to the cultural identity of England and contain some of the finest examples of our built heritage.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.0/3">In a recent response to the Government Select Committee report, 'Coastal Towns', Government made clear the underlying principles that the visitor economy needs to be part of a wider agenda to regenerate and diversify the economies of coastal areas. The development of tourism has an important role to play but it is only one part of a bigger picture and it must also be linked with wider regeneration work in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.0/4">Last year my Department announced a programme called Sea Change, which will run for three years to 2011. It is intended to boost regeneration in coastal areas through investment in culture and heritage, and, giving &pound;45 million in total, it will encourage new visitors to coastal areas and help support and enrich existing communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.761W.4/1">The academies clauses in the Apprenticeships, Children, Skills and Learning Bill give powers to the Secretary of State which will enable him to require the YPLA to carry out certain academies functions. But the Secretary of State can only ask the YPLA to exercise, on his behalf, powers which he has himself, either in law, or through academy funding agreements.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.4/2">Funding agreements contain requirements and certain express direction powers in relation to admissions. The YPLA, on behalf of the Secretary of State, would consider complaints and objections which relate to funding agreement admissions requirements, and could take action to remedy any breaches. That could include, for example, requiring an academy to change its admission arrangements to achieve compliance with the funding agreement. In relation to the express powers of direction available to the Secretary of State, we are considering whether or not it would be appropriate to authorise the YPLA to use these powers, relating to admissions either with or without the Secretary of State's prior approval.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.4/3">Funding agreements also contain curriculum requirements and cover the need to have in place a behaviour policy and pay arrangements. However, there are no specific direction powers in these areas. Behaviour policies and pay are areas where academies are free to adopt the arrangements which they believe will best support raising standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.762W.8/1">We agree that schools have an important role in raising awareness of domestic violence and abuse issues by giving children and young people the knowledge and skills to not only deal with their own anger but anger and violence directed towards them. Through the non-statutory framework for Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education children and young people are taught a number of the skills pertaining to relationships with partners, friends and family, thus promoting harmonious relationships. In October 2008, we announced our intention to make PSHE statutory, in recognition of the key role it plays in equipping children and young people with the knowledge and skills they need to lead healthy and successful lives. At the same time we launched an independent review of how the principle that PSHE should have a statutory status can be translated into a practicable way forward. Sir Alasdair Macdonald, the head teacher of Morpeth School in Tower Hamlets, is leading the independent review and will report in April 2009. Proposals for the statutory implementation of PSHE education will be the subject of a full public consultation. Due to the time needed for full public consultation and parliamentary process, statutory PSHE is unlikely to come into effect before 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.762W.8/2">The secondary curriculum also encourages schools to tackle social issues through cross-curricular links. For example, Citizenship teaches children and young people about legal and human rights and responsibilities underpinning society, basic aspects of the criminal justice system and the importance of resolving conflict fairly.</p>

	<p pid="a.764W.8/1">The Department's guidance, Drugs: Guidance for Schools (DFES 2004) makes it clear that head teachers can introduce voluntary drug testing if they consider that such an approach is appropriate. It is essential that before a school takes the decision to introduce drug testing that it considers very carefully all of the factors outlined in the guidance, including whether such action will result in appropriate support for pupils most in need. In deciding whether to use this approach, schools are encouraged to consult with local partners, such as the police, who may be able to offer advice and support.</p>

	<p pid="a.767W.5/1">For Local Area Agreements (LAA) and Local Public Service Agreements (LPSAs) agreed prior to 2008 the total potential reward grant (if all targets are achieved) is equivalent to 2.5 per cent. of an authority's net budget requirement (the budget requirement plus dedicated schools grant less parish precepts) in the financial year prior to the start of the LAA or LPSA. In the case of two-tier areas, the net budget requirement of any district councils was also included in the calculation. Grants are paid as half revenue grant and half capital grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.767W.5/2">The proportion of the potential grant payable to any authority is determined by their performance in relation to the improvement targets agreed. Local authorities are currently submitting claims and &pound;378 million is allocated to meet these claims in 2008-9. For 2009-10 a total of &pound;257 million has been allocated. It is difficult to accurately predict in advance the exact funding levels required as this depends upon the final performance achieved in relation to each target.</p>

MOD, DOH and the third sector are working together to raise awareness of military issues among civilian health professionals and administrators and NHS-led veterans' mental health services providing best practice assessment and treatment in an accessible acceptable way are being piloted at sites across the country. These pilots will run for two years with independent evaluation and analysis. Lessons learned will inform future service planning. For those veterans with mental health problems living outside pilot areas and who have served in operations since 1982, the Medical Assessment Programme at St. Thomas's hospital, London, provides a mental health assessment by an expert in the problems that arise from military service. Treatment recommendations are then made to the GP.</p>

	<p pid="a.776W.5/1">The Northern Ireland Security Guard Service (NISGS) are MOD employees and are a professional, armed and trained body who provide security at MOD establishments in Northern Ireland. The NISGS review was initiated in order to examine the structure and responsibilities of the NISGS as part of the normalization process. It was neither designed as a review into NISGS capability nor as a security review. It was divided into two parts: Part 1 examined the establishment (numbers) of the NISGS to support the reducing number of military bases and examine their roles and responsibilities; Part 2 was to determine future requirements including the retention of special constable (SC) status.</p>
	<p pid="a.776W.5/2">The paper has been staffed through the chain of command and the review is in its final stage. The decision on removal or retention of SC status is pending until consultation with trade unions is complete and resource implications are fully addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.776W.5/3">We expected the review to be completed by the end of 2008 but this deadline was internal and self-imposed by HQ NI and 38 (Irish) Brigade. The review was more complex than originally anticipated with a broad range of subject matter experts' views to be sought. Further work was therefore directed to ensure all resource implications and advice had been properly addressed. The report date was therefore slipped to the end of March 2009, with the full knowledge of both the MOD and trade unions. Trade union consultation on the findings of the review will commence shortly, before promulgation of the outcome to NISGS personnel.</p>

We are also defining specialist skills which reflect the work of the FCO across its network. As part of this process we mapped skills required against roles within the organisation. The next step will be to record the skills we have throughout our work force. This will be an ongoing process which will help inform decisions on learning and development, recruitment and workforce planning.</p>

	<p pid="a.785W.6/1">There is no standard definition of 'routine surgical operations'. The national health service collects information on surgical operations from a range of data sources, for example:</p>
	<p pid="a.785W.6/2" class="indent">(i) There are limited clinical audit outcomes data on surgery for cancer (lung, head and neck, bowel, oesophago-gastric, mastectomy and breast re-construction), and heart disease (cardiac and paediatric surgery). Reports on these have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.785W.6/3" class="indent">(ii) Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) is the national statistical records-based system for England for the care provided by NHS hospitals and for NHS hospital patients treated elsewhere. Each HES record&mdash;one for each period of care&mdash;contains clinical information about diagnoses and operation. There is no nationally agreed definition of 'main procedure and intervention'. Each episode in HES has 24 procedure and intervention fields. The 'main procedure and intervention' should be the one that is the most resource intensive. Procedure and interventions are recorded using the latest version of the Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys: Classification of Interventions and Procedures, 4<sup>(th)</sup> Revision, OPCS-4.4 for 2008-09, and a copy of this has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.785W.6/4" class="indent">The National Centre for Health Outcomes Development (NCHOD) has linked HES data with Office for National Statistics deaths data to develop indicators on deaths within 30-days of a coronary artery bypass graft and within 30-days of surgery for non-elective admissions (excluding diagnostic procedures and spells with cancer).</p>
	<p pid="a.785W.6/5" class="indent">(iii) Patient Reported Outcome Measures&mdash;From <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase> all providers of NHS-funded care who are subject to the terms of the Standard NHS contract for acute services will be obliged to invite patients undergoing hip and knee replacements, groin hernia and varicose vein surgeries to complete patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) questionnaires.</p>
	<p pid="a.785W.6/6">The Department is actively exploring extending the use of PROMs into other clinical areas including long-term conditions. Any future decision to extend the use of PROMs will be based on a sound evidence base.</p>
	<p pid="a.785W.6/7">The Department is aware of a number of examples where local providers and regional networks are involved in other data collection exercises, including local PROMs collection, although there is no central register of these activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.785W.6/8">&quot;High Quality Care for All&quot; stressed quality as the organising principle of the NHS and the need for this to be supported by measurement. Therefore, the Department set out the vision for developing quality indicators across patient safety, effectiveness and patient experience including outcomes of care, PROMs and surgical outcomes, and using these to improve the quality of services in the NHS. This is described in &quot;Measuring for Quality Improvement (MQI)&mdash;The Approach&quot;. A copy of this document has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="a.792W.3/1">The Department for International Development's (DFID) programme in Zimbabwe is focused on providing immediate humanitarian support and broader livelihoods assistance to meet the essential needs of the people of Zimbabwe. This year we have provided: &pound;9 million to the World Food programme for food aid; &pound;10 million to support the growing season; and &pound;10 million to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. We also recently made &pound;10 million available to tackle the cholera outbreak and support life-saving essential health systems. We anticipate a total spend of &pound;49 million this financial year across these vital areas of support. Our aid is channelled through the UN and NGOs and not the Government of Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.792W.3/2">We anticipate the need for sustained large-scale humanitarian support from the international community for the foreseeable future and we are monitoring the situation very closely. However, a sustainable and credible political solution is required to fully address Zimbabwe's problems. In principle, we are ready to support economic and social recovery in Zimbabwe but this will depend on the new government's commitment to reform, including a clear commitment to macroeconomic stabilisation and sound economic management; restoration of the rule of law; commitment to democracy; respect for human rights, and the guarantee of full humanitarian access.</p>

	<p pid="a.794W.2/1">The Legal Services Commission (LSC) and the Ministry of Justice have not commissioned specific research on the effect of CDS Direct or the DSCC on the number and proportion of suspects who receive legal advice in person, but the LSC continues to record the number of cases funded each year. In 2007-08, there were 602,000 (574,000) cases in which publicly funded legal advice was provided in person at a police station and 94,000 (48,000) cases in which telephone advice was provided by an individual solicitor or firm. In addition, in 2007-08 CDS Direct dealt with 78,000 (123,000) telephone advice cases. Final figures will not be available until after the financial year ends, but the figures in brackets represent cases for the 2008-09 period up to February 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.794W.2/2">The Defence Solicitor Call Centre handles all requests for legal advice from police stations and refers them, as appropriate, to either the duty solicitor, the detainee's own solicitor if they have one, or to Criminal Defence Service (CDS) Direct.</p>
	<p pid="a.794W.2/3">CDS Direct is a separate service which provides telephone advice to individuals detained at police stations in England and Wales in relation to one of a small group of specified offences such as drink driving. These are relatively less serious, non-imprisonable offences that do not normally require the police to interview the suspect and therefore telephone advice is considered to be appropriate and cost-effective. In February and April 2008 the service was expanded in two phases to handle all cases appropriate for telephone advice, including those where the detainee has named a particular solicitor or firm. Even prior to the expansion of CDS Direct, if a named solicitor provided advice directly to a client on a case involving this group of offences, that solicitor would receive a fee from public funds for telephone advice only. The expansion of CDS Direct in early 2008 has not increased the scope of publicly funded telephone advice or reduced entitlement to face to face advice.</p>
