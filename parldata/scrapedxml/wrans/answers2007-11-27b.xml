	<p pid="b.291W.2/1">In terms of energy inputs (i.e. the quantity of fuels used directly or converted into other forms of energy such as electricity or petroleum products) nuclear accounts for 7.5 per cent. of the UK's demand for primary fuels (rounding to the nearest 0.5 per cent.). The figures behind this percentage are as follows. They can be found in this Department's National Statistics publication, &quot;Energy Trends, September 2007&quot;, Table 1.2:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.291W.2/4"> <td><i> Primary fuel input basis equivalent</i></td> <td><i> Million tonnes of oil</i></td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.291W.2/9">In terms of energy consumed, nuclear accounts for 19 per cent. of the electricity generated in the UK and electricity accounts for 18.5 per cent. of the energy used in the UK.

	<p pid="b.294W.0/2">I have not had a meeting to discuss the issue of Olympic target pistol shooters. This issue is being taken forward by colleagues at the Home Office who have recently secured agreement in principle from the Ministry of Defence on use of their ranges by a small squad of elite pistol shooters. To enable this to take place, the Home Secretary will need to use her powers under section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968 and I understand she has written to the First Minister for Scotland about the proposed arrangements and to establish whether he intends to exercise his powers in respect of Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="b.297W.0/1">Ownership of Waterloo International transfers to the Department at the end of March 2008 following Eurostar's de-commissioning of the facility as an international station. The Department is currently working closely with Network Rail and Stagecoach South West Trains (the train operating company) to finalise the design and costs associated with the partial conversion of Waterloo International to accommodate some domestic passenger services. Works on site are expected to commence soon after the station transfers to the Department and will take several months to complete. Services could then operate into and out of Platform 20 of Waterloo International from the start of the timetable change date in December 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.297W.0/2">Options to make use of all five platforms are being assessed by the Department and Network Rail as part of the medium term proposals to deliver the Department's strategy for providing additional capacity as set out in its White Paper on Delivering a Sustainable Railway which was published in July 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.297W.0/3">The medium term proposals would require significant infrastructure alterations at Waterloo. Additionally, it would be linked to the procurement of additional rolling stock to lengthen trains. The timescale for implementation is likely to be around 2012-14.</p>

The new database will allow, among other things, information to be recorded accurately relating to the tariff, Parole Board reviews and release of all life and indeterminate sentence prisoners. This new database is not likely to be fully operational until the early part of next year as it will be necessary to migrate core information and fully test the system before it goes live.</p>

DEFRA is represented on the Programme Board of relevant NERC climate change programmes, for example quantifying and understanding the earth system (QUEST). DEFRA specialists liaise closely with NERC scientists and theme leaders and there is close collaboration at the highest level between the two organisations.

	<p pid="b.318W.11/1">Supermarkets are already responsible for the environmental impact of the waste they generate.</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.11/2">There are two sets of packaging regulations in place to encourage producers (including retailers) to minimise, recycle and recover packaging and reduce packaging waste.</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.11/3">The Government have created incentives for all businesses to reduce, re-use and recycle their waste. For example, we have announced that the landfill tax escalator will be increased, so that the standard rate of tax will be raised by &pound;8 per annum from &pound;24 now to &pound;48 in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.11/4">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) assists both businesses and consumers in their efforts to be more efficient in their use of materials and reduce the impacts of their waste. WRAP is currently working with food retailers through the 'Courtauld Commitment', a voluntary agreement which aims to halt packaging growth by 2008 and make absolute reductions in packaging waste by 2010. 12 major retailers, representing 92 per cent. of the UK grocery sector, and 12 major brands have signed the commitment since its launch in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.11/5">In addition, DEFRA, working with WRAP and the devolved Administrations, has secured the agreement of UK retailers to reduce the overall environmental impact of their carrier bags by 25 per cent. by the end of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.318W.11/6">WRAP also has a target to divert 100,000 tonnes of food waste from landfill by March 2008. Retailers, and a number of significant food manufacturers, have agreed to work with WRAP to help deliver this target. More generally, DEFRA is working closely with the food industry to improve its environmental impact through the Food Industry Sustainability Strategy (FISS). The FISS targets a reduction in the food industry's own wastes of 15-20 per cent. by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.319W.6/1">In West Africa and the Sahel, the floods have coincided with the most critical time of year, when families face food insecurity. The destruction of crop and food stocks has aggravated the vulnerability of poor families both in the immediate and medium terms. In East Africa, the effects have been as severe&mdash;in Uganda, the next successful harvest cannot be expected before February 2008, and it will take at least two harvests for affected households to fully recover their losses.</p>
	<p pid="b.319W.6/2">Across the affected countries, medium term food security needs are being formally assessed by DFID's traditional partners (including the World Food Programme), and DFID will respond as appropriate on the basis of the vulnerabilities identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.319W.6/3">DFID has responded promptly to the humanitarian consequences of the flooding through relief interventions and complementary early recovery activities, where needs have been assessed and identified. Overall, a total of &pound;9.21 million has been allocated for flood response from the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF)&mdash;to which the UK has contributed &pound;42.2 million this year. The Togo contribution (&pound;110,000) was specifically for agricultural recovery.</p>
	<p pid="b.319W.6/4">DFID is also the largest donor to the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF) in Sudan, contributing approximately &pound;40 million this year, and the Humanitarian Response Fund (HRF) in Ethiopia, contributing &pound;3 million this year. These funds have been drawn down in Sudan (&pound;2.4 million) and Ethiopia (&pound;1 million) for flood response. Some of these funds will be directed towards addressing the longer term effects of the flooding.</p>
	<p pid="b.319W.6/5">Direct DFID funding is being provided where humanitarian and recovery needs remain unmet. So far DFID has contributed &pound;1 million in Ethiopia to the appeal of the international Red Cross (ICRC), some of which is being used for flood response, and a total of &pound;1.834 million in Uganda and Ghana. In. Ghana &pound;343,000 is in support of an agricultural recovery programme being implemented by CARE.</p>

	<p pid="b.324W.2/1">DFID supported the &quot;UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Post-Conflict Environmental Assessment for Sudan-2007&quot;. This concentrates on the links between conflict and the environment, including in Western Sudan. The report highlights competition over pastoral land and water in Darfur as a driving force behind the majority of local confrontations over the last 70 years. It also indicates a very strong link between land degradation, desertification and conflict in the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.324W.2/2">Further to this analysis, we are also providing &pound;2.18 million to support a new sustainable livelihoods programme in Darfur in partnership with UNEP, the UN Human Settlement Programme and the UN Resident Co-ordinator's Office. The programme aims to protect environmental assets, support strategies that &quot;do no harm&quot;, and promote environmentally-friendly solutions that sustainably protect the livelihoods of ordinary Darfuris. The programme will work with and through others to prevent deforestation, promote woodless construction and improve water resource management.</p>

	<p pid="b.330W.5/2">The costs and savings of changing the level of the standard minimum guarantee to the proportion of the average wage specified in the question are shown in the following table. There are a number of different definitions of average wages. For the purposes of this answer we are using the gross weekly average mean earnings reported by the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings 2007. This figure stands at &pound;549.80. 60 per cent. of this figure is &pound;329.88.</p>
	<p pid="b.330W.5/3">It should be noted that this is a very different definition to the one used to understand low incomes for pensioners. Low income pensioners are often measured as those living in households with an income below 60 per cent. of median household income. Here income is measured as total net disposable household income after deducting housing costs, adjusted for household size. In 2005-06, the 60 per cent. of median income amount after housing costs are deducted stood at the equivalent of &pound;108 for a single person without children.</p>

	<p pid="b.345W.8/1">It is not possible to provide these figures, as universities are only required to supply data relating to the highest level of subject classification rather than a detailed course breakdown (e.g. number studying physics, rather than number studying nuclear physics). Similarly, universities are not obliged to provide nationality data, only the country of domicile.</p>
	<p pid="b.345W.8/2">However, through the voluntary vetting scheme and now the academic technology approval scheme (ATAS), we do have the means, and have used it, to stop Iranian applications for proliferation-sensitive subjects where there are concerns. Under ATAS, non-European economic area students intending to undertake postgraduate study in the UK in areas which have been identified as sensitive need to apply for counter-proliferation clearance from the Government before taking up their study.</p>

	<p pid="b.348W.9/1">China and the US signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban treaty (CTBT) in 1996 but have not yet ratified it. India has neither signed nor ratified the treaty.</p>
	<p pid="b.348W.9/2">The United Kingdom strongly supports the earliest possible entry into force of the CTBT. We continue to take every appropriate opportunity, both bilaterally and through the EU, to urge all states who have not yet done so to sign and/or ratify the CTBT without delay and without condition. We most recently took action with India in April 2007, with the US in September 2007, and agreed EU action with China in November 2007. The UK also continues to support the outreach activities of Ambassador Ramaker, the Special Representative of the ratifiers of the treaty, staff of the Provisional Technical Secretariat and the Executive Secretary of the CTBT. In addition, the UK actively participates in the annual events held under the provisions of article XIV of the treaty to facilitate entry into force.</p>

The number of ASBOs issued in each year from April 1999 up to December 2005 (latest available) in (i) England (ii) London and (iii) each London borough can be found in the following tables. The number of ASBOs issued in Greater London shown in tables 1 and 2 differs due to the basis on which the ASBOs have been counted. Table 1 shows the number of ASBOs based on the location of the court that issued them and table 2 shows the number of ASBOs based on the local authority area in which the boundary prohibitions apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.354W.9/2">Data showing the number of offenders cautioned in England and London for all offences from 1997 to 2005 are in table 3. Data for 2006 will be available in late November 2007. The number of cautions issued in each London borough is not available, as police forces only supply cautions data for the whole of the force area.</p>
	<p pid="b.354W.9/3">The available information on formal warnings for cannabis possession (now known as cannabis warnings) is given in table 4. The data relate to the number of recorded offences detected by this method and are not available prior to 2004-05.</p>

	<p pid="b.362W.5/1">Following consideration of the assessment of the programme Ministers have decided not to continue to directly fund the live single non-emergency areas but will continue to provide funding to support the national 101 routing infrastructure to ensure that the number remains available for use by local areas wishing to implement or develop their own locally funded 101 service.</p>

Evaluation and assessment of the 101 service found that it had successfully demonstrated the benefits it was intended to achieve around improving access to and delivery of local community safety services. Importantly, through better partnership working and information about what problems are happening where, it has also helped local police and councils to target their resources more effectively and efficiently. It is hoped that the lessons learned and good practice will be mainstreamed into local operations wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.362W.5/3">Representations on funding were received from the existing live police and council partnership areas. These representations were taken into careful consideration in deciding the future for the 101 service.</p>
	<p pid="b.362W.5/4">The Home Office will have spent &pound;41 million to the end of 2007-08 on the development, implementation, support and live operation of the 101 service. The good practice and lessons learned for improving local services from this work, together with continued funding support for the national 101 telephony infrastructure, will help to inform and support further improvements to community safety and the maintenance or development of locally funded 101 services in local areas.</p>

Ex-police officers could retire from SOCA, take their lump sum and after a short break rejoin SOCA; but they would not be able to draw a full pension and a salary once they rejoined if this took them over their previous salary (i.e. abatement would apply).

	<p pid="b.364W.2/1">There are currently 19 Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) with a further 17 centres under development with the support of Home Office funding. The existing SARCs are primarily funded by police forces and primary care trusts, although funding sources and operating costs vary across the SARC network. The direct financial support for SARCs provided by the Home Office is set out in the attached table. In 2007-08 there have been three funding streams available to SARCs: capital start-up grants for new SARCs, grants to support the development of good practice in existing SARCs, and grants for independent sexual violence advisers based in SARCs.</p>
	<p pid="b.364W.2/2">&quot;National Service Guidelines on Developing SARCs&quot;, published jointly by the Home Office and the Department of Health in 2005, make clear that the primary responsibility for establishing and running SARCs sits with police forces and Primary Care Trusts, although they also encourage Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships to support the development of SARCs through local area agreements. These guidelines also provide guidance on the set up and running costs of SARCs. Guidance on policies and procedures is provided in &quot;Getting Started&quot; guidance produced by the National SARC Steering Group and updated in 2006. The Home Office also employs an expert consultant in SARC development to assist those setting up SARCs with establishing partnerships, costing proposals and developing operating procedures.</p>
	<p pid="b.364W.2/3">The Home Office and Department of Health engage in regular discussions about SARC development and are working in partnership to develop guidance for primary care trusts and local authorities on commissioning services for victims of sexual violence, including SARCs. Ministers from both Departments sit on the Inter-Departmental Ministerial Group on Sexual Offending, which includes the development of SARCs within its remit.</p>
	<p pid="b.364W.2/4">The Government have encouraged the development of SARCs through the publication of guidelines, the provision of start-up funding, the work of the expert consultant, and practitioner workshops. In October the Government published in draft the National Indicator Set for Local Strategic Partnerships which will be in operation from 2008-09. This included an indicator on access to support services for victims of serious sexual offences, including services provided by SARCs. We have also made clear through the new Making Communities Safer public service agreement that tackling serious sexual offences, including through the provision of support services to victims to reduce harm, is a priority for the Government.</p>

We are committed to widening family and inter-generational learning and to building links between adult learning and our agendas on parenting, children and extended schools. We have not commissioned research which looks specifically at the relationship between adult and community learning and child attainment but the Centre for Research on the Wider Benefits of Learning (which the Department manages jointly with DCSF) has produced a number of reports on the relationship between parental learning in general and children's education: &quot;A model of the inter-generational transmission of educational success&quot; by Leon Feinstein, Kathryn Duckworth and Ricardo Sabates (2004); &quot;Does education have an impact on mothers' educational attitudes and behaviours?&quot; by Leon Feinstein and Ricardo Sabates (2006); and &quot;Are there effects of mothers' post-16 education on the next generation?&quot; by Leon Feinstein and Kathryn Duckworth (2006). The Centre for the Economics of Education (also jointly managed by DIUS and DCSF) has also published research on family learning such as &quot;Parent's education and child's education: a natural experiment&quot; by Arnaud Chevalier (2004).</p>

	<p pid="b.378W.0/1">The Children's Workforce Network is working together to consider the needs of children and young people with a range of disabilities including speech, language and communication. A key part of this work is embedding the common core for children, young people and families in all qualifications which support the children's work force. The common core sets out the skills needed to communicate effectively with children and young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.378W.0/2">The Children's Workforce Development Council (CWDC) is also working with the Network to consider future action to ensure that the work force has the right skills and qualifications to meet the needs of children and young people with disabilities.

A suite of generic cross sector qualification units, based on the Common Core of Skills and Knowledge has been developed for the IQF. It is currently available as part of the test and trial of the Qualifications and Credit Framework (QCF) being developed by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. CWDC is working with partners, including DCSF and DIUS, who has responsibility for the QCF, to consider what else needs to be done to address the needs of children and young people with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.378W.0/4">CWDC's web-based portal was launched on <phrase class="date" code="">26 September</phrase>. It was developed with support from a wide range of partners and has been welcomed by practitioners. It is too early to say what impact it will have on the work force but CWDC is now working with partners to assess its use and consider how it can be further developed to ensure that the work force has access the right training and qualifications.</p>

	<p pid="b.379W.8/3" class="indent">Consultancy&mdash;as a result of discussions with HMT about the classification of consultancy costs in the light of the 2007 Consolidated Budgeting Guidance (Chapter 4), the Department has reclassified &pound;2.8 million of such costs from programme to administration with effect from 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="b.379W.8/4">In addition to these two items, the Department is exploring with HMT a case to score as programme some staff early release costs resulting from the commitment in the comprehensive spending review to deliver real terms savings of 5 per cent. year on year in administration costs. The Consolidated Budgeting Guidance (Chapter 4) permits such payments to be exceptionally scored as programme rather than administration where a case explicitly linked to improved efficiency has been agreed in advance with the Treasury.</p>

	<p pid="b.383W.2/1">Improving outcomes for children in care, including the proportion of care leavers who progress into HE, is of highest priority for the Government. The White Paper &quot;Care Matters: Time for Change&quot;, published in June 2007, set out a range of measures to improve the education of children in care. Ensuring that all children in care make better progression at school will enable more care leavers to enter higher education.</p>

It will place a duty on all local authorities to pay a bursary of a minimum of &pound;2,000 to all care leavers who enter higher education, on top of the existing support they already receive. This measure will further improve the financial support that care leavers receive for higher education.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.2/3">Further work to increase the numbers of care leavers progressing into higher education takes place through the &quot;Aimhigher&quot; programme. It helps people from under-represented backgrounds, including care leavers, to be able and willing to consider higher education as a viable option. The programme brings together local partnerships of schools, colleges and universities to design and deliver a range of aspiration and attainment-raising activities.</p>

	<p pid="b.383W.5/2">The main measure for tracking progress on increasing participation is currently the higher education initial participation rate (HEIPR). This is the sum of the HE initial participation rates for individual ages between 17 and 30 inclusive. It covers English-domiciled first-time entrants to HE courses, which are expected to last for at least six months, at UK higher education institutions and English, Scottish and Welsh further education colleges, and who remain on their course for at least six months. The earliest figure is 39.3 per cent. for 1999/2000 and the latest available figure is 42.8 per cent. for 2005/06.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.5/3">Equivalent figures for the 18 to 22-year-old age group are 33.4 per cent. for 1999/2000 and 36.2 per cent. for 2005/06.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.5/4">Equivalent figures for 18-year-olds are 19.3 per cent. for 1999/2000 and 21.3 per cent. for 2005/06. Figures for 2006/07 will become available in 2008. The HEIPR is not disaggregated below national level.</p>
	<p pid="b.383W.5/5">HEFCE's &quot;Young participation in Higher Education&quot; publication includes the proportion of young people who enter higher education at age 18 or 19 by parliamentary constituency, although this only covers the years up to 2000. Participation rates based on this work are given on the supporting POLAR website (<a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/polar">www.hefce.ac.uk/polar</a>). These indicate that, for the cohort reaching 18 in 1997, the proportion of young people from Romford who entered higher education at age 18 or 19 was 22 per cent. For the cohort reaching 18 in 2000, the proportion of young people from Romford who entered higher education at age 18 or 19 was also 22 per cent.</p>

It is possible that we will advise schools and group early years and childcare settings to close when a pandemic reaches their area. The decision on whether to issue such advice cannot be taken before there is a pandemic, as the decision will be based on the evaluation by expert advisers of the level of threat to children and young people from the pandemic strain of virus.</p>
	<p pid="b.385W.0/2">Officials from my Department are in discussion with partners in local government about the possibility of school staff assisting other services if schools were to close during a pandemic. However, we would hope that schools, working with their local authorities, would support remote learning by students during a pandemic, which would involve some, if not all, of a school's teaching staff.</p>

	<p pid="b.399W.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.399W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Colin Mowl, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-27">27 November 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.399W.5/3" class="indent">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking how many and what percentage of 18 to 24 year olds are unemployed in West Chelmsford constituency; and what the equivalent figures were on 27th November in each of the last five years. I am replying in her absence. (167892)</p>
	<p pid="b.399W.5/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles unemployment statistics for parliamentary constituencies from the annual local area Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions. These are annual surveys and the estimates derived from them cover twelve month periods, rather than a particular day.</p>
	<p pid="b.399W.5/5" class="indent">However, from the annual LFS and the APS, there is only one period in the last 5 years where the sample size is sufficient to provide an estimate of the number of unemployed 18 to 24 year olds in West Chelmsford. For April 2004 to March 2005, there were 1000 unemployed persons aged 18 to 24 resident in West Chelmsford. This was 7 per cent of all 18 to 24 year olds in West Chelmsford. This percentage is not the same as the unemployment rate, which is defined as the number unemployed as the percentage of the number of economically active persons in the age group of interest. The unemployment rate for 18 to 24 year olds in West Chelmsford in this period was 10 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.399W.5/6" class="indent">As these estimates are for a subset of the population in a small geographical area, they are based on very small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="b.399W.5/7" class="indent">ONS also compiles statistics for local areas of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). The table, attached, shows the number of JSA claimants aged 18 to 24, resident in West Chelmsford, claiming in November for 2002 to 2006 (data for November 2007 are not yet available).</p>
	<p pid="b.399W.5/8" class="indent">These numbers are not the numbers of claimants on the 27th of each November; the JSA claimant count date is the second Thursday of each month. These numbers cannot be shown as the percentage of all persons aged 18 to 24, as the working age population estimates for parliamentary constituencies cannot be broken down into different age groups.</p>

We expect this funding, and other sources, to generate 110,000 social housing units over the next three years in comparison with 78,000 units over the last three years. The South East's proposed provisional share of this is &pound;1.37 billion. We expect this additional investment to fund over 12,700 affordable homes per year in the period 2008-11. This compares with an average of 8,200 affordable homes per year over the previous three years.</p>

	<p pid="b.409W.0/1">In 2003 <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1646" name="John Prescott">my right hon. Friend the Member for Hull, East (Mr. Prescott)</phrase>, as Deputy Prime Minister, published &quot;Sustainable Communities: building for the future&quot;, a document setting out a programme of action to tackle key housing problems including lack of affordable housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.409W.0/2">The programme of actions included the establishment of Regional Housing Boards in each of the regions to develop a Regional Housing Strategy on which to base advice to Ministers about strategic housing priorities and allocation of housing capital funding from the new Regional Housing Pot.</p>
	<p pid="b.409W.0/3">The West Midlands Regional Housing Board (RHB), in its first West Midlands Regional Housing Strategy published 2005, identified the need for affordable housing as a key regional priority, particularly in the south and west of the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.409W.0/4">On that basis the RHB made recommendations to Ministers about allocations of funding for the Affordable Housing Programme (formerly Approved Development Programme&mdash;ADP), administered by the Housing Corporation, resulting in an allocation to the West Midlands of &pound;377 million pounds over the period 2004-05 to 2007-08, to subsidise delivery of 8,500 new affordable homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.409W.0/5">Prior to the formation of the RHB, the ADP was allocated on an annual basis through the Housing Corporation and in 2003-04 the allocation was &pound;84.11 million. Therefore, over the five year period 2003-04 to 2007-08 allocations to the West Midlands for the provision of new affordable housing total &pound;460 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.409W.0/6">In October 2007 the Government announced their overall funding for housing capital allocations for 2008-11. The West Midlands was allocated &pound;209 million for 2008-09 (18 per cent. higher than 2007-08); &pound;228 million for 2009-10 (11 per cent. in-year rise), and &pound;245 million for 2010-11 (7 per cent. in-year rise).</p>
	<p pid="b.409W.0/7">This additional funding comes with a higher target for delivery of affordable housing, with the West Midlands expected to achieve 10,800 new affordable homes over the period 2008-11.</p>

	<p pid="b.411W.6/1">Planning permissions for active and dormant quarries are compatible with current planning and environment law. However, mineral permissions do differ from other planning permissions in that many were granted just after the Second World War and they can involve continuous development over many years, and sometimes decades. As with other planning permissions, mineral consents and permissions are property rights which cannot, in general, be taken away with without compensation. The Planning and Compensation Act 1991 and the Environment Act 1995 introduced legislation to initially review old mineral permissions granted before <phrase class="date" code="1982-02-22">22 February 1982</phrase> and then periodically review, at 15 year intervals, all mineral permissions to ensure that operations are in accordance with conditions which reflect the most up to date environmental standards. In 2000, regulations were introduced applying environmental impact assessment to reviews of mineral permissions where the remaining development is likely to have significant effects on the environment.</p>

Although vaccination may not protect all elderly people from flu virus infection experts, including those from the Health Protection Agency (HPA), advise that the majority of those immunised benefit by suffering a less severe illness.

During the years that these records have been collected the National Health Service there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time. <i> Data Quality</i><i> </i>HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i> Finished admission episodes (FAE)</i><i> </i>A FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. <i> All Diagnoses count of episodes</i><i> </i>These figures represent a count of all FAEs where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in a HES record. <i> ICD10 code used for Alcoholic Liver Disease = K70</i><i> </i>ICD10 code used for Cirrhosis of Liver: K70.3 Alcoholic cirrhosis of liver K71.7 Toxic liver disease with fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver K74.3 Primary biliary cirrhosis K74.4 Secondary biliary cirrhosis K74.5 Biliary cirrhosis, unspecified K74.6 Other and unspecified cirrhosis of liver.</td> </tr>
