	<p pid="d.1490W.13/1">Bird of prey populations are not assessed annually in the UK so it is not possible to provide figures for each year since 2001. The population of most species is assessed periodically by species-specific surveys of breeding numbers. The latest available results from these, together with the year/s of survey, are provided in the following table. The table also gives the estimated population trend since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="d.1490W.13/2">A tentative estimate for the current total population of all birds of prey in the UK, based on the information in the table, is around 145,000 breeding pairs.</p>

	<p pid="d.1494W.3/1">The Minister's Mandate for the New Forest is due for review and renewal in 2008. Since the current mandate was presented to the Forestry Commission in 1999, the New Forest has seen considerable change, not least the establishment of the New Forest national park. Any future mandate would need to take account of those changes and the new legislation and governance arrangements for the area.</p>
	<p pid="d.1494W.3/2">Preparation of the management plan for the national park is due for completion in March 2009. The management plan will establish the framework for future actions to secure and enhance the area's special qualities and the Forestry Commission, who are responsible for the management of 47 per cent. of the park area, will play a full part in its delivery.</p>
	<p pid="d.1494W.3/3">Given the time scale for the preparation of the management plan, I have asked the Forestry Commission to seek views locally about whether it is better for the mandate to be reviewed in 2008 as originally intended or after the National Park Management Plan is completed. Should the review be deferred then, I would extend the existing mandate over the intervening period. Once I have received the Forestry Commission's advice, I will write to the hon. Member.</p>

	<p pid="d.1497W.8/1">My Department has made no projections for increases in fly-tipping under waste incentive schemes.</p>
	<p pid="d.1497W.8/2">For modelling purposes, the impact assessment for this policy assesses the possible effect of waste incentive schemes on levels of waste-related offences, and the potential costs to local authorities. The impact assessment can be found on the Department's website.</p>
	<p pid="d.1497W.8/3">We also think that it is sensible for pilot authorities to review their policies for tackling fly-tipping, and to have a fly-tipping prevention strategy in place. Having a strategy in place to deal with fly-tipping is good common sense for all authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.1497W.8/4">Evidence from other countries where similar schemes operate suggests that an increase in fly-tipping is not an automatic consequence of introducing them. Where increases in fly-tipping have been seen overseas, this quickly tails off where schemes are well designed and effective enforcement action is taken. Having a good strategy is in the first instance an important part of effective enforcement.</p>

	<p pid="d.1499W.2/2">Japan plans to kill 935 minke and 50 fin whales in the Antarctic this season under its &quot;scientific&quot; research programme (known as JARPA II). Agreed estimates from the International Whaling Commission's Scientific Committee for both species are too old and uncertain to be relied upon. While it seems unlikely that Japan's activities will put the survival of either species at serious risk, we note that fin whales are listed as &quot;Endangered&quot; on the World Conservation Union Red List of threatened species. Hunting this species may therefore put at risk the survival of small localised populations frequenting the Antarctic and South Pacific.</p>

	<p pid="d.1500W.0/1">The Government are making &pound;212 million available to travel concession authorities in England for 2008-09 to cover the cost of the new statutory minimum bus concession which commences on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>. This is based on very generous assumptions about fares, the take-up of passes, and the number of extra journeys. It also includes a significant contingency to allow for the difficulty of distributing grant by formula and uncertainty around likely travel patterns. No specific allowance has been made for transport inflation but the total allocation will increase to &pound;217 million in 2009-10 and &pound;223 million in 2010-11. We are confident that this will be sufficient to cover the on-going cost of the concession although we will be monitoring its impact closely. Authorities offering concessions that are more generous than the statutory minimum must do so at their own cost. We have no plans to provide additional funding to individual authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.1500W.0/2">In terms of considering the needs of rural authorities, we are proposing a distribution of this grant that takes into account visitor numbers, levels of bus use, retail floor space, and eligible population&mdash;all variables likely to be linked to the eventual pattern of cost. Our proposed distribution also reflects the clear preference of those who responded to our recent consultation on the issue.</p>

Government would then decide which to proceed with once bids had been returned and a measure of the cost and affordability of each proposition was known.</p>
	<p pid="d.1505W.2/2">Southeastern regulated fares have an overall cap of an annual average increase of 3 per cent. above the retail price index, or 6.8 per cent. for 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.1505W.2/3">Individual regulated fares can increase by more than the average and for Southeastern fares, the maximum is 8 per cent. above inflation. Therefore, individual regulated fares on Southeastern were permitted to rise by up to 11.8 per cent. for 2008, provided average increases were limited to RPI+3 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="d.1507W.2/1">Over the 10-year period covered by the first and second Local Transport Plan rounds, the Department for Transport is providing more than &pound;6.5 billion for highways maintenance to English highway authorities outside London, to cover a range of investment in the network including street lighting. In addition, we have allocated &pound;1.4 billion in credits for street lighting PFI schemes, including &pound;64.3 million recently announced for the Coventry Street Lighting PFI project.

	<p pid="d.1512W.3/1">Government is committed to improving the rates of successful prosecution in rape cases. Specialist police units, staffed by highly skilled and trained personnel, are dedicated to enhancing the service to victims of rape and sexual assault and both PSNI and the Public Prosecution Service are seeking to develop models of best investigative practice so that more offences can achieve the threshold for prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="d.1512W.3/2">The Northern Ireland Office and the Department of Health and Social and Personal Services have also jointly developed, and consulted on, a draft regional strategy for addressing sexual violence in Northern Ireland which will address these issues through a robust action plan delivering on strategic objectives in three key areas&mdash;crime prevention, better victim support and improved protection and justice measures. The strategy is to be published this spring.</p>
	<p pid="d.1512W.3/3">Table 1 shows the number of rapes (including attempts) recorded by PSNI from 2001-02 to 2006-07 by DCU. As the DCU structure was only introduced in 2001-02, it is not possible to provide a breakdown by DCU prior to this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.1512W.3/4">Table 2 shows the number of prosecutions, convictions and percentage conviction rate for rape by District Command Unit from 2000 to 2005 (the years for which figures are available).</p>
	<p pid="d.1512W.3/5">Data are collated on the basis of the principal offence; so only the most serious offence with which an offender is charged is included.</p>
	<p pid="d.1512W.3/6">It is not possible routinely to reconcile recorded crime data from PSNI with prosecution and conviction data. Data from PSNI relate to the number of offences, whereas data on prosecutions and convictions relate to the number of offenders brought before the courts. In addition, PSNI data denote each offence as it has been initially recorded, and this may differ from the offence for which a suspect or suspects are subsequently proceeded against in the courts. I therefore regret that a direct comparison between recorded rape and convictions for rape cannot easily be made.</p>

The MLA has already committed to maintain current levels of support for the scheme for 2008-09. Since the 2004 Spending Review, the Department's funding allocation to the MLA has not included ring-fencing for the PAS.</p>

	<p pid="d.1524W.2/1">I can confirm that the new management transfer power proposed for the social housing regulator OFTENANT at clause 225 of the Housing and Regeneration Bill permits the regulator to transfer management functions of social housing owned by a registered provider to any other specified person (that is, any organisation). This includes arm's length management organisations.</p>
	<p pid="d.1524W.2/2">Clause 225 is a new power recommended by the Cave Review of social housing regulation. It gives OFTENANT the power to address systematically poor management without transferring ownership of the assets. The power could be used in respect of all a provider's homes or a proportion of them, so it could be used to address issues on a specific estate. The owner of the homes would be subject to the regulatory regime and would ensure the managing agent met any relevant standards. This power could only be exercised following an inquiry under clauses 183 to 186 and is subject to appeal to the High Court.</p>
	<p pid="d.1524W.2/3">Similarly, if OFTENANT directed the registered provider to put social housing management functions out to competitive tender, under clause 223, an arm's length management organisation could tender for the work and be selected as manager.</p>

	<p pid="d.1528W.6/1">We have committed to an ambitious timetable for improvements to the carbon standard of new homes so that from 2016 all new homes will be zero carbon. In 2010 and 2013 we will improve the carbon standard as set out in building regulations by 25 per cent. and 44 per cent. respectively, compared to current building regulations.</p>
	<p pid="d.1528W.6/2">We have also made the commitment that all new homes developed by English Partnerships or with direct funding from the Government's housing growth programmes are now being built to level 3 of the Code for Sustainable Homes. Additionally, Housing Corporation funded homes built by registered social landlords will, from the start of the next national Affordable Housing programme (beginning April 2008) comply with level 3 of the Code. As well as producing 25 per cent. less carbon than homes built to current building regulations, these homes will also be designed to minimise their environmental impact outside of carbon emissions in areas such as the water they use, the waste they generate and the materials that they are built from.</p>
	<p pid="d.1528W.6/3">Furthermore, the industry, together with local authorities and other stakeholders have been invited to come forward with proposals for eco-towns. Eco-towns will be entirely new settlements which are exemplar &quot;green developments&quot; of 5,000 to 20,000 homes and designed to meet the highest standards of sustainability. The development as a whole (including all homes) should reach zero carbon and should use the standards set out in the Code for Sustainable Homes as a guide.</p>

	<p pid="d.1533W.3/2">Christmas trees are recycled through a number of routes. Both local authorities and businesses offer facilities where individuals can deposit their Christmas trees. Many local authorities offer either specific collection points or operate a green waste collection following Christmas and collect trees through this route, but my Department does not hold details of the exact number doing so.</p>
	<p pid="d.1533W.3/3">205 local authorities in England collect cards at the kerbside as part of their dry recycling collection scheme. The Woodland Trust also promotes a dedicated Christmas cards collection scheme in association with WHSmith, Tesco, TK Maxx and Marks and Spencer. Last year, 93 million cards were collected through the Woodland Trust scheme, saving 2,400 tonnes of CO2. This is equivalent to taking over 700 cars off the road for a year.</p>

Every LDF includes a core strategy as the key overarching document but other plans vary according to circumstances. Projections are not easy to make with total accuracy but I currently expect over 90 per cent. of core strategies to be adopted by March 2011, 99 per cent. by March 2012 and 100 per cent. by March 2013.</p>

	<p pid="d.1536W.5/1">The proposal for a new settlement at Northstowe was put forward by local authorities in Cambridgeshire (Cambridgeshire county council, South Cambridgeshire district council and Cambridge city council) and adopted in the Cambridgeshire structure plan in 2003, and taken forward in 2006 through the South Cambridgeshire Core Strategy and an area action plan all of which predate the eco-towns programme. I understand that a planning application, being taken forward by English Partnerships and Gallaghers, who jointly own most of the area for development is expected shortly. The ambition is for Northstowe to be an early prototype for eco-towns including being an exemplar of sustainability in the use of renewable energy resources and reducing carbon emissions.</p>

	<p pid="d.1540W.11/2"><i> </i>Details of the UK's bilateral assistance and imputed multilateral assistance to Tanzania over the last five years are laid out in the following tables.</p>
	<p pid="d.1540W.11/3">The majority of the UK's bilateral assistance to Tanzania is provided direct to the Government of Tanzania in the form of Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS). We provide significant levels of PRBS as Tanzania meets the requirements of the UK's Conditionally Policy, namely, a commitment to poverty reduction, a respect for human rights and a credible reform programme in place, including of public financial management. The UK regularly monitors Tanzania's continued adherence to this policy, including throughout the year with the 13 other budget support donors and also using a range of diagnostic tools (for example, the World Bank's Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability indicators) and independent surveys of corruption. We also use international and local data on poverty reduction to assess the progress the Government of Tanzania are making in improving the lives of their people.</p>
	<p pid="d.1540W.11/4">In addition to PRBS, the UK provides significant support to the Government of Tanzania's efforts to reform, improve public financial management and tackle corruption. For example, the UK has just agreed to provide &pound;20 million over the next four years to support the Government's public service reforms and build their capacity to deliver basic services to the poor.</p>
	<p pid="d.1540W.11/5">In addition to our support direct to Government, the UK provides significant project and programme support to strengthening accountability and deepening democracy in Tanzania, including through support for civil society, the media and Parliament. Levels of scrutiny within Tanzania have significantly increased in the last two years. Alongside this, the UK supports the private sector to deliver the continued economic growth Tanzania needs to lift itself out of poverty in the long-term.</p>

	<p pid="d.1542W.12/1">The Scotland Act 1998 is working well to secure the benefits of devolution within the United Kingdom for Scotland. Flexibility has always been contained in the Scotland Act and the Government will continue to be willing to adjust the settlement, using the powers contained within the Scotland Act, in whatever way is appropriate in the interests of good government. We will only make changes that strengthen the stability of the Union.</p>

All fluorescent lighting tubes are recycled, as is waste cooking oil.

	<p pid="d.1549W.2/2">The Department has already met both targets. In 2006-07, 54 per cent. of our electricity was supplied from renewable sources, with a further 9 per cent. from CHP sources.

	<p pid="d.1549W.5/2">The Department did not meet the target to reverse the upward trend in carbon emissions by April 2007. However, early indications for 2007-08 indicate that the upward trend has been reversed significantly, as the many projects and campaigns in place to reduce energy use begin to show positive results. It is important to note that the range of services offered to the public and the way in which they are delivered has changed dramatically since the baselines were set. Enhanced customer service, such as extended opening and contact times, means the Department has maximised its contribution to the social element of sustainable development; the trade-off for this being an increase in energy use, albeit one that we are successfully addressing.</p>

	<p pid="d.1549W.11/1">Employers are central to our aspirations of improving the health of the working age population and helping more people with health conditions and disabilities to find and keep work. As such, a key focus of the cross-government Health, Work and Well-being Strategy is engaging and supporting business. Practical support provided has included supporting Institute of Directors' guidance on managing workplace well-being; the Health and Safety Executive's (HSE) Workplace Health Connect pilot, which has been testing the provision of free occupational health and return to work advice to smaller and medium-sized employers; and Shift's &quot;Action on Stigma&quot; campaign, which has developed resources to help line managers deal with employees with mental health conditions. We have also announced our intention to pilot a new advice and support service for employers, specifically focused on managing staff suffering from mental ill-health.</p>
	<p pid="d.1549W.11/2">This programme builds on the core activity of the HSE which works with employers and trade unions to make workplaces healthier and reduce the likelihood of injury and ill-health being caused by work. HSE provides a wide range of free and priced written guidance on the management of health and safety, as well as an extensive website. In addition, HSE's public enquiry telephone contact centre, Infoline, provides access to workplace health and safety information, guidance and expert advice.</p>
	<p pid="d.1549W.11/3">DWP has also set up a Vocational Rehabilitation Task Group to look at the best ways of encouraging and supporting employers to provide good quality rehabilitative services to their staff. The task group has commissioned an evidence review to assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of such interventions, which will help to guide employers.</p>

	<p pid="d.1553W.2/1">As part of its research and analysis programme over the last few years, the Department has published several analyses on incentives to save in a pension, and the role of income related benefits. This includes Projections of Pension Credit Entitlement, Financial Incentives to Save for Retirement, the Pensions Bill&mdash;Impact Assessment, and the Gender Impact Assessment of Pension Reform. These analyses show that, under reasonable assumptions about factors such as investment growth, the large majority of individuals likely to be affected by private pension reform&mdash;including many of those who may end up on income related benefits in retirement&mdash;can expect to benefit from saving.</p>
	<p pid="d.1553W.2/2">The Department also commissioned work on savings incentives from NIESR (The Effects of Means-testing Pensions on Savings and Retirement) and IFS (The Importance of Incentives in Influencing Private Retirement Savings: Known Knowns and Known Unknowns). These found, respectively, that the introduction of pension credit in 2003 strengthened incentives for lower-income households to save for retirement, and that many individuals face positive incentives to save in a private pension.</p>

	<p pid="d.1554W.3/1">The law requires people who work on gas appliances to be competent and, if that gas work is done as business, that business must be CORGI-registered. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) publicises this key message, and the danger and likely illegality of DIY work, through a range of free guidance literature and via its website <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/gas/domestic/index.htm">www.hse.gov.uk/gas/domestic/index.htm</a>. CORGI, approved by HSE to run the gas installer registration scheme, reinforces these messages through regular publicity campaigns, co-ordinated with the gas industry. A reform of the gas installer registration scheme will establish this as a major responsibility of the appointed provider of the new scheme.</p>
	<p pid="d.1554W.3/2">HSE follows up complaints and information received about illegal gas installers. It takes targeted enforcement action in line with the Health and Safety Commission's Enforcement Policy Statement. In 2006-07 approximately 9 per cent. of all offences prosecuted by HSE related to gas safety matters; of these 19 per cent. related specifically to unregistered installers. HSE has undertaken targeted enforcement initiatives against illegal installers, leading to innovative penalties such as community orders with an unpaid work requirement and to cases being well publicised. HSE also works with CORGI in tackling the issue of unregistered gas installers, through both investigative and awareness raising activities. The reform of the registration scheme envisages a possible new function for the new provider to take enforcement action against illegal gas workers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1554W.3/3">Statistics on the number of illegal gas installers working in the UK are not available.</p>
	<p pid="d.1554W.3/4">There are no official figures on the number of carbon monoxide poisoning incidents caused by illegal gas work. There was one fatal incident in 2006-07 involving such work, in which three people were killed. The installer was prosecuted and received a custodial sentence.</p>

	<p pid="d.1558W.5/1">It is the responsibility of benefit recipients to advise the Department if they are committed to prison. However, we recognise that not all prisoners do notify us of this, so we have processes in place for HM Prison Service and the Scottish Prison Service, to send us data on admissions so we can identify prisoners who are receiving benefits to which they are no longer entitled. From December 2006, the frequency of this data was increased from monthly to weekly. In 2006-07, nearly 8,000 cases were corrected as a result of this type of data matching. This led to us identifying over &pound;2.2 million in recoverable overpayments.</p>

Estimates for the first of these categories are readily available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) for the second quarter of 2007 (April to June). Of the estimated 12.9 million dependent children living in families in households in the United Kingdom, 2.8 million dependent children were in lone mother families. Comparable figures for the other two categories are not readily available. For step families, available estimates based on the 2001 Census relate to number of families and do not separately identify the number of children living with a step-father.</p>
	<p pid="d.1560W.7/6" class="indent">There is no single estimate of children living apart from both parents. This group includes children living in households with other relatives (e.g. grandparents) or in foster or adoptive families; and children living in communal establishments without their parents e.g. those 'looked after children' in residential homes.</p>

	<p pid="d.1566W.8/1">The Government support people who are on low incomes and working full-time primarily through the working tax credit (WTC). Together with the national minimum wage, tax credits have enabled the Government to guarantee minimum levels of income and tax credits entitlement for full-time workers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1566W.8/2">This means, for instance, that from April 2008, a single person, aged 25 or over, who is in full-time work will have a combined weekly income and tax credit entitlement of at least &pound;187. A household with one adult in full-time work, with one child, will have a combined weekly income and tax credit entitlement of no less than &pound;290, while for a couple with no children and one adult in full-time work the equivalent minimum will be &pound;221.</p>
	<p pid="d.1566W.8/3">The Government also offer support for low-income workers through the child care element of WTC. This ensures that workers can keep more of their earnings by paying for up to 80 per cent. of child care costs up to a maximum of &pound;175 per week for one child and &pound;300 for two or more children.</p>

	<p pid="d.1569W.2/4" class="indent">The CPI and the RPI measure changes from month to month in the cost of a representative 'basket' of goods and services bought by consumers. Each year the ONS reviews the RPI and CPI basket of goods and services and updates the weights used to aggregate price changes, to ensure the selection of products in the basket and their weights remain representative of the overall pattern of expenditure of the average household covered by the published indices.</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.2/5" class="indent">There are some goods and services where household expenditure is sufficiently large that they merit inclusion in the basket in their own right: examples include petrol and telephone charges. More commonly, it is necessary to select a sample of specific goods and services that can give a reliable measure of price movements for a broader range of similar items. For example, price changes for garden spades might be considered representative of price changes for other garden tools.</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.2/6" class="indent">The components of the 2007 RPI and CPI basket of goods and services are shown in this article, available on the National Statistics website. Please see Annex B of:</p>

	<p pid="d.1569W.2/9" class="indent">Each item in the index is weighted to reflect the proportion of household expenditure spent on them. Changes in the weights of components over time reflect changes in the expenditure pattern of households. The underlying data source for the weights for both the RPI and CPI is ONS's Expenditure and Food Survey (EPS). The EPS is a continuous household survey which monitors the spending patterns of around 6,000 households across the country each year.</p>

	<p pid="d.1569W.5/4" class="indent">Estimates of household income (which include income from all sources such as earnings, benefits, pensions, and investment income), are generally based on household surveys. The largest of these is the Family Resources Survey which has an annual sample in the UK of around 28,000 households. This is sufficient to produce estimates of household income at national and regional level, but not for smaller areas. Statistics on earnings by employees are available for local authorities from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) which is an employer-based survey.</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.5/5" class="indent">The ONS has published estimates of household income for what are known as the medium layer super output areas, for 2004/05 only. These estimates are based on a statistical model and are classed as experimental statistics&mdash;this means they have been developed in accordance with the principles set out in the National Statistics Code of Practice but have yet to be fully accredited as National Statistics. They are available through the Neighbourhood Statistics section of the ONS website. Super Output Areas (SOA's) are a new geographic hierarchy designed to improve the reporting of small area statistics. Unlike electoral wards, these SOA's are of consistent size across the country and are not subject to regular boundary change.</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.5/6" class="indent">The table provided shows household income for each London borough for 2004/05, before and after housing costs. These estimates have been calculated using the estimates of income and also estimates of population for each SOA to calculate a weighted average income for each London Borough. The population estimates themselves are also experimental statistics. Figures on the number of households in each SOA are not available.</p>
	<p pid="d.1569W.5/7" class="indent">The average household income figures for the UK are taken from the 'Households Below Average Income' series produced using the Family Resources Survey. These are National Statistics. The 'Household Below Average Income' series usually presents results based on median incomes, however mean incomes are presented here to be more comparable with the small area statistics.</p>

	<p pid="d.1578W.8/1">Defence Ministers are taking an active lead in the work being done on accommodation&mdash;this involves frequent meetings, briefings and site visits with stakeholders, service personnel and other interested parties. We want to ensure a step-change and to drive forward further work on upgrading and improving accommodation, including repair and maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="d.1578W.8/2">In recent years a single Housing Prime Contract (HPC) has been set-up covering the maintenance of some 45,000 service families accommodation (SFA) in England and Wales, which replaced hundreds of previous contracts. The HPC helpline ensures that emergency calls are responded to quickly with nearly all emergency repairs now being effected within the required timescales. Since 2003 SFA in Scotland has been maintained as part of the Regional Prime Contract.</p>
	<p pid="d.1578W.8/3">In a similar timeframe, Project Single Living Accommodation Modernisation (SLAM) was launched to deliver new en-suite SLA across the UK together with several parallel PFI projects. These initiatives have resulted in 12,000 SFA and 20,000 SLA being upgraded since 2002 and have increased the efficiency of delivery.</p>
	<p pid="d.1578W.8/4">We are also developing an Estate Development Plan which will help us ensure we have an estate of the right size and quality.</p>

	<p pid="d.1583W.5/1">If a continuity of education allowance (CEA) claimant dies in service, the allowance will continue to be paid either to the end of the current stage of education, or for up to two full terms after the term in which the death of the service person occurred, whichever is the longer extension. This support applies to all children for whom CEA was being claimed prior to the date of death in service, and delivers the very continuity that the allowance was designed to provide.</p>
	<p pid="d.1583W.5/2">Moreover, if a child is already studying for public examinations, CEA will continue to be paid for up to four years or to the end of the term in which the child takes the examination and then leaves school, whichever is soonest. By way of example, for a child aged 14 to 16 years who subsequently moves on to A-level studies, this would normally be up to four further years. Conversely, for a child aged 16 to 18 years, it would normally be up to two further years.</p>
	<p pid="d.1583W.5/3">Given the emphasis on providing continuity of education, the allowance does not infer new entitlement for any child(ren) not already in receipt of CEA when the service parent dies.</p>
	<p pid="d.1583W.5/4">Importantly, however, the same degree of support is available in all cases where a CEA claimant dies in service, whether or not the individual was deployed on operations. The above provisions are also available in all instances where CEA claimants are invalided from the armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="d.1590W.8/1">The final demand vectors form one part of a complex methodology for deriving the estimates of UK employment dependent on MOD expenditure and defence exports, and associated breakdowns on MOD expenditure in UK industry and commerce. The latest aggregate information on the non equipment and equipment vectors is published by the Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA) in Table 1.9a of &quot;UK Defence Statistics 2007&quot;: a copy of which is available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="d.1590W.8/2">In isolation the raw underlying data used to construct these vectors will not reconcile to these final published estimates as a series of internal adjustments are made to the vectors prior to publication. Moreover, the vectors will also not reconcile to the published MOD resource accounts since they are constructed using cash rather than resource data. To correct these raw figures to make them consistent with published accounts would involve disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.1590W.8/3">A full account of the methodology, associated caveats and descriptions of the data sources used to construct these vectors can be found in the DASA &quot;Defence Statistics Bulletins Nos. 5 and 5A&quot;: both of which are available in the Library of the House.</p>

The scheme focussed on survivors of Nazi Concentration Camps. Servicemen held as ordinary POWs and civilian internees held in non-concentration camps were excluded. In the late-1990s, a fund totalling some &pound;3.3 billion was set up by the German Government and industry to make payments to those civilians who were forced labourers. Again, service personnel held as POWs were excluded.</p>

I have raised these concerns with the Colombian Government, including when I visited Colombia in November 2007. However, it is clear that illegal armed groups and terrorist organisations such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are responsible for the majority of abuses in Colombia, as acknowledged in the 2006 report of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia.</p>
	<p pid="d.1607W.7/2">Helping the Government and civil society in Colombia to protect and promote the basic human rights of all Colombians is a priority for this Government. A large part of our bilateral assistance programme, including with the Colombian armed forces, is focused on human rights. I am satisfied that no UK assistance is being used to commit human rights abuses, directly or indirectly. We have received no evidence to suggest that this is the case.</p>

	<p pid="d.1614W.5/1">Since coming to power, President Berdimuhamedov has carried out some reforms but has not yet changed the fundamental political and economic character of the country. For example, he has instituted agricultural and educational reform, and modified pensions. He has relaxed travel restrictions and broadened internet access. He has encouraged students to travel abroad for education and members of the Government to learn from the experience of other countries. He has increased Turkmenistan's engagement with other countries and improved relations both with its neighbours and with the wider world.</p>
	<p pid="d.1614W.5/2">Under President Berdimuhamedov, Turkmenistan has engaged more with the UN, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and EU on human rights, including by extending invitations to experts to visit the country. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the previous OSCE Chairman-in-Office, the current OSCE Secretary-General and the Director of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), have all visited this year and have received assurances of co-operation from the President, including on electoral reform. ODIHR sent a needs assessment mission to the presidential election in February 2007. The Government have agreed to a comprehensive EU/UN human rights project. There have been some limited releases of political prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="d.1614W.5/3">In late December 2007, President Berdimuhamedov announced reforms which will eventually lead to the abolition of the dual exchange rate. This is a welcome step, although it will take time to work through the economy.</p>
	<p pid="d.1614W.5/4">Given the nature of the previous regime, it remains too early to assess the full extent and the ultimate direction of reform, but the signs are encouraging. With our EU and other partners, we will continue to work with Turkmenistan in support of the President's reform agenda.</p>

	<p pid="d.1618W.0/1">The information requested is not readily available and to attempt to provide it would incur disproportionate cost. The figures given as follows are the best that can be provided in the time available from information held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="d.1618W.0/2">Table 1 records the number of individual bankruptcy orders in the London region (classified according to the Official Receiver's (OR) offices), for those cases where trading information was available. The figures are broken down by the length of trading period (years). Table 2 shows a similar breakdown for company compulsory liquidations.</p>
	<p pid="d.1618W.0/3">It should particularly be noted that the only information held on which to base 'length of establishment' is the trading start and end dates, but that this is only available for on average 25 per cent. of trading bankrupts and 20 per cent. of compulsory liquidations over the period requested (nationally). This means that these figures should be interpreted with extreme caution and should not be considered to be representative of the totality of trading bankrupts or company liquidations during the period in question.</p>
	<p pid="d.1618W.0/4">A breakdown by length of establishment is not available by London borough. Further, it should be noted that there are movements of individual OR's offices between broader regions which coincide with financial years, notably in FY 2004-05, Croydon OR's office moved from Anglia to London region. This means that the statistics cannot be treated as a consistent time series.</p>

	<p pid="d.1622W.2/59">The Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB) provides independent advice to the Government on the remuneration of the senior civil service (SCS). The Cabinet Office submits the Government's evidence to the SSRB for the annual pay round. Once a decision is made on whether to accept the SSRB recommendation, the Cabinet Office issues documentation on the SCS performance management and pay framework.

In the UK, local authority civic amenity sites have registered their sites as designed collection facilities (DCFs) where consumers can return their WEEE for free. Producers, through their Producer Compliance Schemes, are liable for the costs of collecting, treating and recycling household WEEE from a DCF. Consumers can locate details of their nearest recycling centre from <a href="http://recycle-more.co.uk/">http://recycle-more.co.uk/</a></p>

	<p pid="d.1629W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-26">26 November 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="d.1629W.2/2">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="d.1629W.2/3" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> It is estimated that there are 292,000 jobs which were paying below the applicable NMW rate in April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.1629W.2/4" class="indent">Some people may be paid below the NMW due to non-compliance with the legislation. The Government have announced their intention to introduce new penalties for all employers who underpay the national minimum wage and a fairer system of paying arrears. These measures are included in the Employment Bill announced in the Queen's Speech 2007. However, not all those that are paid less than the NMW reflect non-compliance. There are a number of circumstances where the national minimum wage does not apply and so individuals may legitimately earn less than the appropriate national minimum wage rate for their age. For example, individuals may be on Government training programmes or apprenticeships, where they are exempt for the first year, up to the age of 26. Employees may also not be receiving the national minimum wage in cash terms because employers can legitimately reduce rates to take into account the cost of accommodation provided, for which there is a standard level of deduction.</p>
	<p pid="d.1629W.2/5" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> The estimates of those at the NMW level are not available from the Office of National Statistics, as hourly earnings are calculated from weekly earnings divided by the numbers of hours, it is not possible to be so precise. However, the number of jobs less than the NMW plus 5p are 921,000 (3.6 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="d.1629W.2/6" class="indent"><i> (c)</i> 3,939 jobs (16.5 per cent.)</p>
	<p pid="d.1629W.2/7" class="indent"><i> (d)</i> 2,279 jobs (9.5 per cent.)</p>
	<p pid="d.1629W.2/8" class="indent"><i> (e)</i> 2,062 jobs (8.6 per cent.)</p>
	<p pid="d.1629W.2/9" class="indent"><i> (f)</i> 1,777 jobs (7.4 per cent.)</p>
	<p pid="d.1629W.2/10" class="indent"><i> (g)</i> 3,342 jobs (14.0 per cent.)</p>
	<p pid="d.1629W.2/11">The numbers are from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE). They are indicative as they exclude some employees (such as those whose pay has been affected by loss of earnings or those who are not on adult rates) in order to give a better measure of earnings. Therefore, the proportions are more meaningful than the absolute numbers.</p>

	<p pid="d.1644W.3/1">The Bail Accommodation and Support Service provided by ClearSprings is for defendants on bail and offenders on Home Detention Curfew. The following are excluded from the scheme: (i) those convicted of or charged with sex offences, (ii) those convicted of arson in the last 10 years or charged with arson, (iii) those who are considered to pose a significant risk to the public or to ClearSprings staff or to others in a shared house and (iv) those sentenced prisoners who are excluded from HDC. The main exclusions from HDC are:</p>
	<p pid="d.1644W.3/2" class="indent">sex offenders subject to the notification requirements of the Sex Offenders Act 1997/Sexual Offences Act 2003;</p>
	<p pid="d.1644W.3/3" class="indent">violent and sex offenders currently serving an extended sentence;</p>
	<p pid="d.1644W.3/4" class="indent">prisoners currently serving a sentence for failing to return after a Release on Temporary Licence;</p>

	<p pid="d.1644W.3/6" class="indent">most prisoners who have been recalled to prison for failing to comply with the HDC curfew conditions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1644W.3/7" class="indent">fine defaulters and contemnors; and</p>
	<p pid="d.1644W.3/8" class="indent">foreign national prisoners who are liable to removal.</p>
	<p pid="d.1644W.3/9">In addition, prisoners with any history of sexual offending (who are not required to register as a sex offender) or serving sentences for the following categories of offences are considered unsuitable for release on HDC and can apply for HDC only if there are exceptional circumstances:</p>
	<p pid="d.1644W.3/10" class="indent">homicide, including attempted murder, threats to kill, conspiring, aiding or inciting murder and death by reckless/dangerous driving;</p>
	<p pid="d.1644W.3/11" class="indent">causing explosions, placing explosives, possessing explosives;</p>

	<p pid="d.1644W.3/15" class="indent">racially aggravated offences.</p>
	<p pid="d.1644W.3/16">Defendants and offenders who are not excluded, who otherwise have no suitable address and who apply for bail or home detention curfew will be considered for the scheme. But a defendant will be released into the service only if granted bail by the court. The court can refuse bail if it considers that there is a risk that the defendant will abscond, offend or interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice. An offender will be released into the service on Home Detention Curfew only on the decision of a prison governor following consultation with probation and a thorough assessment of risk and of the suitability of the proposed location.</p>
	<p pid="d.1644W.3/17">Information on how many offences have been committed by defendants and offenders while accommodated by ClearSprings cannot be obtained except at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.1644W.3/18">Information on the categories of offences committed by offenders prior to their transfer to bail and Home Detention Curfew cannot be obtained except at disproportionate cost. However the service is available only to those who are granted bail or who are released on Home Detention Curfew, and to those who have not committed offences or been charged with offences that would exclude them, as mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="d.1644W.3/19">I will provide information on how many defendants or offenders released into ClearSprings service who have been returned to custody as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="d.1644W.3/20">ClearSprings staff personally call on the immediate neighbours of a BASS property to provide information on the BASS scheme and a 24/7 contact telephone number. Where it is not possible to make face-to-face contact an introductory letter is left providing ClearSprings' contact details.</p>
	<p pid="d.1644W.3/21">ClearSprings consult with local authorities, and with police and probation, when acquiring properties so that local knowledge can inform the selection of addresses and avoid inappropriate locations. The scheme endeavours to return people to their own communities unless there is reason not to.</p>

	<p pid="d.1646W.8/1">Probation Boards meet the cost of delivering community sentences through their grant as they see fit to meet their statutory duties. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 established the new community order as a single community sentence with a number of elements in respect of offences committed after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase>. This replaced the separate community sentences which existed previously. 2005-06 was a transitional year with pre-CJA 2003 and post CJA 2003 sentences. From 2005 to present, cost exercises have been carried out by Probation Boards annually and have produced the planned cost of a range of activities. These together represent the best available data on the planned cost of administering and delivering the Community Order and include Probation Board overhead costs. The planned costs are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.1646W.8/2" class="indent">2005-06&mdash;&pound;418 million&mdash;cost per offender commencement &pound;2,400</p>
	<p pid="d.1646W.8/3" class="indent">2006-07&mdash;&pound;519 million&mdash;cost per offender under supervision &pound;1,831</p>
	<p pid="d.1646W.8/4" class="indent">2007-08&mdash;&pound;496 million&mdash;cost per offender under supervision &pound;1,677</p>
	<p pid="d.1646W.8/5">The costing methodology changed between the 2005-06 and subsequent exercises which means that they are not directly comparable. The 2005-06 exercise provides a cost per offender commencement; subsequent exercises provide a cost per offender under supervision.</p>

	<p pid="d.1648W.9/1">The Ministry of Justice is working closely with other Departments to decide the best ways in which to publicise the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007 to victims and potential victims of forced marriage when it comes into force in autumn 2008. We will build on the ongoing outreach programme of the joint Home Office/Foreign and Commonwealth Office Forced Marriage Unit. The Forced Marriage Unit in collaboration with Karma Nirvana (an NGO based in Derby) are piloting a survivor's helpline this year, and helpline staff will receive guidance in the provisions of the Act. We are considering how best to engage public authorities and voluntary sector organisations before the Act is implemented, to raise their awareness and ensure they meet their statutory obligations and provide co-ordinated support for victims.</p>

	<p pid="d.1649W.11/1">Whether to grant bail, or not, is and must remain a decision for the courts to make within the statutory framework provided by Parliament in the Bail Act 1976 as amended, taking account of relevant case-law. It is the responsibility of the Government to keep the statutory framework under careful review, bringing proposals for change to Parliament as necessary.</p>
	<p pid="d.1649W.11/2">The 1976 Act as amended provides for a general presumption that bail will be granted in all cases, including murder, except in specific circumstances which have to be supported by evidence. The court can impose conditions to prevent absconding, committing further crime while on bail, interfering with witnesses or for the purpose of medical or other reports: s3(6A) deals with the need for such a report when bail is granted in murder cases. In addition, it may require a defendant to provide security. The exception to this, under section 25 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, is that bail can only be granted in exceptional circumstances in cases of homicide (or rape) where there has been a previous conviction for such an offence.</p>

	<p pid="d.1653W.5/2">However, the probation specific projects now established within the new NOMIS Programme, and those which will provide arrangements to allow the sharing of information between public prisons and probation areas, and replace at risk probation case management systems, will continue to derive benefit from the investment and work on NOMIS to date. In addition, work completed by the programme on dependent projects, such as improving the OMNI infrastructure, will also provide further benefit.</p>
	<p pid="d.1653W.5/3">C-NOMIS has been, and continues to be, funded centrally through the National Offender Management Service and nearly all of the expenditure attributable to it is relevant to its future use in HMPS as 'Prison NOMIS'. No separate funding has been provided. About &pound;1 million of computer hardware was acquired for use by probation in association with C-NOMIS. This is being reallocated to other projects which have similar hardware needs.</p>

	<p pid="d.1658W.2/1">The offending behaviour programmes that have been introduced into prisons and probation are based on the best available international evidence. This has included a thorough review of UK and international programmes and their evaluations to identify the types of programmes that appear to be the most effective in reducing re-offending and tackling key aspects of offenders' thinking and behaviour. Home Office Research Study 291 published in February 2005, 'The impact of corrections on re-offending: a review of what works' summarises some of the key findings. In order to ensure rigour in the design of programmes each one has had to demonstrate a sound theoretical, empirical and evidence base as part of the process of accreditation by a panel of independent experts. There is considerable evidence to support the effectiveness of offending behaviour programmes in reducing re-offending.</p>

	<p pid="d.1659W.2/1">Yes. One of the intended aims of offending behaviour programmes is to reduce re-offending. It aims to do this by contributing to the overall strategy to reduce recidivism by addressing attitudinal and behavioural factors known to be related to re-offending. There is considerable evidence to support the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural programmes in reducing re-offending.</p>

	<p pid="d.1659W.5/1">In relation to the probation service, data is only available on the budgeted cost of delivering programmes to offenders under their supervision in the community.

	<p pid="d.1666W.5/1">I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December 2007</phrase> a programme for building 10,500 prison places to be delivered by 2014. This was in response to Lord Carter's Review on Prisons Securing the Future. The programme includes building up to three large 'Titan' prisons, housing around 2,500 prisoners each and closing old and inefficient prisons. The cost of construction (including development and design but not land) of the Titan prisons has been estimated to be around &pound;350 million each at 2007-08 prices.</p>
	<p pid="d.1666W.5/2">The indicative funding profile for this programme for the CSR period 2008-09 to 2010-11 is shown in the following table. The table also includes provision for the purchase of land for Titans and for the possible conversion of a second military camp that has been provisionally allocated to the post 2011 SR period and will be subject to the usual SR process.</p>

	<p pid="d.1666W.5/16">Around &pound;700 million is estimated for the building and conversion of new places at existing prison sites. This is included in the aforementioned table. Funding does not include the construction and operating costs of the Titan prisons which are planned to open after 2011. This will also be subject to the usual SR process.</p>
	<p pid="d.1666W.5/17">Sites have been identified for quick build units within the prison estate and are subject to the usual planning process. However, planning for the individual projects (which includes Titans), including the delivery timeframe and capital and resource requirements in each year, is being developed. Work is progressing to assess the various procurement options and associated costs to deliver Titan prisons.</p>
	<p pid="d.1666W.5/18">The Carter Report (pages 19-20) gave estimates of a range of capital unit cost per place for the various security categories of prisoner accommodation. Currently the estimated capital cost of the programme announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-05">5 December</phrase> is &pound;2.3 billion including the current CSR period and beyond.</p>

Experience from other jurisdictions suggests that such an approach can mean the drivers behind the prison population can be addressed and managed in a transparent, consistent and predictable manner.

	<p pid="d.1683W.12/1">The Cancer Reform Strategy sets out a series of actions to improve the care and experience of all cancer patients, including those with secondary breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid="d.1683W.12/2">Whether patients are living with or beyond cancer, high quality information and support will be available, tailored to the patient's personal needs. Action will be taken to inform and empower patients so that they can play as active a role in decisions about their treatment as they wish. Priority will be given to ensuring there is adequate provision of clinical nurse specialists, and effective systems will be in place so that care is seamless from a patient's perspective. There should be adequate provision of psychological support for patients, their families and carers, and a new national cancer survivorship initiative will be established to improve the ongoing support available to people who have been treated for a cancer. This initiative will include patients who are living with progressive disease and may be receiving treatment but are not in the terminal phase of illness.</p>
	<p pid="d.1683W.12/3">In addition, to improve the care and experience of all cancer patients, we need to collect good quality information on cancer services and outcomes, which can be analysed and published in such a way that is useful to patients, commissioners, service providers and other interested parties. To co-ordinate this, a national cancer intelligence network (NCIN) will be developed, building, maintaining and quality assuring a new national repository of cancer data. One of the early products expected from the NCIN will be an evaluation of services for secondary cancer patients in specific tumour areas, including breast cancer.</p>

	<p pid="d.1685W.0/1">As announced by the Prime Minister in his speech about the national health service on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-07">7 January</phrase>, the Department will in the next few months bring forward proposals for a screening programme in the NHS to assess people for risk of vascular disease, including heart disease, stroke, kidney disease and diabetes. This is a complex area, which requires a critical and systematic review of the evidence for a vascular risk assessment. The impetus for this work came in part from the National Screening Committee's (NSC) recommendations, as well as from the chief medical officer's department in the Department of Health. When the current phase of analysis and modelling yields its results, we intend to use it as part of our consultation with stakeholders on the development of these proposals. The work of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence on lipid modification is of considerable relevance to our plans for a wider programme of vascular risk assessment and we expect the two to be wholly complementary.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Fisheries (David Miliband) announced revised sustainable operations targets for the Government estate. They focus on key areas such as carbon neutrality and emissions, energy efficiency, waste and water consumption.</p>
	<p pid="d.1689W.6/2">The 2006 estate targets include:</p>
	<p pid="d.1689W.6/3" class="indentitalic"> Recycling:</p>
	<p pid="d.1689W.6/4" class="indent">Departments to increase their recycling figures to 40 per cent. of their waste arisings by 2010 and to 75 per cent. of their waste by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="d.1689W.6/5">These targets will apply for the reporting period April 2006 to March 2007 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="d.1689W.6/6">Previous Government targets that applied to the Government estate were launched in March 2004 but have since been superseded by the new targets.</p>
	<p pid="d.1689W.6/7">The Department has consistently exceeded the targets. Our performance over the past five years is as follows:</p>

	<p pid="d.1690W.8/2">It is for local health communities to work together to decide the best setting to deliver diagnostic services for their patients. However, direct access to diagnostics from primary care can help with delivery of the 18 weeks target by improving the quality of referrals to secondary care by reducing the number of unnecessary referrals to secondary care outpatient clinics, and removing unnecessary steps from the patient pathway. A number of initiatives are underway to support direct access diagnostics.</p>
	<p pid="d.1690W.8/3">The payment by results for 2008-09 contains a number of indicative tariffs to support unbundling of services, for example for imaging scans. Unbundling diagnostics provides incentives for primary care trusts to commission diagnostics via direct access prior to referral.</p>
	<p pid="d.1690W.8/4">The 18 weeks team have been working with clinical colleagues to develop commissioning pathways to support commissioners in challenging existing practice and transform services. The pathways, developed in conjunction with clinical colleagues, are based on best practice and include direct access diagnostics where this is appropriate.</p>

However, a range of assumptions about likely take-up levels of a vascular risk assessment programme will be modelled into the analytical work being undertaken by the Department. Assumptions about likely take-up will also form part of the discussions we will have with stakeholders about the development of the practical aspects of the programme.</p>

	<p pid="d.1708W.18/1">It is our expectation that all academies will now be designed to incorporate sprinklers. However, this is not a compulsory measure; but to demonstrate that sprinklers are not needed, the academy trust will need to be able to demonstrate that their buildings are low risk and that incorporation of sprinklers would not represent good value for money. For academies in the Building Schools for the Future programme the decision to install sprinklers will be shared between the academy trust and the relevant local authority.</p>

We expect this advice to promote the proven benefits of further education and training. However, it is important that information, advice and guidance is impartial: that it reflects the needs of the learner, not of the institution providing the advice.</p>
	<p pid="d.1720W.5/3">It is not the Department's policy to promote one learning route over another. Our interest is ensuring that each learner is helped into education and training that is best for that individual and which is most likely to sustain their participation in learning and lead to the highest level of attainment. For many learners A-levels are the most appropriate way forward: for others, different routes will be appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="d.1721W.3/1">As part of the 2007 comprehensive spending review (CSR), a new set of public service agreements and national targets was announced in October 2007. From 2009 onwards there is a dual focus on ensuring that pupils reach the levels expected for their age in both English and mathematics (threshold targets) and improving the rates of progress made by pupils from 5 to 16 (new progression targets) with increased attention to achieving faster progress for underachieving groups such as children in care and minority ethnic pupils.</p>
	<p pid="d.1721W.3/2">The key stage 4 threshold target is for 53 per cent. of pupils to achieve 5A*-C GCSEs (and equivalent), including GCSEs in both English and maths by 2011.</p>
	<p pid="d.1721W.3/3">The progression targets will be a major factor in helping all pupils&mdash;regardless of their background and circumstances&mdash;to realise their potential in English and mathematics in particular. By 2011 we want to see a 15 percentage point improvement in the number of pupils making two levels of progress in English and a 13 percentage point improvement in those making two levels of progress in mathematics between key stage 3 and key stage 4.</p>
	<p pid="d.1721W.3/4">We have also made the commitment that, by 2012, no secondary school should have fewer than 30 per cent. of pupils achieving five GCSEs at grade A*-C including English and mathematics. This children's plan, launched last month, also sets out the ambition that, by 2020, at least 90 per cent. of young people should achieve the equivalent of five higher GCSEs at age 19.</p>

	<p pid="d.1726W.11/1">Without compulsion, there is a risk that young people with lower aspirations, who may come from families and communities which have a poor experience of education and training, are missed as participation increases&mdash;and this group will become more marginalised. That is why we believe that to galvanise the system to provide better for this group we must go further, and a different approach is needed. The experience of other countries suggests that if this policy is to have the impact we want we need to be clear that it can be enforced if necessary. For example, Western Australia raised the participation age from 15 to 16 and have seen their participation rate at 16 rise from 80 per cent. to 98 per cent. The Netherlands has recently changed the law too and we will look to learn from their experience. Under plans to raise the participation age, sanctions will only be used as a last resort and the focus will be on ensuring there is the right provision and the right support for young people to participate in education and training post-16.</p>

	<p pid="d.1727W.8/3" class="indent">We are working closely with the devolved Administrations on the MOD's new cross border forum discussing provision for service children across the whole UK, particularly provision for those with statements of special educational needs (SEN) who move between countries within the UK;</p>

	<p pid="d.1727W.8/5" class="indent">We are working with a group of heads of schools which have high mobility due to large numbers of service children, to develop best practice guidance to help schools deal with the difficulties mobility causes, and to ease the impact that frequent moves can have on the children;</p>
	<p pid="d.1727W.8/6" class="indent">The School Admissions Code requires admission authorities to take account of service families' needs and allows them to allocate places in advance where families are moving to their area, using the unit HQ address if necessary where families have yet to be given an address. These provisions have been welcomed by the MOD.</p>
	<p pid="d.1727W.8/7">One recommendation about children with statements of SEN was not accepted. For those children with statements who move frequently, there are regulations governing the transfer of information between local authorities, and the timing of reviews of the statements and any necessary reassessments of the children's SEN. Previously statemented children who return from abroad may have been away for a considerable period and their needs may have changed. It is right that their needs are reassessed on return.</p>

	<p pid="d.1728W.5/1">Data on school temporary buildings were supplied to my Department by local education authorities in 2001; 2003 and 2005. However, checks on recent months indicate that the completeness and quality of the data was not good enough to accurately assess the number of buildings.</p>
	<p pid="d.1728W.5/2">Central Government capital support for investment in schools has increased from under &pound;700 million in 1996-97 to &pound;6.4 billion in 2007-08 and will rise further to &pound;8.0 billion by 2010-11. Progress is being made year-by-year in improving the quality of the school building stock. The bulk of schools capital is now allocated by formula to authorities and schools so that they can address their local priorities, including the replacement of decayed temporary accommodation, on which we have set a high priority. Given the high levels of funding, authorities have the opportunity to replace temporary buildings where they are considered to be unsuitable.</p>
	<p pid="d.1728W.5/3">Modern, high quality mobile or demountable buildings provide a good environment for teaching and learning where there is short-term need. Where they are new, they are required to meet the same building environmental standards as buildings that are not demountable. They might, for instance, be needed to cope with a short-term increase in pupil numbers, or where extensive remodelling or rebuilding of permanent accommodation means providing temporary accommodation on the school site, rather than transporting children elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="d.1732W.14/3">Central Government capital support for investment in schools has increased from under &pound;700 million in 1996-97 to &pound;6.4 billion in 2007-08 and will rise further to &pound;8.0 billion by 2010-11. While reducing maintenance requirements is a long-term aim, the primary objectives for funding are to raise educational standards and tackle local deprivation. A substantial proportion of capital funding is targeted at transformational programmes, such as Building Schools for the Future and the Primary Capital Programmes. Over time, these programmes will significantly reduce future maintenance requirements.</p>

	<p pid="d.1733W.5/1">The allocation formula for Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) does not separately allocate money to support small rural schools; it starts from local authorities' spending on schools for 2005-06, which is closely related to the formula for schools formula spending shares in use that year. That formula took account of the needs of sparsely populated authorities to keep open small rural primary schools, using an indicator of sparsity. The following table sets out estimated amounts within 2007-08 allocations of DSG, derived from the amounts allocated through the schools FSS formula in 2005-06 on the basis of sparsity, updated appropriately.</p>

	<p pid="d.1737W.2/1">The Government are supporting a number of curricular and extra curricular programmes that aim to encourage the study of science at key stages 3 and 4 and beyond. These include:</p>
	<p pid="d.1737W.2/2" class="indent">The introduction of a new science programme of study at key stage 3 for first teaching from September 2008. As with the new science programme of study at key stage 4 that was introduced in 2006 it will maintain the breadth, depth and challenge of the previous curriculum, but will have a better balance between knowledge and understanding.</p>
	<p pid="d.1737W.2/3" class="indent">The secondary national strategy which provides a comprehensive professional development programme for teachers which includes training and materials and support from local consultants who are experts in their field. The strategy sets high expectations and is designed to raise standards for all pupils in all circumstances, but also focuses on pupils who need extra support and who are falling behind.</p>
	<p pid="d.1737W.2/4" class="indent">The national network of science learning centres to provide professional development for science teachers and technicians. The training focuses on encouraging innovative and exciting teaching practice that will enthuse and inspire young people and improve the subject specialism of science teachers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1737W.2/5" class="indent">Piloting 250 after school science and engineering clubs offering an engaging and stretching programme of activities to key stage 3 pupils with interest and potential in science. A further 250 clubs will be established from September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.1737W.2/6" class="indent">Establishing a system for coordinating the many enhancement and enrichment activities that are available to make it easier for schools to access them. This will include the publication of directories of nationally available activities.</p>
	<p pid="d.1737W.2/7" class="indent">Project Faraday, which is developing inspirational exemplar designs for school laboratories which will reflect the latest thinking on what is required to ensure effective science teaching. A book showing the exemplar designs will be published in early 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.1737W.2/8" class="indent">The new triple science support programme, delivered by the Learning and Skills Network, which provides practical advice and support to schools to offer separate GCSEs in biology, physics and chemistry.</p>
	<p pid="d.1737W.2/9">Information on how much has been spent on science, technology, engineering and mathematics at key stage 3 since 1997 can be provided only at disproportionate cost or cannot be disaggregated from wider budgets.</p>
	<p pid="d.1737W.2/10">From September 2008 the Government want to make GCSEs in the individual sciences of physics, chemistry and biology (triple science) more accessible to pupils who would benefit. To achieve this we are introducing a non statutory entitlement to triple science for all pupils who achieve level 6 in science at key stage 3. All specialist science colleges will be expected to deliver triple science from 2008. The Government have also put in place the triple science support programme to support schools as mentioned above. This will include the delivery of 600 days of training to schools by the end of March 2008. The programme has also established 40 local triple science networks to support schools starting to offer triple science.</p>

	<p pid="d.1743W.2/2">This range of programmes and the variety and flexibility of approaches used in schools already, means that we cannot give a simple cost for small group teaching in either primary or secondary schools. However, &pound;1.6 billion has been committed to support personalised learning over the CSR period 2008-11, building on the &pound;990 million allocated over the last two years This funding is designed to ensure that every school has the capacity to deliver personalised learning, including the use of smaller groups where appropriate.</p>

Friend, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Jim Fitzpatrick), stated in his answer on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-17">17 December 2007</phrase>, the aviation security measures in place in the UK apply equally to all airports within the National Aviation Security programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.1755W.9/3">Separately, the police require airlines to present passengers in a manner that would prevent any attempt to evade police scrutiny. To meet this requirement a number of airports across the United Kingdom have deployed digital imaging to ensure that the passenger who actually boards the aircraft is the same passenger that checked in.

Any such incidents are usually reported to the police, local authority, landlord or other frontline agency public whose task it is to deal directly with that problem. However, in common with many other Government Departments, for example Communities and Local Government or the Ministry of Justice, we do receive representations from members of the public, direct or through their Member of Parliament, about our policies in the field of antisocial behaviour. We received over 2,000 such letters and e-mails in the three years from 2005 to 2007.</p>

	<p pid="d.1762W.2/1">It is an offence under section 12(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 for a person to promote or take part in a race between motor vehicles on a highway. The offence carries a maximum fine at level 4 (&pound;2,500), obligatory disqualification and obligatory endorsement of between three and 11 penalty points on the offender's licence. The police also have a power under section 59 of the Police Reform Act 2002 to seize a vehicle that is being driven carelessly or inconsiderately on road contrary to section 3 of the 1988 Act and in such a way as to cause or be likely to cause alarm distress or annoyance. Enforcement of the law and exercise of the seizure power are operational matters for the police.</p>

	<p pid="d.1764W.0/1">In 2005 1,970 requests were received in the Home Office, of which 1,469 were resolvable. The non-resolvable cases were those where no information was held or where advice and assistance was provided. Of the 1,469 resolvable requests, 42 per cent. of the requests were granted in full and 35 per cent. were withheld in full. The remainder of requests resulted in a partial disclosure or the requests were not replied to in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="d.1764W.0/2">In 2006 2,861 requests were received of which 1,790 were resolvable. Of the resolvable requests, 42 per cent. were granted in full and 33 per cent were withheld in full. The remainder resulted in a partial disclosure or the requests were not replied to in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="d.1764W.0/3">Between <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-30">30 September 2007</phrase>, 1,849 requests were received, of which 1,270 were resolvable. Of the resolvable requests, 50 per cent. were granted in full and 24 per cent. were withheld in full. The remainder resulted in a partial disclosure or the requests were still being processed after <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-30">30 September</phrase> last year. All percentages have been rounded to the nearest whole number.</p>
	<p pid="d.1764W.0/4">All Freedom of Information requests are logged on an Access database. An automatic case reference number is generated by the database when a new case is added.</p>
	<p pid="d.1764W.0/5">Unfortunately a summary of each request received by the Department could be provided only at disproportionate cost. FOI requests are often contained within letters detailing individual's personal circumstances. To put the details of the requests into the public domain would require personal information (which would allow identification of the individual to be ascertained) to be removed. This could be done only at disproportionate cost. The Home Office disclosure log provides a useful picture of the types of request received by the Department and the information which has been disclosed as a result. The disclosure log can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="d.1764W.0/7">It is also impossible to provide the specific reason why an exemption is applied without consulting each FOI response issued by the Department. Collating this information could be done only at disproportionate cost. It may however be useful for you to see the top ten exemptions used by the Department from September 2006 to August 2007.</p>

	<p pid="d.1775W.11/2">Section 14 of the Police and Justice Act 2006 introduced a new power that will allow the police to capture passenger, crew and service information on air and sea journeys within the United Kingdom. The intention is that the power will be brought into force by secondary legislation in 2008. The specific police requirements under this power, which will include details of the routes affected and data required, are still under discussion within Government. Once the proposals have been finalised they will be subject to a 12-week public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="d.1775W.11/3">It is expected that this police power will only apply to air and sea routes between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Passengers will not be required to use passports, but may be required to produce one of several types of documentation when travelling, to enable the carrier to meet the requirements of a police request.</p>

Section 59 enables the police to seize a vehicle they reasonably believe is being driven in a way that both contravenes s3 or 34 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (careless/inconsiderate driving or off-road driving without authority) and is causing or is likely to cause alarm, distress or annoyance. Section 165A enables the police to seize a vehicle they reasonably believe is being driven by someone who does not have an appropriate licence (including a disqualified driver) or appropriate insurance. In both cases the police can hold the vehicle until a person pays prescribed charges in respect of its removal and storage and, in respect of s165A, produces licence and insurance. They can dispose of the vehicle if it is not claimed and retain sufficient of the proceeds to cover the unpaid charges.</p>
