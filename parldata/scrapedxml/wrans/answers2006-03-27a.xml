	<p pid="a.621W.3/1">The World Bank's Africa Action Plan, which forms part of the World Bank's response to the commitments made at Gleneagles last June and was endorsed by bank governors at their annual meeting in Washington in September, proposed the establishment of a &quot;Catalytic Growth Fund&quot;. Its purpose is to help Africa make faster progress on meeting the MDGs, particularly the &quot;hardest-to-reach&quot; ones like health and access to water, and increasing the rate of economic growth. Its aim is to complement other sources of development financing, including those from the International Development Association (IDA), while, at the same time, being innovative and creative in supporting countries that have shown an ability to make good use of increased amounts of aid, as well as countries with reforming and post-conflict Governments that show a commitment to reducing poverty. Money will also be given to regional projects to deal with needs that cross borders.</p>
	<p pid="a.621W.3/2">We welcome the Bank's agreement that use of the Fund will be guided by the priorities of the Africa Partnership Forum and that the World Bank will ensure regular consultations with Fund donors, African Governments and regional institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.621W.3/3">The Fund will be financed by voluntary contributions from World Bank members. The UK is the first country to pledge support, our &pound;200 million contribution was announced in October 2005. The Bank is also seeking contributions from other donors. We expect the first projects to be approved in the coming months.</p>

	<p pid="a.623W.2/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is strongly committed to the targets set out in the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate. During the refurbishments of our UK offices we incorporated many energy saving mechanisms; for instance, a new building management system allow us to monitor and manage energy usage to a much greater extent than in the past. DFID has also installed energy efficient heating systems and lighting systems which are movement sensitive and take account of natural lighting levels. An environment management system has been implemented at both UK offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.623W.2/2">DFID is also currently installing timers to regulate energy usage and additional sub-meters to monitor our energy usage even more closely in the future. We have ensured that 100 per cent. electricity used in our main UK offices is from renewable sources and we are also currently investigating additional options such as combined heat and power plants, solar panels and a wind turbine at our East Kilbride office. The design for the refurbishment of our East Kilbride office has received an &quot;excellent&quot; and the London office a &quot;very good&quot; rating under the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM). We are also actively encouraging staff to use energy efficiently, for instance by switching off equipment when not in use rather than simply leaving on &quot;stand-by&quot;. DFID is also in the process of arranging under the Carbon Trust Framework Agreement, a carbon management programme including an energy audit of both UK offices.</p>

	<p pid="a.624W.2/1">This year, DFID will spend around &pound;250 million in India&mdash;the Department's largest country programme in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.2/2">DFID's India programme supports the achievement of the Government of India's (GoI) 10th Plan and Millennium Development Goal (MDG) poverty reduction targets, as outlined in our India Country Assistance Plan (CAP) for 2004&ndash;08 (available on DFID's website <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a>).</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.2/3">The programme is provided in close partnership with the Union Government and the State Governments of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal. In these states, and at the national level, DFID supports the Indian Government's measures to improve the quality and poverty impact of public policies and services and in creating the necessary conditions for economic growth. Our funds are directed at increasing access to basic education and health and to improving the lives of poor people in rural and urban areas. We also promote better management of the environment and support activities to empower the poor, especially women and those who are less able to represent themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.2/4">For example, in West Bengal, our Kolkata Urban Services for the Poor Programme aims to help slum dwellers directly, through funding improvements to slum infrastructure (for example; better drainage, road systems, latrines, solid waste management), and indirectly and in the longer term through supporting overall city management, building in a poverty focus to urban planning, strengthening urban management systems, and working to help municipal authorities become more accountable to citizens. A parallel programme operates in Andhra Pradesh and one is also planned for Madhya Pradesh.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.2/5">In Andhra Pradesh, our Rural Livelihoods Project supports the State Government in helping poor rural households to develop new livelihood options and landless farmers to earn income from the use of common lands through better use of water in drought-prone areas. The project aims to extend the reach of these schemes to target the poorest and most excluded groups including women, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.2/6">Alongside assistance to its four focus states, DFID is strengthening its National Programme to provide significant resources for central programmes in key areas, including health and education where progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) needs to accelerate. For example, DFID is currently supporting the Government of India's Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All) programme with a &pound;210 million commitment in close collaboration with other donors. This programme is aimed at ensuring that by 2010, all children in India receive eight years of basic education of acceptable quality regardless of sex, caste, creed, family income or location and has already resulted in a reduction in the number of out of school children from 25 million in 2003 to 13.5 million in March 2005. DFID is also financing over 20 per cent. (&pound;128 million) of the Government of India's National Polio Eradication Programme, which has succeeded in confining this disease to only a few isolated pockets in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.624W.2/7">Through the National and State programmes, DFID is also placing renewed emphasis on support to Indian civil society, to strengthen the capacity of poor people to participate in decisions affecting their lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.627W.8/1">The Governments of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Rwanda have concluded discussions on their development partnership and have signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to this effect. The new MoU, which was signed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-13">13 February</phrase> by representatives of the two Governments, supercedes the previous MoU originally signed in 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.8/2">The new 10-year arrangement re-affirms and extends the UK's development partnership with Rwanda. The partnership focuses on reducing poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in Rwanda, as well as the promotion of peace and stability in the Great Lakes region.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.8/3">Currently, we allocate bilateral development assistance worth &pound;46 million each year to Rwanda. Subject to Rwanda honouring its commitments under the MoU, the UK expects to maintain bilateral assistance at this level or higher over the next 10 years. Of this, we expect that at least two thirds will be provided as Poverty Reduction Budget Support.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.8/4">In recent years, the United Kingdom has provided substantial development assistance to Rwanda. There have been good results in the form of impressive development progress, with improvements in the quality of life of Rwanda's people, as well as increased peace and security. It is in the light of this good progress that we have agreed the new MoU as a basis for providing more predictable finance for Rwanda's development.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.8/5">The MoU sets out shared objectives as well as specific commitments made by each side and arrangements for monitoring and review. The MoU also specifies circumstances under which the UK's development assistance may be interrupted or reduced. The MoU will be underpinned by a set of specific, monitorable benchmarks, to be agreed with the Government of Rwanda. These will provide a clear basis for monitoring adherence to the MoU as well as tracking the progress of our development partnership with Rwanda, and will provide a basis for continuing dialogue and discussion with the Government of Rwanda.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.8/6">I have arranged for copies of the document entitled 'Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Rwanda' to be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.634W.2/2">The department is taking a number of steps to tackle the systematic tendency for promoters to be overly optimistic in estimating capital costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.2/3">Firstly, to ensure that optimism bias is factored into decision making the department makes explicit adjustments to promoters cost estimates within economic appraisal. The adjustments are empirically based (e.g. using data on cost overruns for transport projects in the past).</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.2/4">Secondly, the department is taking a number of steps to try to reduce optimism bias in the future. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.2/5" class="indent">Issuing improved guidance on cost estimation and risk assessment (including requiring a Quantitative Risk Assessment to be undertaken for all larger major schemes).</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.2/6" class="indent">More closely scrutinising promoters' cost estimates to ensure they are realistic and based on the latest cost information.</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.2/7" class="indent">Involving private sector contractors earlier in scheme development to help to better estimate costs, improve scheme design and to ensure that schemes are planned in a way that uses existing capacity effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.634W.2/8" class="indent">Providing greater incentives for scheme promoters to produce realistic estimates of cost. This is achieved by only committing to fund risk adjusted cost estimates excluding optimism bias and not automatically funding cost overruns.</p>

	<p pid="a.634W.5/2">A range of appraisal information including assessments using the New Approach to Transport Appraisal system, is required alongside all schemes submitted to the department for funding. Traffic forecasts are used by scheme promoters as part of these appraisals. There is departmental guidance available to promoters, setting out the appropriate use of forecasting techniques, to ensure that traffic is realistically forecasted. The forecasts are checked by the promoters, such as the Highways Agency or other appropriate body, and by the department's modellers. The full appraisal is finally inspected by the department as part of the value for money assessment, to provide ministers with advice on the case for a particular scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.635W.2/2">The Department does not ordinarily compile information on the modelling technique used by external promoters in assessing future patronage; to compile a list of schemes on this basis would be prohibitively expensive. However, scheme promoters are expected to use appropriate techniques in the appraisals of a project, using the guidance published by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.635W.2/3">Since 1997, of some sixty Highways Agency road schemes that have been approved, around 90 per cent. were appraised using a fixed trip matrix method to assess future traffic levels; a similar proportion would be expected for local authority major road schemes. The 'elasticity' approach has been the alternative used in larger schemes. This technique models the growth in traffic induced by the completion of a transport improvement&mdash;something a fixed trip matrix would not do. The Department for Transport has recently published guidance for road scheme promoters to encourage greater use of improved 'variable demand' appraisal techniques. All rail schemes are assessed using an 'elasticity' approach. In the largest schemes, affecting a number of modes, full multi-modal studies are conducted which would better articulate modal change as well as induced traffic.</p>

	<p pid="a.638W.8/1">The Government assessed the costs of implementing a statutory Operating and Financial Review against those of implementing an enhanced Business Review in a Regulatory Impact Assessment, which was published alongside the DTI's formal response to consultation. It was estimated that a statutory Operating and Financial Review would cost business &pound;33 million per annum more than the Business Review. Most of these additional costs related to the different audit requirements applying to the OFR compared to the Business Review. As the Business Review and OFR reporting requirements are similar, work already undertaken on the preparation of the OFR will be useful in the preparation of the Business Review.</p>

	<p pid="a.639W.5/1">The recent volatility in gas and electricity prices is driven by the current tight supply/demand balance and the general uncertainty in the market over the winter months. The Government have been pursuing a number of avenues to reduce this tightness and improve the operation of the market. We have talked to the North sea gas producers, and the operators and capacity owners of the Bacton-Zeebrugge Interconnector and the Isle of Grain Liquefied Natural Gas import terminal, in order to maximise supplies over the winter. We have encouraged end users, particularly gas-fired power stations and other energy intensive industrial consumers, to respond to price signals by reducing demand and switching to alternative fuels where possible. We have sought to improve the operation of the market by making more information available on a timely basis through the voluntary agreement with the offshore industry, and by encouraging the Futures and Options Association to develop an action plan for improving the liquidity of the gas and electricity markets.</p>

The UK is giving the European Commission our full support to ensure that EU energy markets are also open and competitive. As the Chancellor noted in his budget speech, incomplete liberalisation of EU energy markets is a factor in high gas prices and at the Spring European Council the UK will propose that the energy and other sectors which fail to liberalise and open up to Competition should be subject to independent investigation and enforcement. This work has been ongoing in the energy sector for some time; the Commission launched a sector inquiry into EU gas and electricity markets in June 2005 and the UK gave this prominence during our Presidency of the EU in the second half of last year. The Commission recently reported the preliminary findings of this inquiry and identified a number of areas of concern. We expect the Commission to remedy the defects it has found.</p>

	<p pid="a.642W.6/1">We have received a range of representations concerning the programmes of advice and assistance for small businesses some of which reflect the wish of Ministers to make support for business much simpler and easier to obtain. The CBI's report &quot;Improving Government Services to Small and Growing Businesses&quot;, published in January 2006, demonstrated the CBI's support of the Government's objective to ensure services to businesses become more coherent. A report from the Federation of Small Businesses published this month, showed that only 4 per cent. of its members who responded to the survey used the help available from the Business Link network yet 96 per cent. of those who actually use the service would recommend it to a friend&mdash;so there is clearly a gap between perception and reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.6/2">During November 2005, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants informed the DTI of its concerns with the Government's wider business support agenda and Small Business Service officials recently met the Association to discuss these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.6/3">Ministers believe that the proliferation of business support schemes has created a complex picture that makes it difficult and time consuming for businesses to gain access to relevant support and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has set in train a process of deproliferation. We will work with the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) and other local and national bodies to reduce the number of business support services from around 3,000 now, to no more than 100 by 2010. The DTI's Small Business Service will spearhead this cross-Government programme and will engage with a wide range of key stakeholders, including the CBI and ACCA. An announcement of this programme was formally presented in the 2006 Budget report.</p>

	<p pid="a.643W.5/1">The Information Commissioner is responsible for administering the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. Regulation 21 of these Regulations relates to unsolicited direct marketing telephone calls. Where a complaint is made about a potential breach of Regulation 21, the alleged breach is considered to have been committed by the instigator of the marketing call rather than the telephone service provider who has provided the service by which the call was made. While the Commissioner's Office have received complaints about potential breaches of Regulation 21 which have allegedly been committed by organisations that would be classed as telephone service providers, the nature of the casework management system used makes it impossible to identify the number of telephone service providers about which the ICO has received more than 50 complaints. They are looking to develop this function in their casework management system in the future.</p>

Last Autumn, WRAP (the Waste and Resources Action Programme) conducted a 'Reusable Bag' campaign trial, which took place in Bristol and Edinburgh in association with supermarket retailers, Defra, the Scottish Executive, the British Retail Consortium and the Scottish Waste Awareness Group. Customers were asked to &quot;Choose to reuse&quot; any kind of durable shopping bag for their supermarket shop, and remember to bring it with them to store, in an effort to curb carrier bag take-up. WRAP are hoping to publish the results of the campaign by Easter.</p>

The Trust can provide support and practical advice on a range of measures (which includes no and low cost measures such as not leaving equipment on standby) to help them meet their commitments.</p>

Any birds already imported would be traceable if the required records have been kept.</p>

	<p pid="a.659W.5/1">UK nitrous oxide emissions are monitored via the UK's Greenhouse Gas Inventory, which is published annually. Between 1990 and 2004 (the most recent year for which figures are available) the inventory shows that nitrous oxide emissions fell by about 40 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.5/2">The main sources of nitrous oxide are agriculture and industrial processes including manufacture of adipic and nitric acids. Under the Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) system introduced by the Environmental Protection Act, DuPont (UK) Ltd., the operators of the only adipic acid plant in the UK, introduced an abatement unit that reduced nitrous oxide emissions from their plant by over 95 per cent. This is estimated to have reduced UK greenhouse gas emissions by 6.5 million tonnes of carbon equivalent, equal to about 3 per cent. of 1990 greenhouse gas emissions. The Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) system which is now superseding IPC will drive further reductions including at nitric acid plant.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.5/3">In the agriculture sector nitrous oxide emissions fell by 17 per cent. between 1990 and 2004, and are expected to continue to fall. A range of options to reduce emissions from the sector are being considered through the Climate Change Programme Review and development of the Adaptation Policy Framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.5/4">As part of a resource efficient approach to farm management, we are promoting actions to optimise fertiliser use, as well as measures to improve management of manure, nutrients and soil. Additionally, activities under a range of Defra initiative, such as Catchment Sensitive Farming, can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while addressing other environmental issues. Defra is seeking to maximize the benefits of these policies in delivery of climate change objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.660W.5/2">The Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) system was set up by the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 and encompasses (i) regulation by the Environment Agency of industrial installations subject to the requirements of the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive, and (ii) regulation by local authorities of some 23,000 generally smaller industrial installations in respect of their emissions to air. Local authorities are also responsible for the regulation of about 10 per cent. of the some 4,500 installations subject to IPPC.</p>
	<p pid="a.660W.5/3">These regulators recover their costs through charges made to each operator who holds a permit issued under the PPC system. The income from these charges is set out in the tables which cover the annual periods from 2000 in which year the PPC Regulations came into force. The increasing income to the Environment Agency arises because installations subject to IPPC requirements are being phased into the new system according to a timetable laid down in the PPC Regulations extending from late 2000 to early 2007. Many of those installations were already subject to integrated pollution control under the system introduced by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and which IPPC is superseding. The local authority income from charges does not vary so much from year to year because it includes income from the predecessor controls under Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>
	<p pid="a.660W.5/4">While these charges account for a large part of the administrative costs of the PPC system, operators may also incur costs directly in preparing applications for permits and, on a recurring basis, responding to routine monitoring and other information requirements of their permits. No estimates of these on an annual basis are available.</p>

Most of them are the result of a campaign by Friends of the Earth and raise the concern that increased incineration will prevent higher levels of recycling, but make no reference to health impacts. These issues are addressed in the current waste strategy review consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.664W.0/2">Incineration with energy recovery is principally a waste management solution for residual, post-recycling waste, which also provides a source of renewable energy. Energy recovered from residual municipal waste currently accounts for about 0.35 per cent. of electricity generation in the UK. At current rates of conversion efficiency, this could rise to about 1.5 per cent. by 2020 on the basis of anticipated increases in this waste management route.</p>

	<p pid="a.664W.3/1">The Waste Implementation Programme has two overarching targets. Firstly to work with stakeholders, particularly local authorities to insure that our national recycling and composting targets are met. The 2003&ndash;04 target of 17 per cent. was exceeded and we are confident that the 2005&ndash;06 target of 25 per cent. will be met, although figures are not yet available. WIP's second overarching target is to create the conditions in which the investment needed to meet our 2010, 2013 and 2020 landfill directive targets can take place. This remains a highly challenging objective but we are confident that good progress is being made toward achieving it.</p>

	<p pid="a.666W.3/1">The proliferation of nuclear weapons in the Middle East would be deeply damaging for stability and security in the region and beyond, and for the multilateral non-proliferation system.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.3/2">We have serious concerns about the nature of Iran's nuclear activities, its history of concealment and inadequate co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and its failure to take the steps requested by the IAEA Board. These have all contributed to the international community's lack of confidence that the aims of the Iranian nuclear programme are, as Iran claims, exclusively peaceful.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.3/3">These concerns must also be seen in the context of Iran's ballistic missile programme, its attitude to Israel and the Middle East Peace Process, its links to Lebanese Hizballah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other groups undermining peace through violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.666W.3/4">It is therefore essential that Iran should meet in full the requests set out in the <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-04">4 February</phrase> IAEA Board Resolution, including reinstating a full suspension of all enrichment related and reprocessing activities. We will intensify our efforts, with our partners, to that end.</p>

	<p pid="a.669W.2/1">Land Systems OMC, is a South African based company in which BAE Systems has a 75 per cent. shareholding. We are aware of reports that Land Systems OMC has sold armoured vehicles to the Ugandan Government. Uganda is not an embargoed destination and the UK did not approve export licences for these vehicles. Overseas subsidiaries are subject to the export controls of the country in which they operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.669W.2/2">Armoured vehicles were used on several occasions to police the recent elections, but we have not been able to substantiate the allegations that they were used to violate human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.669W.2/3">Armoured vehicles are also used by the Ugandan armed forces to escort convoys in the north of the country where there is a long-running and very violent incursion by the Lord's Resistance army. Food convoys are essential to sustain the 1.7 million people living in internally displaced people's camps in the region.</p>

	<p pid="a.675W.10/1">There is currently no administrative backlog of appeals at the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT). Between April 2005 and October 2005, an administrative backlog of entry clearance and family visitor appeals built up with the AIT, totalling approximately 39,000 cases. Those cases experienced a delay in initial processing (acknowledgment and issue of papers to the respondent requesting the appeal bundle) of up to 16 weeks. The administrative backlog was cleared by the end of December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.675W.10/2">The once backlogged appeals now form part of the Tribunal's current work in progress&mdash;as at February 2006 around 82,000 immigration judge appeals and 6,000 other cases for review or reconsideration. As a result of work load volumes, and the clearance of backlogged cases, the AIT is currently listing entry clearance and family visit appeals at 16 weeks from receipt of the appeal bundle. This represents a departure of between eight and 12 weeks from steady-state time scales.</p>

	<p pid="a.681W.3/2">Phase 1 the Criminal Justice Viewer, was implemented on time and within budget in March 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.681W.3/3">Phase 2 Electronic Case Preparation&mdash;which enables the electronic transfer of information between the police, prosecution and forensic services&mdash;went live on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-13">13 June 2005</phrase>. To date some 40,000 PSNI investigation cases have been placed on the Causeway system with approximately 13,000 of these being shared with the Public Prosecution Service (PPS). There have been over 11,000 shares of forensic test requests and reports between forensic scientists, the police and prosecution lawyers. Over the course of the year Causeway is expected to have removed from circulation some 6 million pieces of paper.</p>

Recently the Compensation Agency, Youth Justice Agency and the Police Ombudsman's Office have been provided with access to on-line criminal records. The programme is also examining the feasibility of linking into the Police National Computer. In addition to winning a national award for promoting joined up government, Causeway was recently cited by HM Treasury as an example of best practice in risk management.</p>

	<p pid="a.693W.0/1">Invest NI continues to implement a strategy that promotes all areas of Northern Ireland as attractive and viable locations for new inward investment opportunities in what is a very competitive global marketplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.693W.0/2">To achieve this, Invest NI's marketing and sales resources are focused on those sectors and geographical markets most likely to generate projects to match the Northern Ireland business proposition and contribute to the development of an innovation-based economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.693W.0/3">In recent years the shift from manufacturing to predominantly tradeable service-based sectors has seen a significant change in where projects are located within Northern Ireland. Investors from these sectors place an increasing emphasis on locations with large labour pools, excellent infrastructure and close proximity to universities or centres of excellence. Consequently, Belfast and Londonderry are often the main focus of potential investors' interest.</p>

	<p pid="a.694W.2/1">Migrant workers in Northern Ireland are entitled to the same employment rights and working conditions as other workers, including benefiting from the laws relating to the conduct of employment agencies. Employment agencies and employment businesses in Northern Ireland are regulated by Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 and the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005 ('Conduct Regulations'). The Conduct Regulations, which came into operation on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-25">25 September 2005</phrase>, were subject to two full public consultations. They establish a framework of minimum standards that the work-seekers and employers who use employment agencies can expect, including establishing the suitability of work-seekers for vacancies, agreeing terms and conditions, placing controls on client accounts and record-keeping, and clarifying arrangements for charges and fees. Under the 1981 Order, the Department for Employment and Learning has responsibility for enforcing the legislation, including powers to prosecute offenders and in more serious cases, seeking a prohibition notice from an industrial tribunal to prevent an individual from operating an agency for up to ten years.</p>
	<p pid="a.694W.2/2">Under powers granted in the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 the Department may also enter and inspect employment agency premises and records to ensure compliance with the Conduct Regulations. A schedule of inspections, undertaken by the Trading Standards Service on behalf of the Department, will commence from April 2006. The inspections will be scheduled based on the perceived risks of vulnerable groups, including migrant workers and as such a high priority will be attached to their interests. The Department will investigate all complaints brought to its attention in respect of employment agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.694W.2/3">In addition the Department has produced and distributed guidance material aimed at those affected by legislation governing the recruitment sector, including material to assist migrant workers in Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Tetum and Lithuanian.</p>

	<p pid="a.709W.3/1">VAT is not chargeable on the construction of academies, or parts of academy buildings, provided that use of the building for which a charge is made will account for less than 10 per cent. of its total use under this relief, taking the year as a whole (including non-term time) a 1,000 student institution could potentially provide charged extended services for an average of around 50 people per day.</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.3/2">VAT agreements with our European partners mean that while we can maintain this relief for the construction of charitable buildings, it cannot be extended further. DfES and HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will explore with academies how community use of their facilities might be maximised, consistent with this VAT relief.</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.3/3">If VAT is chargeable on construction of any part of an academy building, this can be reclaimed from HMRC to the extent that the building is to be used for a taxable business purpose. DfES and HMRC will also explore with academies how any remaining VAT costs might be managed within the current rules&mdash;for example by allowing academies to spread VAT costs relating to non-business use of their facilities over a 20-year period.</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.3/4">In relation to other youth and education facilities, the VAT relief detailed applies for buildings constructed for charities. Where VAT is chargeable on construction, this can be reclaimed from HMRC to the extent that it relates to taxable business use of the facilities. In addition, local authorities can usually reclaim from HMRC all VAT costs relating to schools and other youth and community facilities that they maintain.</p>
	<p pid="a.709W.3/5">Where VAT is chargeable and not reclaimable from HMRC, it is legitimate for bids for grants or public funding to include relevant overhead costs, such as this irrecoverable VAT.</p>
