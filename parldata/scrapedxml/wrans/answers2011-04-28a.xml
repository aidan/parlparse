	<p pid="a.522W.2/1">The Council of the European Union appointed the Commission to negotiate accession on behalf of the EU in June 2010, on the basis of an agreed negotiating mandate. The Commission has since met regularly with a group of experts elected by the member states of the Council of Europe, including one from the United Kingdom, to prepare the accession agreement, including any necessary adaptations to the Convention system. An early draft of the agreement was recently prepared by the Council of Europe Secretariat based on these negotiations, which will now form the basis of further discussions and drafting refinement.</p>
	<p pid="a.522W.2/2">The negotiating group has a mandate to consider this issue until the end of the year. Article 218 (8) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union states that the European Council's decision concluding this agreement shall enter into force after it has been approved by the member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. The agreement will also need to be ratified by the members of the Council of Europe. The EU cannot accede to the Convention until all of these steps have been completed so it is not currently possible to provide an accurate estimate of the earliest date for accession.</p>

Food, water and sanitation, urgent medical care, the protection of civilians and shelter for some 800,000 displaced and those communities affected by the conflict are needed. Over 150,000 people have now crossed the border to seek refuge in neighbouring Liberia.

Further, they will be able to interpret any information more readily using their better knowledge of the local economic environment.</p>

These survey results will be shared with local partners, such as Local Enterprise Partnerships and local authorities, as well as being made publicly available.

However, The Service is a demand-led organisation, and should case numbers rise or fall outside of current forecasts then the staffing requirement could be significantly different from that shown here. For this reason, and because The Service does not have funding allocations for future years, we are unable to provide firm figures for 2012-15.</p>

Our embassy is in regular contact with local and international organisations working to highlight the social and environmental consequences of the dam's construction. We understand that construction of the dam, and extensive logging in the area, may mean that 15,000 Kachin villagers are relocated against their will to areas that will not support their livelihoods.

	<p pid="a.540W.2/1">The table gives estimates of the weekly gross state pension entitlements of hypothetical individuals with different lifetime earnings profiles and numbers of qualifying years for the basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/2">The hypothetical individuals presented are assumed to be male, and to begin employment aged 25. They are assumed to work continuously for 30 or 40 years, and then remain inactive until they reach state pension age. Each individual's annual gross earnings are assumed to be flat across their working life, when expressed in 2011-12 earnings terms. So an individual with average earnings of &#163;10,000 is assumed to earn &#163;10,000 in each year of employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/3">These hypothetical individuals are purely illustrative; they are not representative of the general population. In reality, people will have more complex and varied histories of national insurance contributions and credits, resulting in more varied state pension outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/4">Gross state pension entitlement refers to an individual's full weekly entitlement deriving from national insurance contributions, before any deductions have been made due to periods spent in contracted-out employment. Individuals who have been in contracted-out employment will receive some of their entitlement from their private pension schemes when they retire, instead of from the Government. Therefore, the state pension they receive from the Government will be lower than illustrated in this table.</p>
	<p pid="a.540W.2/5">The Government are currently consulting on two options for state pension reform for future pensioners, as set out in the consultation paper &quot;A state pension for the 21<sup>(st)</sup> Century&quot; published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-04">4 April 2011</phrase>. The Government have made clear that contributions to the current system will be honoured under any new state pension arrangements.</p>

The Government have received representations that academic research indicates that neonicotinoid insecticides, which meet the requirements for approval, could be harming populations of bees and other pollinator species.

The Government will continue to engage actively with researchers and regulators from around the world regarding this issue and will not hesitate to take further action if a need emerges.</p>

	<p pid="a.547W.2/2">A scientific report submitted in December 2009 to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), entitled &quot;Bee Mortality and Bee Surveillance in Europe&quot;, highlighted weaknesses in the surveillance systems employed by many member states leading to a lack of representative data at country level and comparable data regarding colony losses at EU level. However, the available data suggested that in recent years colony losses in England and Wales were lower than in a number of other European countries. The European Commission issued a Communication to the European Parliament and the Council in December 2010 outlining a number of initiatives to improve bee health in the EU. One of these was the commencement of a pilot surveillance programme in order to gain a better understanding of the situation across the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.547W.2/3">The honey bee population varies during the year from around 20,000 per colony in the winter to 60,000 per colony in the summer. As honey bees are a managed species, their population is subject to decisions taken by beekeepers about how many colonies to maintain or expand in any one year and the beekeepers' success in this work. In recent years, both the number of beekeepers and colonies has increased in England, as shown by the Food and Environment Research Agency's National Bee Unit's voluntary register of beekeepers, BeeBase. Currently, there are nearly 20,000 beekeepers managing about 104,000 colonies compared to 16,000 beekeepers managing about 80,000 colonies in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.547W.2/4">Over the last two years, there has been a significant reduction in the number of colonies that have been lost during the beekeeping season (i.e. from April to October) in England and Wales. During the 2010 season, 5.8% of colonies inspected were found to be dead compared with 6.9% the previous year. These figures are considerably lower than in 2008 when 12.3% of colonies inspected were found to be dead and last year's losses were the lowest since 2001. There is no clear relationship with usage data on neonicotinoid pesticides where the area treated in the UK has increased steadily since they were first approved. Given the EU initiatives on bee health and work by other international bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), there, is currently no justification for additional specific research on the relationship between neonicotinoid pesticides and the size of the UK bee population, but this will be kept under review.</p>

	<p pid="a.550W.9/1">The marketing and use of pesticides (or plant protection products) are prohibited unless they have been approved by Ministers. Approved products may be reviewed to ensure that they continue to meet modern standards of safety. Products which do not meet those standards are refused approval or, if they are already on the market, are withdrawn. Active substances used in plant protection products are subject to similar arrangements for approval and periodic review at European Union level. If approval of an active substance is withdrawn, approvals of all products that contain it are withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid="a.550W.9/2">Approval holders may also withdraw products or active substances on their own initiative and for their own reasons. Official approvals are withdrawn in these cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.550W.9/3">Withdrawn products and substances are not banned. It remains open to approval holders to submit new applications for approval with the necessary supporting data if they wish to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.550W.9/4">I have arranged for a table identifying the year in which an active substance was withdrawn in the United Kingdom to be placed in the Library of the House. It is based on the latest year in which a product containing it could be used. The information is available only for substances withdrawn since <phrase class="date" code="1997-08-14">14 August 1997</phrase>. Those withdrawn before that date were not recorded in a database which can be interrogated, and information concerning them cannot be provided without disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.552W.3/1">The Department has not set a formal public sector job reduction target. However, as part of the coalition Government's ambition of a decentralised, more enabling state, we are restructuring our Department. The restructuring will be completed by October 2012, with the number of staff in the Department falling by around 32% or 700 posts, from current levels. To help realise this reduction the Department has already launched two successful voluntary exit schemes, which have generated around 280 offers of voluntary exit.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.3/2">To achieve the remainder of the necessary downsizing, over the next 12 months the Department is undertaking a selection exercise. The Department's senior civil servants have already undertaken such an exercise, with the number of senior posts falling by a similar percentage to the Department overall.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.3/3">The Department has also not set any job reduction targets for its non-departmental public bodies. However, as a result of arms length bodies reform some will close, some will merge and some will reduce in size. The Department has agreed administration budgets with each of its arm's length bodies. It is for the individual bodies to determine how to make savings to live within their administration budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.3/4">The closure of the Government offices for the regions, as of <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>, will also result in reductions. Currently this is expected to result in approximately 200 compulsory redundancies, with the final number depending upon how many staff obtain a post elsewhere in the civil service during their notice period and a number of other staff confirming their formal acceptance of voluntary redundancy terms. It is expected that approximately 500 staff will leave on voluntary redundancy terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.552W.3/5">A number of residual regional development agency staff will transfer into the Department during the summer. These staff are not included in the figures quoted above.</p>

	<p pid="a.557W.0/1">The Government believe that, in regulating the private rented sector, it is important to strike the right balance between over burdening landlords and causing the sector to contract and ensuring that adequate safeguards are in place to protect tenants. Our view is that that current legislative framework gets this balance right.</p>
	<p pid="a.557W.0/2">The existing legislation is well established and much guidance, including that provided by my Department, is available to help landlords and tenants understand their rights and responsibilities. Although these matters are kept under constant review, we, therefore, have no plans at present to change or consolidate the, existing framework.</p>

	<p pid="a.563W.2/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the UK Statistics Authority. I have asked the authority to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated April 2011:</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.2/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) I have been asked to reply to your recent question to the Minister for the Cabinet Office asking (i) for what reason the contract for handling the UK 2011 Census data was awarded to a non-British company; (ii) what steps will be taken to ensure (a) the security of this data and (b) the privacy of the individuals providing it; (iii) what access will be granted to personal data about named individuals; under what circumstances such access may be granted; (iv) which (i) public bodies and (ii) other organisations will have access to such data; and if he will make a statement. (52433)</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.2/4" class="indent">(i) The Office for National Statistics (ONS) carries out the census in England and Wales. Lockheed Martin UK was awarded a contract in August 2008 to provide a range of services to support the 2011 Census in England and Wales. The contract was awarded following a fully compliant procurement in accordance with the requirements of European law and the European Union Procurement Directives, which have been incorporated into English law. Lockheed Martin UK has subcontracted operations to a range of UK or EU owned companies. Lockheed Martin UK does not handle 2011 Census data.</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.2/5" class="indent">UK Data Capture has been subcontracted by Lockheed Martin UK to receive, scan and process questionnaires at a specially commissioned site in Manchester. The data is then passed to ONS to analyse the data and produce census statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.2/6" class="indent">(ii) (a) The confidentiality of census personal information is a top priority for the ONS. The UK has a 200 year track record of maintaining confidentiality which ONS intends to uphold. Security has been a fundamental aspect of the whole census design. The broad principles and strategic approach covering privacy, security and confidentiality of census information were set out in Chapter 6 of the White Paper 'Helping to shape tomorrow' (CM 7513), laid before Parliament in December 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.2/7" class="indent">The Census collects information from each person and household in the country but it is not concerned with facts about individuals as such. Its purpose is to provide facts about the community, and groups within the community, as a whole.

Participants with refineries will not need to purchase CRC allowances for emissions covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). However if the organisation is responsible for energy use other than that covered by a participant's obligations in the EU ETS or climate change agreements the participant will need to purchase CRC allowances for these, like all other CRC participants in the first phase of the CRC. The energy efficiency measures the CRC encourages can save organisations money through savings on energy bills and make them more competitive. The Government are currently reviewing the overlapping regulations facing CRC participants as part of our simplification review. My officials met the UK Petroleum Industry Association to discuss the concerns of the refining sector earlier this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.575W.2/1">The UK operates within an international market for petroleum products and it is for the market to decide whether to maintain spare or mothballed refining capacity. The UK does hold emergency oil stocks under international obligations for use in oil supply disruptions. The latest available data for the end of January 2011 report that the UK held emergency oil stocks of 13.5 million tonnes that are equivalent to 88 days worth of consumption, against an EU obligation of 67.5 days of consumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.2/2">Emergency oil stocks are more accessible than mothballed refining capacity that would take some time to re-activate. Furthermore I do not consider that it would be appropriate for the Government to intervene in an individual company's economic decision on whether to mothball a refining asset as this may prevent companies from taking the right decisions for their businesses and could deter future investors from the UK market.</p>

These include: a change from running the survey every two or four years; asking about crime experienced in the preceding calendar year; a change to rolling interviewing from 2001 in which respondents are asked about crimes experienced in the previous 12 months; increases over time in the numbers of people interviewed to give greater precision around survey estimates; and since January 2009 an extension of the survey to cover children aged 10 to 15.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.2/2">The coverage of the police recorded crime statistics have been affected both by the introduction of new legislation and changes in recording practices. In addition to the changes to the calculation of crime figures outlined below, there have been numerous other changes to both coverage and classification of recorded crime since their introduction in 1857.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.2/3">There have been three major changes to police recorded crime in recent years. In April 1998, the recorded crime coverage was extended to include additional offences including some summary offences closely related to the existing ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.2/4">At that time, the counting rules were also changed to place a greater emphasis on counting one crime per victim wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.2/5">The National Crime Recording Standard was introduced nationally on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase> with the aim of promoting greater consistency between police forces in the recording of crime and to take a more victim oriented approach to crime recording.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.2/6">The 2005-06 annual crime publication included figures from the British Transport Police within the England and Wales totals for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.582W.2/7">The major changes are described in more detail in sections two and three of the User Guide to Home Office Crime Statistics. A copy of the publication can be accessed at:</p>

	<p pid="a.588W.2/1">The Government have accepted Lord Hutton's recommendations as a basis for consultation, recognising that the position of the uniformed services will require particularly careful consideration. The Government have committed to ensuring that any proposed changes to public service pension schemes, including the police schemes, as a result of Lord Hutton's recommendations are affordable, sustainable, and fair to both the public sector workforce and the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.588W.2/2">Any proposed changes to the police pension schemes would be subject to the normal consultation process with the Police Negotiating Board in line with statutory obligations. Where appropriate, an equality impact assessment would be conducted to accompany proposed changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.588W.5/2">The law places limits on attendance at polling stations. Rule 32 of the Parliamentary Elections Rules at Schedule 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 sets out a list of people who are allowed to attend a polling station, which includes police constables on duty. Police officers at polling stations have their normal policing powers. Within polling stations, it is the Presiding Officer's duty to maintain order. Rule 33 of Schedule 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 provides that the Presiding Officer may direct police constables to remove persons who have either misconducted themselves in a polling station or have failed to obey a lawful order of the Presiding Officer.</p>

	<p pid="a.594W.2/2">The police and security services already invest significant resource into planning for terrorist and other major risks to the UK, and have considerable expertise in dealing with both threats and incidents. Our approach to the games is intelligence-led and risk-based, giving us the flexibility to respond to any changes between now and 2012. Regular threat assessments inform our risk management process. Threat levels may change rapidly, and by basing the plans against a SEVERE threat level we maximise our flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.594W.2/3">Last year the Minister for Security and Counter-Terrorism conducted an audit and review of Olympic security planning, and that concluded that that work is well placed. There is of course more work to be done, but an effective foundation has already been established. We have protected the Olympic security budget, which is in addition to core funding for the police and counter-terrorism.</p>

	<p pid="a.599W.5/1">A Systematic Review of Water Fluoridation, which was commissioned by the Department from the university of York in 1999 and published in 2000, showed that, on the best available evidence, fluoridation increased the proportion of children without tooth decay by 15% and that children in fluoridated areas had, on average, 2.25 fewer teeth affected by decay than children in non-fluoridated areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.599W.5/2">Evidence from epidemiological surveys of child dental health, which are carried out at regular intervals, confirms that these benefits continue. An example of the effects of cessation is provided by a study of Anglesey<sup>(1)</sup> where fluoridation commenced in 1955, became intermittent from 1987 and ceased in 1991. In 1987-88, the last year of optimal fluoridation, the mean number of decayed, missing and filled teeth (dmft) of five-year-old children was 0.80. By 1993 average dmft had increased to 2.01 with a dmft of 1.81 among those who had experienced fluoridation during approximately 35 % of their lives and one of 2.28 for those who had experienced fluoridation for less than 10% of their lives.</p>

The table includes information on payments already made (i.e. for financial years preceding 2011-12) and estimated for the remaining contract period. The payment figures include not just the financing costs for initial construction but also all the other services such as building maintenance and support services (cleaning, catering, portering etc.) provided over the lifetime of the contract. The figures also include an annual uprate assumption for inflation of 2.5%.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.2/4">Information on the interest rates incurred on the principal debt finance and any equity finance (i.e. the financing costs referred to above) can be found in the Business Cases for each scheme, which NHS trusts are required to make publicly available. The information is not collated centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

The first is the additional &#163;25,000 for those who had already received a Stage 2 payment, some of whom will have died since receiving their initial payment, but before the <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-10">10 January 2011</phrase> announcement. The second is posthumous claims in respect of those who died before the Skipton Fund was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-08-29">29 August 2003</phrase>, and who were previously ineligible to apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.605W.6/2">As at <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>, 140 estates in England had applied to the Skipton Fund for the additional Stage 2 payment of &#163;25,000, and 472 estates in England had registered an intention to claim in respect of the pre-2003 deceased. Prior to <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>, the Skipton Fund pro-actively contacted all existing Stage 2 recipients in England on their database who had not otherwise come forward, at their last known telephone number. Of the 140 eligible claims, 34 were identified by the ring-round. It is not known who the estates are in respect of the pre-2003 deceased, so it was not possible to make pro-active contact.</p>

	<p pid="a.606W.2/1">The Government announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-04">4 April</phrase> that they would take advantage of a natural break in the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill to pause, listen, reflect and improve the plans for modernising the national health service. As a result, subject to the listening exercise and the passage of the Bill, all of the statutory changes which were due to take place in April 2012 will now take place no earlier than July 2012. This revised time scale applies to the abolition of strategic health authorities such as South Central Strategic Health Authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.606W.2/2">Strategic health authorities' functions will transfer to a range of organisations, including the NHS Commissioning Board, Health Education England and local authorities. We intend that functions will be transferred at the point that strategic health authorities are abolished.</p>
