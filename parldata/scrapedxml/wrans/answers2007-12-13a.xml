	<p pid="a.760W.6/2">Since 1997, the Government have been working to: increase the early identification of (and intervention with) victims of domestic violence; ensure that effective advice and support is provided to victims of domestic violence; improve the criminal justice response to domestic violence; and to manage perpetrators to reduce risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.6/3">These aims have been underpinned by the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 and an annual cross-Government National Delivery Plan for Domestic Violence (since 2005) to progress this work both nationally and locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.6/4">The following table sets out some of the key steps that the Government have taken to tackle domestic violence. Main themes have included:</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.6/5" class="indent">(i) strengthening the criminal justice response to domestic violence through the development and expansion of Specialist Domestic Violence Courts to 64 systems in England and Wales, ensuring that domestic violence coordinators are located in every police force, probation and Crown Prosecution Service area, and rolling out perpetrator programmes to all probation areas; and</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.6/6" class="indent">(ii) improving the safety of identified high risk victims of domestic violence through the development of Independent Domestic Violence Adviser services and Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences, with over 100 areas currently supported.</p>
	<p pid="a.760W.6/7">This work has had a significant impact: according to the British Crime Survey the prevalence of domestic violence has fallen by 59 per cent. between 1995 and 2006-07.</p>

	<p pid="a.761W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-31">31 October 2007</phrase>, there were an estimated 4,188,033 individuals with a DNA profile retained on the National DNA Database (NDNAD). This includes approximately 22,700 persons who had provided a DNA profile voluntarily. Of the 4.18 million persons, 3,938,156 persons were sampled by police forces in England and Wales. These figures were obtained from the NDNAD.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/2">Data on arrest and criminal histories are not held on the NDNAD, but are held on the Police National Computer (PNC). Such data are not available routinely at present, but the National Policing Improvement Agency which has responsibility for the delivery of NDNAD services is working towards being able to provide such data regularly from the NDNAD and PNC.</p>
	<p pid="a.761W.2/3">Data obtained from the PNC on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-31">31 October</phrase> indicate that 3,637,163 (of the 3,938,156) persons had a record retained on PNC. Of these, 3,117,942 persons had a conviction, caution, formal warning or reprimand<sup>(1)</sup> recorded on the PNC (79 per cent. of persons on the NDNAD sampled by forces in England and Wales); and 519,221 persons (13 per cent. of persons on the NDNAD sampled by forces in England and Wales) had no current conviction, caution, formal warning or reprimand recorded on PNC. The latter figure comprises some persons who may have had a caution or conviction record removed from PNC after five to 10 years in accordance with the Rules for Criminal Record Weeding (which applied prior to April 2006); persons who have been charged and acquitted or proceedings discontinued; persons who have been charged with a recordable offence and proceedings are ongoing; and persons who have been arrested but no further action was taken against them. The PNC records for the other 300,993 persons (8 per cent. of persons on the NDNAD) had been removed from the PNC for various reasons, for example, their conviction and caution records had been weeded after five-10 years, the person had been acquitted or proceedings were discontinued. No breakdown is available of the number of males and females who have a profile on the NDNAD but who have not been convicted, cautioned etc. These data could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.776W.2/1">The Future Rotorcraft Capability (FRC) programme explored the capabilities of many different helicopter types from all major western helicopter manufacturers, including products from EADS Eurocopter and Sikorsky. It also explored whether certain helicopter types could contribute to more than one area of our overall capability need, thus helping reduce through-life costs, though the wide spectrum of tasks required of our helicopter fleet means that no single type is able to meet the required capability in full.</p>
	<p pid="a.776W.2/2">The through-life military capability, cost and risk of various mixes of different helicopter types was assessed. These mixes included options that used different aircraft types to deliver the Land and Maritime capabilities now contracted to be provided by Future Lynx.</p>
	<p pid="a.776W.2/3">This analysis concluded that, alongside other investments arising from the FRC programme, the delivery of the British Army's Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter (BRH) and the Royal Navy's Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft (SCMR) through a single helicopter type (Future Lynx) provided the best combination of through-life military capability, cost and risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.776W.2/4">I am withholding the information requested on our internal assessments of the average cost per helicopter as its disclosure would prejudice commercial interests.</p>

	<p pid="a.777W.0/1">In Iraq, Class A, B and C vehicles are fuelled using diesel (F-54) with no additives during the winter months. In the summer a 50/50 blend of diesel and aviation fuel (F-34) known as F-65 together with a lubricant additive, Lubrizol 539M, is used. The fuels are obtained from the US military in Kuwait under the UK-US Fuel Exchange agreement, with logistic support provided by two contractors. F-65 is approximately 11 per cent. more expensive than plain diesel.</p>
	<p pid="a.777W.0/2">In Afghanistan, vehicles are operated in accordance with the NATO single fuel policy where this is technically feasible. The fuel is aviation fuel (F-34) (which has already been treated with AL41 Icing Inhibitor and AL61 Lubricity Improver) to which Lubrizol 539M is also added, the resulting mixture being referred to as F-63. A number of vehicle types are being fuelled with F-54 at certain locations for operational reasons, these include engineering plant, Warrior and CVR(T) vehicles. These fuels are provided under a NATO contract with a civilian contractor. In Afghanistan, F-34 is approximately two per cent. more expensive than F-54.</p>
	<p pid="a.777W.0/3">No breakdowns have been apportioned to the use of any of these fuel types. During the transition from diesel to F-65 or F-63 use, there can be a transient increase in fuel filter use as the F-34 component has a cleansing effect on the engine.</p>

	<p pid="a.779W.5/1">The operational focus of the River Class vessels is fishery protection. When not being used for this purpose their time is used for stand-offs, training, passage, visits and maintenance. They must also be available for the VT Group plc 'unused' days (days for which the ships are not contracted and therefore unavailable for any FLEET tasking). They may also be programmed by the Commander in Chief Fleet for other tasks, such as maritime security, in the case of an urgent operational requirement. These cases are likely to be rare. None of these tasks are carried out at the expense of the agreed number of fishery patrol days provided by the Ministry of Defence to DEFRA. There are currently no plans to change the purposes for which River Class vessels are used in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.779W.8/1">The Ministry of Defence announced in June 2007 the award of a contract to EADS Eurocopter to assess the timescale, cost, performance and risk issues associated with the enhancements of the capability and the extension of the in-service life of the Puma HC1 helicopter until 2022. This assessment will explore issues relating to the upgrade of avionics systems and the replacement of engines and obsolete items. It is scheduled to conclude in 2008 to inform an investment decision to undertake the capability enhancement and life extension programme. It is envisaged that the resultant aircraft would be known as the Puma HC2. In-service duties will not be decided until the main investment decision is made.</p>

	<p pid="a.780W.6/1">The strategy to manage movements of animals from bluetongue restricted zones has been agreed at EU level and is set out in Regulation 1266/2007. The regime is based around the scientific evidence base, with movement conditions intended to provide appropriate assurance that animals are not infected before moves can be allowed. Pre-movement testing forms an integral part of this regime, but testing must be used in conjunction with other measures to provide appropriate guarantees, due to the nature of bluetongue spread by midges.</p>
	<p pid="a.780W.6/2">These measures include testing during the &quot;vector free period&quot; when temperatures have dropped significantly and midge activity is greatly reduced, or isolating animals in midge-proof buildings before testing. In each case, the aim is to ensure that the animal is safe to move. Guidance on these provisions, and on movement in the vector free period in particular, will be published shortly (the most likely window for such a period if it can be declared is January to March).</p>

	<p pid="a.784W.6/1">Improving standards of literacy is one of the Government's top priorities. Since 1997 literacy rates have risen dramatically. The 2007 English results show that 80 per cent. of 11-year-olds reached the expected level or above, an increase of 17 percentage points since 1997; and 74 per cent. of 14-year-olds reached the expected level or above, an increase of 17 percentage points since 1997. At GCSE, 2007 results indicate that 45.7 per cent. of young people achieved 5 A*-C GCSEs including English, an increase of 9.7 percentage points since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.6/2">This is as a result of a number of factors, including the challenge and support provided through the Primary and Secondary National Strategies. The National Strategies provide continuing professional development to support schools in raising standards in teaching, support better use of pupil performance data and challenge schools and local authorities to set ambitious targets for their pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.6/3">The primary framework for teaching literacy has been renewed to reflect the recommendations of the &quot;Rose Review&quot;. The renewed framework now puts phonics at the heart of teaching reading and, backed up by the letters and sounds phonics teaching programme, will help to raise attainment levels in all pupils. Next April a revised and updated secondary framework for teaching English will be published which will place greater focus on pupil assessment and progression.</p>
	<p pid="a.784W.6/4">For those children who struggle most in learning to read, the additional support provided through the national roll-out of the Every Child a Reader programme and the development of an Every Child a Writer programme will help to ensure that we maintain and extend the improvements we have already achieved.</p>

	<p pid="a.791W.2/1">Since 2000 the Highways Agency has been allocated &pound;5 million per annum for noise mitigation measures to deal with the most serious and pressing cases, where practical and cost-effective measures can be provided. These measures are applied to the entire strategic road network including both motorways and trunks roads. This annual allocation for noise mitigation is scheduled to continue until the end of the period covered by CSR07.</p>
	<p pid="a.791W.2/2">The Agency's expenditure in this area is not limited to this figure as noise mitigation measures are included in all the Agency's schemes, where warranted, as it is more cost effective to do this work concurrently with other scheme works. The cost of these works are subsumed within the overall cost of the individual schemes making it impossible to extract the exact figure spent on noise mitigation without incurring disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.791W.2/3">In 1999, the Agency commissioned research to develop a system which would help to identify and classify residential areas adjacent to the road network on the basis of their noise exposure. A copy of the report from this research will be placed in the House library. More recent research has been undertaken by DEFRA, as a result of the introduction of the Environmental Noise Directive into UK legislation. This has required major sources of noise to be mapped, including the entire strategic road network. These maps are expected to be published by DEFRA in early 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.803W.5/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.803W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-13">13 December 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.803W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about what assessments his Department has made of the ease of access to Jobcentre Plus in rural areas. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.803W.5/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus services are provided not only through the Jobcentre network but also by telephone through the Contact Centre and Benefit Delivery Centre network as well as the internet. This allows all customers to access services regardless of where they live. Where there are issues about customer access to a Jobcentre provision can be made for additional more flexible support arrangements. These include the installation of Jobpoints in libraries, surgeries in third party premises, partnering in Local Authority outlets and, where practical, some mobile services.</p>
	<p pid="a.803W.5/5" class="indent">At the inception of Jobcentre Plus in 2002 District Managers developed local service delivery plans in consultation with key stakeholders from the community. This exercise led to the identification of where best to locate our Jobcentre network and where to introduce the additional flexible arrangements referred to above. In developing service delivery plans District Managers had full regard for a range of factors including where people live, the needs of those people, ease and cost of accessing Jobcentres by those communities and the viability of maintaining an outlet or introducing a flexible support arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="a.803W.5/6" class="indent">Since the development of those original plans our service provision has been continuously improving, because of advances in telephony and e-channels. These improvements mean that District Managers can review the original plans to ensure that we achieve our aim of providing work for those who can and support for those who cannot in the most efficient and effective manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.803W.5/7" class="indent">Devon &amp; Cornwall Jobcentre Plus District, for example, is in the process of reviewing its Service Delivery Plan. This review is being carried out once again in consultation with key stakeholders and their views will be fully considered before decisions are finalised. Access to services for all customers will be a key consideration of that review regardless of where they live.</p>
	<p pid="a.803W.5/8" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.806W.2/1">In the Green Paper &quot;In-work, better off: next steps to full employment&quot;, we set out our proposals for the flexible new deal. Our proposals are that the flexible new deal would replace the existing mandatory new deal for young people (NDYP) and new deal 25-plus (ND25+) programmes, and would be for jobseeker's allowance (JSA) customers only. The funding for the new deal for musicians, which is offered through NDYP and ND25+, would be incorporated into the flexible new deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.806W.2/2">It is intended that the flexible new deal will look very different to these programmes and will respond more flexibly to individual needs; providers may draw on experiences from the activity offered in the current mandatory new deal programmes but would be able to develop and offer other initiatives as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.806W.2/3">The voluntary new deals are open to customers across benefit groups. Under flexible new deal, there would be some changes to the way the additional support available through flexible new deal applies to jobseeker's allowance (JSA) customers on these programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.806W.2/4">New deal 50-plus would continue in its present form for non-JSA customers. The support currently offered to JSA customers through new deal 50-plus would be replaced by the additional employment and skills support and activity requirements at the six-month Gateway stage of flexible new deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.806W.2/5">New deal for lone parents would continue to support JSA customers as now. New deal for partners would offer additional work-focused interviews from April 2008 where there are dependent children.</p>
	<p pid="a.806W.2/6">The new deal for disabled people (NDDP) is not available to JSA customers and so would be unaffected by the introduction of the flexible new deal.</p>

	<p pid="a.829W.2/1">The UK is already playing a leading role alongside international partners in ensuring that the international community can become more effective in preventing the breakdown of states and societies. Effective measures will require international consensus on the challenges and the backing of the international community. That is why the UK is pressing the UN and other bodies to deliver the 2005 World Summit commitment to the creation of a single Early Warning System and to operationalise the concept of Responsibility to Protect also endorsed at that World Summit. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister set out the clear challenge to the international community to deliver its commitments by improving procedures to prevent conflict. Specifically, the UN Security Council needs to act earlier, and there needs to be more use of targeted sanctions and international criminal court actions. The UK will continue to work with international partners on specific mechanisms to deliver existing international commitments.</p>

In his report, he stated that Iran had provided 'sufficient access' to individuals and had responded in a 'timely manner' to the IAEA's questions. However, he also noted that co-operation had been 'reactive rather than proactive' and that active co-operation and full transparency were 'indispensable for full and prompt implementation of the work plan'. Even more concerning, he noted that the IAEA's knowledge about Iran's current nuclear programme is diminishing.</p>
	<p pid="a.829W.8/2">We share Dr. El Baradei's concerns. After many years of concealing its nuclear programme, Iran has still not disclosed in full its past nuclear activities, and the IAEA is still unable to state its confidence in the answers Iran has given. To do this, the IAEA has made clear that Iran needs to give proactive co-operation and implement the Additional Protocol. Unless Iran does this, the IAEA has said it is unable to provide assurances about the exclusively peaceful nature of the programme. If Iran is serious about building international trust, it should implement the Additional Protocol and suspend all enrichment-related activities without delay.</p>

	<p pid="a.835W.5/2">The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) has planned for 18 transport helicopters and six tactical utility helicopters for UNAMID, and has identified and approached countries that could potentially supply them. We have worked closely with the DPKO to support its lobbying efforts with those countries. We continue to work closely with them, with allies in the UN Security Council and with other potential contributors to secure the supply of helicopters.</p>

The Department for International Development (DFID) is providing &pound;60,000 for some off-island training activities and a review of options for Tristan to diversify its economy and increase its revenue. DFID provides a resident doctor, and a visiting dentist and optometrist, under its health programme for St Helena. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and DFID are funding &pound;107,000 this financial year from their Overseas Territories Environment Project budget for a number of small-scale development projects. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is also working closely with DFID and the Tristan Government on the emergency repairs of Calshot Harbour.</p>
	<p pid="a.836W.5/2">A recent viral outbreak on Tristan da Cunha has triggered a rise in the cases of asthma on the island. The island has enough stocks of the necessary drugs for this not to be an emergency situation now. Following close liaison with the Administrator on Tristan, DFID, the Ministry of Defence and others, however, we are making arrangements to provide an additional supply of drugs in advance of the next regular ship's visit to the island at the end of January 2008. We hope to be able to deliver these supplies to the island on a Royal Navy vessel around <phrase class="date" code="">15 December</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.837W.6/1">Recent assessments by DFID and the United Nations in North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) suggest that for the moment, although the humanitarian situation is serious, most of the critical humanitarian needs are being met. However, many areas are increasingly difficult to access, both due to ongoing conflict and poor infrastructure. The recent surge in fighting between the FARDC and forces of rebel General Nkunda is a serious cause for concern. There are reports of tens of thousands of newly displaced people. Although funding is available to respond to further needs through the DRC Humanitarian Pooled Fund&mdash;to which DFID has contributed &pound;30 Million in 2007&mdash;if large scale displacements occur, the capacity of the humanitarian community could become overstretched and may struggle to address the humanitarian needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.837W.6/2">On the <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-22">22 November</phrase>, the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly adopted a resolution which called on the Governments of the EU and ACP countries, the Council of the EU, the European Commission, the UN and the African Union (AU) to do everything possible to provide efficient and adequate aid to the population in the east of the DRC and to contribute to address a humanitarian disaster. As a member of the Good Humanitarian Donorship group in the DRC, DFID regularly meets with partners, including EU counterparts and the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), to discuss humanitarian assistance priorities and needs. We continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

	<p pid="a.839W.6/1">No intellectual property provisions have been included in the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) signed to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.839W.6/2">The UK has always been clear that issues other than trade in goods should only be included in EPAs if the African, Caribbean or Pacific regions wish them to be. If a region wants to negotiate intellectual property rights in their EPA, then the UK policy is that no country should be required to go beyond existing commitments under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement on trade related intellectual property rights (TRIPS). This agreement includes the right for countries to improve their access to cheaper medicines by producing, exporting or importing generic medicines under a compulsory licence. The UK supports this right. The Department for International Development has financed a number of organisations to assist developing countries to make better use of their TRIPS flexibilities, including compulsory licensing.</p>

	<p pid="a.840W.0/1">DFID does not carry out its own assessments, but relies on information from other bodies including the World Health Organisation (WHO). According to WHO's latest information from October this year, 91 out of 416 essential drugs, and 188 out of 596 essential medical supplies were out of stock due to problems faced by suppliers in delivering. Stocks of a further 114 items of medical supplies were only predicted to last one to three months.</p>
	<p pid="a.840W.0/2">More recently, in November the UN OCHA reported that first line paediatric antibiotics were no longer available in the Ministry of Health (MoH) because the only drug manufacturer that produces them in Gaza is unable to import the necessary chemical precursors. In addition, certain expensive drugs that are not on the essential drug list and that the MoH has no budget to procure have run out.</p>
	<p pid="a.840W.0/3">These shortages are the result of the closure of Gaza's crossings. We call on all sides to assume their responsibilities in ensuring they re-open as soon as possible, and stand ready to provide appropriate assistance. I raised the closure of Gaza crossings and its humanitarian impact with the Israeli and Palestinian authorities during my visit earlier this week.</p>

Do not add these figures together as this would cause double counting.<br/> 3. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected in the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing times series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> 4. Data Quality: HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> 5. Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 6. Ungrossed Data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES, The Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

In the case of the NHS, primary care trusts are responsible for delivering improvements to patient care, so spending on activity outlined in the strategy will be based on local decisions. We would also expect there to be scope for off-setting efficiency savings, for example from reduced hospital admissions.</p>

	<p pid="a.846W.11/1">In March 2002 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organisation (WHO) evaluated the evidence on breast cancer screening. They concluded that trials have provided sufficient evidence for the screening of women between 50 and 69 years, and that the reduction in mortality from breast cancer among women who chose to participate in screening programmes was estimated to be about 35 per cent. The IARC working group consisted of 24 experts from 11 countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.11/2">We now want to extend the breast screening programme so that more women benefit and even more lives are saved. At present women are invited for screening seven times at three yearly intervals between 50 and 70. Over time, this will be extended to nine screening rounds between 47 and 73 years with a guarantee that women will have their first screening invitation before the age of 50.</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.11/3">This extension was recommended by the Cancer Reform Strategy (CRS) Breast Cancer Working Group, who carefully examined the emerging evidence on extending the programme below and above the current age ranges, and the recommendation was accepted by the CRS Advisory Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.11/4">For bowel screening research undertaken in Nottingham and Funen in the 1980s showed that screening men and women aged 45 to 74 for bowel cancer using the faecal occult blood test (FOBt) could reduce the mortality rate from bowel cancer by 16 per cent. in those screened.</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.11/5">An independently evaluated pilot in Warwickshire and Scotland showed that this research can be replicated in an national health service setting. Based on the final evaluation report of the pilot and a formal options appraisal, the NHS bowel cancer screening programme in England is screening men and women aged 60 to 69.</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.11/6">As announced in the recently published cancer reform strategy, from 2010 we will be extending the screening age range for bowel cancer to invite men and women aged 70 to 75 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.846W.11/7">By the end of 2010, decisions will be taken about the possible roll out of bowel screening to people in their 50s, dependent on forthcoming research findings.</p>

	<p pid="a.848W.2/2">Socio-economic deprivation has a marked impact on cancer outcomes. Cancer mortality is more than 15 per cent. higher in spearhead primary care trusts (PCTs) than the national average.

	<p pid="a.848W.2/4">Other specific actions in the CRS to reduce regional inequalities include:</p>
	<p pid="a.848W.2/5" class="indent">the Government will continue to invest in social marketing initiatives at the national level to support people to stop smoking, especially with the free support available from the national health service.

	<p pid="a.849W.2/1">The Cancer Reform Strategy contains several actions that will improve cancer detection and recognises that primary care professionals have essential roles at all stages of the cancer care pathway, one of which being the diagnosis of cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.2/2">The main actions are:</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.2/3" class="italic"> Establishing a national audit in primary care</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.2/4">The audits will build on the 'significant events reviews' already being undertaken by many general practitioners and will focus on aspects such as the number of visits to primary care with relevant symptoms before referral to hospital (delay pattern analysis).</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.2/5">The resultant information will inform both local practice learning as well as the national audit. The audit will be undertaken collaboratively by the Royal College of General Practice and the National Patient Safety Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.2/6" class="italic"> Establishing a national awareness and early diagnosis initiative</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.2/7">Some good work to raise cancer symptom awareness and encourage early presentation is already under way. The initiative, led by the National Cancer Director, will provide co-ordinated support to local health services to deliver effective interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.2/8">The initiative will also develop key cancer messages for both health professionals and the public. The messages will be developed over the course of 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.2/9" class="italic"> Improving access to diagnostics</p>
	<p pid="a.849W.2/10">This is the single most important priority in primary care.

	<p pid="a.849W.2/11">This issue also forms an important component of the national health service Next Stage Review, which is being conducted by Lord Darzi. The review is due to be published in the summer 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.852W.2/2">A full evaluation of the pilot was undertaken by the London Institute for Sport, Middlesex university, in September 2006. During the pilot year, step counts increased steadily from an average of 8,355 steps at baseline to an average of 16,436 in the 28 week (97 per cent. increase). The pilot found that students' intention to maintain their walking levels was optimistic as 35 per cent. reported that they 'definitely' will maintain their walking during the next 12 months. Most students (51 per cent.) reported that since the beginning of the school year they had increased their physical activity levels. We are confident that the increases in physical activity it produced are likely to have an important impact on energy balance, helping to reduce levels of obesity.</p>

FACS is a framework that councils should use to help them determine if individuals are eligible for support.

	<p pid="a.860W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-29">29 November 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.860W.5/2">The importance of the climate change agenda is well understood and it is recognised that to tackle climate change, not only do we have to reduce greenhouse gases, but we must also adapt to the impacts we are already experiencing and will continue to experience over the coming decades due to the inertia in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.5/3">Climate impacts affect many departmental responsibilities. We have worked closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to develop the adaptation sections of the Climate Change Bill, which will require Government to assess the risks climate change poses to the United Kingdom&mdash;including to public health and the health estate&mdash;and to develop a programme to respond to those risks. The first risk assessment will be due three years after Royal Assent (around 2011) with the programme being published shortly afterwards. We have also worked with other Departments on the development of the Adaptation Policy Framework which will be published in spring 2008, setting out the Government's programme of action on climate impacts.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.5/4">In May 2007, the Department published an update of their 2001 report &quot;the Health Effects of Climate Change&quot; for comment. This is being finalised for publication later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.5/5">The Department has a national heat wave plan in place, which is evaluated and updated annually to ensure that the best available evidence is used to reduce the ill effects of heat waves. The plan and supporting guidance are circulated to emergency planners and relevant stakeholders in May each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.5/6">On flooding, the Department's emergency preparedness division continues to work across the health economy in partnership with other agencies and Departments to ensure improved resilience of patient services, including national health service infrastructure and health supply chains, and the preparedness of the service to respond to major flooding incidents. Closer work will be needed between the NHS and the Environment Agency to mitigate the affects of flooding in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.5/7">Protection from skin cancers, sunburn and cataracts caused by ultraviolet radiation will rely heavily on public health messages building, for example, on the Department's current collaboration with Cancer-Research UK for the SunSmart campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.5/8">Although winter deaths are likely to decline, the Department's Keep Warm Keep Well campaign provides annual advice to vulnerable people (mainly older people and also disabled people and families on low incomes) on how to keep themselves and their homes warm in the winter.</p>
	<p pid="a.860W.5/9">The UK recognises that the potential health impact of climate change also requires global action. To this end, the UK has successfully arranged for an agenda item on 'climate change and health' to be included on the agenda of the forthcoming World Health Organisation Executive Board in January 2008. Our aim is to raise awareness of the health implications of climate change among health ministries and professionals and promote practical and sustainable action nationally and internationally to respond to these. Discussion at the Executive Board will enable member states to focus on planning and developing adaptation policies. The UK is also engaged with the European Union on their recent Green Paper on Adaptation.</p>

	<p pid="a.863W.0/2">We take the issue of eating disorders, especially among young people, very seriously. This is why the Department asked the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to produce a clinical guideline on the core interventions in the treatment and management of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and related eating disorders, and which NICE published in 2004. The guideline covers physical and psychological treatments, treatment with medicines, and information specifically for patients, carers and the public. NICE will commence a review of this guideline in January 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.863W.0/3">As primary care trusts consider local health needs and commissioned services, they will need to assess whether the right balance exists between in-patient care and home-based care, particularly at a highly specialised levels, to help individuals with eating disorders.</p>

	<p pid="a.863W.3/1">There is no intention to nationally provide new or additional incentives for general practitioners (GPs), nurses, or other health professionals to deliver nutritional screening for older people. Prioritisation is a matter for primary care trusts (PCTs) who would need to pay for any local incentive scheme. However, one aim of the Agenda for Change pay system, introduced in 2003-04 for the majority of non-medical national health service staff, was to establish a framework within which PCTs could incentivise delivery of local priorities through rigorous job evaluation, which enables remuneration based on skills and experience, better training opportunities linked to pay progression and use of recruitment and retention premia to attract difficult to recruit skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.863W.3/2">Older patients regularly see their GP or other member of the primary care team. On average, over-75s see their GP at least six times a year, and as part of GPs' essential services, elderly patients' general health would be assessed as part of their regular ongoing treatment within these visits.</p>

	<p pid="a.874W.8/1">The National Nutrition Plan published in October 2007 encouraged commissioners and providers to promote nutrition screening in all health and social care settings. The National Patient Safety Agency is currently supporting the implementation of the malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST) as the screening tool of choice. This is being done in collaboration with the Royal College of Nursing, as part of the Nutrition Now Campaign, through a serious of trust based workshops. The workshops are attended by nurses, dieticians and caterers and provide a training session on using the MUST screening tool.</p>

	<p pid="a.884W.2/1">The following barriers to nutritional screening within 24 hours of admission to hospital were identified by the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) at the two workshops: lack of equipment, weighing scales and height measures; lack of leadership; lack of clarity relating to screening and assessment; dependency of patients; credibility and usability of available screening tools; lack of education and training for medical and nursing staff and that it is not mandatory.</p>
	<p pid="a.884W.2/2">The NPSA hosted two patient participation meetings in early 2007 to gain their views of nutritional care in hospitals. 27 patient representatives either nominated by Age Concern or recruited from the NPSA patient participation register attended these meetings. All of the participants had been hospital inpatients in the last two years. The meetings were facilitated externally.</p>
	<p pid="a.884W.2/3">The patient participation meetings discussed the patient's experience of hospital food and focused in more detail on nutritional screening. Perhaps the most surprising finding of these workshops was that participants did not generally complaint about the quality of the food. Many, indeed, said that it was very reasonable or even good.</p>
	<p pid="a.884W.2/4">Several commented that hospital food had improved beyond all recognition, noting earlier experiences when the food had been inedible. There was a concern to acknowledge this improvement, one commented:</p>
	<p pid="a.884W.2/5" class="indent">&quot;it used to be cold fish and stale cabbage smells&mdash;you don't get that now&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.884W.2/6">There were some issues raised relating to the availability and choice for some patient groups, specifically diabetics and people on a halal diet.</p>
	<p pid="a.884W.2/7">There were considerable complaints about the way the food was served. The tendency for the food to be plated before reaching patients in some hospitals was disliked, as some people got too much, which was then wasted, and others did not get enough and went hungry.</p>
	<p pid="a.884W.2/8">Getting food delivered was seen as the start. It must be possible for patients to reach it and then to be able to eat it. This is clearly not always the case. Sometimes food was put out of reach, so that someone had to move it closer to a patient. A number of participants recounted that they or others were unable to eat without help due to problems associated with their illness.</p>
	<p pid="a.884W.2/9">Participants were asked if they had been aware of being screened while in hospital. Some were aware of being weighed, but not much else. Several said that they had lost substantial amounts of weight, but no one asked them about it. A few were aware of their height being checked. Very, very few remembered being asked any questions about what they ate, although some Asian participants had been asked about this and one person remembered being asked if he was diabetic.</p>
	<p pid="a.884W.2/10">The costs of the workshops were &pound;2,500. The balance is an approximation of the staff and non-pay costs associated with supporting this work and the work with the Royal College of Nursing.</p>

	<p pid="a.887W.5/1">We have no plans to review the Commission for Social Care Inspection's role in complaints. We are informed by the Chair of the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) that the threshold for intervention by CSCI is not measured uniquely in terms of the number of complaints about a provider. It is one of a number of factors that CSCI take into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.887W.5/2">CSCI has developed, through the inspection methodology, &quot;Inspecting for Better Lives&quot;, a proportionate inspection framework based on risk. This enables CSCI to focus its resources on those homes that have been assessed as requiring the most improvement. Minimum inspection frequencies are based on quality ratings as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.887W.5/3" class="indent">homes classified as 'poor' receive two key inspections per year;</p>
	<p pid="a.887W.5/4" class="indent">homes classified as 'adequate' receive one key inspection per year;</p>
	<p pid="a.887W.5/5" class="indent">homes classified as 'good' receive one key inspection every two years; and</p>
	<p pid="a.887W.5/6" class="indent">homes classified as 'excellent' receive one key inspection every three years;</p>
	<p pid="a.887W.5/7">Even when a home is judged to be 'good' or 'excellent', it will continue to be monitored throughout the period and CSCI will act on any concerns, complaints or allegations. In addition to key inspections, which are thorough, detailed inspection, under which CSCI will assess all of the key national minimum standards, CSCI also carries out random and 'thematic' inspections, which are short, focused inspections on a specific theme or area.</p>
	<p pid="a.887W.5/8">Annual Service Reviews are also conducted from information obtained from the home and a report produced on an annual basis. Reviews are an analysis of all information that CSCI has gathered since the last key inspection, information submitted each year from the service itself and information from surveys sent to people who use the service and other interested parties. The assessment will consider matters such as staff turnover; if any concerns are raised about how well outcomes are being met for the people who use the services, or if CSCI receives information that causes concern between reviews, it will bring forward the date of the key inspection of the service. CSCI retains the power to conduct an inspection of any home at any time.</p>

	<p pid="a.889W.3/1">The Department's 2006 annual report set out expenditure on grants for adult personal social services in 2006-07 of &pound;1,688.8 million. Of this, &pound;1,590.4 million was revenue grants and &pound;98.4 million was capital resources including Supported Capital Expenditure (Revenue).</p>
	<p pid="a.889W.3/2">The Specific Grant Resources allocated by the Department in 2006-07 totalled &pound;1,644.948 million. Of this, &pound;1,596.848 million was allocated to revenue grants. This is &pound;6.485 million higher than the resources allocated in the annual report, due to this sum being made available to fund new pressures from the Mental Capacity Act and Independent Mental Capacity Advocate Service. &pound;48.1 million was allocated to specific capital grants and a further &pound;50.3 million of capital funding was allocated to Supported Capital Expenditure (Revenue). Total capital expenditure was &pound;98.4 million, as set out in the annual report.</p>

It incorporates the latest forecasts of climate change. It also requires regional planning bodies to ensure their regional spatial strategies include a broad consideration of flood risk from all sources and set out a strategy for managing it. This process is informed by regional flood risk appraisals (RFRAs), which are based on the most up to date information on flood risk. RFRAs should be updated in line with future revisions of the regional spatial strategy. We will be taking careful note of the recommendations of Sir Michael Pitt's review of the lessons learned from the summer floods, and will be looking at whether any of the detail of PPS25 needs to be revised.</p>

	<p pid="a.903W.2/2">I have deposited in the Library of the House a summary of the responses to the consultation which includes the full list of respondents at Annex A.</p>
	<p pid="a.903W.2/3">The consultation paper, included the following proposal:</p>
	<p pid="a.903W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;The Secretary of State intends to issue guidance re-stating and specifying the minimum standards of accommodation that housing authorities should have regard to when considering whether temporary accommodation is suitable for homeless person they seek to place in such accommodation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.903W.2/5">This proposal was implemented through the inclusion of guidance in the revised Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities, issued in July 2006. Chapter 17 of the Code, Suitability of Accommodation, provides guidance on the factors to be taken into account when determining the suitability of temporary accommodation secured under the homelessness legislation, including fitness for habitation, housing healthy and safety, overcrowding and houses in multiple occupation. Also in chapter 17, the Secretary of State recommends minimum standards that should be taken into account by local authorities when assessing whether bed and breakfast accommodation is suitable. The recommended minimum standards are set out in detail in annex 17 of the Code. Annex 16 of the Code sets out the statutory definition of overcrowding.</p>

	<p pid="a.905W.0/1">The welfare of any child is of paramount importance where children are the subject in family proceedings. Irrespective of parents' marital status, children are most often the subject of proceedings about contact and residence arrangements following parental separation.</p>
	<p pid="a.905W.0/2">The Government believe that court is not always the best place to resolve these disputes. Court proceedings can prolong parental conflict which is damaging for children. Unless there are safety issues, it is generally better for the children concerned that parents reach agreement themselves. In &quot;Parental Separation: Children's Needs and Parents' Responsibilities&quot; (January 2005) the Government announced a range of measures to support this aim, including promoting family mediation which can offer advantages over going to court, especially where children are involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.905W.0/3">Children can find the court process frustrating and stressful if they feel that their wishes and feelings are being ignored. Where parents cannot agree, the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) has a key role in ascertaining the wishes and feelings of the child involved, dependent on their age and understanding. In the most difficult cases, the court can request that the child is separately represented to ensure that their views are properly heard.</p>
	<p pid="a.905W.0/4">When parents do come to court, there is still the opportunity for them to reach agreement themselves and avoid the stress, for them and their children, of a contested hearing. In-court conciliation is a service available in most family courts which aims to facilitate agreement between the parents when they first attend court. The Government commissioned Dr. Liz Trinder of the university of East Anglia to evaluate the effectiveness of various models of in-court conciliation and to look at longer-term outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.905W.0/5">The latest report, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November</phrase>, found that two years following conciliation, the great majority (79 per cent.) of cases had an agreement about contact and were closed. More children were having overnight contact and the overall amount of contact per child had increased since the initial conciliation intervention. However, during the two years following the intervention, the majority of parents had required further professional intervention and 40 per cent. had been involved in further litigation. Around 60 per cent. of agreements made at the 'original' conciliation meeting had been changed or had broken down by the two-year follow-up.</p>
	<p pid="a.905W.0/6">The well-being of parents had improved significantly and was at a similar level to those who had not come to court. However, this improvement was not apparent in children. After two years, 35-43 per cent. of these children still had borderline or abnormal well-being scores.</p>
	<p pid="a.905W.0/7">The report recommends the development of more relationship-based or therapeutically-orientated interventions as additional family justice systems or as referral-based services. The Government recognise that more needs to be done to support these parents and have already legislated to provide the courts with powers to refer parents to more therapeutic activities designed to help them overcome some of the underlying issues they face. These issues can often act as barriers that prevent parents from making arrangements that work for their children. The Government will shortly announce the timetable for implementing these provisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.909W.3/1">There is considerable international evidence to support the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural treatment programmes in reducing reoffending. These research findings are based on systematic reviews which draw together all the available, high quality evidence in the field. Two of the more recent reviews were published within the last two years (Wilson et al., 2005; Washington State Institute for Public Policy, 2006).</p>
	<p pid="a.909W.3/2">UK research examining the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural programmes in prisons is limited and has produced mixed results (Friendship et al, 2002; Falshaw et al, 2003; Cann et al, 2003). These findings may be due to implementation failure or the research designs used which makes it difficult to attribute the outcomes directly to the impact of the intervention (Debidin, M. and Lovbakke, J, 2004). However, a qualitative study conducted in the UK in 2004 examined the programme experience of prisoners completing cognitive skills training (Clarke et al, 2004). Both prisoners and staff reported short-term benefits for prisoners such as improved prisoner behaviour; increased self-confidence; enhanced literacy skills and better interpersonal skills. Completion of cognitive skills also helped to prepare prisoners for other offending behaviour programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.909W.3/3">The current RDS NOMS programme also includes further research on the effectiveness of other cognitive behavioural programmes based on rigorous research designs.</p>

	<p pid="a.915W.2/2">This information is not available centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.915W.2/3">Research conducted by Professor Karen Bryan in partnership with HM Prison Service (University of Surrey 2004) found that 60 per cent. of young offenders screened on entering custody were identified as having difficulties with speech, language and communication.</p>
	<p pid="a.915W.2/4">All young offenders receive health screening on reception into prison and in addition will be screened for their educational needs. A general learning needs induction and assessment process is used to help identify learning difficulties and disabilities. As part of this process, education staff are expected to identify concerns about a prisoner's speech and language capability. Where such problems are identified, either as a result of the health screen or the education screen, a referral to an appropriate health professional would be expected to be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.915W.2/5">All young people in custody are required by the Youth Justice Board to participate in education and training. Teaching professionals work with young offenders in small classes to help ensure they receive education which meets their personal needs. special educational needs coordinators are employed in each young offender institution to assist in meeting the personal needs of young people and to help them get the most from their education in custody.</p>
