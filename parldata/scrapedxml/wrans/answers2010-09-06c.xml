	<p pid="c.18W.2/1">As reported in the statistical release &quot;Collection rates for council tax and national non-domestic rates in England 2009-10&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-22">22 June 2010</phrase>, in 2009-10 local authorities collected &#163;21.4 billion out of a possible &#163;22.1 billion which was a national in-year collection rate of 97.1%. This release is available on the Communities and Local Government website at:</p>
	<p pid="c.18W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/localregional/localgovernmentfinance/statistics/counciltax/collectionrates/">http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/localregional/localgovernmentfinance/statistics/counciltax/collectionrates/</a></p>
	<p pid="c.18W.2/3">Collection of council taxes continues once the financial year to which they relate has ended. This means that the amount outstanding will be reduced and the final collection rate achieved is somewhere between the figures shown here and 100%.</p>
	<p pid="c.18W.2/4">The collection and enforcement of council tax is a matter for individual local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.18W.2/5">Every penny of council tax that isn't collected means higher council tax for the law-abiding citizens who do pay up on time. Councils with an efficient collection service are able to set lower council tax bills for everyone or spend more money on frontline services such as bin collections. The new Government will be making councils become more open and transparent about what they are spending. It is important that councils are sympathetic to the vulnerable and families who are struggling in the recession, and don't overuse bailiffs, but a lot more could be done to improve the back office service, especially in inner-city areas which have the worst collection rates.</p>

	<p pid="c.22W.0/1">My Department is facilitating a range of activities to increase the involvement of young people in decisions made by its Ministers, officials and public bodies. Ministers recently met the Young Advisors' Charity and a number of its young advisors to talk about young people's contribution to the Big Society agenda; and officials hold regular meetings with representative organisations to ensure the views of young people are properly taken into account when developing policy. Although we do not hold information centrally on the work of this Department's public bodies with young people, we are aware of a number of different engagement programmes, including the Olympic Legacy Company's establishment of a Youth Panel made up of young people from the host boroughs, to get them involved in shaping the plans for the park after the Games; and the Tenants' Service Authority work with the Young Advisors' Charity to recruit young people to participate in their national structures for tenant voice. The Department for Communities and Local Government is also working with the Department for Education and the Office for Civil Society to support the National Citizen Service programme. The National Citizen Service programme is a key component of, and will seek to galvanise young people's interest in the Big Society. The programme is aimed at 16-year-olds and will be piloted in summer 2011 and will seek to develop a more cohesive, responsible and engaged society.</p>

	<p pid="c.36W.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-16">16 July 2010</phrase> Mr Justice Silber quashed the UK Border Agency's policy of giving less than 72 hours notice of removal in certain exceptional categories of persons being removed from the UK. This policy applied to all removals, including non-asylum removals, and was entirely different from the detained fast-track process which covers asylum decision making.</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.3/2">According to management information, the policy which was quashed by the court was applied 145 times between <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-12">12 March 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-21">21 May 2010</phrase>, when the policy was suspended by order of the court as an interim measure. We have broken this down by year as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="c.36W.3/5"> <td></td> <td><i> Number of children served removal directions with less than 72 hours notice</i></td> <td><i> Total number served removal directions with less than 72 hours notice (includes the children figures above)</i></td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.36W.3/13">We only have information on the number of cases where less than 72 hours notice of removal was given. We do not have information on how many of these cases were given less than 48 hours or 24 hours notice of removal. We do not have information on how many of these removees were failed asylum seekers.</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.3/14">Cases which would have been removed under this policy are being processed in alternative ways and are currently all being given at least 72 hours notice of removal. There are not any cases on hold pending the outcome of this litigation.</p>
	<p pid="c.36W.3/15">Those who were removed under the policy will have already exhausted any statutory rights of appeal against the UK Border Agency's decision not to grant leave and/or to remove before removal action was initiated. However, those being removed under the policy may apply for permission to seek judicial review of their removal directions or they may seek an injunction preventing removal from the court. In the 145 cases set out above, management information that we provided to the court shows that 11 removals were prevented from proceeding because an injunction was sought or obtained, a judicial review application was lodged or threatened, or further representations were submitted for consideration.</p>

	<p pid="c.38W.8/1">The Home Office did not keep a record of the number of neighbourhood policing teams that there were in 1997. While elements of neighbourhood policing were being practiced in 1997, it was not until 2003 that the Home Office began a National Reassurance Policing programme to pilot neighbourhood policing teams in their present form. The Home Office collected information on the number of neighbourhood policing teams until 2008. The last count, in September 2008 showed 3,603 teams. To reduce the burden of bureaucracy on forces, the Home Office no longer collects these data. The number of neighbourhood policing teams is an issue for individual police forces and authorities.</p>

The Scheme Actuary reviews employer contributions every four years. Following a full scheme valuation the rates for 2009-10 were in the range 16.7% to 24.3%. The employer contribution rates are set to meet the cost of the benefits accruing during the financial year when the member retires, and not the benefits paid during the period to existing pensioners.</p>

Total removals relates to all immigration offenders removed and includes total removals and voluntary departures from the United Kingdom. This includes both in country and port removals. This data was taken from published immigration statistics (http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration-asylum-stats.html).  <sup>(2 )</sup>The PQ asks for the number of failed asylum seekers that have been deported in each of the last five years. It is not possible to say what stage in the asylum process the returnees as a whole have reached at the time of their removal, including whether their claim has failed at that point, because those departing voluntarily can do so at any stage. For this reason we have interpreted this as the number of asylum cases, including dependants, removed and departing voluntarily from the UK.

These figures form part of the total number of non-asylum cases. Other cases that contribute to this figure include for example, administrative removal cases such as breach of employment restrictions. It should also be noted that Management Information has not been quality assured under National Statistics protocols and hence is subject to change. Statistics to be used publicly or for other Government Departments or agencies must be agreed with the Migration Statistics.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.45W.0/1">Use of restraint is governed by schedule 13 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 and specifically in relation to Immigration Removal Centres, by the Detention Centre Rules 2001.</p>
	<p pid="c.45W.0/2">In order to exercise any use of restraint, detention custody officers and escorts must be accredited by the Secretary of State, a condition of which is that they have undergone training of techniques approved by the National Offender Management Service.

In very exceptional circumstances, officers may be given authority to restrain a child in order to enforce their removal from the United Kingdom where every effort has been made to secure their compliance, but unfortunately they refuse to do so, often encouraged by their parents.</p>

	<p pid="c.51W.3/8">The UK Border Agency considered the points carefully before submitting the application. Many were for the local authority to address rather than the UK Border Agency or indeed the Ministry of Justice. The UK Border Agency has agreed to consider, subject to financial constraints, assisting in the improvement of the immediate area around the Centre as part of any new construction work but it has no influence over the local authority's decision making processes.</p>

A decision on whether to pursue an extension to Lindholme Immigration Removal Centre at this time is subject to approval of the application and the outcome of the Government's spending review in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="c.59W.5/1">The Home Department does not provide any direct funding to trade unions.</p>
	<p pid="c.59W.5/2">As part of the fulfilment of our legal responsibilities towards our trade union representatives we provide reasonable facility time and access to office space and equipment. We are unable to provide an estimate of the total value of these for the current year as this information is not centrally recorded and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.59W.5/3">Home Office headquarters employs approximately 3,000 staff and has 7.6 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff working full-time on trade union duties, assisted by 1.5 FTE staff providing administrative support. Almost all of these representatives and administrators also provide representation and support to around 23,000 staff working in the UK Border Agency.</p>
	<p pid="c.59W.5/4">There are a further 11 staff who undertake trade union duties on an ad hoc basis. These staff must seek prior authority from their line manager to undertake these duties. The Home Office provides clear guidance covering the circumstances in which staff who are acting as trade union representatives can claim facility time.</p>
	<p pid="c.59W.5/5">As facility time is not recorded centrally, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the equivalent numbers of days spent on trade union activities and duties in the ranges requested.</p>

We have also spent &#163;598.25 on posters explaining that passengers must have valid travel documents for themselves and any dependent children otherwise they face prosecution as set out in the Asylum and Immigration Act 2004.

	<p pid="c.72W.2/1">The Department for Work and Pensions presently communicates with customers by post, telephone, in person and increasingly via the internet. We provide official information in a range of formats, for example large print and Braille, so that elderly customers and those with specific accessibility needs are not disadvantaged. We also use specially trained telephony agents to communicate with deaf or hearing impaired customers who contact us using a text phone. Our literature is widely available in a range of public access areas (e.g. doctors' surgeries).</p>
	<p pid="c.72W.2/2">We are always seeking to improve accessibility of official communications. For example, our regular customer surveys ask how customers would prefer to be contacted and we are currently running a project that will help to improve the quality of our letters. In addition the design of the new state pension on-line service, which went live in March this year, was extensively tested with customers to ensure it meets the needs of older people. An enhanced version of the service is due to go live later this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.72W.2/3">We plan to signpost our customers to the benefits of internet use and to sources of help or support to get online. We recognise, however, that elderly people in particular make less use of the internet, so we will ensure that our plans do not introduce inequality and disadvantage.</p>

	<p pid="c.78W.2/2">For lone parents who are looking for work and have caring responsibilities for a disabled child, further support is offered under the provisions of the Childcare Act 2006.

	<p pid="c.78W.2/3">In recognition of the difficulties lone parents caring for disabled children may encounter in returning to work, regulations provide that lone parents on income support with a child aged 15 or under who have a child receiving the middle or higher care component of disability living allowance are not required to seek work in return for benefit. However, for those lone parents who wish to return to work, pre-employment and in-work support are available through specialist lone parent advisers in Jobcentre Plus.</p>

	<p pid="c.80W.2/1">No specific assessment has been made, but the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requires service providers not to discriminate against disabled people in the provision of their services, and to make reasonable adjustments where it would otherwise be impossible or unreasonably difficult for a disabled person to access the services being provided. A reasonable adjustment can include relaxing a ban on animals entering premises so that a guide dog user may access the services. The failure of a service provider to make a reasonable adjustment is a form of discrimination. If a disabled person considers that they have been discriminated against by a service provider, the Act provides for the person to be able to take enforcement action.</p>

	<p pid="c.83W.7/1">The June Budget announced that social security benefits, including disability living allowance and incapacity benefit, would rise in line with the consumer prices index from April 2011 onwards. Under the previous Administration's plans, last year's increase to disability living allowance was set to be clawed back, which would have meant a 1.5% reduction in the value of the awards. This Government will not implement this clawback.</p>
	<p pid="c.83W.7/2">The Budget also announced that we would be introducing a new, objective assessment for disability living allowance from 2013 to ensure support is targeted at those with in need. The impact will depend on the detailed design.</p>
	<p pid="c.83W.7/3">The old incapacity benefit system is coming to an end. Employment and support allowance (ESA) was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-27">27 October 2008</phrase> which replaced a range of incapacity benefits with immediate effect for customers making a new claim for financial support on the grounds of illness or incapacity. The reassessment of 1.5 million incapacity benefits customers will start in October 2010. The full reassessment programme will begin in spring 2011 and is expected to take three years to complete. No one migrating from their existing benefit to ESA will see a reduction in the level of their benefit entitlement at the point of change.</p>

	<p pid="c.90W.0/3">The need to increase pension savings by individuals is at the heart of the Government's commitment to introducing automatic enrolment into workplace pensions. The review is intended to ensure the way in which automatic enrolment is introduced strikes the right balance between costs, benefits and risks. The membership of the review team reflects this objective: Paul Johnson has wide experience of economic analysis and developing evidence-based public policy solutions, and David Yeandle and Adrian Boulding provide the review team with the expertise they need to understand what the reforms mean for employers and for the pensions industry. The review team is, of course, engaging with all relevant stakeholder interests through their meetings, the seminars and written submissions.</p>
	<p pid="c.90W.0/4">No engagement has been made with the European Commission on possible outcomes of the review.</p>

	<p pid="c.106W.7/2">Following the recent general election there has been an increase in the number of MPs from under-represented groups, including an increase in the number of women MPs and those from an ethnic minority background to 22% and 4% respectively. Numbers of disabled MPs and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender MPs are unknown, but we believe there is under-representation of these groups in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.106W.7/3">There is still more to do. That is why the Government are considering the recommendations by the Speaker's Conference on representation very carefully. We have already made an early commitment as part of our coalition agreement to introduce extra support for disabled people who want to become MPs, councillors or other elected officials.</p>
	<p pid="c.106W.7/4">The Equality Act will allow political parties to have selection arrangements for candidates, designed to reduce inequalities, including all women shortlists until the end of 2030. These Provisions will come in to force in October 2010 during the first wave of implementation of the Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.106W.7/5">The Government Equalities Office has commissioned research to understand the barriers faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people participating in civil society. This is looking at a broad range of ways to participate, including standing for Parliament. In light of the findings of the research, we will consider what further steps we can take to support lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people to participate visibly, including developing tools to support those who want to participate but are unsure how to.</p>
	<p pid="c.106W.7/6">I look forward to working closely with the Deputy Prime Minister to ensure that equality and diversity are at the heart of the constitutional reform agenda.</p>

	<p pid="c.124W.2/1">The number of prisoners who have gaming consoles in their cells is not held centrally and could be found only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.124W.2/2">Since <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-23">23 July 2008</phrase>, no public money has been used to purchase games consoles or games. A one-off survey in 2008 identified that at that time over 11,000 prisoners had games consoles in their possession. This figure has not been updated since then and there are no plans to do so now that no consoles are provided at public expense.</p>
	<p pid="c.124W.2/3">Only prisoners on the enhanced level of the Incentives and Earned Privileges scheme are allowed to have in possession or to use games consoles that have been purchased with their own money or given to them by family or friends. The current policy is set out in PSI 32/2008: Restricting Prisoner Access to Games Consoles which is available in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="c.124W.2/4">Access to in-cell television is one of the key earnable privileges of the Incentives and Earned Privileges scheme. PSO 4000 Incentives and Earned Privileges sets out the current policy and is available in the Libraries of both Houses. Prisoners pay a rental charge for their television sets. Prisoners who do not reach the standards of behaviour expected lose their right to in-cell television.</p>
	<p pid="c.124W.2/5">No prisoners have digital televisions sets in their cells. In line with the rest of the population, prisons are preparing for the switchover from analogue to digital broadcasting. In the 62 establishments where digital channels are available, and where prisoners have earned Standard or Enhanced Privileges under the IEP scheme, prisoners have access to nine free-to-view channels in-cell. These are BBC1, BBC2, ITV1, Channel 4, Channel 5, Sky News Sport (E4 in female prisons), ITV3. VIVA and Film 4. Governors have discretion to change any of these channels to other free-to-view channels if they wish.</p>
	<p pid="c.124W.2/6">In addition a number of prisoners have non-subscription set top boxes bought with their own money. However, in October 2006, public sector prisons were instructed that no new set top boxes were to be allowed as they will not operate with the digital head-end conversion system, although existing ones could remain until the digital equipment was installed.</p>
	<p pid="c.124W.2/7">No prisoners in public sector prisons have satellite television in their cells. It is available in association areas only in two public sector prisons. In contracted prisons, approximately 4,070 prisoners had access to satellite TV in their cells as of <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-10">10 December 2009</phrase>.</p>

This research produced inconclusive results, and highlighted the need to focus effort on developing more effective deterrents to prevent capture, such as acoustic devices.</p>
	<p pid="c.130W.6/4">The focus of our current research and monitoring is, therefore, to identify those fisheries responsible for high levels of cetacean by-catch, and to test acoustic deterrents that are effective at preventing cetacean bycatch in these fisheries. We are committed to finding an acoustic deterrent that is both safe for fishermen to use, and effective at deterring cetaceans from fishing gear, and eagerly await the results of this research, due in April next year.</p>

The original principles determining the basic pay of members of CNC (up to and including Chief Superintendent ranks) is that it is linked to the pay of corresponding members of the Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) which, in turn, is linked to that of Home Office Police taking account of the 95% weighting (i.e. MDP and CNC pay is set at 95% of Home Office Police force pay). Ranks above Chief Superintendent i.e. Chief Police Officer ranks have personally negotiated contracts that are aligned to Level 1.0 of the Police Negotiating Board agreed Chief Officer pay scales.</p>

	<p pid="c.132W.8/2">The CNPA was set up by the Energy Act 2004 and came into being in April 2005.

These plans will include the role of the CNC at the sites where they are deployed.</p>
	<p pid="c.132W.8/4">In addition, CNC is subject to inspection by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. The CNPA is responsible for setting the strategic direction of the CNC. Under the Energy Act 2004, it is required to publish a Strategic Policing Plan each year setting out the Police Authority's medium and long-term strategies for policing by the Constabulary during the three year period beginning with that year.

NCAs are bilateral treaties designed to enable collaborative working between companies and agencies in both states covering civil nuclear trade and information exchange. Detailed records of any assistance provided are not kept centrally except where export licences are involved.

	<p pid="c.145W.6/1">DECC has provided funding to Transition Towns and other community organisations over the last 12 months through the Low Carbon Communities Challenge (LCCC) and the Low Carbon Buildings Programme (LCBP).</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.6/2">LCCC is a-two-year DECC-funded research programme providing financial and practical support for 22 'test-bed' communities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to test delivery options for achieving ambitious cuts in carbon emissions at community level. The first selected projects were appointed in December 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.6/3">Of the 11 communities that have been provided with funding so far, seven are community based civil society organisations. One of these is Transition Town Totnes, which has been provided with &#163;625,000 to support their project. The other six civil society led organisations have been provided with a total of &#163;2,593,000 in funding for their projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.145W.6/4">The Low Carbon Buildings Programme-now closed to new applications-provides grants for installing microgeneration technologies and has provided funding for approximately 5,000 community-based projects over the last five years. In the financial year 2009-10, DECC provided &#163;20.58 million in funding through LCBP to projects such as housing associations, schools, churches, and other not-for-profit organisations, and the forecast expenditure for the financial year 2010-11 is &#163;53.41 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.146W.11/1">The Warm Front Scheme tackles fuel poverty, enabling households to keep their homes warm at an affordable cost. Warm Front has assisted over 2.2 million households since the scheme's inception in 2000. On average, each household which received assistance from the scheme has the potential to save over &#163;350 per annum during the lifetime of measures installed.</p>
	<p pid="c.146W.11/2">Household energy efficiency is measured using the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) which rates on a scale of 1 to 100-the higher the number the better the rating. Households assisted by Warm Front in 2009-10 increased their SAP rating on average from 33 to 66.</p>

During the same year, the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier project underwent independent assurance, which concluded that the project was progressing well and at a more mature stage of development than previous major naval projects prior to manufacture. Linked with this work was an independent financial review, which concluded the costs were robust. However, as reported in the National Audit Office's Major Projects Report 2009, the decisions taken in 2008 to delay the Queen Elizabeth class directly increased costs by an estimated &#163;674 million.</p>

The Army Welfare Service, Naval Personal and Family Service and Royal Marines Welfare, and RAF Community Support provide more focused support and ensure families are put in touch with, and supported by, the most appropriate agency.

	<p pid="c.160W.9/1">The departmental resource accounts are compiled in accordance with the Government Financial Reporting Manual ensuring compliance with international financial reporting standards as adapted for the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.9/2">The 2009-10 departmental resource accounts were qualified by the Comptroller and Auditor General because the Department has not complied with the new accounting requirements for determining whether a contract contains a lease and has therefore omitted a material value of assets and liabilities from the statement of financial position (previously known as the balance sheet).</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.9/3">The Department has assessed that the impact on the financial statements is likely to be material but the cost of the additional work exceeds the benefits of compliance. The number and complexity of existing contracts, together with likely difficulties in obtaining information required from third parties, would make compliance costly and time-consuming.</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.9/4">In order to move towards achieving compliance, the Department is applying the new accounting requirements to contracts agreed on or after <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>. However, given the length of some of the Department's existing contractual arrangements, it may be a number of years before compliance is achieved.</p>

	<p pid="c.167W.5/2">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) is currently reviewing its secondary legislation in two areas. Firstly, regulations governing the Service Pensions and Compensation Schemes are reviewed annually and updated where necessary. This includes implementing the recommendations of Admiral the Lord Boyce in his review of the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme laid before Parliament in February 2010. Also being reviewed are existing Defence byelaws and other local instruments in relation to land occupied for Defence purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.167W.5/3">Although regulations made by the MOD rarely impact on business, the reviews within these policy areas will be conducted in the spirit of this announcement, to ensure fairness and to provide clarity and consistency.</p>
	<p pid="c.167W.5/4">Finally, the 'Your Freedom' website launched by the Deputy Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-01">1 July 2010</phrase> will also give members of the public the opportunity to suggest existing regulations for removal, in order to reduce the regulatory burden.</p>

	<p pid="c.169W.2/1">Training and development is an integral part of the Ministry of Defence's core business whether it is providing essential job training for our civilians or training our armed forces in order to maintain a state of readiness to conduct operations in any part of the globe. In order to meet this requirement our armed forces personnel need to remain in a state of constant readiness. MOD addresses this requirement through what is known as phase training of which there are three stages.</p>
	<p pid="c.169W.2/2">Phase one training is basic military training carried out at a specialist site and will last approximately seven weeks.</p>
	<p pid="c.169W.2/3">Phase two training is specific job or trade training in the individual's choice of branch, for example pilot, engineer, medic etc. This training is again carried out at a specialist site and can take months or years to complete depending upon the branch trade.</p>
	<p pid="c.169W.2/4">Phase three is continuation training which service personnel undergo to increase their knowledge in a specialist area.</p>
	<p pid="c.169W.2/5">Annual information for each year dating back to 1997 along with a breakdown below departmental level is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.169W.2/6">However, MOD's estimated spend on training in financial year 2009-10 was &#163;3.3 billion. Of this, &#163;2.5 billion was spent on military training covering phases one to three. A further &#163;665 million was spent on other training requirements including recruitment, resettlement and cadet forces. Finally, &#163;189 million funded the Defence Academy which provides post graduate education and the majority of command, staff, leadership, management and specialist acquisition and technology training for members of the armed forces and MOD civil servants.</p>
	<p pid="c.169W.2/7">Most armed forces and civil service training is provided in house but some &#163;210 million is provided through external providers.</p>

	<p pid="c.182W.2/1">Over the past year, the Department for Transport has reviewed the vision standards for drivers, including the effectiveness of the number plate test. This review has been undertaken in conjunction with the experts on the Secretary of State's Honorary Medical Advisory Panel on Vision and Driving. The review concluded that the test remains an effective, straightforward means of testing visual acuity.</p>
	<p pid="c.182W.2/2">The number plate test is not just a test of acuity but also of ability to scan information accurately at a distance. The simplicity of the test enables drivers to check that their eyesight continues to meet the required standard throughout their driving career. It also allows the police to make a straightforward check if they are concerned that an individual is driving with defective eyesight.</p>

When a police officer attends the scene of a personal injury road accident they can report 'tyres illegal, defective or under inflated' as a contributory factor to the accident.

Not all reported road accidents are included in contributory factor analysis, only those where a police officer attended the scene and at least one contributory factor was reported.</p>

Looking at this higher consumption without the support that helped enable it may provide a misleading picture of the overall impacts.</p>

	<p pid="c.206W.9/1">Under EU VAT agreements, sporting services are exempt when supplied by certain non-profit making organisations, such as sports and leisure trusts and when supplied by members' clubs to their members. However, these services are taxable at the standard rate of VAT when supplied by local authorities and commercial organisations, and by members' clubs to persons who are not members.</p>

	<p pid="c.208W.10/1">All UK civilian funding in Afghanistan is aligned to strategic priorities and subject to a robust planning regime. A programme office, based in Kabul, oversees governance processes that monitor expenditure and reports progress. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's funding is made up of three categories: the Strategic Programme Fund, which supports the Government's most important international goals; the Bilateral Programme Budget, which is used to enhance bilateral relations between two countries; and the Conflict Pool, a tri-departmental pool created to enhance the effectiveness of the UK's contribution towards conflict prevention and management. The following tables give their total allocation figures for each year since 2002. This includes the total amount of the Conflict Pool available to the Ministry of Defence, the Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office as the pool is not divided into three parts but allocated on a project-by-project basis throughout the year to the three departments.</p>
	<p pid="c.208W.10/2">These programme funds do not, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office does not, directly administer aid to Afghanistan. Rather, these are funds available for development-related programmes and projects on or in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="c.209W.2/1">There is no one single piece of legislation covering the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1540, but a wide range of national UK legislation is compatible with our obligations under the Resolution. The Biological Weapons Act, Chemicals Weapons Act, the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act, the Export Control Act, are examples of some of the UK legislation in place that meet UNSCR 1540 requirements. Regulations are also in place covering the storage and transport of materials to ensure the UK is in compliance with international guidelines. In addition to this the UK has recently ratified both the International Convention on the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and the Amended Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. The UK is working with other international organisations such as the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, International Atomic Energy Agency, and through the G8 to promote UNSCR 1540 implementation and bi-laterally to assist countries with adherence.</p>

	<p pid="c.209W.5/1">Our embassy in Brasilia is closely following the proposed construction of dams in the Brazilian Amazon. As a rapidly developing economy, Brazil has many difficult decisions to make about how it can ensure that its development is as sustainable as possible, and not at the expense of Brazil's rainforests and the cultures and livelihoods of the indigenous peoples that live within them.</p>
	<p pid="c.209W.5/2">The Brazilian Environment Agency, IBAMA, is tasked with ensuring that construction processes comply with the environmental criteria set out in construction licences. These aim to minimise the impact of the construction and operation of the dams on the environment and on local communities.</p>

	<p pid="c.215W.3/2"><i> </i>Any calculation of the cost of the European External Action Service (EEAS) will necessarily be provisional until presentation of the EEAS draft budget, expected in mid-September 2010. We expect that the European Commission will issue an amending letter detailing the redistribution of expenditure. I will deposit this letter in Parliament. However, taking the most recent year for which actual figures are available, 2009, the total cost of the Commission and Council services which, according to provisional plans, will be transferred into the EEAS is in the order of &#8364;398.5 million. This figure does not represent the entire cost of the EEAS, which will also include seconded member state nationals, a part of the staff of the EU Special Representatives, and administrative costs which have not yet been fully laid out. This figure is based on the assumption (subject to some change as details are worked through) that the units that will move are:</p>
	<p pid="c.215W.3/3" class="indent">the Directorate-General for External Relations (DG Relex) (although not all staff in delegations);</p>
	<p pid="c.215W.3/4" class="indent">half of Directorate-General Development (including staff in delegations);</p>
	<p pid="c.215W.3/5" class="indent">half of the cost to DG Relex of delegations;</p>
	<p pid="c.215W.3/6" class="indent">12.5% of the non-building (ie staff and ancillary costs) of the Council Secretariat.</p>
	<p pid="c.215W.3/7">The costs of these four items for the last year for which we have actual figures of money spent, 2009, are: &#8364;11 million; &#8364;97.4 million; &#8364;128 million; and &#8364;59 million. This gives a combined total of &#8364;398.5 million.</p>

	<p pid="c.217W.6/1">The Iranian ballistic missile programme continues to be of serious proliferation concern because of their utility as weapons of mass destruction (WMD) delivery systems. Recent developments have greatly increased the range of the missiles and reduced the launch preparation time. This technology has facilitated the construction of a missile capable of delivering a payload both regionally and into western Europe, from Moscow to Greece.</p>
	<p pid="c.217W.6/2">The threat that Iran poses has been at the top of the counter-proliferation agenda, with the UK working with others on six UN Security Council Resolutions condemning Iran's activities. These have repeatedly called for the cessation of Iranian enrichment activity, transparency over its nuclear facilities and suspension of its long range ballistic missile programme. During the negotiations of these resolutions, we considered the threat posed by Iran's WMD and ballistic missile programme in its entirety, making it impossible to isolate individual conversations on the missile threat.</p>
	<p pid="c.217W.6/3">The UK rigorously imposes sanctions authorised by these resolutions, including embargoes on the supply of technology for the Iranian missile programme. Complementing this work is the UK membership of the Missile Technology Control Regime that maintains a watch-list on sensitive technology and materials for Iran.</p>

	<p pid="c.219W.8/1">The tri-departmental Conflict Pool and Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Bilateral programme funds support the Government's aim of reducing conflict in the middle east and North Africa region in order to help safeguard British national security. Our Conflict Prevention programmes in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories are jointly managed by the FCO, the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence. They work to improve the political environment in support of the peace process, including tackling difficult issues such as settlements and alleged human rights violations on both sides. Our Bilateral programme strengthens our relations with countries in the middle east and North Africa region. We work with both the Palestinian Authority to enhance their capacity for tackling violence and with Israeli institutions and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
	<p pid="c.219W.8/2">Many of the initiatives we support work to promote equality and human rights, build trust between communities, reduce violence inside the Occupied Palestinian Territories and advance peace. The NGOs we work with have helped to raise awareness of Israel's obligations under international law with regard to settlement activity and human rights violations. They also work to ensure due legal process is adhered to by Israeli authorities. Regular monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of all programmes is a requirement for all our funding commitments. Since we began supporting these programmes there have been a number of changes to Israeli civil and military judicial practice and decisions, and increased public debate on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.219W.8/3">A vibrant, independent and diverse civil society is one of Israel's great strengths and we believe that continuing British support will assist in strengthening democratic processes. By raising awareness and creating an environment where people are able to learn more about the situation and realities on the ground, the projects we support play a crucial role in creating sustainable conditions for peace.</p>

These figures represent the average number of truckloads that entered Gaza during the first five months of 2007, before Israel imposed severe access restrictions.

Gaza's population has also grown and fuel for the power station is now delivered by truck, rather than pipeline.</p>

Friend the Under-Secretary of State (Alistair Burt), shall remain engaged through discussions in the National Security Council until the conclusion of the review.</p>

	<p pid="c.226W.5/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) currently uses two contracts with private hire taxi companies: Addison Lee, covering the London area; and Raffles Taxis, covering the Milton Keynes area. Both contracts are used for both FCO departmental usage, and FCO Services. As FCO Services has been an independent trading fund since <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>, their expenditure is recorded and shown separately since that date. The following table shows the breakdown of costs by year.</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.5/2">FCO staff travel by the most efficient means of transport, bearing in mind the operational requirement and the need to secure value for money for the public purse. Public transport is used whenever possible and staff avoid using taxis on official business unless it is absolutely necessary. Expenditure is now closely monitored and as a result expenditure in financial year 2009-10 has shown a decrease.</p>
	<p pid="c.226W.5/3">Staff should not normally use a taxi at public expense between home and office-nor between airports and central London-except for journeys during the hours when public transport is not running. If it is absolutely necessary for staff to work after 9 pm or before 7 am, they may consider taking a taxi from their destination station to their home address or vice versa.</p>

	<p pid="c.228W.5/1">We do not hold data going back to 1997 on the number of days Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) staff spent on trade union activities. Since 2005 however, there have been 9.5 full-time equivalent staff in the FCO and FCO Services elected by FCO union members, each financial year to represent members. This equates to 0.2% of the Department's overall whole time equivalent staffing headcount. The FCO also allows up to 25 days time off for staff elected to the branch executive committees of their unions to engage in union activities. Actual time taken is not recorded centrally and is at the discretion of line management. We currently have 33 volunteer members of staff who are branch committee members.</p>
	<p pid="c.228W.5/2">The amount of trade union facility time allowed in the FCO is in compliance with the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 and the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) code of practice 'Time off for trade union duties and activities'.</p>

Due to organisational changes Peterborough Hospital NHS Trust may not directly map to Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and therefore caution should be taken when comparing the figures before and after 2004 as data may not be directly comparable.<br/>  2. Alcohol-related admissions.<br/>  The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO), which uses 48 indicators for alcohol-related illnesses, determining the proportion of a wide range of diseases and injuries that can be partly attributed to alcohol as well as those that are, by definition, wholly attributable to alcohol. Further information on these proportions can be found at<br/>  http://www.nwph.net/nwpho/publications/AlcoholAttributableFractions.pdf<br/> 3. The application of the NWPHO methodology has recently been updated and is now available directly from HES. As such, information about episodes estimated to be alcohol related may be slightly different from previously published data.<br/>  4. Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis.<br/> These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a HES record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br/>  5. Data quality.<br/>  HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="c.230W.0/18"> <td colspan="3">6. Assessing growth through time.<br/>  HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.233W.2/15">We know that the prognosis for children diagnosed with osteosarcoma is significantly better if the cancer is found early and has not spread from the bone to other parts of the body. In 2005, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published &quot;Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer&quot;, to help general practitioners (GPs) refer patients with suspected cancers more quickly. The guidance includes a section focusing on children and young people with bone cancers, including osteosarcoma. The guidance can be found at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="c.233W.2/17">Cancer survival rates are improving for many cancers, and patients' experience of their care has improved. However, we believe more needs to be done. It is now generally agreed that the most important reasons for lower survival rates in England, compared with other European countries, are low public awareness of the signs and symptoms of cancer, delays in people presenting to their GPs, and patients having more advanced disease at diagnosis. We will be looking carefully at how best to achieve earlier diagnosis.</p>

A range of methods are used such as tracking (reporting monthly), bespoke surveys, web statistics (monthly) and buzz monitoring (regular reporting) to measure awareness of both the campaign overall and specific activities taking place at a national and local level as part of Change4Life campaign activity.</p>

The Department is working with the NHS Information Centre to develop an audit of the prescribing of anti-psychotics for people with dementia. The audit will be a key mechanism for measuring the reduction in the use of anti-psychotic drugs.</p>

There have been widespread variations in the size and population coverage of primary care trusts (PCTs), which are currently responsible for commissioning national health service healthcare services, and there is no evidence to suggest a single 'right' size.

	<p pid="c.262W.14/1">The High Impact Action (HIA), &quot;Keeping Patients Nourished&quot; was launched last year. This work, which is led by the chief nurses from the 10 strategic health authorities with input from various partner organisations including the Department, identified that keeping patients nourished, especially older people, was a priority area of care upon which nurses and midwives could facilitate progress. Support materials have been made available to help nurses deliver this HIA.</p>
	<p pid="c.262W.14/2">There is also the &quot;Better Hospital Food Programme&quot;, which focuses on consistent delivery of high quality food served to patients.</p>

	<p pid="c.264W.0/2">The reason it will not apply to mental health trusts is that we are implementing a payment system for mental health services in 2012-13 that covers both in-patient and community care.

As it is advisory guidance, we would expect the national health service to have regard to it, but we do not monitor compliance.

A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record. Note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure. For example, patients under-going a 'cataract operation' would tend to have at least two procedures-removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one-counted in a single episode. Operations have been defined using the following codes:<br/> Heart Procedures and Interventions OPCS K01-K78<br/> All Procedures and Interventions 2008-09 OPCS 4.4 - A01-O10, O15-X97, 1996-97 OPCS 4.2 A01 - X59<br/> <sup>(3)</sup> Assessing growth through time<br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.<br/> <i> Note:</i><br/> It should be noted that the count of 'heart procedures and interventions' cannot be subtracted from the count of 'all procedures and interventions' to get a count of 'other non-heart procedures and interventions' as some patients will have a heart and non-heart procedure in the same episode of care.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.272W.3/1">The most recently available estimate for deaths in England related to pandemic influenza A (H1N1) was 363. A confirmed death was defined as related to pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza if recorded on any part of the death certificate or confirmed on laboratory testing, either before or after death. This number therefore includes deaths where influenza A (H1N1) was the primary cause or a contributory factor.</p>
	<p pid="c.272W.3/2">In December 2009 an analysis of available data from death certificates was performed. The resulting paper was co-authored by England's Chief Medical Officer and published in the <i> British Medical Journal</i> (BMJ) on <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-10">10 December 2009</phrase>. Of the 138 deaths recorded by that date, pandemic A/H1N1 was shown to have led directly to death (part one of the death certificate) in 74 cases, and recorded as contributing to death in 23 cases (part two of the death certificate). Another 30 positive (microbiological) tests for pandemic A/H1N1 had not been recorded on death certificates, while 11 death certificates were still to be issued in cases where a positive test had been found. Re-analysis of death certificates has not been performed since this time and it is therefore not possible to provide any updated estimates. It would be expected that these proportions would remain roughly similar when applied to the larger deaths cohort. The figures and full analysis can be found on the BMJ website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.275W.2/1">The Department does not collect specific data on the achievement of goals agreed through the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) framework. Assessing and rewarding achievement of both locally and nationally defined CQUIN goals is the responsibility of local commissioners as part of their contractual relationship with providers. However, in 2010-11 providers must demonstrate achievement of the national CQUIN goal on reducing venous-thromboembolism (VTE) through a national data collection on VTE risk assessment, which started in June 2010. Providers are required to submit their first data return for June no later than <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-28">28 July 2010</phrase>. We will be reviewing the quality of this data with a view to later publication.</p>
	<p pid="c.275W.2/2">For the national CQUIN goal on VTE, the period over which commissioners will assess achievement during 2010-11 is a matter for local negotiation between commissioners and providers, although published guidance states that achievement of the 90% must be over at least a full quarter to earn the related CQUIN payment. From the CQUIN schemes the Department has seen so far, it seems that many providers are aiming to achieve the goal during the last quarter of 2010-11.</p>

	<p pid="c.289W.2/2">Estimates of the number and proportion of children living in poverty are published in the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) series. HBAI uses household income adjusted (or &quot;equivalised&quot;) for household size and composition, to provide a proxy for standard of living.</p>
	<p pid="c.289W.2/3">As they are based on survey data, child poverty estimates published in HBAI only allow breakdowns to Government office region and analysis by parliamentary constituency is not possible. However, figures for East of England are set out in the following table.</p>

Three survey years have been combined as regional single year estimates are subject to volatility. 4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &quot;Households Below Average Income&quot; (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &quot;equivalised&quot;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living. 5. For the Households Below Average Income series, incomes have been equivalised using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) modified equivalisation factors. 6. Numbers of adults and children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000. <i> Source: </i>Households Below Average Income, DWP.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.289W.2/12">Measures of income poverty at constituency level are available with National Indicator 116. This indicator shows the number and proportion of children living in families in receipt of child tax credit whose reported income is less than 60% of the median income or in receipt of income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="c.289W.2/13">Due to methodological differences to the HBAI publication, these small area estimates are not directly comparable with national or regional figures. Nl 116 does not necessarily capture all those, or only those, children living in households below the 60% of median threshold.</p>

	<p pid="c.289W.2/16">Income measures do not necessarily capture all aspects of poverty or inequality facing children and their families and the Government are committed to tackling the causes of poverty and not just treating the symptoms. We must tackle the root causes of how people get trapped in poverty, breaking the cycle of disadvantage and dependency culture to stimulate social mobility.</p>
	<p pid="c.289W.2/17">Frank Field has been asked to lead an independent review of poverty and life chances including examining the case for reforms to poverty measures, in particular for the inclusion of non-financial elements. The review will explore whether there are measures that can improve the way poverty is tackled, ensuring we focus on the root causes and the paths into poverty as well as looking at the non-financial side.</p>

The Government's constitutional reform agenda was also discussed in July at the inter-governmental senior officials' forum which supports the JMC. We will continue to work collaboratively with the devolved Administrations and the forward work programme for the JMC and JMC (Domestic) will be the subject of discussion by ministers collectively at the first meeting of JMC (Domestic) in the autumn.

EROs appointed by district or borough councils in two tier local authority areas may therefore not have access to records held by county councils, including data held by social services and education departments. The Government have announced their intention to speed up the implementation of individual electoral registration in Great Britain and any consideration of further legislation relating to registration will be in that context.</p>

The Government have no intention of dictating the size of a future Assembly but in the absence of any decision by the Assembly we do not intend to make specific provision in relation to the Northern Ireland Assembly in this Bill. As a result the existing legislative framework would provide for a reduced Assembly by the time of the 2015 election.

	<p pid="c.330W.2/4">The estimated value of the contracts awarded to businesses in the North West of England is &#163;96,156,682, the figure for businesses in the North East of England is &#163;9,457,409 and in Yorkshire and the Humber it is &#163;65,069,036. Of the Yorkshire and the Humber figure, &#163;18,357,494 worth of contracts has been awarded to businesses in Leeds. These figures represent the committed spend to date, rather than the end contract value, as in many cases this will not yet be known. These figures only account for the contracts awarded by the ODA to its own top tier of contractors (tier one contractors). The figures do not include the values of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided. The ODA estimates that overall up to 50,000 contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains.</p>

	<p pid="c.330W.5/1">Data from the Olympic Delivery Authority's eTendering system, covering procurements with an estimated value in excess of &#163;25,000, show that a total of 4,142 tenders were received February 2007 to the end of June 2010. 27 tenders were received from businesses registered in Scotland, of these one was from a business registered in South Lanarkshire, in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.330W.5/2">The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) was established in April 2006 and set up its eTendering system in February 2007. Tenders under &#163;25,000 are not tracked through the ODA's central procurement system. To establish where firms are based for tenders before February 2007 or under &#163;25,000 would incur disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid="c.330W.5/3">The ODA now shares its eTendering system with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic games (LOCOG) and its major contractors. The ODA has advised that it is not possible to provide information that distinguishes applications for contracts between these organisations; the data that it has provided therefore includes responses to invitations to tenders raised by those other organisations in addition to the responses to the ODA.</p>
	<p pid="c.330W.5/4">The value of contracts awarded by the ODA to businesses in Scotland to date is &#163;22,200,816. Of this &#163;1,798,874 has gone to businesses in South Lanarkshire, in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.330W.5/5">The ODA is unable to release the value of individual contracts at this time as this is commercially sensitive information. These figures only account for the contracts awarded by the ODA's to its own top tier of contractors (tier one contractors). These values represent the sums that the ODA has spent to date, rather than the end contract value, as the end contract value in many cases will not yet be known. The location of each business is determined by its registered address. The figures do not include the values of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA.</p>
	<p pid="c.330W.5/6">Information on businesses that have directly supplied the ODA is available in the business section of the London 2012 website under the heading ODA Suppliers, where you will be able to find suppliers listed by venue and sector:</p>

In England libraries are already providing drop-in sessions with health professionals or local police officers. In some authorities libraries are selling parking permits or renewing travel passes, providing links to employment opportunities and taking council tax payments. These connections can have positive benefits for communities and can increase efficiencies within authorities.</p>

The recently announced Regional Growth Fund, worth &#163;1 billion, will provide an important resource in this regard.

The report will seek to consider how much money may be left abandoned in betting accounts and the value of unclaimed winning tickets. The hon.

He expects to present his findings, along with a possible proposal of new legislation, to me by the end of the year.</p>

(Employees and recipients of services are additionally protected in relation to the characteristics of age and marriage/civil partnership.)</p>

Including academies on the list of public authorities in Schedule 19 means that academies will also be subject to the public sector duties set out in Part 11 of the Equality Act, when they come into force in April 2011.</p>

It will consist of a grant to meet VAT costs, and a grant in lieu of certain local authority (LA) services. The VAT grant is calculated by using historical data on schools' expenditure to derive a typical proportion of spend that attracts VAT. The grant in lieu of LA services is calculated by dividing LA spend on those services by the relevant number of pupils in the local authority to derive a per-pupil sum.

The review announced by the Department on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-05">5 July 2010</phrase> will make recommendations to help shape the design of future capital investment in schools; to ensure that future capital investment represents good value for money and strongly supports the Government's ambitions to reduce the deficit, raise standards and tackle disadvantage.</p>

It will be for Birmingham local authority to consider the need for savings across all areas of its expenditure, regardless of whether the initial source of funding is formula or area based, taking account of statutory responsibilities, local priorities and of the Government's commitment to protecting front line services wherever possible.

	<p pid="c.359W.2/1">At present there is no national Government subsidy for employers of any size when they recruit an apprentice. I recognise the attraction of such a policy but in the context of the current fiscal climate we need to be cautious and ensure that we secure the best possible value for our apprenticeship funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.359W.2/2">Earlier this year the National Apprenticeship Service ran the Apprenticeship Grant for Employers, a time-limited initiative which gave 5,000 SMEs a subsidy of &#163;2,500 for recruitment of a 16 or 17 year-old apprentice. We will want to consider the evaluation of this initiative carefully before making any decisions about future subsidies for SMEs.</p>
	<p pid="c.359W.2/3">However, Government do fully fund the training costs for 16-18 year old apprentices, and makes a significant contribution towards the training costs for adult apprentices.</p>

	<p pid="c.371W.3/2">However, public libraries have been embracing their digital role and helping people navigate through digital as well as printed information for many years. 79% of library services in England provide free internet access and a further 12% charge nothing for the first hour (91% of the total). The availability of this low cost internet access in every community will be vital to Race Online's mission to build a UK of near-universal web literacy by the time of the Olympics and get everyone of working-age online by the end of this Parliament.</p>

Similarly, BIS estimate that around one million jobs have had their pay increased each year because of annual upratings of the National Minimum Wage (NMW).</p>
	<p pid="c.372W.8/2">It is not possible to add up the number of potential beneficiaries of the NMW over the years since its implementation because consecutive years' figures may include many of the same people. However, over time people move in and out of jobs and progress up the pay scale so new individuals will be affected by the NMW every year. Therefore the total number of people to have benefited from an increase in wages due to upratings in the NMW since 1999 is likely to considerably exceed one million.</p>

A new European Regulation which comes fully into force in July 2013 will require all new cosmetic products to be notified to the European Commission six months prior to being placed on the market and this notification will include a section on nanoparticles. The report shall include the identification of the nanomaterial, the size of particles, physical and chemical properties; an estimate of the quantity of nanomaterial intended to be placed on the market per year; the toxicological profile and the safety data foreseeable exposure conditions relating to the category of cosmetic product.</p>

	<p pid="c.376W.2/1">The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) continues to promote innovation by providing a clear, accessible and widely understood Intellectual Property (IP) framework so that creators, users and consumers can benefit from knowledge and ideas. The IPO supports industry by granting robust IP rights and further through business support activities such as IP education programmes.</p>
	<p pid="c.376W.2/2">The Strategic Advisory Board for Intellectual Property Policy (SABIP) which was formally established on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-02">2 June 2008</phrase> provided Government with independent, strategic, evidence based advice on IP. Following the decision to dissolve SABIP, the sponsoring agency, the IPO, consolidated key IPO and SABIP research into one programme. The combined work is designed to bring together existing sources of data on IP rights, linking them to economic data to develop a definitive information base with direct relevance to policy evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="c.376W.2/3">During 2010/11 this evidence will be used to answer the following questions:</p>
	<p pid="c.376W.2/4" class="indent">How much does UK industry spend creating IP protected by IPRs, and what does this investment deliver?</p>
	<p pid="c.376W.2/5" class="indent">How big is investment in the copyright economy, who earns what from it and how are value chains affected by digital media?</p>
	<p pid="c.376W.2/6" class="indent">Do patents add value to R&amp;D-how much, and in which industries/markets?</p>
	<p pid="c.376W.2/7" class="indent">Which firms make money out of IP and innovation without patents, and how?</p>
	<p pid="c.376W.2/8" class="indent">Do trademarks help innovation and growth-and which firms win from branding?</p>
	<p pid="c.376W.2/9" class="indent">Why is UK design a major success despite using few registered rights?</p>
	<p pid="c.376W.2/10" class="indent">Are EU copyright levies a useful reward system or distortion of the market?</p>
	<p pid="c.376W.2/11" class="indent">Can patent markets create depth and transparency to benefit innovators?</p>
	<p pid="c.376W.2/12">Research partners will help the IPO bring together data on business use of IP rights, innovation and business performance, creating a knowledge base that other researchers and policy analysts will be able to access, use and develop. All the research reports will be published. I do not intend to make any further statements.</p>

	<p pid="c.378W.0/1">In 'A Strategy for Sustainable Growth', published by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in July, the Government state that, by strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals and providing a strong framework for business and growth, it aims to increase productivity through skills, innovation, ICT diffusion and new firm start-ups. We are in the process of further developing this strategy to improve the UK's performance.</p>
	<p pid="c.378W.0/2">We want to build an internationally competitive skills base. We have already begun the process of reforming the further education and skills system by refocusing funding on 50,000 extra apprenticeship places, and putting measures in place to free colleges and training organisations from unnecessary bureaucracy. But we want to go further, to redesign the system so it places power and responsibility in the hands of learners and employers, and supports the vision for a &quot;Big Society&quot;. We are therefore consulting on the future direction of skills policy, including how to measure how well employers and the skills system are progressing in meeting our priorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.378W.0/3">On productivity, between 1998 and 2008, the UK closed the productivity (as measured by output per worker) gap with Germany and narrowed the gap with France, and broadly kept pace with the US. Over the same period, the gap in productivity in terms of output per hour worked has also narrowed with Germany, though remained broadly unchanged with both France and the US.</p>
	<p pid="c.378W.0/4">On employment, the latest comparable data (2009) shows the UK's employment rate is 70.6% compared with an OECD average of 64.8% in 2009. We seek to support a flexible labour market. We also recognise the continuing need to provide strong employment support to those that are out of work.</p>
