We provided &pound;150,000 through Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) during the last ebola outbreak in the Congo in February 2002. The current death toll from the latest outbreak is 75, but WHO believes the situation is now under control. The Government of Congo has made available $68,000 to deploy medical teams, and the national authorities are being supported by a team of 10 WHO epidemiologists, medical anthropologists and social mobilisation experts. The Congolese Red Cross are working on raising public health awareness and social mobilisation and an appeal was recently launched. WHO has established isolation wards which have helped to contain the disease: most of the people who became infected have now unfortunately died. My Department will continue to monitor the situation in close collaboration with WHO, the Red Cross and MSF.</p>
	<p pid=".732W.9/2">My Department has not received any reports that the recent ebola outbreak has spread to neighbouring Gabon. The Gabonese authorities have responded swiftly to this latest outbreak of the virus by closing the Gabon-Congo border in the north-east of the country and has sent a team of experts from the Health Ministry and the Medical Research International Centre in Franceville to the two areas, near the border with Congo, where there was an outbreak last year. Guidelines have been issued to locals asking them not to touch dead animals in the forest, or those with an unusual behaviour (primates are often carriers of the ebola virus), as well as reporting any suspected cases of ebola to the authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".734W.9/1">The Attorney-General and I have been actively looking at the current operation of the law on provocation as a partial defence to murder and have discussed the issues with the DPP. The DPP has sought the views of Chief Crown Prosecutors as to whether recent developments in the law, in particular the decision of the House of Lords in R v Smith (Morgan) has had an effect on the prosecution of cases on the ground.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.9/2">We have also had discussions with the DPP on the issue of the acceptance of pleas to manslaughter by reason of provocation and the DPP intends to issue guidance to prosecutors which emphasises that only in exceptional circumstances should the issue whether or not an offender was provoked not be put before the jury.</p>
	<p pid=".734W.9/3">As Law Officers we have also considered the defence of provocation in the exercise of our power to refer a sentence to the Court of Appeal by virtue of section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 on the grounds that the sentence was unduly lenient. In 2002 the Law Officers referred two cases of the manslaughter of women by their partners by reason of provocation arising out of jealousy and unfaithfulness to the Court of Appeal, arguing that the current sentencing tariff does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offences and is out of line with levels of sentencing in other cases of homicide and serious violence. The Court of Appeal indicated that it would be inappropriate to lay down guidelines in this difficult area without the Sentencing Advisory Panel having first been involved. It is too soon to say what the outcome in this area of the law will be. In addition, the Government has given a commitment to publish a consultation paper on domestic violence in the spring.</p>

However grant aid is not provided for defences to protect proposed new development, although it is possible for such development to benefit incidentally by defence schemes designed to protect existing assets. In such cases, authorities are expected to seek a commensurate contribution from the developer to the extent that he benefits from the public investment. No specific provision for new development has been made therefore, either by the EA or Defra. It should be noted that many of these developments, for example the Thames Gateway, will be defended to a high standard by existing defences which would anyway be subject to a renewal programme.</p>

It will help schools work together and support each other and will be based on local demand not national imposition.

	<p pid=".753W.2/1">Maternity benefits are being improved as part of the Government's drive to help pregnant women and parents financially and to achieve a better balance between their work and home lives.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.2/2">In order to qualify for statutory maternity pay a woman must have average weekly earnings that at least equal the lower earnings limit for National Insurance contributions. The lower earnings limit is currently &pound;75 a week. An average is taken of the gross earnings actually paid to a woman in an eight week period running up to the 15th week before the week baby is due. The period used may vary slightly depending on the woman's own pay period.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.2/3">Maternity Allowance is available for those women who do not qualify for SMP. From this April we are changing the earnings calculation, so that women will be able to choose the 13 weeks that reflect her best earnings during the test period (the 66 weeks up to the week before the week her baby is expected). This change will, of course, be beneficial to those with part year earnings. It will mean that women's entitlement to Maternity Allowance is maximised so that more will qualify for the standard rate.</p>

	<p pid=".755W.2/1">Jobseeker's Allowance is paid to support people who are out of work and actively seeking employment. People who are in remunerative work, i.e. averaging 16 hours or more per week, are not entitled to Jobseeker's Allowance.</p>
	<p pid=".755W.2/2">For term-time workers the average number of hours they work is calculated over the whole academic year, including the school holidays. If this average is less than 16 hours a week then they may be entitled to Jobseeker's Allowance. This calculation would apply if an application was made during term-time or during the vacation period. We have no plans to change the rules on remunerative work.</p>
	<p pid=".755W.2/3">The National Minimum Wage has to be paid for every hour worked, averaged over the pay reference period, to most people who work in the UK. The calculation to determine if a person is receiving the National Minimum Wage depends on whether the worker is a time worker or a salaried-hours worker.</p>
	<p pid=".755W.2/4">If the term-time worker is paid a set amount at regular periods (i.e weekly or monthly) throughout the year regardless of whether they have actually worked during that period then they are a salaried worker. For salaried work, the contract between the employer and the worker must set out a basic number of hours for which the worker must be paid at least the minimum wage. If the salaried worker works any hours in excess of their contract, then the National Minimum Wage will also apply to those additional hours.</p>

	<p pid=".759W.4/1">It is clear that the child care tax credit is removing an important barrier to work by making child care more affordable. According to the Repeat Survey of Parent's Demand for Childcare, around a quarter of respondents said that the impact of the child care tax credit had an effect on the number of hours they worked; and of those, 80 per cent. said that they had increased their hours. Recent data suggests that among families in receipt of WFTC and using eligible child care, around 85 per cent. claim the child care tax credit. Among lone parents receiving WFTC the figure is higher still, with over 90 per cent. of lone parents who receive WFTC and use eligible child care claiming the child care tax credit. The majority of claims for child care tax credit come from lone parents, for whom child care costs can represent one of the biggest barriers to making work pay.</p>

CTS is built on a combination of scanning, workflow and document management technology. It will allow all incoming correspondence addressed to Ministers or to the Home Office to be scanned on arrival and transmitted around the department electronically. Its use will ensure that no piece of correspondence ever gets mislaid or delayed in the internal mail, and will enable progress to be monitored at all stages of the process.</p>

The public correspondence module will roll out approximately six weeks later, and the e-mail module approximately four weeks after that. A scoping study is currently under way in IND to establish timescales for the roll out of CIS there.</p>

	<p pid=".764W.2/2">The sentencing provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill will make it possible to ensure that the most serious violent, sexual and persistent offenders spend longer in prison while allowing other offenders to be dealt with by means of tougher and more effective community sentences. Current projections indicate that the long-term net effect of implementation of these provisions will be a small increase of about 1,000 in the prison population.</p>
	<p pid=".764W.2/3">The proposal contained in the Bill in relation to retrial for serious offences would only permit a retrial in cases where new and compelling evidence subsequently came to light. Furthermore, to prevent the possible harassment of acquitted persons or where it is not in the public interest, the personal consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions will be required to the re-opening of investigation and an application to the Court of Appeal. Given these safeguards it is estimated that only a very small number of cases are likely to be retried each year and that the impact upon the prison population will be negligible.</p>

However, based on research conducted by the Office for National Statistics, the Service estimates that 18,000 prisoners each year would benefit potentially from participation in a rehabilitation programme. The length of treatment courses serves to restrict access to those sentenced to two years or more.</p>

	<p pid=".765W.5/2">Considerable progress has been made in ensuring that interventions with offenders are soundly based on the What Works evidence and are effective in reducing re-offending. A joint prison/probation assessment system (OASys) is being rolled out. We have introduced a range of accredited offending behaviour programmes covering both general offending and specialised areas such as drug abuse and sexual offences.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.5/3">Work is also progressing on the reintegration of offenders into society by addressing factors such as literacy, numeracy, employment and accommodation; and a system of Enhanced Community Punishment is being introduced this year. An intensive scheme collaborating with police surveillance is being developed in the community for young adult offenders between 18 and 20 years of age.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.5/4">The Youth Justice Board is also taking forward What Works initiative. It is producing a series of Effective Practice Guidance Notes, and is introducing a quality assurance process within Youth Offending Teams.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.5/5">Overall, our aim is to reduce re-offending by 5 per cent. by 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".765W.9/2">Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder with a prevalence of approximately one in 5,000 people. It is associated with liver disease among children and lung disease among adults between approximately 30&ndash;50. We do not hold data centrally on the number of patients being treated.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.9/3">While no specific guidelines have been issued by the Department of Health, the British Thoracic Society's 1997 Thorax guidelines advised general practitioners that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) sufferers under 40 should be referred for a specialist opinion to identify an alpha-antitrypsin deficiency and to consider therapy and family screening. Alpha-antitrypsin deficiency is the most common inherited liver disease in babies and children and it is accepted clinical practice to test for this condition.</p>
	<p pid=".765W.9/4">Both liver and lung disease may present with a wide variety of symptoms. The main signs are jaundice in respect of liver disease and shortness of breath and cough for lung disease.</p>

	<p pid=".769W.5/1">It is for National Health Service trusts to determine their local hospital waste contract requirements and specifications, and fulfil all statutory and legal obligations. However, a significant amount of guidance on clinical waste management and disposal is available to the NHS. The Health and Safety Commission guidance, Safe disposal of clinical waste, states:</p>
	<p pid=".769W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;Identifiable human tissue is clinical waste unless it has been rendered safe and non-infectious. After treatment, identifiable human tissue remains an offensive waste. It therefore needs to be dealt with by an authorised waste handling facility. The only appropriate treatment for identifiable human tissue is incineration.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".769W.5/3">Human tissue has to be disposed of by incineration. Not all waste disposal facilities are licensed or have the appropriate disposal technology to dispose of human tissue. Those companies who only operate alternative non-burn technology plant and facilities are required to sub-contract human tissue clinical waste to other facilities for incineration.</p>
	<p pid=".769W.5/4">Human tissue is not dealt with under a separate contract but clearly, where non-burn solutions are used for the bulk of the waste, it does require a separate logistical approach. In England, the main clinical waste disposal companies are:</p>

	<p pid=".769W.5/23">Since the introduction of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the loss of Crown Immunity in 1991, the NHS has moved away from disposing of its own waste to contracting out that service to the private sector.

	<p pid=".770W.2/1">Guidance about the possible side effects associated with taking the morning-after pill or emergency contraceptive, Levonelle, is routinely provided in the patient information leaflet included with this medicine.

	<p pid=".770W.2/2">Pharmacists are supplied with a 'Protocol' that contains a checklist of advice that should be given to each woman when she is given Levonelle. This protocol includes the need to inform women of the most common side effects that may occur.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/3">Information about potential side effects of Levonelle has most recently been provided in the Chief Medical Officer's (CMO) newsletter, CMO Update, which is available through the Medicines Control Agency (MCA)/CMO websites.</p>
	<p pid=".770W.2/4">As with all licensed medicines, the safety of Levonelle is continuously monitored by the MCA, with independent expert advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines. In the event of any important new safety information emerging, the MCA will take action to ensure that this is accurately reflected in the product information and communicated to health professionals and women using the product.</p>

	<p pid=".772W.11/1">The sexual health and HIV strategy recommends that there are a number of service elements for sexual health care that current good practice acknowledges should be available in every general practice setting. These elements include sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing for women and assessment and referral of men with STI symptoms. However we do recognise that these service elements are not available everywhere at present and that development will be gradual. The development of non-invasive STI tests will extend the elements that can be provided in primary care.</p>

The Department is funding a conference being organised by the RCGP and the Royal College of Nurses to take forward a co-ordinated approach to the teaching and accreditation of sexual health skills for primary care. The RCGP will be publishing guidelines for general practitioners on primary care provision of recommended service elements for sexual health later this year.</p>
