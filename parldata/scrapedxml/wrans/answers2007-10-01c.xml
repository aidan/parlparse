	<p pid="c.2339W.11/2">The Department receives few direct complaints from airline passengers. This is because the Air Transport Users' Council (AUC) is the passenger complaints body in the UK for airline services.</p>
	<p pid="c.2339W.11/3">Figures from the AUC show that in the last six months it received some 3361 written complaints. Of these 234 related to lost or delayed baggage.</p>
	<p pid="c.2339W.11/4">Passenger rights in respect of the loss, damage or delay to baggage are protected by international legislation. Under the 1999 Montreal Convention which came into force for the UK in June 2004 the carrier is prima facie liable for luggage that has been delayed, damaged or lost (unless the carrier can establish a defence under the Convention). The liability for delay, loss or damage to baggage is limited to 1,000 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) - approximately &pound;820. These are maximum limits. Claims are assessed individually.</p>

	<p pid="c.2340W.2/2">Due to small sample sizes at the level of disaggregation requested, data from several survey years have been combined to produce more reliable estimates.</p>
	<p pid="c.2340W.2/3">In 2006 a weighting strategy was introduced to the NTS to improve the reliability of the data. This weighting methodology has been applied to data back to 1995 so figures for earlier years are not directly comparable with data for 1995 onwards.</p>

	<p pid="c.2344W.5/2"><i> </i>The recently commenced review of the Shoreline Management Plan, which is being led by Bournemouth borough council in conjunction with the Environment Agency, will consider long term management of flood and coastal erosion risk along this length of coast.</p>
	<p pid="c.2344W.5/3">A Strategic Flood Risk Assessment for Bournemouth borough council, Christchurch borough council, East Dorset district council, North Dorset district council and Salisbury district council is also underway. This will investigate and identify the extent and severity of flood risk to Bournemouth to enable the council to steer development away from those areas at highest risk; supplement current policy guidelines and provide a clear risk based approach to development control; and, contribute to the evidence base for the Local Development Framework and Sustainability Appraisal work.</p>

	<p pid="c.2345W.2/2">In 2000 the Environment Agency published a non-statutory environmental quality standard (EQS) for fluoride in water. The standard was informed by a review, carried out for the Agency, on the effect of fluoride on a range of aquatic life. This review drew on available research from recognised scientific laboratories and indicated that fluoride affects aquatic life at concentrations at 9.0-350.Omg/l depending on the hardness of the water and the sensitivity of the species tested.</p>
	<p pid="c.2345W.2/3">Where public water supplies are fluoridated the concentration of fluoride is maintained at 1.0mg/l, and any discharges of these supplies into the aquatic environment would be further diluted through the process of collection and treatment of waste water. Therefore the environmental impact would not be expected to be significant.</p>

	<p pid="c.2347W.2/2"><i> </i>The Government have a duty to explain its policies, decisions and actions; to inform the public about their rights and liabilities; and to provide the public with advice and warnings. DEFRA publishes regularly reports and consultations in accordance with these principles, but to establish the combinations of such publications could be collated only at disproportionate cost. Print procurement policy is to produce the lowest quantity of publications to meet the specific needs of each case, thereby minimising waste. In the case of consultations most are handled on-line and stakeholders may download a copy for local printing. Copies will be supplied to order&mdash;printed digitally&mdash;on a limited basis, if requested, as will large print and Braille versions.</p>
	<p pid="c.2347W.2/3">All the paper used to print reports and publications is based on a material that contains a minimum of 100 per cent. recycled fibre for uncoated papers, and 75 per cent. recycled fibre for coated papers. Print procurement policy is to use uncoated stock except where design, marketing and production requirements require coated stock.</p>

	<p pid="c.2354W.2/2"><i> </i>Since my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary's appointment, Home Office Ministers have received correspondence from right hon. and hon. Members, police officers and others on the subject of police pay. The subject has also been raised at some meetings attended by Home Office Ministers. The 2007 police officer pay award has been addressed through the Police Negotiating Board in the usual way. Following the PNB's failure to reach agreement, the issue will now proceed to the Police Arbitration Tribunal, before my right hon. Friend makes her decision. In doing so she will consider very carefully the recommendations that result from this process.</p>

	<p pid="c.2354W.5/17">The difference in costs over the period reflects the changing nature of the Home Office's business, in particular the growth of international terrorism, migration and international travel. Collaboration and information exchange with other countries on counter-terrorism activities and border control have become increasingly critical to the effective discharge of the Department's responsibilities for asylum, immigration and national security. This has involved higher levels of overseas travel.</p>
	<p pid="c.2354W.5/18">Details on the number of visits could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Since 1999, the Government have published on an annual basis, a list of all overseas visits by Cabinet Ministers costing in excess of &pound;500, as well as the total cost of all ministerial travel overseas. Copies of the lists are available in the Libraries of the House. Information for 2006-07 is currently being compiled and will be published before the summer recess. All travel is undertaken in accordance with the Civil Service Management Code and the Ministerial Code.</p>

	<p pid="c.2358W.0/2">Cost figures for the storage of DNA samples are not centrally available. The costs for retaining DNA samples fall to individual police forces and are dependent on the contractual agreement between the force and the forensic supplier. This information is commercially confidential. The costs of retaining DNA profiles on the National DNA Database are essentially the costs of running and operating the database. These are set out in the National DNA Database Annual Reports for the years 2002-03 to 2005-06, copies of which are available in the House of Commons Library. The Annual Report for 2002-03 was the first annual report produced; and no information is available for the years 2000-01 and 2001-02. The costs of processing DNA samples for the DNA Database are available for the years 2000-01 to 2005-06 and are set out in the following table. In 2006-07, the Home Office ceased the payment of a separate specific grant for funding DNA activity.</p>

I understand that it will be completed by the end of the year, and the Association of Chief Police Officers has undertaken to keep me informed.</p>

Friend the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="">25 July</phrase> that the Government would integrate the vital work of the Border and Immigration Agency, Customs and UK Visas overseas and at the main points of entry to the UK, the Cabinet Secretary is conducting a review on the stages ahead in implementation and whether there is a case for going further, while ensuring value for money. Special Branch will continue to play its full role, based on intelligence, at ports and airports.</p>

	<p pid="c.2365W.3/3">To strengthen the employer voice at the heart of the employment and skills system the UK Commission implantation project are working with the devolved administrations to establish a new UK Commission for Employment and Skills. The UK Commission will be a UK-wide body with responsibilities across each of the four nations, and for skills at all levels, as set in the Leitch review of skills: 'Prosperity for all in the global economy&mdash;world class skills'</p>
	<p pid="c.2365W.3/4">The UK Commission will be primarily advisory, shaping strategy to achieve the Government's world class ambitions and will not have significant executive or operational functions. Sir Michael Rake has been appointed as the chair and we are currently recruiting for a chief executive and commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="c.2365W.3/5">The new UK Commission will open on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase> and will incorporate those functions that the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA) and National Employment Panel (NEP) currently undertake that fall under the remit and responsibility of the new organisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.2365W.3/6">At this early stage of developments we are not yet in a position to be able to give defined numbers of staff and therefore an agreed budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.2365W.3/7">I am of course happy to provide you with figures and numbers once these have been established and agreed with Departments and senior officials within the new UK Commission.</p>

	<p pid="c.2368W.6/49" class="indent">It may be helpful if I provide some further context for our JOT performance figures. Since the 2006/07 JOT target was set, more recent historical performance information has become available, suggesting that the target involves a higher degree of challenge than was intended. Given this, the department recognises that the JOT points target was set 8.4% too high. A target level of around 12.4 million points would have been more representative of the degree of challenge intended, rather than the original 13.5 million-point target. However, it was agreed that Jobcentre Plus would continue to report against the original profile for 2006/07. Detailed JOT performance data is published on the Jobcentre Plus website and updated regularly.</p>

Pensioner households are defined here as single people aged over women's SPA and couples where at least one partner is over women's SPA.  2. Estimates of the number of pensioner households eligible are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million, and proportions to the nearest 1 per cent.  3. Proportions entitled are based on Pensim2, a dynamic micro-simulation model produced by the Department for Work and Pensions. This model is designed to estimate long-term trends; estimates for individual years are subject to random variation and should be treated with caution. The time series have been smoothed using a three-year moving average.  4. Numbers entitled have been estimated by applying the estimated proportion entitled to the projected household population above women's SPA, which is derived from Government Actuary's Department's 2004-based projections of individuals and trends in private households modelled in Pensim2.  5. Projections are calibrated to National Statistics estimates of eligibility to pension credit in 2005-06, which adjust Family Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting. The National Statistics are published as a range; the projections have been calibrated to the mid-point of that range.  6. Projections take account of policies introduced in the Pensions Act 2007, including changes in state pension age. They do not include any increase in private saving from the introduction of personal accounts, which would further reduce the numbers eligible for pension credit.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="c.2378W.0/2">During the recent postal disruption, the Department used a company with whom it has an existing contract for providing courier services. In the absence of assurance from Royal Mail that deliveries to our customers could be maintained, we used our contingency arrangements to ensure customers (many among the most vulnerable in society) received their payments. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis was conducted when the cheque contingency plan was developed. This established that the contracted courier could deliver cheques to our customers during local, regional or national postal disruptions, and that Post Office Ltd. could provide additional counter services during such disruptions.</p>
	<p pid="c.2378W.0/3">The total cost of the exercise, including VAT, was approximately &pound;2.6 million. This cost included discounts totalling &pound;390,000 negotiated with the suppliers. A quantifiable saving of &pound;250,000 was made by using our contingency arrangements, in not having to incur postal delivery charges. Further unquantifiable savings were made by substantially reducing the number of customer cheque payment queries received in local offices due to the industrial action.</p>
	<p pid="c.2378W.0/4">Customer cheques, including those paid to pensioners, were delivered to each cheque customer's nearest post office, as determined by their postal code. Any customers who were unable to collect their cheques, could nominate a temporary agent to do so on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid="c.2378W.0/5">The contingency plan was highly effective in ensuring our customers received their cheque payments throughout the disruption caused by the postal workers' dispute, and the contingency will be used again if required.</p>

	<p pid="c.2384W.2/3">While overseas players continue to make a valuable contribution to the English game and have helped the Premier League to become one of the best domestic leagues in the world, we recognise concerns that an over reliance on overseas players may impact upon the quality of players available for the national team. It is right that The FA should be considering this issue.</p>

	<p pid="c.2386W.9/2">Planning obligations (s06 agreements) are private agreements negotiated between local planning authorities and persons with an interest in a piece of land, usually in the context of planning applications. They are intended to make acceptable development which would otherwise be unacceptable in planning terms. They may be used to prescribe the nature of the development, or to secure a contribution from a developer to compensate for loss or damage created by a development or to mitigate a developments impact. Planning obligations should never be used purely as a means of securing for the local community a share in the profits of a development.</p>
	<p pid="c.2386W.9/3">Local planning authorities should include in their development plan documents, policies about use of planning obligations. The process of setting planning obligation policies and negotiating planning obligations should be conducted as openly, fairly and reasonably as possible. The Planning and Compulsory Purchase act 2004 requires regional planning bodies and local planning authorities to prepare a Statement of Community Involvement, in which they set out their policy on involving their community in preparing regional spatial strategies, local development documents and consulting on planning applications.</p>

	<p pid="c.2394W.2/1">This is a matter for Ofsted. HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to the hon. Member and a copy of her reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.2394W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-27">27 July 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.2394W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.2394W.2/4" class="indent">You asked how many schools in Poole use a) streaming and b) setting.</p>
	<p pid="c.2394W.2/5" class="indent">In total, 19 primary schools in Poole parliamentary constituency were inspected between 1996/97 and 2005/06 (some have been inspected more than once during this period). Setting or streaming was observed in at least one lesson in 13 of these schools. In total, 2,684 lessons were observed in primary schools in Poole during this period. Of these lessons, 8% were either setted or streamed.</p>
	<p pid="c.2394W.2/6" class="indent">In total, 3 secondary schools in Poole parliamentary constituency were inspected between 1996/97 and 2005/06 (some have been inspected more than once during this period). Setting or streaming was observed in at least one lesson in all of these schools. In total, 1,015 lessons were observed in secondary schools in Poole during this period. Of these lessons 38% were either setted or streamed.</p>
	<p pid="c.2394W.2/7" class="indent">Some explanation of these figures may be helpful. Before September 2005, inspectors were usually informed about how classes were organised by means of pre-inspection documentation, discussion with headteachers or teachers' schemes of work or lesson plans. Under the inspection arrangements at that time, all full-time teachers were observed by inspectors. Since September 2005, the recording of class organisation has been based either on discussions with the headteacher or teacher by reference to the lesson plan at the time of observation. A much smaller number of lessons are observed than would have been seen under the previous inspection framework. Lessons seen may therefore not represent pupil grouping in the school as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.2394W.2/8" class="indent">Prior to 2003/2004 lessons were recorded as being setted, streamed, mixed ability or otherwise organised. For clarity, setting is the term used to describe the organisation of pupils in classes on the basis of their prior attainment in the particular subject being taught. The term banding, which is very similar to streaming, is used when the decision as to which pupils are included or not in a class is based on the prior attainment in a range of subjects.</p>
	<p pid="c.2394W.2/9" class="indent">From 2003/04 the distinction between streaming and setting was removed and instead data recorded on whether the class was mixed ability or setted/streamed.</p>
	<p pid="c.2394W.2/10" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Jim Knight MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="c.2397W.5/1">Prior to October 2006, teacher training providers were required to ensure that all candidates entering primary teacher training had achieved a standard equivalent to a grade C in the GCSE examination in a science subject. This was because primary trainees were normally required to teach the whole curriculum, including maths, English and science and would be better prepared to train to teach these subjects if they have demonstrated the GCSE equivalent in them. However, an exemption had been applied for those born before <phrase class="date" code="1979-09-01">1 September 1979</phrase> as this coincided with the date at which science became compulsory at key stage 4 of the National Curriculum for people born after that date.</p>
	<p pid="c.2397W.5/2">I have had no meetings with the Minister for Women and Equality. Last year the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) took advice from the DTI (the sponsors of the legislation) and from ACAS and both confirmed that the original requirement which referred to entrants born after <phrase class="date" code="1979-09-01">1 September 1979</phrase> would be discriminatory as defined by the new age discrimination legislation that came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.2397W.5/3">In order to comply with the new legislation, the TDA therefore removed the exemption for those born before <phrase class="date" code="1979-09-01">1 September 1979</phrase> and applied the requirement to all primary entrants recruited on or after <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October 2006</phrase>, and alerted training providers to the change in the entry requirement. Offers made prior to this date for places on courses beginning after it could stand as they were made prior to the legislation being introduced but any candidates offered places after <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase> would need to demonstrate the GCSE science standard.</p>
	<p pid="c.2397W.5/4">The requirement is for a standard of science knowledge, rather than a requirement to hold a particular qualification, and applicants with no formal qualifications in science can demonstrate this standard via a variety of means. Some teacher training providers offer equivalency tests; others use subject knowledge audits to test this standard. Some providers have worked with further education colleges to offer extra GCSE science courses and the TDA has worked with both providers and their associations to ensure that effective practice in meeting the needs of applicants is shared.</p>
	<p pid="c.2397W.5/5">No data are held on the number of unsuccessful applications to primary initial teacher training and it is not therefore possible to determine whether any applications have been voided as a result of removing the exemption for older applicants.</p>

	<p pid="c.2398W.2/1">This is a matter for Ofsted. HM Chief Inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to the hon. Member and a copy of her reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-27">27 July 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.2/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.2/4" class="indent">You asked how many schools in Gravesham use <i> (a)</i> streaming and <i> (b)</i> setting.</p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.2/5" class="indent">In total, 30 primary schools in Gravesham were inspected between <phrase class="date" code="1996-09-01">1 September 1996</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-31">31 August 2006</phrase> (some have been inspected more than once during this period). Setting or streaming was observed in at least one lesson in 11 of these schools. In total, 3,892 lessons were observed in primary schools in Gravesham during this period. Of these lessons, 7 per cent. were either setted or streamed.</p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.2/6" class="indent">In total, eight secondary schools in Gravesham were inspected between <phrase class="date" code="1996-09-01">1 September 1996</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-31">31 August 2006</phrase> (some have been inspected more than once during this period). Setting or streaming was observed in at least one lesson in all eight of these schools. In total, 2,221 lessons were observed in secondary schools in Gravesham during this period. Of these lessons 28 per cent. were either setted or streamed.</p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.2/7" class="indent">Some explanation of these figures may be helpful. Before September 2005, inspectors were usually informed about how classes were organised by means of pre-inspection documentation, discussion with headteachers or teachers' schemes of work or lesson plans. Under the inspection arrangements at that time, all full-time teachers were observed by inspectors. Since September 2005, the recording of class organisation has been based either on discussions with the headteacher or teacher by reference to the lesson plan at the time of observation. A much smaller number of lessons are observed than would have been seen under the previous inspection framework. Lessons seen may therefore not represent pupil grouping in the school as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.2/8" class="indent">Prior to 2003-04 lessons were recorded as being setted, streamed, mixed ability or otherwise organised. For clarity, setting is the term used to describe the organisation of pupils in classes on the basis of their prior attainment in the particular subject being taught. The term banding, which is very similar to streaming, is used when the decision as to which pupils are included or not in a class is based on the prior attainment in a range of subjects.</p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.2/9" class="indent">From 2003-04 the distinction between streaming and setting was removed and instead data recorded on whether the class was mixed ability or setted/streamed.</p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.2/10" class="indent">A copy of this reply has been sent to Jim Knight MP, Minister of State for Schools and Learners, and will be placed in the library of both Houses.</p>

	<p pid="c.2408W.2/2">In 2006/07, all Higher Education Institutions in England who were running undergraduate courses had an access agreement to charge Variable Tuition Fees, and were charging over the &pound;1,200 fixed fee amount for that year.</p>
	<p pid="c.2408W.2/3">Data are not yet available on the income to institutions from Tuition Fees in the 2006/07 academic year.</p>
	<p pid="c.2408W.2/4">However, the Department's estimates for the expected receipts from university tuition fees were given in the November 2005 statement to the Commons. These were based on the income from UK and EU full-time undergraduate students studying at English Higher Education institutions; where we estimated that once all cohorts of students were paying variable fees, the total fee income would equate to &pound;2,250 million in 2006-7 prices which compares to an estimated income of &pound;900 million from standard fees of &pound;1,200. Therefore, our estimate for the additional fee income from Variable Tuition Fees is &pound;1,350 million.</p>
