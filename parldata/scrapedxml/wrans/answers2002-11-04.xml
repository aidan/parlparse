	<p pid=".3W.2/1">The Directions and Guidance the Secretary of State has issued to the Strategic Rail Authority require the Authority, when considering the disposal of land (including disused trackbeds), to have regard to the sites' transport potential and to avoid taking a short-term view. The Authority should look to the rail industry and local authorities to acquire sites with rail potential, but if these bodies do not purchase sites the Authority should consider whether they should be retained for rail use at a later date. The XPlanning Policy Guidance Note 13: Transport&quot;, issued to Local Planning Authorities, states that local authorities should identify, and protect sites and routes, both existing and potential, which could be critical in developing infrastructure for the movement of freight.</p>

	<p pid=".5W.3/1">Part V of the Disability Discrimination Act gives the Secretary of State powers to introduce regulations requiring public transport to be accessible to disabled people, including those who need to travel in a wheelchair. Under these regulations all new trains (including light rail and underground) which have come into service since January 1999 have been required to meet comprehensive accessibility standards. Similar regulations have applied since January 2000 to all new buses with a capacity of over 22 passengers used on local or scheduled service. Some requirements to help ambulant disabled people and those with visual impairment use coaches and smaller buses have also been introduced but full wheelchair access will not be required for these vehicles until January 2005 because of the technical and operational challenges that remain. Regulations, which came into force on <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase> this year, also place obligations on bus drivers and conductors to assist disabled passengers.</p>
	<p pid=".5W.3/2">Transport infrastructure, including bus and railway stations is covered by Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act which has placed duties on service providers since October 1999 to amend policies or practices which discriminate against disabled people. From October 2004 these duties will extend to the removal of physical barriers to access.</p>

The cost would depend on location, planned usage, the condition of existing or provision of new infrastructure, and a host of other factors.

	<p pid=".20W.9/2">The amounts spent by Connexions Partnerships on literature (which is interpreted here as promotional material) vary according to the length of time partnerships have been operational. (The first phase of partnerships went live in April 2001 and the most recent in October 2002.) The table presents regional data on partnerships' cumulative expenditure from the date they went live. It has not been possible in all cases to disaggregate figures for design, printing and consultancy as some partnerships group these together and/or contract with one provider to supply all three services (these appear as Xmerged costs&quot; in the table).</p>

According to this survey there were 21,400 job vacancies in the construction industry on average for the period July to September 2002 for the United Kingdom as a whole. The design of the sample survey means it is not presently possible to provide regional analysis of vacancies on a reliable basis.</p>

	<p pid=".25W.9/1">Colleges in the further education (FE) sector, including sixth form colleges, are independent corporations with their own pay arrangements. Colleges agree annual pay rises and conditions of employment with their staff in the context of local priorities and the overall resources available to them. There is a nationally recommended pay increase agreed by the employers' representative bodies and the unions but pay arrangements in the sector are diverse, reflecting colleges' local flexibility. Government have no plans to change this arrangement.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/2">Extra resources have been made available to the FE sector. This year, #4.4 billion has been allocated to FE, an increase of #1.2 billion in five years. Within this, there is #142 million available for the Teaching Pay Initiative, known as the Professional Standards Payment in sixth form colleges, which helps colleges to modernise pay arrangements and to recruit, reward and retain excellent teachers.</p>
	<p pid=".25W.9/3">We have already announced that from next year and up to 2005&ndash;06 there will be a 1 per cent. annual real terms increase in core funding for FE and three year budgets for colleges which demonstrate their effectiveness. This, plus the additional resources for FE that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will be announcing in November to support our Success for All strategy, will present a more stable environment within which general FE and sixth form colleges can plan and negotiate pay levels and arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".30W.11/1">The UK forms part of the European Community's delegation to the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) and which deliberates on coffee matters. In 2001, the ICO organised the first World Coffee Conference and which drew attention to the challenges posed by low coffee prices. The UK is also a member of the Common Fund for Commodities which has a particular interest in the livelihoods of commodity dependent peoples, particularly in the least developed countries.</p>
	<p pid=".30W.11/2">The main cause of low coffee prices is oversupply, with production far exceeding consumption. Many poor smallholder farmers, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are dependent on coffee for a livelihood. The dramatic fall in prices has therefore had, and continues to have a significant livelihood and development concerns.</p>

	<p pid=".31W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-30">30 October 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".31W.2/2">The current situation of historically low coffee prices is having a significant effect on the livelihoods of very large numbers of coffee producers (who are predominantly smallholders) and those working in related industries and services. The income that people derive from the production and sale of commodities like coffee is influenced by a number of market (price, quality requirements) and non-market (pests and disease, weather etc.) factors. Low prices also have substantial macro-economic effects in terms of foreign exchange earnings, income to the exchequer and hence on debt repayment. Many of the poorest countries, particularly in Africa, remain dependent on a narrow range of commodity exports of which coffee is but one example.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.2/3">The UK, through its development programme and by working at international level, supports programmes that seek to expand the trade opportunities for poor countries and improve the economic, social, environmental and political framework within which commodity-dependent people derive a livelihood. Diversification, both horizontal (into other economic activities or crops) and vertical (greater participation in value-adding activities within the coffee value chain such as processing) forms an important element of this broader approach.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.2/4">In many countries we are assisting governments to develop poverty reduction strategies that address the needs of poor producers, taking into account commodity dependence. Ghana, Tanzania and Uganda are examples. We also support capacity building of individuals and producer organisations to better enable them to explore alternative markets and options and engage in the supply chain.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.2/5">DFID provides support to producers and producer groups to meet the growing range of quality (eg food safety) and performance criteria (eg environmental; social) that increasingly characterise developed country market requirements. We also fund research on smaller producers (eg integrated pest management, germplasm quality, post-harvest management) that aims to provide effective and low-cost solutions for those seeking to diversify both vertically and horizontally.</p>
	<p pid=".31W.2/6">DFID is also working hard to ensure that pressure is maintained for pro-poor trade reform (including CAP reform)&mdash;to ensure that any diversification efforts by poor coffee producers in developing countries are not undermined by unfair trade arrangements. We are also, with other Whitehall Departments, working to ensure that the Common Fund for Commodities is more poverty focused.</p>

However once an inclusive transitional Government has been agreed, the UK will be willing to consider providing direct assistance to the Government of DRC. In the short term we are considering options for Quick start initiatives to demonstrate to the people of DRC the benefits of peace. In the medium term we plan to provide assistance in a number of sectors where we believe we can best add value such as disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) and support to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process. We will also continue our humanitarian and peace building activities, and will support re-engagement in the DRC by the international financial institutions (IFIs).</p>

The FCO's assessment is that Libya's record on human rights is not good, but there are recent signs of improvement (including the release of remaining political prisoners), and Libya is expected to continue to show a commitment to improving its human rights record during its period as chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</p>

Also excluded are activities funded through multilateral channels. Education and health and population will remain priorities for future spending. We do not however, support externally imposed targets. We believe support for poverty reduction strategies devoted to meeting the millennium development goals is the right approach and that our programmes should be harmonised with the efforts of other donors behind locally led poverty reduction strategies.</p>

We believe that justice sector reform needs to be a key part of poverty reduction strategies in many countries. Justice programmes supported by my Department in SADC countries aim to promote respect for human rights, both through training, and through strengthening the accountability of the justice sector. Through such programmes we seek to encourage the integration of human rights principles into the training programmes of police services and other professionals in the justice sector.</p>

	<p pid=".37W.3/1">The re-establishment of effective legal institutions and the rule of law are crucial for successful reconciliation and future development in both countries.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.3/2">Rwanda has made significant progress in re-establishing a functioning legal system and rehabilitating the judiciary since the 1994 genocide. The development of a new Constitution will further clarify roles and enable greater effectiveness of the justice system.</p>
	<p pid=".37W.3/3">The justice system is overstretched by the need to administer justice to people affected by the genocide. The Government are implementing the community-based justice system of Gacaca, which will relieve pressure on existing overburdened legal structures. The introduction of traditional Gacaca trials for genocide related crimes has an important role to play as a key part of the reconciliation process within Rwandan communities. This mechanism is complementary to national trials for more serious genocide related offences and those at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.</p>

The Arusha Accord includes a Protocol dedicated to democracy and good governance. As well as setting out transitional constitutional and parliamentary arrangements, the Protocol sets out a number of measures aimed at reinforcing the independence of the judiciary and the effectiveness of the justice system. The success of the transition will largely depend on a ceasefire.</p>

	<p pid=".39W.5/1">I discuss child rights and development regularly with partners. Discussions focus on the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals to which the UK Government are committed. In particular the goals of achieving primary education for all, promoting gender equality and improving child survival are key to meeting the goal of halving absolute poverty by 2015. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child forms one cornerstone for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and the UN General Assembly's Special Session on Children in May 2002, to which my Department contributed, committed governments to clear action and objectives for children and young people.</p>

	<p pid=".46W.5/2">Emergency cover in Somerset, as for the rest of the country, will consist of a number of elements including Green Goddesses, breathing apparatus teams (BARTs), a rescue team equipped with specialist equipment (REST) and the police. The BARTs and RESTs carry basic cutting and other rescue equipment, and have been trained to respond to road traffic accidents.</p>
	<p pid=".46W.5/3">The provision of MOD emergency cover has been planned in consultation with Chief Fire Officers to maximise the effectiveness of call-outs and the availability of a range of firefighting capabilities. The MOD's emergency cover will not replicate the firefighting capabilities of the Fire Service, but will aim to minimise the danger to human life.</p>

	<p pid=".49W.2/1">We will announce the new system for distributing Formula Grant, including detailed grant allocations for individual authorities, at the time of the provisional local government finance settlement which we expect to be around the start of December. Once the Government has allocated its grant, decisions about budgets and services are primarily for local councils to make. However, we have already guaranteed that no authority will face a cut in grant next year on a like for like basis, and we hope to do better than that when we announce the actual floors and ceilings scheme as part of the provisional settlement.</p>

	<p pid=".49W.5/1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister commissioned research into the impact of sparsity, dispersal and settlement patterns as part of the work on the Environmental, Protective &amp; Cultural Services block. In addition other Government departments have undertaken such research covering the services for which they are primarilyresponsible. Officials have also discussed sparsity issues with local government colleagues over the past 18 months in technical groups covering all service blocks. This informed the options put forward in the Formula Grant Review consultation document. We are currently taking decisions on the new system to be implemented following that consultation, and in doing so are considering carefully all of the evidence, pressures and representations that we received, including those from rural areas.</p>

The deployment to provide emergency fire cover will inevitably impact on their ability to continue some of these tasks at the same level of effort. The longer service personnel are required to provide fire cover the greater the penalties that will accrue to other activities, and in particular on the Armed Forces personnel employed on these duties in place of professional firefighters.</p>

	<p pid=".54W.13/1">The service families taskforce was set up by the Government in 1999 to deal with service family issues that were outside the control of the Ministry of Defence. However, it is now the tri-Service focus for family issues, both internal and external. Representatives of service families meet a Minister twice a year to discuss the issues that are of concern to them. In addition, bilateral meetings are held with other Government Departments, as necessary, to discuss changes to any rules and regulations that are considered detrimental to, and discriminate against, service families.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.13/2">Some are of progress by the Task Force over the last year are:</p>
	<p pid=".54W.13/3" class="indent">(a) The new Adoption legislation has been amended to ensure that Service families will not be disadvantaged when overseas.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.13/4" class="indent">(b) Legislative changes have been made to enable the Inland Revenue to pay Working Families Tax Credit to Service families on overseas postings.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.13/5" class="indent">(c) We have resolved the problems that some Service spouses had encountered in claiming Child Support Agency payments when on an overseas posting.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.13/6" class="indent">(d) As a result of discussions with the Department for Education and Skills, the new Code of Practice for School Admissions in England due for publication next year contains specific reference to Service families.

	<p pid=".55W.2/1">The recent announcement of the selection of the Short Take off and Vertical Landing variant of Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) to meet the United Kingdom Joint Combat Aircraft requirement reaffirmed our participation in the JSF programme. This decision has been well received by UK industry.</p>
	<p pid=".55W.2/2">United Kingdom companies have already secured key roles within the programme as a result of their outstanding technology and ability to deliver value for money. Industry estimates that its involvement could be worth up to #27 billion over the whole life of the programme, creating or securing some 8,500 jobs. In addition, we are working closely with the US authorities to facilitate further involvement of UK companies and we are placing particular emphasis on arrangements to smooth the transfer of technology between the US and UK. This builds on the considerable progress already made under the declaration of principles.</p>

	<p pid=".57W.8/1">My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces announced the full implementation of our proposals for the use of the Reserves in home defence and security in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-31">31 October 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2002-10-31.1023"><i>Official Report,</i> column 1023</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.8/2">The new arrangements will provide significant improvements in three areas. An enhanced regionally-based planning and command capability will make it easier for the authorities dealing with civil contingencies to secure rapid support from the Armed Forces, both Regular and Reserve. An integrated communications infrastructure will be provided by a Territorial Army unit, 2 (National Communications) Signals Brigade, for which we are acquiring new communications equipment compatible with that being introduced in the emergency services. Finally, we are establishing 14 Civil Contingency Reaction Forces, each of some 500 volunteers from existing Reservists, to provide a new planned capability to assist the emergency services and other authorities at short notice.</p>
	<p pid=".57W.8/3">In total the Reserve Forces will receive an addition of some 700 new posts and some 130,000 man-training days.</p>

	<p pid=".60W.12/1">As announced by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Defence Procurement, Lord Bach, on <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase>, it has been decided to purchase up to 150 short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) versions of the Lockheed Martin F35s to meet the future joint combat aircraft (FJCA) requirement for the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. These aircraft, which are due to enter service in 2012 with the first unit of a new class of carrier, will replace both the land and carrier-based Harrier aircraft of Joint Force Harrier.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.12/2">No final decision on aircraft numbers has yet been taken. The current planning assumptions to procure up to 150 includes not only front-line aircraft, but also provision for training, maintenance, trials, and attrition.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.12/3">It is planned that, as with Joint Force Harrier, both Royal Navy and Royal Air Force pilots will fly the F35 aircraft when it enters into front-line service. The exact requirements for front-line crews for the successor joint force have yet to be determined by the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. On current planning assumptions it will not be necessary to supplement aircrew manning of the joint force from foreign and Commonwealth countries, as we are confident we will be able to fully man the force with regular Royal Navy and Royal Air Force pilots. However, as with all current operational and training squadrons, exchange personnel from foreign and Commonwealth countries may well fill some posts.</p>

However, the Governments of Australia and New Zealand have vigorously defended compensation claims on the grounds that particular regard was taken for the safety and welfare of test participants, and in the absence of evidence of negligence, there is no proper basis for settling the claims. I understand that no compensation has been paid to individual New Zealand veterans, but that 10 Australian veterans have secured compensation from the Australian Government.</p>

	<p pid=".65W.8/1">I do not consider it necessary to set up a public inquiry. In 1999, the Ministry of Defence commissioned Professor Peter Lachmann and a team of distinguished scientists to undertake an independent review of the fluorescent particle trials which occurred between 1955 and 1963, and included the four two-hour trials which also involved the release of <sup>1</sup> <sup>3</sup> <sup>3</sup> Xenon at Harwell in 1961. The MOD accepts the conclusion of this review, which was that XExposure to cadmium from dissemination of zinc cadmium sulphide during the 'cold war' should not have resulted in adverse health effects in the United Kingdom population&quot;. The findings of the review are summarised in an open literature paper entitled, XThe Risk to the UK Population of Zinc Cadmium Sulphide Dispersion by the MOD During the XCold War&quot; (Occup. Environ. Med. 2002, 59, 13&ndash;17). Additionally, the complete review can be found at <a href="http://www.mod.uk/publications/zinc-cadmium">www.mod.uk/publications/zinc-cadmium</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".68W.2/1">I discussed the proposal for a NATO Response Force (NRF) with the United States Secretary of Defence and other NATO colleagues at the informal meeting of defence ministers in Warsaw in September 2002. The proposed NRF concept is coherent with current work to reform NATO's command and force structures and enjoys the United Kingdom's strong support. Work is now under way within NATO to develop the NRF concept, and guiding principles are expected to be put before Heads of State and Government at the Prague summit for their agreement.</p>

That Policy Statement requires Environmental Impact Assessments to be conducted for all new equipment projects.

	<p pid=".68W.8/2">The reason for the research programme is that, to date, it has not been possible to put forward any definitive conclusions on the effects of differing acoustic energy on marine mammals. The research, which is on-going, has not yet reached any conclusion. In addition to the research, Environmental Impact Assessments undertaken by the Ministry of Defence in respect of this subject will also be informed by evidence from leading experts both in the United Kingdom and the United States. We are also monitoring relevant scientific and environmental research around the globe on this issue.</p>

	<p pid=".69W.2/1">It is Ministry of Defence policy to consider the effects of sonar use on cetaceans. An environmental impact assessment is undertaken prior to all new projects and training activities. The way in which the equipment is then used during each subsequent training activity takes the assessment into account. Trials are preceded by a detailed environmental study of the operating area concerned. The operating area continues to be monitored while the trials are under way, and the activity is managed to minimize the potential impacts on cetaceans. Mitigation methods based on best scientific advice, such as acoustic and visual monitoring in accordance with Government and Joint Nature Conservation Committee published guidelines adapted for military use, are used so that the activity will be modified, delayed or moved as necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".69W.2/2">These measures provide a balance between the requirement for essential trials work and training, and the equally important need to avoid causing any significant adverse effect on the marine environment.</p>

As mandated by the Laeken European Council, the Convention on the Future of Europe is examining whether and, if so, how, the Charter should be included in the treaties. EU member states will take the final decision by unanimity at the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004. People need to know their rights and the EU institutions need to respect them. Our policy remains one of strong support for the charter.</p>

	<p pid=".75W.12/1">The potential for conflicts of interest is addressed when BTI and the FCO consider candidates for secondment opportunities and when setting up the secondments themselves. There are two letters of appointment: one with the secondee, and one with the seconding organisation. Both cover this issue. The letter to the secondee states:</p>
	<p pid=".75W.12/2" class="indent">XIt is a prime condition of the secondment that you ensure that in the course of official duties there will be no conflict of interest that will cause either embarrassment to, or difficulties for, your parent organisation (Company) or the FCO. You will be expected to ensure that your position here is not, and raises no reasonable suspicion of being, abused either in your own personal interest, or in the interests of (Company). In practise this means that you should not undertake any work or research on behalf of (Company), or present yourself as a representative of the company, for the duration of the secondment. In addition, (Company) should not have priority access to information or sales leads you secure in your work with the (Post), but should receive this information at the same time as all other British companies operating in the market or sector. Any areas of work that might possibly give rise to conflict of interest should be discussed with your line manager. Please be aware that if any of these guidelines are breached, British Trade International reserves the right to consider immediate termination of the secondment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".75W.12/3">The letter to the seconding organisation states:</p>
	<p pid=".75W.12/4" class="indent">XI trust (Company) will appreciate and share our concerns that, in the course of (Name) official duties with the FCO, there should be no conflict of interest that would, or might be, a source of embarrassment either to your company or the Department. In practise this means that (Name) should not undertake any work or research on behalf of (Company), or present himself/herself as a representative of the company, for the duration of the secondment. In addition, (Company) should not have priority access to information or sales leads secured in the course of (Name) work with the Embassy, but should receive this information at the same time as all other British companies operating in the market or sector. Please be aware that if any of these guidelines are breached, British Trade International reserves the right to consider immediate termination of the secondment.

We are currently consulting on the future of Lottery distribution and a dedicated Youth Fund is among the options proposed.</p>

The Post Office is developing a post office card account which is a simple account just for the receipt of benefit, pension and tax credit payments.

	<p pid=".83W.0/2">We have been vigorously promoting the benefits of age diversity and recruitment, training and retaining of older workers to employers through our Age Positive campaign. The campaign focuses on raising employers' awareness of the business case for an age diverse work force and encouraging them to use the Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment to inform their employment policies. The campaign features a range of initiatives to promote age diversity, which are shown on our website <a href="http://www.agepositive.gov.uk">www.agepositive.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".83W.0/3">The Code of Practice, published in June 1999, sets out the standards for non-ageist approaches to recruitment, training, promotion, redundancy and retirement, and was developed with leading organisations including the CBI, TUC, the Employers Forum on Age and Age Concern. Evaluation of the Code of Practice, published last year, found that the number of companies using age in recruitment had fallen from 27 per cent. to 13 per cent. and those companies with a policy against employing older people has halved from 14 per cent. to 7 per cent. However it also indicated that 90 per cent. of people believe that employers do discriminate against older workers and although age awareness had increased considerably over the evaluation period, smaller employers were least likely to have realised the implications of ageism.</p>

	<p pid=".90W.0/1">We understand the difficulties that people living in rural areas can face, both in securing employment and gaining access to our services. We are therefore developing new ways of making Jobcentre Plus services more accessible to such people, for example by:</p>
	<p pid=".90W.0/2" class="indent">providing a single point of access to jobs and benefits</p>
	<p pid=".90W.0/3" class="indent">providing access to jobs through call centres, touch screen 'Jobpoints' in a wider range of locations, and the internet</p>
	<p pid=".90W.0/4" class="indent">enabling people to make claims for benefit by telephone, and eventually through other channels such as the internet</p>
	<p pid=".90W.0/5" class="indent">extending outreach services such as local community surgeries</p>
	<p pid=".90W.0/6" class="indent">making services available through mobile units</p>
	<p pid=".90W.0/7" class="indent">delivering services from premises shared with our partners in the local community, for example local authorities</p>
	<p pid=".90W.0/8">We have introduced new services which should be particularly useful for Jobcentre Plus customers in rural areas. XJobseeker Direct&quot;&mdash;on 0845 6060234&mdash;is a telephone jobfinding service available to both unemployed and employed people. They can also look for jobs and learning opportunities on the internet, through two websites <a href="http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk">www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.worktrain.gov.uk">www.worktrain.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".90W.0/9">The integrated Jobcentre Plus offices which we will be extending throughout Great Britain over the next four years will offer a significantly enhanced telephone service that will improve access to services for those who do not live near a Jobcentre Plus office. Each Jobcentre Plus office will have a dedicated telephone contact centre open from 8.30 am to 6.00 pm. Customers will be able to make their initial claim to benefit through this service and book appointments with Personal Advisers.</p>

Organisations wishing to compete for our education, training or employment related contracts are asked to set out how they intend delivering the programme, including the amount and quality of support they will offer participants. The providers who win the contracts are then subject to contractual and quality audits by Jobcentre Plus regional contracts managers, district quality management teams and, in some cases, the Adult Learning Inspectorate.

	<p pid=".91W.6/1" class="holdinganswer">holding Answer <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-19">19 July 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".91W.6/2">Local authority Statutory Performance Standard (Xtargets&quot;) for recycling and composting of household waste have been set for the years 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06. Local authorities will submit performance data against which these targets will be measured to the Audit Commission in Summer 2004 and audited performance figures will be available towards the end of 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.6/3">Targets for individual authorities are listed in the publication XGuidance on Municipal Waste Management Strategies&quot; March 2001. Copies of this document were placed within both libraries of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-05">5 March 2001</phrase>. They are also published on DEFRA's website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/management/guidance/mwms/10.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/management/guidance/mwms/10.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.6/4">We will have audited recycling performance figures for 2001&ndash;02 in December 2002 and this should give us an indication of progress to targets. A document setting out individual local authorities' targets and the most recent available data for their household waste recycling rates (2000&ndash;01), set out in ascending order according to their recycling and composting rate for 2000&ndash;01, has been placed in both libraries of the House (Table A).</p>
	<p pid=".91W.6/5">A further document (Table B) setting out the same information, but also including a column showing the difference between the 2000&ndash;01 rate and the 2003&ndash;04 target, in order to show Xprogress to target&quot;, has also been placed in both libraries of the House. Those furthest from their target in percentage points are shown at the top of the table. Note that, since all authorities had to achieve different levels of improvement to reach their target, that table does not allow for exact comparison.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.6/6">We set targets in a way which means all authorities would have to improve their performance over their rate in 1998&ndash;99, no matter what their starting point. For that reason, when tracking local authorities' recycling performance, we consider how much the recycling rate has <i>increased, </i>rather than looking simply at the rate.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.6/7">I have written to the leaders of the local authorities that are listed below about recycling. In these authorities, preliminary performance data for 2001&ndash;02, taken from 2002&ndash;03 Best Value Performance Plans, shows that the authority's recycling rate has decreased, stayed the same, or only increased by 1 per cent. between 1998&ndash;99 and 2001&ndash;02. I have invited the relevant leaders to identify work that is already in hand to meet their 2003&ndash;04 Statutory Performance Standard for recycling and composting of household waste and to consider the need for further action where this is relevant.</p>

	<p pid=".95W.2/2">The Department recently received the final report of an economic evaluation of agri-environment schemes commissioned from the Centre for Rural Economics Research at the University of Cambridge. This report included a comparison of agri-environment schemes offered in other European countries. It will be published shortly and will be available on the Defra website.</p>
	<p pid=".95W.2/3">All Member States submit mid-term evaluations of their rural development programmes to the European Commission at the end of 2003. The results should allow an EU-wide comparison and assessment of rural development support in general, including agri-environment support.</p>

Internal management Information indicates that during the financial year 2001&ndash;02 we made initial decisions on the vast majority of new substantive applications within the initial six months.

	<p pid=".100W.2/5">Immigration detainees held in Immigration Service removal centres have never been required to work nor are they expected to assist in the running of the centres.</p>
	<p pid=".100W.2/6">Following their redesignation earlier this year as removal centres, the Prison Service detention facilities at Dover, Haslar and Lindholme ceased to operate under Prison Rules. As a consequence, detainees no longer had the opportunity to undertake paid employment in the centres and the practice of relying on such work for the provision of certain ancillary services came to an end. Work formerly undertaken by detainees at these centres has been contracted out or transferred to agency staff. For this year this has resulted in a net additional cost of #1.09 million. This will be met from the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's budget.</p>

	<p pid=".103W.0/1">The Government is committed to the delivery of an effective service for undertaking pre-employment criminal record checks for people working with children and vulnerable adults. The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has not so far been able to provide a satisfactory service.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/2">A number of steps have already been taken to improve the CRB's performance. In May an initial service improvement plan was put in place. As a result the number of disclosures issued by the CRB has increased from an average of 24,500 per week in August to an average of 39,500 per week in the three weeks ending <phrase class="date" code="">26 October</phrase>. The CRB has now issued 541,000 disclosures.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/3">In addition, in September I announced the appointment of an independent team, led by Patrick Carter, to take a fundamental look at the strategy and operations of the CRB and its private-sector partner, Capita. The team will be looking to identify the longer-term changes in the way the CRB operates to ensure that it can meet the demand both for the standard and enhanced disclosures already in place and the basic disclosures to be introduced in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/4">I expect the independent team to report to me with their conclusions and recommendations by the end of the year. It is likely, however, to require a period of months before any system changes necessary to deliver the required step change in the CRB's output can be fully implemented. In the meantime it is expected that there will be a gradual improvement in performance through the ongoing service improvement plan.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/5">In the interim, we need to take steps to ensure that the demand for disclosures is in line with the CRB's current ability to process the applications. I have therefore agreed with my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Health, and for Education and Skills a number of measures to defer the existing or proposed requirement on certain occupations or office holders to obtain a CRB disclosure.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/6">Persons caring for children and vulnerable adults will, as now, continue to be subject to rigorous pre-employment checks, including confirming previous employment history and taking up references, to ensure their suitability for the position in question. All those occupations which were subject to a criminal record check prior to the advent of the CRB will continue to be subject to such a check.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/7">The details of the measures are set out as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/8" class="indentitalic">Care Homes</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/9" class="indent">The care homes regulations (relating to care homes for adults) currently require CRB checks for existing staff&mdash;that is, those employed to work in a care home immediately before <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>&mdash;to be completed by <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>. The Government will be amending the regulations to extend this time limit. Existing care home staff will now be required to obtain a CRB check during the course of 2004. New care homes staff will continue to be required to have CRB checks, as will registered providers and managers of care homes.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/10" class="indentitalic">Nurses agencies and domiciliary care agencies</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/11" class="indent">Nurses supplied by nurses agencies, and staff supplied by domiciliary care agencies, will not be required to have CRB checks for the time being. The Department of Health will still be going ahead with the introduction of the nurses agency and domiciliary care agency regulations to come into effect in February 2003, but without the requirement for CRB checks. Staff will be required to provide a statement that they have no criminal convictions, or to provide a statement of any criminal convictions that they do have.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/12" class="indent">The CRB check requirements will however, apply to registered providers and managers of nurses agencies and domiciliary care agencies.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/13" class="indent">Some nurses agencies are already having to comply with requirements for CRB checks, which stem from the care homes regulations and the private and voluntary health care regulations which are already in place. These require checks to be made before temporary staff can be placed in those settings. These requirements have been in place since April 2002, and are not being removed.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/14" class="indentitalic">Other Department of Health regulations</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/15" class="indent">There will be no change to other regulations under the Care Standards Act 2000. Furthermore, none of these measures affect the requirements of those working with children to have a Protection of Children Act list check and the checks required by the Children's Homes Regulations and the Fostering Services Regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/16" class="indent">It is planned that regulations on residential family centres and adoption agencies will come into effect, with CRB check requirements, in February and April 2003 respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/17" class="indent">In addition, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health has agreed to postpone the implementation of the Protection of Vulnerable Adults list provided for the Care Standards Act.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/18" class="indent">All these arrangements are designed to avoid having regulations in place which cannot be complied with by providers. The Government recognises the importance of criminal records checks but at the same time providers must not be prevented from operating. Care homes have to be able to continue to employ existing staff, and we believe that domiciliary care agencies and nurses agencies should not be prevented from being able to place staff because they have not obtained checks.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/19" class="indent">The regulations and national minimum standards, even with the CRB check requirements, will still be a significant factor in driving up standards and protecting service users. Among other things, they will cover the way the organisation is run, recruitment procedures, staffing arrangements, user feedback, information for service users, all of which are part of a system to protect vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/20" class="indentitalic">School Governors</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/21" class="indent">School governors will not be required to have CRB checks for the time being. The Department for Education and Skills will still be going ahead with the introduction of the School Governance (Constitution) regulations to come into effect in April 2003, but without the requirement for CRB checks.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/22" class="indent">The Government remains committed to introducing CRB checks in these areas at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.0/23" class="indent">The Home Office, in conjunction with the Department of Health for Education and Skills, will be issuing detailed guidance to Registered Bodies about the implications of the above measures. The three Departments will continue to work with their partners and the CRB as the situation develops.</p>

CSOs will provide a visible police presence and will have a vital role to play in support of the police in reducing the fear of crime, increasing public safety and tackling anti-social behaviour.</p>

This has resulted in a number of new measures, initiatives and trials. For obvious reasons I do not propose to give details of them. However, I can confirm that screening is part of this overall package.</p>

Chief officers of police forces and individual crime and disorder reduction partnerships decide on the priorities for their local areas, and a proportion of their mainstream expenditure or their Home Office funding may be spent on tackling retail crime. Many of the measures taken to reduce particular crimes, such as juvenile crime, street crime and drug-related crime, and anti-social behaviour, are also likely to have a beneficial impact on reducing retail crime.</p>

	<p pid=".115W.5/3">In Lancashire, there was a 20 per cent reduction in street crime offences (robbery and snatch theft) between April and September 2002. For robbery, the more serious offence, figures showed 15 per cent fewer offences in September compared to March, the month preceding the initiative.</p>
	<p pid=".115W.5/4">Year on year comparisons show an 11 per cent reduction in the number of robberies in Lancashire in the six months from April to September 2002, compared to the same period last year.</p>

	<p pid=".116W.2/1">The requested details in respect of crimes recorded by the police in the year ending March 2002 have already been published in table 6.06 of the Home Office Statistical Bulletin XCrime in England and Wales 2001&ndash;02&quot;, which was published in July this year, and is available in the Library. The table also gives rates for overall violent crime obtained from the British Crime Survey, which records people's actual experiences of crime.</p>
	<p pid=".116W.2/2">Recorded crime figures may have been affected in comparison to the previous year as a result of changes to police recording practices. Some of the forces in Wales and the North West, including Lancashire, implemented the principles of the National Crime Recording Standard in advance of its national introduction in April 2002. This early implementation by these and other police forces had the effect of uplifting the number of offences of violence against the person in England and Wales as a whole in 2001&ndash;02 by an estimated 13 per cent.</p>

	<p pid=".117W.5/2">I can confirm the intention is for the remaining centre at Yarl's Wood to be ready to re-open in April 2003 with a population of single females, and later families, both asylum and non-asylum cases. In advance of this, work has already commenced to install sprinklers and the necessary facilities so that this population can be accommodated. As with all other removal centres, Yarl's Wood will be used to ensure we deliver our commitment to remove those without lawful right to be here. The intention is always to ensure that the period in detention is as short as possible. However, it is sometimes regrettably necessary to detain asylum seekers and other immigration related cases for longer periods of time.</p>

	<p pid=".117W.8/2">It has not been decided when the report will be published. Stephen Moore has consulted widely and taken representations from a number of interested parties. However, his terms of reference require him to take full account of inquiries being undertaken by Bedfordshire police and the Bedfordshire fire and rescue service, neither of which has yet concluded investigations. He is also required to conduct his inquiry in a way that would not impede any criminal investigation. Criminal trials arising out of the events at Yarl's Wood on 14 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-15">15 February</phrase> are listed for April 2003. Consideration is therefore still being given as to when the report can be completed and published.</p>

	<p pid=".118W.6/1">I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that, in the knowledge of a theoretical risk of BSE in sheep, the Agency has recommended to the European Union (EU) Commission that sheep intestines, used to make some sausage casings, be added to the EU list of specified risk material (SRM) prohibited from the food chain. The EU scientific steering committee (SSC) considered at its September meeting the most recent data on BSE and sheep intestines. The SSC decided not to recommend, at this time, the addition of sheep intestines to the list of SRM. At the same time, differing scientific opinions on the effectiveness of processing sheep intestines, in removing potential infective material should BSE be present in a sheep, were acknowledged. The Agency has subsequently suggested to the Commission that experts be called together at EU level to achieve better common understanding. The Commission has agreed to this. In the meantime, there are no restrictions on the sale or use of such sausage casings pending any decision at the EU level.</p>

Potentially the directive could help members of the public wishing to take greater responsibility for their own health to make an informed choice about which traditional herbal remedy may be helpful.

	<p pid=".122W.6/1">From April 2002, responsibility for securing the provision of the health contribution to child protection services began to be devolved to primary care trusts (PCTs). The particular roles and responsibilities of health professionals for child protection are set out in the Government's core inter-agency child protection guidance Working Together to Safeguard Children. Although this is a new role for PCTs, they are not expected to assume this responsibility without support. Child protection will form a key competency task within the national primary and care trust development programme currently being developed.</p>
	<p pid=".122W.6/2">The exercise of responsibility for child protection involves more than the specific clinical service; it necessitates PCTs exercising a public health responsibility for a whole population. It will require good partnership working with all stakeholders, in particular councils with social services responsibilities. Guidance on specific action required was issued to all chief executives of PCTs in January this year. This will be followed next year by supplementary child protection guidance for health professionals. In addition, the national primary and care trust development programme team are currently running child protection seminars for PCT directors with responsibility for children.</p>

That is why it commissioned the Joint Chief Inspector's report. It is also why my right hon.

	<p pid=".123W.2/2">However, many findings from serious case reviews can serve as an important source of information to inform policy and practice at both national and local levels. In recognition of this, the Department is responsible for identifying and disseminating common themes and trends across review reports, and acting on lessons for policy and practice. We recently published an overview report, XLearning from Past Experience&mdash;A Review of Serious Case Reviews&quot;, drawing out the key findings of a selection of case reviews from the last two years, and their implications for policy and practice. At the same time, we have recently launched a new comprehensive database, which will in future hold information about all serious case reviews.</p>

	<p pid=".137W.5/1">Information is not collected centrally on waiting times for diagnostic tests. Currently published cancer waiting times data include patients urgently referred by their general practitioner (GP) with suspected cancer to first outpatient appointment. This data shows whether a patient was seen in secondary care within two weeks but does not contain information on whether a patient was referred direct for a diagnostic test or for assessment by a specialist. Data are also published on the target of a maximum one-month wait from urgent referral to first treatment for testicular cancer, children's cancers and acute leukaemia. This data will include time for the diagnostic phase but does not contain data on waiting times for individual diagnostic tests. Data is also published on the maximum one-month wait from diagnosis to first treatment for breast cancer. This target measures the waiting time to treatment after the diagnosis has been made. By 2005 there will be a maximum two-month wait from urgent GP referral to first treatment for all cancers.</p>

Traditionally, some of PHLS's core funding has supported the routine services provided to NHS trusts. In 2003&ndash;04, transferring PHLS laboratories will receive payments, to be known as Xresidual subsidy&quot;, to cover this support. For 2004&ndash;05 the subsidy will be passed to primary care trusts as part of general allocations, and contracts between NHS trusts will operate on a full cost recovery basis.</p>

	<p pid=".142W.2/7" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> Currently the latest available estimates for the Gross Value Added (GVA*) for the countries and regions of the United Kingdom are for 1999. This publication lag is longer than usual and has been caused by the ONS completing an exceptionally demanding work programme to include a number of new and revised data sources. This additional work led to a deferral of the publication of estimates of GVA from their planned release date in May 2002 and the reasons for this deferral were covered in a ONS News Release of <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-21">21 May 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".142W.2/8" class="indent">More usually, estimates of GVA below UK level are published some three to four months after the UK-level estimates are released. One of the main reasons for this delay is to ensure that the sub-UK estimates are consistent with (i.e. add up to) those published in the United Kingdom National Accounts. We plan to meet that goal this year by publishing estimates for the period up to 2001 before the end of 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".142W.2/9" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> The ONS announced in the August edition of Updates that Regional Gross Value Added is to be published for the years 2000 and 2001 on <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-17">17 December 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".142W.2/10" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> The estimates of GVA per head for the countries and regions of the United Kingdom for the period 1989 to 1999, consistent with the National Accounts data published in 2000 are shown in table A.</p>
	<p pid=".142W.2/11" class="indent">*While the estimates have been historically referred to as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), under the new European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95) they are more correctly referred to as Gross Value Added (GVA) at basic prices. From 2002 onwards, the term GVA is being used.</p>

These reflect the hard work done by My Noble Friend the Minister for Trade and Investment, Invest-UK in British Trade International and the Regional Development Agencies in seeking out inward investment in these more difficult conditions and promoting the UK as a top venue.

	<p pid=".148W.3/1">Public services (i.e. services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority) such as in health and education are excluded from the GATS. The GATS defines these as services supplied neither on a commercial basis nor in competition with other service suppliers.

	<p pid=".148W.3/2">The United Kingdom has already made GATS commitments, allowing foreign companies to provide private services in the UK in the health and education area. The Government have made clear to the House in the past that we will not make further commitments that could call into question our continued ability to maintain public health and education services.</p>
	<p pid=".148W.3/3">My Department has recently issued a consultation document inviting views on requests for liberalisation of services that we have received in the current round of GATS negotiations. The document was drawn up in close co-operation with the Departments of Health, and Education and Skills, with input from the Scottish Executive and other devolved Administrations. Comments are requested by <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-03">3 January 2003</phrase>. My noble Friend the Minister for Trade and Investment has written to all Members drawing attention to this consultation. The document is available on the DTI website <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/worldtrade/service.htm">www.dti .gov.uk/worldtrade/service.htm</a> and printed copies are being placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".154W.2/2">The TRIPS agreement lays down procedures for extending implementation deadlines for the Least Developed Countries (LDC). The general implementation deadline is 2005 but an extension to 2016 was agreed for pharmaceutical products at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha. There is no specific mechanism for extending TRIPS implementation deadlines for all developing countries.</p>
	<p pid=".154W.2/3">The UK Government work through the EU on issues relating to the TRIPS agreement. The UK Government support the development of objective criteria to form the basis upon which extensions of TRIPS transition periods should be agreed. The UK Government therefore support the introduction into TRIPS of a mechanism for extending transition periods for individual developing countries.</p>
