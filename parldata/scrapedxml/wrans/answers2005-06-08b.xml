	<p pid="b.565W.3/1">Ministers meet regularly with officials from the Rural Payments Agency (RPA). RPA is part way through a major change programme which, since the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), has focused on the introduction and administration of the single payment scheme (SPS). The time scales for the implementation of the change programme were acknowledged to be stretching from the outset. Despite this challenge, RPA has made considerable progress with the introduction of the single payment scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.565W.3/2">By the <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-16">16 May</phrase> closing date 115,196 applications to the SPS had been received, and I am satisfied that this covers not only applications from those previously in receipt of subsidy but has also brought additional land into the scheme thus contributing to the Department's sustainable agricultural and environmental objectives. The number of applications received is in line with RPA's projections for applicants to the new scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.565W.3/3">RPA has been working closely with the National Farmers Union and other industry representatives to ensure the successful launch of the SPS. This was a very large undertaking reflecting the scale of the reform of the CAP successfully negotiated by this Government, and included:</p>
	<p pid="b.565W.3/4" class="indent">the distribution of a series of policy booklets and three detailed guidance booklets;</p>
	<p pid="b.565W.3/5" class="indent">the provision of extensive information on the RPA website, resulting in approximately 6,000 hits per day at peak periods;</p>
	<p pid="b.565W.3/6" class="indent">a sustained media advertising campaign to existing customers and potential new applicants;</p>
	<p pid="b.565W.3/7" class="indent">undertaking, with Defra, 32 road shows across England attended by around 8,500 farmers;</p>
	<p pid="b.565W.3/8" class="indent">distribution of over 12,000 videos, CD-ROMs and DVDs with key excerpts of the road shows introducing and explaining the SPS; and</p>
	<p pid="b.565W.3/9" class="indent">the distribution of specimen forms to enable applicants to prepare the information required to apply for the scheme in advance of receiving the application form.</p>
	<p pid="b.565W.3/10">The change programme is closely monitored through a joint RPA/Defra programme board which reports via the permanent secretary to Ministers. The programme makes use of regular external reviews, including the Office for Government Commerce Gateway Review process, who reported in their latest review of the programme in January 2005 that the review team finds that the programme is under strong leadership and has very visible ministerial and Defra support. They also considered that the programme continues to be managed in a professional manner and given stability in the programme scope, there is the desire and capability to deliver the programme successfully against challenging time scales.</p>

	<p pid="b.575W.8/2">Recent discussions have focused on the review by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), in conjunction with the Department for Transport, of the future of provision of financial protection for consumers against the bankruptcy of air travel providers; on CAA guidance on the scope of the Civil Aviation (Air Travel Organisers' Licensing) Regulations; and on the three organisations continuing compliance with the requirements for approved bodies under the Package Travel Regulations.</p>

	<p pid="b.576W.3/1">Section 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 places a duty on specific agencies to consider the potential impact of all their decisions and activities on crime and disorder. The scope of section 17 was included in a wider review of the partnership provisions of the Act earlier this year. The review looked at how local agencies could better embed crime and disorder reduction into their core business. It also assessed whether section 17 currently covers the right agencies and bodies. I am considering the findings from the review and the Government will announce proposals for making partnership working more effective later in the year.</p>

We have recently re-doubled these efforts. We are also issuing guidance for applicants to help address some of the common mistakes which stakeholders inform us are being made on application forms and there will also be a revamp of the licensing pages on the DCMS website (<a href="http://www.culture.gov.uk">www.culture.gov.uk</a>) to make them more accessible for applicants. In addition, we have responded to requests from stakeholders seeking help on a number of issues including embedded restrictions; whether a personal licence holder must be at a premises at all times; and how transferred licences should be dealt with during the transitional period. The DCMS position on these matters has been circulated widely through the stakeholder groups and has helped ease the transitional process for both licensing authorities and applicants.</p>

To this end the Commission provides funding for a national helpline for Gypsies and Travellers for legal advice on housing matters and a pilot scheme to facilitate information and advice services for Gypsies and Travellers in Cambridgeshire on matters of social welfare law.

	<p pid="b.585W.6/1">In England, the Government have accepted each of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Long Term Care except the recommendation to provide free personal care in all settings.</p>
	<p pid="b.585W.6/2">People who are eligible for national health service continuing care and those whose assets fall below the lower threshold used in the residential care means test automatically receive free personal care.</p>
	<p pid="b.585W.6/3">Making personal care free for everyone carries a very substantial and increasing cost, but would not raise the standard or range of services available. The estimated cost for 2003&ndash;04 is &pound;1.5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.585W.6/4">The estimated costs for future years are shown in the table using 2003&ndash;04 constant prices. The projections take account of demographic change, in terms of numbers of older people by age, gender, household type and housing tenure. They assume that cost of care will rise by 2 per cent. per year in real terms, in line with average earnings. As with any projections, the figures should only be taken as broad estimates of the cost because of the uncertainty of projecting over such a long time scale.</p>
	<p pid="b.585W.6/5">Research conducted by personal social services research unit and the university of Leicester, for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, suggest that free personal and nursing care would increase United Kingdom public spending on long-term care for older people to &pound;42.6 billion in 2051 (1.45 per cent. of gross domestic product (GDP)) as opposed to &pound;35.4 billion (1.20 per cent. of GDP) under the current funding system (without free personal care). These projections are at constant 2000 prices.</p>

	<p pid="b.587W.14/1">Through the national programme for information technology (NPfTT), the NHS Connecting for Health agency of the Department is delivering systems to change the way the national health service delivers care, and the experience of patients. It is a key component of delivering a modern and patient-centred NHS. NPfTT is being implemented by national application service providers, responsible for purchasing and integrating IT systems common to all users nationally; and by local service providers, responsible for supplying and integrating services and systems to perform functions in the local setting and to link to the national system.</p>
	<p pid="b.587W.14/2">A great many systems and services have already been put in place, including hospital-wide patient administration systems as well as many service-specific systems, in areas such as pathology, accident and emergency, maternity and mental health. For example, the programme has delivered a quality management and analysis system, providing general practitioners with evidence and feedback on the quality of care they deliver, to 8,300 GP practices covering over 20,000 registered users. Single assessment process technology is already streamlining the way personal details and care information for older people are gathered, stored and shared, so that people need only give their information once and can be certain that it will be shared appropriately by all those professionals involved in their care.</p>
	<p pid="b.587W.14/3">We are currently seeing a considerable acceleration in the deployment of technology across the NHS. Some patients are able to book their hospital appointments electronically. The first electronic prescriptions were issued in February 2005, with numbers set to rise significantly over the coming months. The first NPfTT&mdash;delivered picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) went live earlier this year. Around 5,500 GP sites, and 1,500 secondary care sites&mdash;some 7000 in total&mdash;have already been connected to the new national network (N3), giving fast and reliable broadband access to over 350,000 users. Almost 25,000 clinicians are now registered users of the national care record data 'spine', almost 3,500 of them general practitioners. Over 124,000 users are now registered with Contact, the secure email and directory service for the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.587W.14/4">Delivery of new software to support payment by results is on schedule to be implemented in June 2005, and a secondary uses service that will hold anonymised and pseudonymised patient information for research, trend analysis and public health monitoring is being created. In addition, a 'Map of Medicine' software package that gives every clinician access to the overall bank of NHS clinical knowledge at the click of a button has been developed and will be incorporated into systems upgrades.</p>
	<p pid="b.587W.14/5">Altogether, we estimate that something over one and a half million patients have already received improved and safer care as a result of these and other NPfIT development, a figure which is increasing every week.</p>
	<p pid="b.587W.14/6">This represents encouraging progress towards a target of full integration of health and social care systems in England by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.587W.14/7">More detailed information about the national programme and future planned developments can be found on the NHS Connecting for Health website at: <a href="http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk">www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk</a></p>

	<p pid="b.589W.6/1">The UK has committed &pound;16 million to the &pound;186 million multi-donor Pilot Programme for the Preservation of Brazilian Rain Forests. Part of DFID's support is provided through a trust fund managed by the World Bank and part as directly managed projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.589W.6/2">Through the trust fund, the UK has supported the Integrated Project for Protection of Indigenous Peoples and Lands of Legal Amazonia (PPTAL). This project, which started in 1996, helps to validate and register lands claimed by indigenous peoples through physical demarcation within the rain forest so that they can be used and protected by indigenous communities. So far a total of 35 million hectares have been demarcated (the size of the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands).</p>
	<p pid="b.589W.6/3">In addition, DFID supports the Indigenous Peoples Demonstration Projects, another component of the multilateral Pilot Programme for the Preservation of the Brazilian Rain Forests, in partnership with the Ministry of Environment. This programme supports activities that aim at strengthening indigenous peoples' organisations throughout Amazonia to negotiate for and manage better services for their communities. Specifically the programme provides funds and technical assistance to help preserve indigenous cultures, protect indigenous lands against encroachment from outsiders, and provide opportunities for economic development. Indigenous leaders are being trained and supported to promote their rights and entitlements to basic services, and to develop a network among themselves that can strengthen social cohesion in Amazon communities. The programme, also supported by German financial and technical assistance, helps to facilitate these new relationships with central and local governments.</p>

	<p pid="b.589W.9/1">Brazil has reduced the rate of HIV infections since 1997 and there has been a relative stabilisation of the epidemic has been observed. Current estimates indicate that about 650,000 people in the 15&ndash;49 age group of the population are infected. HIV/AIDS is prevalent in all regions of the country but has spread beyond groups at particular risk such as men who have sex with men and injecting drug users. Heterosexual transmission is now responsible for a growing share of HIV infections, with women increasingly affected. Data indicate that risk increases with illiteracy, low levels of education, and poor environments such as urban slums. Although national HIV prevalence among pregnant women has remained stable at below 1 per cent. for the past five years, considerably higher levels&mdash;up to 6 per cent.&mdash;have been found in some states.</p>
	<p pid="b.589W.9/2">The role of injecting drug use in Brazil's epidemic remains significant. In some areas, drug users constitute at least half of the AIDS cases reported by state Ministries of Health. Harm reduction programmes have been associated with a steep drop in HIV prevalence among injecting drug users in recent years&mdash;by 40 per cent. in some cities such as Salvador in the poorer north of the country. In the south of the country, however, rates remain high suggesting that prevention programmes need to continue to target injecting drug users.</p>
	<p pid="b.589W.9/3">The Brazil national AIDS programme has recently stepped up its drive to identify and treat other Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), particularly neo-natal syphilis, which will have an important impact in the poorest parts of the country. Brazil's media make a strong contribution to prevention programmes and the recent policy decision to refuse US$24 million of funding from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) because of conditions attached that would preclude effective working among sex workers demonstrates that Brazil is committed to making universal access achievable.</p>
	<p pid="b.589W.9/4">Progress in containing the epidemic can be attributed to strong policy implementation by the National AIDS Programme and the Ministry of Health in the following ways: Brazil provides universal access to Anti-Retroviral Vaccines (ARVs) that are free of charge; the national AIDS programme supports well-designed and targeted information, education and communication programmes to help prevent infection and support people living with AIDS; there is wide and informed involvement of civil society and faith-based groups; and there is a strong focus on sexual health especially for young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.589W.9/5">Brazil is sharing its expertise (and in some cases ARVs free of charge) with other countries in Latin America, Central America, the Caribbean, and Portuguese-speaking African countries through technical co-operation funded by the Brazilian Government with support from donors such as DFID.</p>

	<p pid="b.590W.2/1">DFID is one of a number of UK Government Departments that has supported efforts to reduce deforestation of the Brazilian tropical rain forests.</p>
	<p pid="b.590W.2/2">DFID has committed &pound;16 million to the &pound;186 million multi-donor Pilot Programme for the Preservation of Brazilian Rain Forests (PPG7). Through this, DFID has been actively involved in the preparation of a proposal for a law on the management of public forests. If approved and implemented, this law is expected to reduce deforestation significantly.</p>
	<p pid="b.590W.2/3">The one on-going DFID PPG7 project is the Indigenous Peoples Demonstration Project which is enhancing the capacity of indigenous peoples' organisations throughout Amazonia to preserve indigenous cultures, protect indigenous lands against encroachment from outsiders, and to identify and generate opportunities for economic development for a total community of 250,000 indigenous peoples.</p>
	<p pid="b.590W.2/4">DFID has just completed a number of other projects to support the efforts of the Brazilian Government to reduce deforestation of tropical rainforest. These included the testing of new ways to involve local people in managing natural resources and the environment; support for the assessment of the impact that managing the forest has on the genetic diversity of tree species; and helping Brazilian institutes of higher education include subjects that are more relevant to working with poor people whose lives depend on sustainable forests.</p>
	<p pid="b.590W.2/5">DFID is also contributing through multilateral organisations&mdash;in particular, by its contribution to the European Commission's Asia Latin America programme which supports projects in the Amazon; and its membership of the World Bank which, for example, approved a $0.5 billion loan last year to promote environmental sustainability in Brazil. DFID is a major contributor to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) that is creating and maintaining protected areas in the Amazon through the Amazon Region Protected Areas Programme (ARPA).</p>
	<p pid="b.590W.2/6">DFID also provides support to civil society organisations involved in forest management in Brazil. DFID's commitment of &pound;800,000 a year for 2005&ndash;06 and 2007&ndash;08 to the World Wildlife Fund under a Partnership Programme Agreement for Latin America and Caribbean will enhance their work in Brazil.</p>
	<p pid="b.590W.2/7">Future DFID support for efforts to combat deforestation will be through our contributions to multilateral organisations working in the region. Further details of DFID's future role in the region are set out in the document entitled &quot;Regional Assistance Plan for Latin America 2004&ndash;2007&quot;. I have arranged for copies of this document to be placed in both Libraries of House.</p>

	<p pid="b.592W.5/1">On my last visit to India in October 2004, 1 met both the Minister of State for Health and the Head of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). We discussed how best the Department for International Development's assistance to the National AIDS Control Programme could be used and subsequently agreed to extend our support into the highly vulnerable states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The Secretary of State also raised the question of domestic funding to the country's HIV/AIDS programme with the Indian Finance Minister when he visited India in December 2004 and was pleased to note an overall increase.</p>
	<p pid="b.592W.5/2">India has an estimated 5.13 million people living with HIV, second only to South Africa in numbers, although prevalence is low, at 0.92 per cent. The epidemic is concentrated in six high prevalence states (Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur, Andhra Pradesh and Nagaland) and is overwhelmingly sexually transmitted.</p>
	<p pid="b.592W.5/3">In India, the Department for International Development supports the Government of India's National AIDS Control Programme with &pound;123 million over seven years to March 2007. DFID's support consists of Financial Aid through the Government for Targeted Interventions with high risk groups in eight focus states: Orissa, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and most recently Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Targeted interventions are specifically designed to reach out to these hard to reach vulnerable groups where the prevalence of disease is highest (sex workers, men having sex with men, injecting drug users etc.) with innovative programmes to contain the spread of the disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.592W.5/4">DFID also provides a package of Technical Cooperation which funds, among other things, a Sexual Health Resource Centre, mass media campaigns by the BBC World Service Trust and condom promotion strategies in the focus states. Funding also goes to the UNAIDS country office.</p>
	<p pid="b.592W.5/5">Last year, DFID India carried out a review of its support to the Government of India's National AIDS Control Programme to ensure that our support could be re-aligned with the current state of the epidemic in India and with new DFID policy, taking account of the UK HIV and AIDS Strategy &quot;Taking Action&quot; which I launched in India during my visit.</p>

	<p pid="b.594W.3/1">The Government of Zimbabwe has not asked for international assistance in responding to the recent crop failure. Indeed, President Mugabe has declared that Zimbabwe will import not only 1.2 million metric tonnes (MT) of grain for humanitarian distribution; it will also import 600,000 MT of grain to rebuild the country's strategic reserve. Such imports would more than meet Zimbabwe's food needs. If this situation were to change, the UK would consider a request for humanitarian assistance on the same basis as in other parts of the world&mdash;on the basis of humanitarian need, and our ability to provide relief which would reach effectively those in need, without political interference. DFID has been able to do this successfully in Zimbabwe over several years since the on-going humanitarian crisis began in 2001 and would envisage any future UK assistance being provided under the same arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.603W.0/1">We have been following closely and with concern developments since operation drive out rubbish began recently, including informal sector housing and traders. We condemn the wholesale and callous destruction of people's homes and livelihoods caused by the security forces in urban areas across Zimbabwe as part of a &quot;clean up&quot; campaign. The Government of Zimbabwe's own figures indicate that nearly 23,000 people have been arrested since the operation began and many thousands rendered homeless. This has inflicted even greater hardship and suffering on the innocent and needy who are being punished for the regime's failed policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.603W.0/2">Department for International Development funds are being used in provision of immediate assistance to affected households who do not have the capacity to absorb the shock themselves (particularly children and the chronically ill). We are pressing the UN to take a lead in assessing the extent and impact of the regime's operation, and the scope for international assistance to those who are in immediate humanitarian need.</p>
	<p pid="b.603W.0/3">We understand that the UN's world food programme Director, James Morris, raised the issue with Mugabe on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-01">1 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.603W.0/4">We regularly press the Government of Zimbabwe on our human rights concerns, of which this is only the latest example. We also maintain a dialogue with key African states on Zimbabwe focusing on key developments of concern such as this. We are also discussing a response with our EU partners.</p>

The United Nations development programme agrees that the Government of Zimbabwe's fast track programme is inconsistent with these principles. Concerns about land seizures are just one of the areas of concern we raise regularly with the Government of Zimbabwe, both bilaterally and with our international partners.</p>

	<p pid="b.606W.5/2">Severely disabled people who claimed and qualified for the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance before reaching age 65 may continue to receive it after that age if they continue to meet the conditions of entitlement. If they choose to do so, they can use it to obtain a vehicle through the Motability scheme. Disability living allowance is focused on providing extra financial help to people who are severely disabled early, or relatively early, in life and as a result may have less opportunity to work and save. It is not available to people who become disabled after reaching age 65. However, attendance allowance provides them with well targeted help with their disability-related extra costs and helps maintain their independence. It is a tax-free, non-contributory benefit which is not income-related and is currently worth up to &pound;60.60 per week. It is part of the wide range of help that the Government makes available to older people.</p>

	<p pid="b.607W.5/1">The Government have introduced a number of measures that directly address the reduction in pension that individuals can face when their scheme winds-up with insufficient funds. The Government have:</p>
	<p pid="b.607W.5/2" class="indent">Introduced the Financial Assistance Scheme which will help those most seriously affected by pension scheme failures before the PPF was established;</p>
	<p pid="b.607W.5/3" class="indent">Introduced the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) which is an historic step forward in protecting scheme members. It will, for the first time, pay compensation to members of eligible defined benefit and hybrid occupational pension schemes when there is a qualifying insolvency event in relation to the employer and where there are insufficient assets in the pension scheme to cover PPF levels of compensation;</p>
	<p pid="b.607W.5/4" class="indent">Introduced a new statutory priority order when the PPF started up for business on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>. The new priority order applies to schemes which commence winding up on or after that date. It ensures that members of schemes wound up due to employer insolvency, with sufficient funds to meet more than the benefits guaranteed by the PPF, do not find themselves in a worse position than if the scheme had less funds and was covered by the PPF; and</p>
	<p pid="b.607W.5/5" class="indent">Introduced legislation that increases the debt on the employer to the 'full buy-out' level, as we believe that wherever possible employers should ensure that there are sufficient funds in schemes which are winding up to meet the full costs of the rights accrued by scheme members.</p>
	<p pid="b.607W.5/6">It is also important to take action before schemes reach this point. The Government have established the Pensions Regulator (the Regulator) which replaced the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra) on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase>. The Regulator will take a proactive and risk-based approach to regulation and, in addition to the powers inherited from Opra, will have a range of new and increased powers to protect members of work-based pension schemes. The Regulator will concentrate its resources where there is the greatest risk to the security of members' benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.607W.5/7">The Government fully understands, and shares the concerns of those people whose pensions are affected when their scheme is wound up. The measures we have introduced ensure that trustees and employers have clear obligations and incentives to protect members' benefits. The Government will continue to review the situation.</p>

	<p pid="b.610W.3/1">The Government greatly values the contribution made by the thousands of private and voluntary nurseries, playgroups and pre-schools to early education and child care. We are determined that these sectors should continue to play a full part in the provision of early years education and child care as these services are expanded. The day nursery sector now cares for more children aged under five than any other type of child care with the vast majority of day nurseries in the private sector (85 per cent.). 24 per cent. of all day nurseries are in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged areas and over 60 per cent. of all neighbourhood nurseries were successfully delivered by the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.610W.3/2">Responsibility for the strategic planning of location of children's centres lies with local authorities. Stakeholders including private and voluntary day nurseries are key to the development of current and future children's centres. Providers are regularly invited to work with local authorities in the process of identifying current needs as well as developing plans for existing and future involvement. Local authorities are expected to take advantage of the expertise that many private and voluntary sector providers offer.</p>
	<p pid="b.610W.3/3">Following the Children Act 2004, local authorities are working with key partners as part of children's trust arrangements to plan and commission services strategically. They are encouraged to work with private and other providers to assess current levels of child care availability as well as likely future requirements of the community. Many schools are expected to develop the core offer of extended services by working in partnership with existing local private or voluntary sector providers.</p>

	<p pid="b.611W.0/1">In 2003 the Department commissioned Cambridge and Manchester universities to carry out a joint study of teaching approaches for different types of special educational needs (SEN). The study found a large degree of overlap between different approaches&mdash;in essence, good teaching skills are much the same for all pupils, regardless of whether or not they have SEN, or the type of SEN.</p>
	<p pid="b.611W.0/2">That study did not include a detailed assessment of the effectiveness of different specialised approaches in teaching children with hearing impairment. We are considering what further work might be undertaken in that area.</p>
	<p pid="b.611W.0/3">From 2004 the Department has&mdash;as part of the Annual School Census&mdash;collected information on the type of Special Educational Need of individual pupils. This enables us to monitor the progress of pupils with different types of SEN, including those with hearing impairments, in various settings.</p>
	<p pid="b.611W.0/4">As with other categories of special need, it is important that parents of children with hearing impairment feel supported. The Department's Early Support Programme has published an information booklet for parents on hearing impairment. The Programme has also produced a monitoring protocol for deaf babies and children. This is designed to help families and professionals document the progress of children in the first three years or so after deafness has been identified.</p>

	<p pid="b.611W.3/2">We encourage mainstream and supplementary schools to work together to share experiences, expertise and resources. There are many positive examples of collaboration, including schools that make their facilities available free of charge or for a 'peppercorn' rent.</p>

It will be for schools, working with key partners and in consultation with other key stakeholders, including parents and local communities, to decide what services they should offer. This will be based on a range of factors including the school's capacity to offer services; the need for particular services; and what already exists in the local community. From 2005&ndash;06 all local authorities are receiving funding to support the development of extended services in their schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.612W.5/1">When the original report of the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (IEGMP)&mdash;known as the Stewart Report&mdash;was published in 2000 we informed all schools that it was available. Schools were also told that the Department of Health leaflet 'Mobile Phones and Health' was available, and we drew their attention to the paragraphs relating to children and young people under 16. Our guidance on Teachernet states that schools, in drawing up health and safety policies, may wish to take into account advice from the UK chief medical officers that where children and young people do use mobile phones, they should be encouraged to:</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.5/2" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> use mobile phones for essential purposes only;</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.5/3" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> keep all calls short because talking for long periods prolongs exposure to radiation.</p>

	<p pid="b.612W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.8/2">The Department, the Home Office and the Medical Research Council have jointly funded a large-scale research study of twins looking at the aetiology and developmental pathways of psychopathic tendencies in children.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.8/3">This research found that in children with psychopathic tendencies, antisocial behaviour appeared to be strongly inherited. In contrast, the antisocial behaviour of children who did not have psychopathic tendencies was mainly influenced by environmental factors. These findings suggest that psychopathic tendencies may have a large heritable component. However, environmental factors are still important and early intervention may ameliorate the impact of these traits in later life.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.8/4">The Department has also produced an expert paper entitled &quot;Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD): Children and Adolescents&quot; which explores the scope for preventing ASPD by intervening in adolescence. This can be found on the website of the National Forensic Mental Health Research and Development Programme at <a href="http://www.nfmhp.org.uk">www.nfmhp.org.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.8/5">The following associated research is currently being undertaken:</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.8/6" class="indent">An evaluation of a pilot intervention (aimed at children and parents) for hard to reach children with conduct disorder.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.8/7" class="indent">A longitudinal study of children given the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to identify the prevalence of, and clinical, genetic and environmental risk factors for ASPD in adolescence.</p>
	<p pid="b.612W.8/8" class="indent">A review of case files from the young abusers project to explore the links between juvenile sexual offending and severe personality disorder.</p>

It is planned to undertake fieldwork involving a sample of 10 local authorities in order to explore fully the range of relevant issues, to enable the development of an informative and workable data collection process. This fieldwork is expected to be completed by the end of 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.614W.2/1">Where a school is oversubscribed, it naturally follows that not every parent will be able to have their preference met. Parents who fail to secure a place at any of their preferred schools will be offered an alternative place; usually the nearest school to their home with places available. Parents should be able to make informed decisions on the likelihood of being able to secure a place at their preferred school and all local authorities already publish information for parents to help them do so. However, we would expect local authorities to continue looking at ways in which parents could be better informed.</p>
