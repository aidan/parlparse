	<p pid=".420W.6/1">Government policy is to encourage the implementation of technologies that reduce the noise arising from road traffic wherever these are cost effective and do not have adverse consequences on safety. Categorisation of sites for low noise surfacing is primarily based on maintenance need. In addition, we have criteria for categorisation for noise reduction of roads with concrete surfaces. We announced these criteria on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-17">17 October 2001</phrase>; they are:</p>
	<p pid=".420W.6/2" class="indent">1. that wherever possible the application of quieter surfaces will fit in with normal maintenance needs;</p>
	<p pid=".420W.6/3" class="indent">2. that priority will be given to those sites where treatment would benefit the greatest number of people;</p>
	<p pid=".420W.6/4" class="indent">3. that the works will be carried out in such a way as to minimise disruption to general public and users of the network;</p>
	<p pid=".420W.6/5" class="indent">4. that priority will be given to roads, opened since June 1988, where actual noise levels have turned out to be significantly higher than predicted at the time of Public Inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".420W.6/6">Priority is given to road surfaces that are deteriorating and to locations where road safety is an issue. Where the resurfacing is specifically for noise reduction purposes priority will be given to those cases in which the actual noise levels exceed those predicted by at least three decibels, or where more than 100 properties per kilometre are affected by excess noise.</p>
	<p pid=".420W.6/7">During 2000&ndash;01 4.3 per cent. of the Highways Agency's core network was resurfaced including 3.5 per cent. with quieter surfacing. During 2001&ndash;02 the figures were 4.2 per cent. and 3.8 per cent. respectively, and in 2002&ndash;03 5.5 per cent. and 5.0 per cent. respectively. In the current year, 2003&ndash;04, the Highways Agency estimate these figures will be 5.0 per cent. and 4.6 per cent. respectively.</p>

	<p pid=".421W.2/2">We have considerably tightened the enforcement of Vehicle Excise Duty through the &quot;continuous registration&quot; package of measures. By introducing continuous registration and using modern technology, we are improving the accuracy of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's vehicle register to the benefit of law enforcement and the honest motorist. To deal with short term Vehicle Excise Duty evasion, we have introduced fines for those over a month overdue with relicensing their vehicle. We are tackling those vehicles already outside the system of registration and licensing with enhanced enforcement using wheel clamping and ANPR cameras. By enhancing the quality of the vehicle register these measures are intended to assist the police in the fight against crime, and to assist local authorities in tracking down and enforcing costs against those who abandon vehicles.</p>

	<p pid=".425W.3/1">I am unable to comment on individual cases for reasons of medical confidentiality. However, the Ministry of Defence takes the health concerns of Service and former Service personnel very seriously. I therefore urge any personnel who served on Op TELIC who have concerns about health matters to consult their Service medical officer or general practitioner, who will investigate thoroughly. Service and ex-Service personnel are also entitled to be seen at the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (GVMAP) on referral from their doctor. The GVMAP provides as full a diagnosis as possible to veterans, assesses patients and recommends treatment.</p>

	<p pid=".428W.2/1">Asbestos pipes have been used extensively by the water industry without giving rise to any quality problems. However, the Drinking Water Inspectorate issued an information letter on behalf of the Secretary of State, which reminded water companies of the Asbestos (Prohibitions) (Amendment) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999 No. 2373). These Regulations effectively precluded the use of new asbestos cement pipes to carry drinking water, because of health and safety issues associated with cutting the material, not because of any concerns about possible effects of asbestos pipes on drinking water quality.</p>

	<p pid=".428W.5/1">The Government estimate that domestic and international aviation emissions could account for 20&ndash;25 per cent. of UK carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. This calculation assumes that the 60 per cent. goal specified in the Energy White Paper for the domestic economy is achieved. If international aviation were to be included in the 60 per cent. goal emissions from other sectors would have to be around 15&ndash;20 per cent. below their Energy White Paper target to compensate.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.5/2">This calculation is based on an assumption of three new runways in the south east and does not reflect the impact of any economic instruments.

	<p pid=".429W.8/1">The EU agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-26">26 June 2003</phrase> to a radical shift in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). In future, the bulk of subsidies will no longer be linked to production, freeing farmers to produce the safe, high quality food which people want and bringing environmental improvements.</p>
	<p pid=".429W.8/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-12">12 February</phrase> my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, announced how she proposed to implement key features of that groundbreaking reform in England. We will decouple fully in 2005 and move over an eight year transition period towards a flat rate Single Farm Payment to farmers. England will be split into two regions&mdash;land in the severely disadvantaged areas (SDAs) of the less favoured areas (LFAs) and all other eligible land. Different rates will apply in these regions. This represents a decisive irreversible and forward-looking shift consistent with the direction that we have already set in the Sustainable Farming and Food Strategy (SFFS) and in the June 2003 CAP reform negotiations.</p>
	<p pid=".429W.8/3">If farmers seize the market opportunities offered by these reforms, it is estimated that UK farm incomes could increase by around 5 per cent. relative to the 2003 Total Income from Farming, and farmers will be freed from some of the bureaucracy associated with the old subsidy schemes. For some of the poorer farms this change in support represents a chance to get off the treadmill of small scale and unprofitable commodity production.</p>
	<p pid=".429W.8/4">There are also Defra led initiatives already available to help poorer farmers. These include the Farm Business Advice Service to help farmers adjust and respond to the difficult trading conditions of recent years and a number of benchmarking initiatives to help struggling farmers see how they can bring their performance up to the level of more successful businesses.</p>

CITES aims to ensure that where trade is carried out, it is done in a sustainable way that ensures the long-term survival of all species. It has been very successful in this respect and is widely respected for its ability to produce effective regulatory measures that are based on sound science. We will, therefore, continue to support CITES both practically and financially.</p>

	<p pid=".432W.3/1">Ministers have become increasingly concerned that agricultural tenancy legislation, together with the terms contained in agricultural tenancy agreements, combine to prevent some tenant farmers from participating in diversification and agri-environment activities. Income from diversified activities might also affect succession rights under the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986. In view of these concerns, we reconvened the Tenancy Reform Industry Group in November 2002. The Group was asked to make recommendations to improve the health of the tenancy sector, and in particular, to encourage greater participation in farm diversification among tenant farmers.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.3/2">The Tenancy Reform Industry Group presented its report to Government in June 2003. The report, which has the support of all Group members, made a number of wide ranging recommendations for increasing flexibility within agricultural tenancies. These include updating the statutory succession provisions in the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 to allow income derived from farm diversification projects undertaken with the consent of the landlord to be taken into account in assessing eligibility for succession to an agricultural tenancy. The Group also recommended a code of practice on diversification within agricultural tenancies, backed up by an independent adjudication scheme to which disputes can be referred when they cannot be settled between parties.</p>
	<p pid=".432W.3/3">The Government responded to the Report of the Tenancy Reform Industry Group shortly before Christmas. The Government accepted all of the Group's recommendations for amendments to the existing tenancy legislation and the proposed code of practice. It is anticipated that changes to the legislation will be effected by means of an Order under the Regulatory Reform Act. It is hoped that a formal consultation document on the Regulatory Reform Order will be issued later in the year.</p>

	<p pid=".435W.2/1">Fish stock assessments are undertaken by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and are linked to the sea areas in which individual fish stocks are mainly found. They will often embrace the waters of more than one country as well as the high seas. Account is taken of data contributed by all of the main countries exploiting each stock and comprises officially recorded information on landings and fishing effort, plus scientific data on size and age structure, growth rate, maturity, and discard rates (when available). Most assessments also use the year to year trend in relative abundance estimated as catch per effort from independent national and international research vessel surveys. The absolute accuracy of assessments is difficult to estimate at the present time but judgments on the robustness of the underlying data will be reflected in the scientific advice provided regarding future levels of stock exploitation.</p>

The programme is a rolling one and other houses will have benefited from projects approved prior to 1997 which will have been funded in the period. There is likely to be an element of double-counting in these figures where different projects (for example for annual beach recharge) have benefited the same houses. Such double-counting could not be removed, and neither could the total be broken down by constituency, without incurring disproportionate cost. The Department has agreed Service Delivery Agreement (SDA) Target 27 with HM Treasury to reduce flood risk to a further 80,000 houses (with no double-counting) during the Spending Review 2002 period&mdash;2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06. Because of the measurement method used for the SDA target (counting houses at project completion rather than approval) this figure will include some of the houses included in the 290,000 figure above.</p>

Decisions regarding which flood and coastal defence projects to promote, their timing and appropriate solutions are matters for the operating authorities&mdash;the Environment Agency (EA), local authorities and (in areas with special drainage needs) internal drainage boards.</p>
	<p pid=".437W.2/2">The list which has been placed in the Libraries of the House, shows capital flood defence works projects (excluding those for flood warning or primarily to protect against coastal erosion) approved for grant since <phrase class="date" code="1997-04-01">1 April 1997</phrase>. Of course the programme as a whole is a rolling one and some projects approved prior to 1997 will also have received funding in the period. I regret that I am unable to break the list down by constituency without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".437W.5/1">We recognise that there are around 1.9 million properties in England in flood risk areas that are at some risk of flooding.</p>
	<p pid=".437W.5/2">Defra provides grant aid to the flood and coastal defence operating authorities to support their capital schemes to reduce flood risk, including through the improvement of flood warnings. These projects must meet specified criteria and an appropriate priority score to attract Defra funding but decisions regarding which projects to promote and their timing rest with these authorities. The principal operating authority for flood risk is the Environment Agency (EA) but local authorities (LAs) and, in areas with special drainage needs, internal drainage boards (IDBs) also carry out works on a much smaller scale overall.</p>
	<p pid=".437W.5/3">The effective management of flood and coastal erosion risk is a priority for Government. This is demonstrated by the substantial increase in funding in recent years and for the SR2002 period. For example, total Government expenditure on flood and coastal defence was &pound;310 million in 1996&ndash;97, &pound;439 million estimated in 2003&ndash;04 and is planned to be &pound;564 million in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".437W.5/4">Defra has two relevant SDA targets under SR 2002. One relates to the delivery of the enhanced flood and coastal defence capital programme over the SR2002 period, reducing the risk to life, to major infrastructure, environment assets and to some 80,000 houses. The other is to implement the outcomes of the flood and coastal defence funding review, including funding the Environment Agency's flood defence service through a single stream of Defra grant in aid and transferring to the Agency responsibility for all rivers creating the greatest flood risk.</p>
	<p pid=".437W.5/5">In addition, Defra has initiated work on a major new Government strategy for flood and coastal erosion risk management, including consideration of possible new funding streams.</p>

	<p pid=".438W.5/2">The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs is unlikely to be in a position to provide direct assistance to employers seeking advice on illegal working. However, My hon. Friend, the Minister for Citizenship, Immigration and Counter Terrorism, chairs the Illegal Working Steering Group which comprises representatives of the commercial sectors where illegal work is most prevalent. The steering group has examined ways in which employers can be encouraged and supported in carrying out checks under section 8 of the Asylum and immigration Act 1996. Following discussions with the steering group the Government have consulted on measures to strengthen the document checks of prospective employees that employers must make under section 8. The Government are now planning to bring forward revised measures.</p>

	<p pid=".440W.0/1">The most recent estimate of the hen harrier population is based on the results of the 1998 survey of hen harriers in the UK. A total of between 450&ndash;591 territorial pairs were found in the UK with a best estimate of 521 pairs. The full results were published in the journal Bird Study 48:341&ndash;353 in 2001. There are no directly comparable data for any of the previous 10 years but there is thought not to have been any overall change in the size of the population since the last estimate was published in 1993, for the period 1988&ndash;1989 (Bird Study 40: 1&ndash;11).</p>
	<p pid=".440W.0/2">The information regarding breeding pairs of hen harriers is not available for the whole of the UK. However, there were 17 known breeding attempts by hen harriers in England in 2003. Just eight of these were successful. A further five attempts failed before it could be established whether eggs had been laid.</p>
	<p pid=".440W.0/3">There are currently no steps being taken to encourage the reintroduction of breeding hen harriers to lowland England. The conservation effort for hen harriers in England is focused in upland moorland areas in northern England where hen harriers have nested regularly in recent decades. We believe that a cessation of illegal persecution in England, and elsewhere in the UK, would allow the population to recover naturally, obviating the need for any reintroduction programme. Furthermore, we believe that, in contrast to the Red Kite programme, the reintroduction would not be in accordance with IUCN guidelines, insofar as we cannot be certain that the factors which brought about their loss from the English lowlands (almost certainly habitat loss and persecution) no longer pertain.</p>
	<p pid=".440W.0/4">The Government have not specifically conducted an analysis of the impact of agricultural changes on the breeding success of hen harriers. However, agricultural change and persecution are widely held to have been responsible for the historical decline, to currently low levels, of the UK population. Currently, illegal persecution appears to be the main factor limiting hen harrier population size and breeding success over much of its range.</p>
	<p pid=".440W.0/5">This contrasts with Orkney, where the population has declined dramatically since the end of the 1970s. The decline here is thought to relate to declining prey availability, resulting from changes in agriculture, particularly a decrease in the area of rough grazing and an increase in sheep densities. Full details were published in Biological Conservation 111: 377&ndash;384 in 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".440W.0/6">It should be noted that in the absence of illegal persecution, hen harrier numbers might be expected to increase, if moorland burning regimes for both agricultural and grouse management purposes are altered. This would allow the development of taller heather swards and thus an increase in the area of suitable nesting habitat available to hen harriers. English Nature's Hen Harrier Recovery Project has shown that the inappropriate burning of moorland is a serious problem for the small number of hen harriers nesting in England. This results in the loss of nesting habitat and, in some cases, the destruction of active nests.</p>

One of several very strict pre-conditions which must be met before any sales can take place is that the CITES Secretariat must be satisfied that the importing countries are able to effectively regulate their domestic ivory trade to prevent any illegal ivory from entering into these markets. We will therefore be working in co-operation with the EU member states and other CITES parties to make sure that this, and all the other strict conditions, are met in full before any sales are allowed to go ahead.</p>

	<p pid=".446W.2/1">Ministers welcomed the final report of the Raptor Working Group, in 2000, as providing Government a consensus view from organisations representing statutory and non-governmental conservation, game-management and racing pigeon interests as to desirable actions to reduce conflicts with birds of prey. The statutory nature conservation agencies and others, co-ordinated through various fora, are taking the detailed recommendations of the Working Group forward. Monitoring of raptor populations provides feedback as to the status of different populations. To this end, the extent and scale of illegal persecution of birds of prey continues to give cause for concern, as does, in particular, the population status of the hen harrier in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".446W.5/1">Birds of prey are an important part of the natural biodiversity of the UK and the health of their populations is widely recognised as a key measure of ecosystem health. While we recognise that some specific conflicts occasionally arise with human interests, notably on grouse moors, with racing pigeons, and with lowland gamebirds, we are not aware of any land in the UK where biodiversity more generally is endangered by raptors. The legal means of control for raptors are limited. Government established a Raptor Working Group in 1995, involving a wide range of stakeholder interests, to advise, inter alia &quot;on statutory and other mechanism for the resolution of problems&quot;. The UK Raptor Working Group's report, published in 2000, recommends &quot;enhanced enforcement of existing legislation to seek to eliminate illegal killing of birds of prey&quot;.

	<p pid=".447W.2/1">Raptor populations in the UK are monitored through a number of schemes. Information on these schemes is comprehensively summarised in table 2.4 of the final report of the UK Raptor Working Group, a copy of which is in the House of Commons Library. There is no national provision for monitoring the impact of raptors in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".447W.2/2">There have been no studies conducted on the impacts of raptors on the brown hare population. But the impact of raptors on game birds was studied and reviewed in the report of the UK Raptor Study Group.</p>
	<p pid=".447W.2/3">With regards to lambs the Scottish Executive and Scottish Natural Heritage, commissioned a study of the interaction between white-tailed eagles and lambs on Mull, in 1999 and 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".447W.2/4">The results showed that the diet of 11 pairs of white-tailed eagles during the breeding season was species-diverse but included lambs. While most pairs took few lambs, one pair took twice as many lambs as any other pair under study. A lack of alternative prey (rabbits) and the proximity of the nest to a lambing area in 1999 may have been responsible for higher lamb predation then. There was no information as to whether lambs killed by eagles would otherwise have survived.</p>
	<p pid=".447W.2/5">The study found that the number of lambs was small compared with overall lamb mortality, but sufficient to be an important loss to an individual farmer if eagle predation of lambs was additive and concentrated on one farm. There is no information to suggest that raptors take significant numbers of lambs elsewhere in the UK. Further information on this study is available in: Birds of Prey in a Changing Environment, pp471&ndash;479, published in 2003 by The Stationery Office.</p>

	<p pid=".448W.2/1">Raptor conservation projects form a small element of English Nature's conservation work. The two significant projects currently ongoing are the Red Kite Reintroduction Programme and the Hen Harrier Recovery Project, with costs to English Nature in 2003&ndash;04 of approximately &pound;10,000 and &pound;90, 000 respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".448W.2/2">The Red Kite Reintroduction Programme is a partnership between English Nature, RSPB and a wide range of other organisations and funding bodies. The majority of funding for this programme comes from external sources, including the Heritage Lottery Fund and sponsorship from private companies. The Red Kite re-establishment programme in England, together with a similar programme in Scotland and effective conservation measures for the species in Wales, has increased Red Kite numbers to a level where they constitute a small but significant proportion of the European total. As was intended at the outset, the project has helped enhance the international status of Red Kite, a species whose global distribution is restricted to Europe.</p>
	<p pid=".448W.2/3">English Nature's Hen Harrier Recovery Project is now entering its third year. It is staffed by a project coordinator and three seasonal fieldworkers. It has so far been successful in improving our understanding of the status of the hen harrier in England and of the factors affecting breeding numbers and success.</p>

	<p pid=".448W.5/1">The on-going red kite reintroduction programme is widely recognised as one of the most successful projects of its kind. It has already resulted in the re-establishment of self-sustaining red kite populations in three areas of England, with estimates of about 200 breeding pairs in the Chilterns, 30 in the Midlands and 16 in Yorkshire in 2003. Despite the success of the programme, less than 5 per cent. of the bird's potential British range has been recolonised. Further releases are anticipated, and from spring 2004, birds will be released in north-east England in order to encourage recolonisation of this part of the bird's former range.</p>
	<p pid=".448W.5/2">The red kite programme has also been instrumental in raising public awareness of conservation by focusing interest on a flagship species such as the red kite. It has also highlighted issues that still adversely affect birds of prey more generally in Britain. This includes the use of illegal poison baits in the open countryside and accidental secondary poisoning by modern, highly toxic rodenticides. The high profile of the red kite project has been utilised to help promote effective measures to tackle these issues, which will benefit a wide range of wildlife in addition to the red kite.</p>

Similarly, the CRB would have access to relevant local intelligence held by the police arising from a joint operation involving the police and an agency such as Customs and Excise. We are committed to bringing forward legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows to enable the CRB to access intelligence information held by non-&quot;Home Office&quot; police forces and other law enforcement agencies such as Customs and Excise and, in due course, the Serious Organised Crime Agency. It is currently open to bodies such as Customs and Excise, if they have information that, for example, connects a school employee to the smuggling of child pornography, to notify the relevant authorities of such information.</p>

	<p pid=".457W.9/3">For instance a report detailing the impact of 63 evaluated Reducing Burglary Initiative (RBI) projects is soon to be published, and this report will include estimates of displacement and diffusion of benefits. Under the RBI, a methodological report was also produced by one of the evaluation teams that examined the complex issue of how one measures crime displacement, and proposed a new statistical technique for doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".457W.9/4">However, it has to be acknowledged that there remains no agreed methodology for assessing whether policing initiatives result in a displacement of crime or a diffusion of benefits. Nevertheless, past research evidence from outside the Home Office indicates that displacement of crime resulting from police or related crime reduction activities is by no means inevitable, and indeed crime reduction gains usually outweigh any possible displacement of crime.</p>

	<p pid=".458W.5/1">Safer cells have several design features which can assist staff in the task of managing those at risk from suicide, such as specially designed furniture and fixtures which are manufactured and installed to make the attachment of ligatures very difficult, and access to window bars prevented via non-opening windows with integral ventilation grills. Realistically, no cell can be considered totally 'safe' and the Prison Service's preferred terminology is 'safer cell.' Safer cells can complement (but not replace) a regime providing care for at risk prisoners.</p>
	<p pid=".458W.5/2">The Prison Service employs the term 'self-inflicted death' rather than 'suicide.' This includes all those deaths where it appears the person may have acted specifically to take his/her own life. In 2002, of the 95 self-inflicted deaths in prisons, four occurred in safer cells. In 2003, of the 94 self-inflicted deaths in prisons, three occurred in safer cells. In 2004 to date (<phrase class="date" code="2004-01-28">28 January</phrase>), of the 10 self-inflicted deaths in prison, one has occurred in a safer cell.</p>
	<p pid=".458W.5/3">An independent evaluation of safer cells, carried out by the Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science in 2003, including interviews with prisoners and staff, revealed that the ventilation design in safer cells may require revision. Otherwise, the Institute concluded that the safer cells programme has much to commend it, and recommended that the programme continue. Three prisoners stated to evaluators that being in a safer cell had prevented them from killing themselves.</p>
	<p pid=".458W.5/4">The Prison Service is already looking into alternative safer ventilator designs to meet the report's finding. In those cases where ligature points have been identified in particular types of safer cells, remedial action has been taken and guidance issued to prisons. Also, funding has been agreed to progress the design and production of second generation safer cell furniture, building on the original safer cell furniture design, and by using mass production techniques reducing costs and enhancing robustness.</p>
	<p pid=".458W.5/5">The competition for the framework agreement for the supply and installation of safer cell furniture was procured under European Union rules. A notice was issued in the Official Journal of the European Community in June 2001. Nine companies responded to the Notice, and five were subsequently short-listed to receive the tender documentation. Tenderers' responses were evaluated, both commercially and technically to see which offered overall best value for money, three companies being awarded the framework agreement. Those companies were: MT Hogjaard, Premier Custodial Group Ltd. and Newcastle Joinery Ltd. Premier Custodial Group Ltd. have subsequently withdrawn from the framework. The framework agreement was for a period of twelve months commencing on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-23">23 January 2003</phrase>. The framework agreement has been extended for six months and is now due to expire <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-23">23 July 2004</phrase>. The Authority does have the right under the Agreement to extend the framework for a further two periods of three months each.</p>
	<p pid=".458W.5/6">The total cost of a self-inflicted death in prison is &pound;132,660.</p>

	<p pid=".469W.2/2">Employer Training Pilots (ETP) were introduced in six local Learning and Skills Council areas in September 2002 to test new measures to improve access to training. ETPs offer a package of support to help low-skilled people in work gain their first level 2 or basic skills qualification. The pilots were subsequently extended for a further year (to August 2004) and doubled in number to cover a total of 12 LSC areas.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.2/3">An independent evaluation of the first year of the pilots, published in December 2003, showed that ETPs are proving successful at engaging employers and their low-skilled employees in training. Building on this success, the Pre-Budget Report in December announced that ETPs are being extended for a third year and that a further six pilots will be launched in September 2004. This will mean that the pilots cover over a third of England and will enable the Government to explore further the impact of the pilots on the demand for training.</p>
	<p pid=".469W.2/4">My officials are currently consulting with the Learning and Skills Council's Regional Directors over the locations for the new pilots and an announcement will be made in due course.</p>

As the debtor has to make the payment direct to the creditor there is no access to information of the value of debt outstanding to creditors within the court. The only way to access up to date information would be to extract the court files from Preston county court and to contact each creditor individually to ask how much debt is outstanding.

The figure does not include civil financial orders (maintenance, forfeiture of recognisance etc.) as no data is collected on civil matters.</p>

	<p pid=".475W.0/1">The European Parliamentary and Local Elections (Pilots) Bill, currently in Parliament, will allow pilots of innovative voting methods at this year's European and combined local elections. The Government asked the Electoral Commission to recommend where pilots should take place and the Commission published its recommendations on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-08">8 December 2003</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".475W.0/2">The Commission identified the North East and East Midlands regions as 'highly suitable' and 'suitable'. The Commission also identified four regions that 'could potentially be suitable', These were, in descending order of suitability, Scotland, Yorkshire and the Humber, the North West and the West Midlands. It regarded the remaining regions as 'not suitable'.</p>
	<p pid=".475W.0/3">The Government accepted the recommendations regarding the North East and East Midlands on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-16">16 December</phrase>. Other options were then carefully considered. An approach of holding discussions with electoral administrators in the potentially suitable regions was decided upon, to establish what their concerns were and whether or not these could be addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".475W.0/4">Scottish Returning Officers had written to the Commission expressing various concerns. While Government viewed these as being about the same practical issues that affect the other regions, and despite efforts to allay their concerns, the Returning Officers remained concerned about their capacity to ensure an effective election. As a consequence of these concerns about operational capability, the Government decided not to impose a pilot in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".475W.0/5">There has already been positive experience of all-postal pilots in local elections in Yorkshire and the Humber and the North West. Discussions with these regions showed that they were confident that successful pilots could be arranged for June and the North West in particular had commenced work to prepare for a possible pilot. It was, therefore, decided that both of these regions should hold pilots, in addition to the two regions already announced.</p>

	<p pid=".478W.8/1">In May 2003, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced the establishment of a new Design and Demonstration Unit of private sector secondees to support the Sustainable Energy Policy Network. Among the activities being undertaken by the Unit, which is based in the Department of Trade and Industry, are pathfinder projects to extend the gas network to non-gas areas. The first of these, in Llay in North Wales, began in October 2003, and is now completed. Three other projects are currently in the process of being developed. In addition, during 2003, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets reviewed the charging arrangements for connections to independent gas transporters' (IGTs) networks. It is expected that, by allowing those providing connections to the existing network (known as &quot;infill&quot; projects) to charge a premium over Transco transportation charges, more IGTs will be encouraged to enter the infill market. Detailed information on the use of structural funds for individual projects is not held centrally by DTI. However, if my hon. Friend wishes to have information about a particular project, he should write to me, and I shall endeavour to obtain the relevant information. The Design and Demonstration Unit will be exploring whether the funds can provide support for the pathfinder projects that it is developing.</p>

	<p pid=".481W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of the Jobcentre Plus, David Anderson. He will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from David Anderson to Mr. Hancock, dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-25">25 February 2004</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".481W.2/3" class="indent">As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply direct to your question concerning the cost implications of running two systems side by side during the rollout of Jobcentre Plus, in the South East. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.2/4" class="indent">The development of Jobcentre Plus is building on the high quality service already provided by social security offices and Jobcentres by delivering a single, integrated service to all people of working age, with a clear focus on work. It is a huge undertaking involving some 1,500 offices across the country. We have to make sure that our customers can continue to receive advice on work and benefits. Therefore we need to stagger the roll-out of the new service over a number of years. Throughout the period of national roll-out social security offices and Jobcentres will be working together to ensure that customers will still benefit from the excellent service we offer.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.2/5" class="indent">Our plans for the roll out aim to ensure that the old services are replaced by the new services and that therefore there is no need to operate them side by side in any location. In fact as the roll out progresses we are looking to rationalise our estate and realise savings through a &quot;merger dividend&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.2/6" class="indent">This is one of the largest change programmes ever and given its size, we are bringing in changes across the four-year period 2002&ndash;06. This means, of course, within the South East region and the other regions/countries, we will have to run new services alongside old style services for this transitional period.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.2/7" class="indent">Full details of the financial allocation for the roll out of Jobcentre Plus are available in the Departmental report (CM5921) a copy of which is in the library.</p>
	<p pid=".481W.2/8" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

The second difference is that the updated estimate takes into account changes to the funding arrangements made by the Government since the Royal Commission produced its estimate.

	<p pid=".486W.8/1">The social security benefits referred to in point seven of the note are attendance allowance and disability living allowance care component. These benefits cease to be paid after four weeks of local authority support. Disability living allowance mobility component does not cease to be paid and is not included.</p>
	<p pid=".486W.8/2">Estimates of the proportions of older privately funded admissions to care homes receiving these benefits were derived from tables 4.13 and 4.14 of the Personal Social Services Research Unit report, Self-Funded Admissions to Care Homes (available at <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/rrep159.asp">www. dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/rrep159.asp</a>). These proportions were applied to the estimate numbers of privately funded care home residents to produce an estimate of the numbers of privately funded residents receiving these benefits. The estimated numbers were multiplied by the benefit rates to produce an estimated annual saving of under &pound;200 million.</p>
	<p pid=".486W.8/3">The approach assumed estimates of 42,000 privately funded residents in nursing beds in nursing homes or dual-registered homes and 58,000 privately funded residents in residential beds in residential care homes or dual-registered homes. Reference to dual-registered beds was omitted from the note for simplicity. This means that none of the estimated 58,000 were assumed to be entitled to free nursing care. This assumption does not, however, affect the estimated saving on disability benefits since receipt of free nursing care does not trigger cessation of disability benefits.</p>

	<p pid=".490W.2/1">The SPIRIT trial received multi-centre research ethics committee approval in November 2003. Local research ethics committee approval is currently being applied for at the various centres that plan to participate. The trial is led by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG). Any centre that wishes to participate must obtain United States federal-wide assurance, and investigators and research nurses must obtain membership of the ACOSOG. The trial team anticipates that six to eight centres in the United Kingdom will be approved by summer 2004, and that these centres will immediately start entering patients into the trial. The team is confident that 300 UK patients will be recruited before May 2007, which is the US target for completing accrual.</p>

It is now for primary care trusts (PCTs), in partnership with health authorities and other local stakeholders, to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling health inequalities and modernising services, based on the specialised knowledge they have of the local community.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/2">The Colchester and Tendring Local Improvement Finance Trust project board is committed to significantly improve services and facilities in the area. Tendring PCTs plan is to develop one purpose-built health centre that will incorporate four local surgeries on one site in the local areas. Therefore, the surgeries are not being closed but re-sited.</p>
	<p pid=".490W.5/3">The proposal is to centralise services on the Kennedy Way site with two satellite surgeries; one in Holland-on-Sea and the other in Great Clacton. The distance from the existing practices to the proposed new centre is approximately one mile. The satellite facilities will provide services to those patients who are unable to travel.</p>
