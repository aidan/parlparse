	<p pid=".1515W.3/2">Defra does not collect statistics which distinguish between sparkling and still waters or the way water is packaged. However, figures published by Mintel in its Bottled Water Report of June 2003 indicate that 75 per cent. of bottled water in 2003 was still and 25 per cent. sparkling. In addition, 79 per cent. was packaged in plastic bottles, 20 per cent. in glass bottles and 1 per cent. in cans.</p>

	<p pid=".1518W.2/2">As part of the business case for the scheme an assessment was made of the potential demand for fallen stock collection from the farming industry and the ability of the collection and disposal industry to meet the demand. At a national level, as the latter has consistently maintained, there has been sufficient capacity to meet demand.</p>
	<p pid=".1518W.2/3">However, it was always anticipated that there may be localised areas, particularly during times of peak demand, where there may be difficulties in meeting the demand for collection services. Given that in advance of the scheme starting it was difficult to know how many farmers would join the scheme in a given area or which areas fallen stock collectors would wish to cover it was not possible to identify with any certainty the extent of such difficulties in advance.</p>
	<p pid=".1518W.2/4">Unfortunately in parts of North West Wales only one collector was available. This collector made every effort to increase capacity for the lambing season but was unable to meet the demand. Positive steps have now been taken by the National Fallen Stock Company, the farming industry and the collector concerned to learn from this and ensure demand can be met for next year's lambing season.</p>

	<p pid=".1518W.8/2">Any derogation would need to be from the EU Animal By-Products Regulation which bans on-farm burial of fallen stock. The scheme is there to assist farmers in their compliance with the regulation. Under the regulation one of the criteria for meeting the requirements for a derogation is that the area concerned should have a low livestock density. This is not true for North West Wales and therefore it would be difficult for the National Assembly for Wales to make a case for granting one.</p>

The results, therefore, are not yet available.

	<p pid=".1523W.12/1">There is no such thing as a disciplinary process in respect of redundant churches.</p>
	<p pid=".1523W.12/2">The Church Commissioners are required under the provisions of the Pastoral Measure to publish a draft scheme making provision for the future of a redundant church. A notice is served on certain statutory bodies, which include the incumbent and parochial church council, but it is open to anyone who wishes to do so to make written representations to the Commissioners for or against the provisions of such a scheme. The Commissioners exercise a quasi-judicial role in adjudicating on any objections received.</p>

The remainder will have been consumed over this period as a result of wear and tear, and operational loss. I refer the hon. Member to the data for this period that was published by the House of Commons Defence Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-08">8 June 2004</phrase> (HC 635), as part of the Government's response to its &quot;Lessons of Iraq&quot; inquiry.</p>

We estimate that the 1,800 service and civilian jobs on the Innsworth site make up approximately 3.5 per cent. of local employment. However, as jobs on the site reduce progressively over the next three years, the economic impact will clearly depend on the future use of the site.

	<p pid=".1540W.5/1">The general procedure in the Ministry of Defence is that taxi fares are paid by the hirers and reclaimed from the Department, often combined with other elements of travelling and subsistence claims. The costs of taxi fares are not collected centrally or recorded separately once claims are authorised for payment. Providing the information would therefore entail personal analyses of claims by every serviceman and civil servant. Receipts are only required to be retained for three years after the end of the financial year in which claims are made, and information would not be obtainable from personnel who have left the services or Department.</p>
	<p pid=".1540W.5/2">I do not consider this a practicable exercise, and it is therefore unrealistic to attempt to estimate the very considerable cost of mounting it.</p>

	<p pid=".1541W.8/1">The London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham is obliged to consult the Ministry of Defence under the provisions of the Wormwood Scrubs Act 1879 on development proposals on Wormwood Scrubs. Development proposals are defined in Section 4 of the Act as</p>

	<p pid=".1541W.8/5" class="indent">&quot;The Secretary of State for Defence agrees for the purposes of the Act that the Greater London Council may carry out on the non-military portion of the Scrubs any operation to lay out drain level plant and improve the Scrubs without requiring his further approval provided the operation is otherwise lawful and does not form part of a major scheme likely to affect the general character of any part of the Scrubs and does not require the consent of the Secretary of State for the Environment.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".1542W.6/1">The information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, the Government's new fire Public Service Agreement target for England is, by 2010, to reduce the number of accidental fire related deaths in the home by 20 per cent. and the number of deliberate fires by 10 per cent.. Since 2003 every Fire and Rescue Authority (FRA) has been required to produce a local integrated risk management plan (IRMP) that sets out the authority's assessment of local risk to life and, in line with this analysis, how it is going to deploy its resources to tackle these risks and improve the safety of all sections of society. The Fire and Rescue National Framework requires FRAs to set out in their IRMPs, the targets and standards it will apply to meet the specific pattern of local risk.</p>

The role of volunteers in the staging of events of this size cannot be overlooked and I am aware of the numbers of volunteers from Chorley who gave up their time to help in the staging of this event. These were key contributors to the successful staging of this significant sporting event.</p>

	<p pid=".1555W.11/1">The new regime introduced by the Licensing Act 2003 makes no provision for licensing authorities to take need, or the means of applicants, into account in their decisions. The new regime is designed to advance the licensing objectives of ensuring public safety, preventing crime and disorder, preventing public nuisance, and protecting children from harm. To those ends, the 2003 Act allows licensing authorities to take full account of the possible effects of the concentration of licensed premises on levels of crime and disorder. This is a separate matter to need or means, the consideration of which is allowed under the current licensing regime.</p>
	<p pid=".1555W.11/2">Under the provisions of the Licensing Act 1964, licensing justices can consider need or means, along with other matters at their discretion, in dealing with licence applications. The consideration of means in such decisions was reviewed by the Departmental Committee on Liquor Licensing, under the chairmanship of Lord Erroll of Hale. The Committee concluded in December 1972 that, in the special context of liquor licensing law, the application of the test of need to new applications for justices' on-licences was out of date and unnecessary.</p>
	<p pid=".1555W.11/3">That conclusion informed subsequent guidance, including the last Good Practice Guide to licensing committees published under the old licensing regime. This was produced by the Justices' Clerks' Society in consultation with the Magistrates' Association, and stated that</p>
	<p pid=".1555W.11/4" class="indent">&quot;when considering the question of need/demand, committees do not attach much, if any, weight to the threat from competition and should not consider trade protection as a matter which is relevant when exercising their discretion.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1555W.11/5">However, different licensing committees continue to be inconsistent in their applications of tests of need. In this and other areas, the 2003 Act will bring greater consistency to licensing decisions.</p>

	<p pid=".1556W.3/1">As at <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-30">30 June 2004</phrase> there were, under the Licensing Act 1964, 10,909 on-and off-licensed premises, and 1,442 registered clubs in Wales. On this date there were 1,117 on- and off-licensed premises, and 68 registered clubs in the Cardiff petty session division.</p>
	<p pid=".1556W.3/2">DCMS deposited the source publication for these figures &quot;Statistical Bulletin Liquor Licensing (England and Wales, July 2003-June 2004)&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-27">27 October 2004</phrase> in the House Libraries.

	<p pid=".1556W.3/3">Figures for the numbers of premises licensed under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 are not collected centrally. However, surveys suggest that approximately 46,000 public entertainment licences are issued in England and Wales annually. Such licences would include those issued under the London Government Act 1963 as well as those under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982.</p>
	<p pid=".1556W.3/4">No estimates have been made centrally about the numbers of licensed premises in Wales or in Cardiff Central that fall into each of the fee bands, or how many in these areas will be required to pay the fee multipliers. It is likely that individual licensing authorities have estimates for these figures. However, the Regulatory Impact Assessment in respect of the fees regulations estimated the spectrum of premises lying in each band as a percentage of the total, as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".1556W.3/7"> <th> Rateable value bands</th> <th>Non-domestic<br/> rateable value</th> <th>Percentage of premises in band</th> </tr>

	<p pid=".1556W.3/17">It also estimated that approximately 2,000&ndash;4,000 premises falling in Bands D and E across England and Wales would meet the definition of being primarily or exclusively engaged in the sale of alcohol for consumption on the premises, meaning that they would be required to pay the fee multipliers.</p>

	<p pid=".1560W.2/2">London's bid underwent rigorous assessment by the International Olympic Committee, Treasury and the Office of Government Commerce. The Government remains committed to ensuring the 2012 games are delivered on time and on budget.</p>
	<p pid=".1560W.2/3">The London Olympics Bill, now before the House, proposes an Olympic delivery authority (ODA) to co-ordinate all aspects of Olympic infrastructure and transport planning. The ODA will work closely with the London Organising Committee to ensure delivery of the project to time and to budget, and their progress will be overseen by the Olympic stakeholders: myself, the Major and the chair of the British Olympic Association.</p>

	<p pid=".1575W.13/1">Afghanistan has the potential to produce, process and market a range of higher value agricultural products such as vegetables, fruits, nuts, and livestock and dairy products. None can compete economically with the returns available on growing opium poppy, and market links are not currently sufficiently developed to offer viable alternatives to the 700,000 farmers growing poppy.</p>
	<p pid=".1575W.13/2">The DFID-funded Research in Alternative Livelihoods Fund (RALF) is identifying new crops and agricultural technologies which can be marketed successfully and have the potential to be used by larger groups of current or potential poppy farmers. Crops being tested include oil seed crops (canola, pea nuts, soy beans, mung beans), medicinal crops/herbs (mint, saffron, cumin), and vegetables (onions, tomatoes, chillies, sweet peppers, mushrooms). Other donor projects are doing similar testing. Programmes to roll out successful pilots will be developed in 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".1575W.13/3">In the Badakhshan province in north-eastern Afghanistan DFID is funding a programme through the Aga Khan Foundation to increase the number of farmers accessing high quality seeds, and other agricultural inputs such as training in growing alternative crops. So far 29,000 farmers have benefited from this assistance.</p>

	<p pid=".1576W.2/1">The Government of Afghanistan has a national programme, the Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA), which provides credit in rural areas, including to sharecroppers. Following a workshop on opium debt and rural finance jointly organised by the Government, the World Bank and DFID in December 2004, it was agreed that the MISFA would fund new ways to restructure informal debts to help farmers and sharecroppers break the cycle of opium indebtedness.</p>
	<p pid=".1576W.2/2">In March 2005, DFID committed a further &pound;17 million to the MISFA (bringing our total contribution to &pound;20 million), with &pound;7 million specifically to increase the scale of the MISFA's work in the seven largest poppy producing provinces through a special funding window, which will pilot debt restructuring. Initial results from these pilots are expected by the end of the year. Writing off debts has been considered as an option, but considered socially unsustainable in rural areas.</p>

	<p pid=".1577W.5/1">Microfinance, or financial services for those on low or very low income, is a powerful tool to fight poverty and help reach the Millennium Development Goals. Approximately 50 million low income people have a loan from a microfinance institution, and at least 500 million have some form of bank account, but in some African countries still less than 10 per cent. of the population has access to a bank account.</p>
	<p pid=".1577W.5/2">Financial exclusion, or lack of access to financial services, acts as a constraint on economic growth and poverty reduction. Without access to loans, small enterprises can be restricted from expanding in size or into new markets. Families need access to a savings account, or to money transfer services, in order to ensure they have money at times of need, or to pay for education and other expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".1577W.5/3">My Department is active in promoting access to financial services, including microfinance. DFID has funded financial sector and microfinance projects in 25 countries and is the major funder to the global Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) initiative. My Department was instrumental in setting up and supporting, the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), which is now made up of 29 international donor agencies. This is a resource centre for microfinance institutions and a centre of best practice for donors, Governments, and financial institutions. DFID also funds international agencies that actively support microfinance and financial sector development, such as the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation and the Asian Development Bank.</p>
	<p pid=".1577W.5/4">My Department has launched or designed eight country programmes to promote financial sector development, seven of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. In several cases these are co-funded with other donors. These programmes work to improve the policy, legal and institutional framework so that banks and other financial institutions are able to expand into microfinance, and in some cases provide direct support to financial institutions to do so. They also enable microfinance institutions to access training, management skills and technical assistance, and improve their governance and systems.</p>
	<p pid=".1577W.5/5">My Department jointly organised two high level conferences for the UN Year of Microcredit 2005, with the French and German Governments, that were attended by over 700 Government and donor representatives, as well as the private sector. We have a joint work programme with the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to promote financial inclusion through agreeing measures and targets for access to financial services by poor households.</p>
	<p pid=".1577W.5/6">DFID's Financial Deepening Challenge Fund has supported innovation by the private sector to extend access to financial services. For example, this Challenge Fund provided a grant to a Kenyan financial institution that then also invested at least as much of its own money, resulting in access to financial services in remote rural parts of Kenya through satellite-linked land rovers. A telecommunications company was also assisted to develop mobile phone-based banking services for low income people in East Africa, which is a technology that offers potential for significantly improving access to financial services across Africa.</p>

	<p pid=".1580W.2/1">The Government assessment of the impact of child poverty is set out in the Child Poverty Review which was published alongside the 2004 Spending Review. The Child Poverty Review shows that poverty can affect children's lives through the effects of living in poor housing and eating less nutritious food, and the higher risks of accidents, ill health and problems with school work. Poverty can exclude children from the everyday activities of their peers and limit their opportunities to play safely. Poverty in childhood can prevent children from fulfilling their potential by leading to poorer educational attainment and higher chances of poverty and social exclusion in adult life.</p>
	<p pid=".1580W.2/2">Child poverty more than doubled between the mid 1970s and the mid 1990s in the UK and we had the highest rate in Europe. The Government are committed to halving child poverty by 2010 and eradicating it by 2020. We have already seen some success. By 2003&ndash;04 there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income households compared to 1998&ndash;99. The Department is working with partners within and beyond Government to meet the Government's target of eradicating child poverty.</p>

	<p pid=".1582W.8/2">The Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) National Rates Advisory Group (NRAG), which advises the LSC on post-16 funding rates and related issues, commissioned the research which helped inform the LSC's area costs uplift. The research was carried out by independent consultants contracted by the LSC and was based on an analysis of differential salary data from the Labour Force Survey and the New Earnings Survey across England. The results were adjusted for affordability and generated the published area costs funding uplifts provided in my Answer of <phrase class="date" code="">11 July</phrase> to Question reference 11107. The work generated a zero per cent area costs rate for the West Midlands Region, including Warwickshire, and for Gloucestershire. A summary of the NRAG recommendations is available on the LSC's website at <a href="http://www.lsc.gov.uk/National/Documents/SubjectListing/FundingLearning/FurtherEducation/default.htm">http://www.lsc.gov.uk/National/Documents/SubjectListing/FundingLearning/FurtherEducation/default.htm</a>, entitled Funding: Indicative Rates for Further Education, Work-Based Learning and School Sixth Forms in 2003&ndash;04.</p>

	<p pid=".1599W.2/1">The majority of services available through Sure Start local programmes are free at the point of use. Local programmes are, however, able to charge parents for child care services provided. Given this, the Government are committed to ensuring that high quality places for children under five, where care and education are integrated, are both affordable and accessible to all parents, particularly those living in disadvantaged areas.</p>
	<p pid=".1599W.2/2">To this end, the 10-year child care strategy, published in December 2004, set out our vision for ensuring that every child gets the best start in life and giving parents more choice about how to balance work and family life.</p>
	<p pid=".1599W.2/3">Child care costs are currently subsidised by tax credits which are rightly targeted at lower and middle income families. The working tax credit is designed to help with the costs of registered or approved child care. From April 2005 the maximum child care element of the working tax credit increased from &pound;135 to &pound;175 for one child and from &pound;200 to &pound;300 for two or more children, subject to a maximum portion of child care costs payable of 70 per cent. From April 2006 the maximum will increase from 70 per cent. to 80 per cent. These changes were expected to benefit 20,000 families straight away and many more over time.</p>
	<p pid=".1599W.2/4">The Government currently provides support to all parents in meeting child care costs and is clearly committed to increasing such support in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".1599W.2/5">From 2006 the 12.5 hour free entitlement to early education for 33 weeks per year will be extended to cover 38 weeks per year for all children aged three or four. From 2007 the free entitlement will begin to increase to 15 hours per week, with all children receiving 15 hours by 2010 on the way to a goal of 20 hours per week. Parents will have the flexibility to use the free entitlement across a minimum of three days. This will result in better choices for all parents who need full day, all year round child care, improved affordability for parents; and more sustainable income for providers.</p>
	<p pid=".1599W.2/6">From April 2007 maternity leave will be extended to nine months with a goal to increase this to 12 months by the end of next Parliament, and with the right for the mother to transfer a portion of her maternity leave to the father. This will enable parents to have greater choice about how to balance their work and family responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid=".1600W.6/1">The 'lead and feed' arrangements were part of the Learning and Skills Council (LSC)'s contracting arrangements for 2004&ndash;05 and were designed to simplify the relationship between providers and the LSC. As part of its continuing drive to improve quality in work-based learning the LSC has reviewed its contracting arrangements, including 'lead and feed' arrangements and is introducing new systems for 2005&ndash;06. I have asked Mark Haysom, the Council's Chief Executive, to write to the hon. Gentleman with more detail about these issues. A copy of his reply will be placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".1600W.6/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom to Mr. Stephen O'Brien, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-08">8 July 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".1600W.6/3" class="indent">I have been asked by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills to provide you with a written response to your recent parliamentary questions regarding the LSC's regional contracting arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".1600W.6/4" class="indent">Lead and feed arrangements were introduced in August 2003 to meet the requirements of Success for All to introduce single contracts and development plans for national providers. The arrangements also enabled the LSC to meet requests from The Association of Learning Providers to reduce the bureaucracy of contracting for large providers who worked across more than one local LSC area.</p>
	<p pid=".1600W.6/5" class="indent">The arrangements were reviewed in 2004 and found to have met the objective of reducing bureaucracy. However, the review also found that the majority of large providers still had success rates below the national average. The review therefore recommended a move to regional contracting so that the LSC could dedicate more senior resource to support providers in improving their quality and success rates.</p>
	<p pid=".1600W.6/6" class="indent">Many large, national providers have introduced their own regional management arrangements and the commercial impact of the regional contracting on providers is not expected to be significant.</p>
	<p pid=".1600W.6/7" class="indent">Regional contracting will not affect the responsibility for local LSC's to decide which providers they contract with and for what programmes. Local LSC's will be making contracting decisions based on providers' past performance and local need. This may result in some providers not having their contract renewed but this will not be as a result of the introduction of regional contracting.</p>
	<p pid=".1600W.6/8" class="indent">Where the decision not to contract with a provider would result in the displacement of learners, the LSC is fully equipped and ready to place each learner with a new provider so that the learner can complete their original programme with the minimum disruption. It is not possible to calculate the number of learners affected until contracting negotiations have taken place.</p>
	<p pid=".1600W.6/9" class="indent">The LSC expects that regional contracting will give providers the opportunity to re-direct administration and management time to front line delivery as the number of points at which we liaise reduces from one per local LSC to one per region.</p>
	<p pid=".1600W.6/10" class="indent">I trust that this covers the three questions you have raised.</p>

	<p pid=".1603W.5/1">The Legal Services Commission fully recognises and actively seeks to fulfil its obligations under Race Relations legislation to eliminate unlawful discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and encourage good race relations. As such, prior to publication of its proposals for competitive tendering, the LSC had already carried out a partial race equality impact assessment on both black and minority ethnic (BME) firms and clients.</p>
	<p pid=".1603W.5/2">Close collaboration with the Law Society, the Black Solicitors Network and other specialist practitioner and representative groups will help to inform a full race impact assessment to be carried out during summer 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1603W.5/3">In addition, the LSC is tendering for research into the issues faced by BME firms within its legal aid supplier base. The information from this research will further help to shape the development of competitive tendering policy.</p>

	<p pid=".1609W.5/1">Most countries with identity cards have had schemes in place for many years and they are therefore not in a position to evaluate the impact they have on crime. However, it is clear that schemes in other countries do help in the fight against crime, for example the Spanish police have stated that identifying nearly all of the terrorists involved in the Madrid bombings was made significantly easier by their identity cards scheme. Identity cards were also used to identify the victims of the bombings quickly.</p>
	<p pid=".1609W.5/2">Biometrics are being used to more strongly tie a verified identity to an individual. In this way, biometrics can be used along with an ID card to verify that identity against the record held for that card. Other forms of authentication, such as PIN numbers and passwords can be stolen along with a card so are much weaker at linking a person to an identity.</p>
	<p pid=".1609W.5/3">All the Schengen states will be required to use biometrics in passports under Council Regulation 2252/2004. Fingerprint biometrics (rather than just fingerprints) will be introduced within three years of adoption. Non- Schengen states may choose to follow the requirements, although they would not be bound by the timetable.</p>
	<p pid=".1609W.5/4">Other EU member states which issue identity cards are considering introducing biometrics to increase security and some, for example Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, already collect one of more fingerprints as part of their national identity card schemes.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-28">28 June 2005</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary placed in the Library a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the identity cards scheme which shows that the benefits outweigh the costs once the scheme is fully operational. In one area of Home Office business alone&mdash;the processing of Criminal Records Bureau disclosures&mdash;processing times could be cut from four weeks to three days.</p>
	<p pid=".1609W.8/2">The cost of equipping Prison Service and other Home Office premises will depend on the nature of the use of the identity cards scheme and the type of identity check(s) necessary to deliver the business benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".1609W.8/3">In some cases, benefits could be realised without the use of card readers and the cost of installing any readers needs to be considered alongside future plans to refresh or upgrade IT systems.</p>

	<p pid=".1610W.2/1">The Home Office has consulted biometrics experts, Communications and Electronic Security Group biometric spoofing and anti-fraud experts and scientific literature in our assessment of fooling biometric technologies and is working with these and other experts to address any risk. We are also in communication with other schemes that are now using biometrics with ID cards, to learn from their experiences.</p>
	<p pid=".1610W.2/2">We are working on process methods to reduce the likelihood of fake biometrics being successful, for example selecting a random finger for verification, from those available, rather than using only one fingerprint on all occasions. This also gives flexibility around issues arising from short term damage to fingers, such as a cut.</p>
	<p pid=".1610W.2/3">In enrolment situations the process would be supervised thereby reducing the risk of fraudulent use of biometrics. In verification situations, the individual would need to have obtained a stolen card as well as a copy of all of the fingerprints in order to attempt this exercise. Further process measures are being developed but in order to protect the integrity of the National Identity Register, it is not possible to disclose them.</p>
	<p pid=".1610W.2/4">The systems proposed by the various manufacturers during procurement, to meet the scheme business requirements, will be rigorously tested to ensure risks from fake biometrics are adequately mitigated and allow the scheme to achieve official security accreditation.</p>

	<p pid=".1613W.5/2">An extensive risk assessment of the use of a single identifying number has been conducted by experienced fraud and security experts. This has resulted in the selection of a new single identifying number that is unrelated to any number issued by the Government at the present time. However, due to the nature of the information involved in the assessment and in order to protect the integrity of the National Identity Register, no further details can be provided.Under the terms of Schedule one Part two, paragraph four of the Data Protection Act 1998 the use of the National Identity Registration Number by other organisations would have to be specified in regulations.</p>

	<p pid=".1622W.2/1">Millimetre wave imaging is one of a number of technologies being evaluated by the police service and the Home Office Scientific Development Branch for detecting bombs and weapons carried under clothing. It relies on non-ionising radiation which is emitted by all objects in the environment or can be generated artificially (for indoor use).</p>
	<p pid=".1622W.2/2">The underlying technology was developed with UK Government funding and devices have been deployed experimentally at an airport and operationally at channel ports, where they are used to detect stowaways in vehicles. QinetiQ's latest system will be evaluated as soon as it is available, probably in early August. The new device is smaller than the stowaway detection system and is designed to inspect individuals or groups of people. The image shows the surface of the body and objects under the clothing and needs to be interpreted by a trained operator.</p>
	<p pid=".1622W.2/3">Millimetre wave imaging systems have clear capabilities in this area. However, like all explosives detection systems they need to be deployed as part of a planned security system which incorporates equipment, staff and procedures to interpret and deal with the information gathered by the equipment.</p>

	<p pid=".1622W.5/2">We are unable to provide figures as to how many appeals against refusals to grant entry clearance have been heard to date and how many were successful due to the disproportional cost that would be incurred in obtaining this information.</p>

We will undertake further consultations with representatives from the hospitality sector in due course.</p>

	<p pid=".1629W.4/1">Access to Work provides practical advice and support aimed at overcoming work-related obstacles resulting from disability. It does this through a system of grants towards the cost of providing support. Types of help available include the additional costs in travelling to work; providing human intervention support in the workplace; adapting work premises, and providing special aids and equipment in the workplace. Access to Work is open to those who are employed as well as people moving out of unemployment and is a highly effective job retention measure.</p>
	<p pid=".1629W.4/2">A report published in June 2004 by the Disability Employment Coalition 'Access to Work for Disabled People', found that for every pound spent, the Exchequer recouped &pound;1.48 in additional revenue. This report is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".1629W.4/3">In an internal study published in September 2002, 'Evaluating the Impact of Access to Work: A Case Study Approach' report reference WAE 138, clear evidence was demonstrated that Access to Work helps people retain a specific job that they would otherwise have lost. This report is also available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".1629W.4/4">In the last five years we have invested around &pound;300,000 a year in marketing and publicising our disability services and programmes. As Access to Work represents an integral part of this, separate information on Access to Work promotional costs is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".1629W.4/5">Promotional material is available for employers and disabled people in a wide range of media including leaflets, audiotapes and videos as well as on the Jobcentre Plus website. A new suite of leaflets about Access to Work has also recently been produced for promotion at conferences and exhibitions.</p>
	<p pid=".1629W.4/6">Our Disability Employment Advisers regularly meet local employers to promote the full range of disability services, including Access to Work, and information on Access to Work is also available to individuals and employers through our Access to Work Advisers. Many disability organisations actively promote Access to Work and some include information about Access to Work on their web pages, which we regularly quality assure.</p>

This exercise supplemented the public consultation and was carried out in April and May. We are considering the outcomes of both these exercises and expect to be in a position to publish the results shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".1639W.8/1">The general provision is that payment of housing benefit is made to the tenant. Every tenant is personally responsible for paying their rent; of those who claim housing benefit, the vast majority accept that responsibility by paying rent to their landlords.</p>
	<p pid=".1639W.8/2">While the present regulations give consideration to the personal responsibility of the tenant and the legitimate interests of landlords, it is ultimately the landlord's own responsibility to ensure that he obtains whatever payments are properly due to him, irrespective of the tenant's source of income.</p>
	<p pid=".1639W.8/3">Housing benefit regulations give local authorities wide-ranging powers to pay benefit direct to a claimant's landlord where there are eight weeks arrears of rent, unless it is in the tenant's overriding interest not to do so, or the landlord is not regarded as fit and proper to receive such payments.</p>
	<p pid=".1639W.8/4">Local authorities also have discretion to make direct payments at any time where they decide that it is in the tenant's best interest to do so. This provision also caters for circumstances where it may be appropriate to make direct payments where there are no rent arrears, for example where the tenant has a history of rent arrears at a previous address or where social or medical problems clearly indicate that help with budgeting is needed.</p>
	<p pid=".1639W.8/5">If a tenant, having originally agreed to payment direct to his landlord, then withdraws his consent it is still open to the local authority to make direct payment if they are satisfied this would be in the tenant's interest, for example, to prevent rent arrears and possible eviction.</p>
	<p pid=".1639W.8/6">Early experience with the local housing allowance is that landlords are increasingly working with local authorities and their concerns over tenants not paying their rent have not been realised.</p>

	<p pid=".1647W.6/1">Where a pension scheme qualifying for help from the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) has completed wind-up, assistance for eligible members (including terminally ill people) will top up to 80 per cent. of core pension rights.</p>
	<p pid=".1647W.6/2">The top-up rate for discretionary initial payments made to eligible members before wind-up has been completed, including terminally ill people, has been set at 60 per cent. of core pension rights. This is because at that stage scheme trustees will not know how the scheme's assets compare with its liabilities and how much pension individual members have lost. This follows the precedent whereby trustees may, where funds allow, make interim payments at a safe rate to pensioner members from the pension scheme itself before wind-up is completed. Initial payments from the FAS will take account of any interim payments from the pension scheme. The top-up rate will be adjusted to 80 per cent. on the completion of wind-up and, if needed, arrears will be paid to compensate for the lower rate of payment during wind-up.</p>

	<p pid=".1649W.2/24">The Department introduced a well-being at work policy in September 2004 as a means of tackling work-related stress. The HSE Management Standards and associated processes underpin the well-being policy and feature as part of the annual DWP staff survey. In addition, the Department has contracts with Atos Origin to provide an occupational health service, and with Right Core Care to provide an employee assistance service. Such provision is not, however, confined to work-related stress, which means it is difficult to apportion a cost to what is being done to reduce this.</p>

Of these 23,470 (0.5 per cent.) were performed under Sections 1(1)<i>(c)</i> and 1(4) of the Abortion Act 1967. These are cases where the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, or where the termination is immediately necessary to save the life or to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman.</p>

	<p pid=".1656W.2/19">Updating this information and providing information on the additional recommendations contained in the first and second reports from the Select Committee on Abortion, session 1975&ndash;76, could be done only at disproportionate cost. Since 1976, a wide range of issues relating to abortion were considered by Parliament during the debates informing the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. In 2001, the national strategy for sexual health and HIV set out the Government's 10 year strategy for sexual health, further bolstered by the 2004 public health White Paper. In this context, the Health Select Committee has itself conducted inquiries into sexual and reproductive health, including abortion issues, in 2003 and 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1656W.2/20">It is accepted parliamentary practice that proposals for changes in the law on abortion have come from hon. and right hon. Members on the back benches and that decisions are made on the basis of free votes. The Government has no plans to change the law on abortion.</p>

	<p pid=".1659W.8/15">1. Expenditure is taken from audited HA summarisation forms and primary care trust summarisation schedules which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The figures have not been adjusted for inflation.</p>

Figures for 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04 have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning health care or other services.</p>
	<p pid=".1659W.8/17">3. In many HAs there are factors which distort the expenditure. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".1659W.8/18">the HA acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and</p>
	<p pid=".1659W.8/19">asset revaluations in national health service trusts being funded through HAs or primary</p>

	<p pid=".1659W.8/21">4. The majority of general dental services expenditure is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority. Total expenditure on these items by the Dental Practice Board and the Prescription Pricing Authority cannot be allocated to individual health bodies. Therefore, the total expenditure in the answer by health authority does not capture all NHS expenditure within the area.</p>

	<p pid=".1661W.5/33">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".1661W.5/34">1. Data were collected by health authority only prior to 2001&ndash;02. Trust level data were collected from 2001&ndash;02 onwards</p>
	<p pid=".1661W.5/35">2. A last minute cancellation is one that occurs on the day the patient was due to arrive, after they have arrived in hospital or on the day of their operation. For example, a patient is to be admitted to hospital on a Monday for an operation scheduled for the following day (Tuesday). If the hospital cancels his/her operation for non-clinical reasons on the Monday, then this would count as a last minute cancellation. This includes patients who have not actually arrived in hospital and have been telephoned at home prior to their arrival.</p>
	<p pid=".1661W.5/36">3. An operation which is rescheduled to a time within 24 hours of the original scheduled operation should be recorded as a postponement and not as a cancellation. The QMCO collection does not record the number of postponements.</p>
	<p pid=".1661W.5/37">4. Some common non-clinical reasons for cancellations by the hospital include: ward beds unavailable; surgeon unavailable; emergency case needing theatre; theatre list over-ran; equipment failure; admin error; anaesthetist unavailable; theatre staff unavailable; and critical care bed unavailable.</p>

	<p pid=".1668W.3/15">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.3/16">1. Registration rates, that is, the percentage of the population registered with a dentist, have been estimated by including registrations in the area of the dentist according to the postcode of the dental surgery (not the patient's address). So the registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live. This can lead to figures being unusually high (even over 100 per cent. for child registrations), whilst other areas may have estimated rates lower than the actual proportion of residents who are registered with a dentist in or outside their own area.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.3/17">2. The registration rates use population estimates for the PCT areas for the nearest year for which data are available. Figures for 1997 to 2000 have been calculated from 2001 population data. Figures for 2004 and 2005 have been calculated from 2003 population data, as this is the most up to date available.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.3/18">3. The numbers of registrations are based on a snapshot of the registration database taken at the end of March each year and subsequent retrospective notifications of changes to registrations have not been included.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.3/19">4. Some double counting may occur in the totals when a patient has been newly registered with a dentist in one PCT, but not yet de-registered from a dentist in another PCT.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.3/20">5. The changes in the registration period from two years to 15 months under the GDS from <phrase class="date" code="1996-09-01">1 September 1996</phrase> affected the registration numbers from December 1997 onwards, so the 1997 figures are not comparable with later figures.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.3/21">6. Most PDS schemes that have registrations have a re-registration period in excess of 15 months, so the figures for PDS schemes are generally higher than they would have been for the same attendance pattern under GDS.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.3/22">7. Some PDS schemes do not have any registrations, for example, dental access centres and will not therefore be included in these figures.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.3/23">8. There is a small number of unallocated registrations.</p>

	<p pid=".1669W.8/1">Emergency hormonal contraception (EHC) is not a method of abortion. In 2002, there was a High Court ruling that the supply and use of EHC is lawful and that the prevention of implantation, which is brought about by emergency contraception products, does not amount to procuring a miscarriage under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. The conscience clause set out in section 4 of the Abortion Act is therefore not relevant to the supply of EHC.</p>

	<p pid=".1670W.5/1">As with all marketed medicines, the safety of post coital contraception is continuously monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p>
	<p pid=".1670W.5/2">Post coital contraception is currently available as a levonorgestrel, containing emergency hormonal contraceptive (Levonelle/Levonelle-2) and as the post-coital insertion of a copper-containing intra-uterine device (IUD).</p>
	<p pid=".1670W.5/3">No safety concerns were identified in two World Health Organisation (WHO) sponsored clinical trials of emergency hormonal contraception that included girls aged 16 and under. In addition, extensive worldwide use of levonorgestrel in over 9 million women, including those under 16 years, have not identified any serious safety concerns or provided evidence that the safety of levonorgestrel is any different in the under 16s. There are also no safety concerns about the use of IUDs in women age under 16. However, these are very rarely used in young women with no children.</p>
	<p pid=".1670W.5/4">Clinical trials for new drugs are not routinely conducted on young people under 16 unless they are specifically indicated for use in children. The judgment on the balance of risks and benefits in women under 16 is the responsibility of the prescribing physician. Health care professionals are encouraged to discuss the potential side effects with everyone who seeks treatment. In addition, prescribers are expected to satisfy themselves that all women understand the risks and benefits of using post coital contraception and that it is in their best interests to receive the treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".1670W.5/5">In the event of any important new safety information emerging, the MHRA will take action to ensure that this is accurately reflected in the product information and communicated to health professionals and women using these products.</p>
	<p pid=".1670W.5/6">No clinical trials of levonorgestrel use specific to women under 16 have been conducted in the United Kingdom. The marketing authorisation that was granted in 1999 for the prescription-only product was supported by evidence from two large randomised controlled trials, one conducted by the WHO <sup>1</sup> , and one using published data from uncontrolled studies. Most women in the clinical trials were aged between 16 and 48, but a few girls aged 14 and 15 were included. No data were available for girls between ages 11 and 14 years. Age analysis of efficacy and safety in randomised studies did not identify any population that responded differently to treatment. Since then another WHO-sponsored study has evaluated 4,136 women aged between 14 and 52 years (mean age 27 years) who attended family planning clinics requesting emergency contraception <sup>2</sup> . In excess of 2,700 women were given levonorgestrel, and of these, 439 were teenage girls (with 85 aged 16 and under). No safety concerns were identified in the study.</p>
	<p pid=".1670W.5/7">Levonorgestrel is available as Levonelle-2G,, a prescription-only medicine licensed for emergency contraception that is available only under medical supervision. The licence does not specify a lower age limit for women but health care professionals are expected to satisfy themselves, in accordance with guidelines, that treatment is in the patient's best interests and that she understands the advice she is receiving.</p>
	<p pid=".1670W.5/8">Levonorgestrel is also available as Levonelle G, which is for sale in pharmacies and is not recommended for use by young women under 16 years of age without medical supervision. Comprehensive guidance and training on best practice for the supply of Levonelle in pharmacies has been issued to all pharmacists. This includes what questions should be asked of women, which women should be referred to a doctor for advice and ensuring that they are satisfied that the client is aged 16 or over.</p>

	<p pid=".1673W.2/17">Note:</p>
	<p pid=".1673W.2/18">1. A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.</p>
	<p pid=".1673W.2/19">2. Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID. This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and national health service number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.</p>
	<p pid=".1673W.2/20">3. The main operation is the first recorded operation in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g.,. time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.</p>
	<p pid=".1673W.2/21">4. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).</p>
	<p pid=".1673W.2/22">5. Time waited (days)&mdash;time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>

	<p pid=".1676W.2/1">Reducing obesity in both children and adults is one of the key overarching priorities of the Government White Paper, &quot;Choosing Health&quot;. The White Paper sets out a comprehensive strategy for tackling obesity and has given a solid foundation for future work. Delivery plans for &quot;Choosing Health, Choosing a Better Diet and Choosing Activity&quot; were published in March this year and show how we will deliver action to tackle childhood obesity.</p>
	<p pid=".1676W.2/2">We have also set a national public service agreement target to halt, by 2010, the year-on-year increase in obesity among children under 11 in the context of a broader strategy to tackle obesity in the population as a whole. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance on the prevention, identification, assessment and management of overweight and obesity in adults and children will also be available early in 2007.</p>
	<p pid=".1676W.2/3">Current action on diet includes investment in the &quot;Five-a-day&quot; programme, including the school fruit and vegetable scheme, promotion of breastfeeding, action to improve diet and nutrition across the whole school, including the food in schools programme, as well as work with industry on food promotion to children and reducing salt, fat and sugar. Current action on physical activity includes investing in school sport and the local exercise and activity pilots.</p>

Relevant figures are only readily available for deaths where the underlying cause was either related to drug poisoning or directly related to alcohol (alcohol abuse, dependence and poisoning, and diseases directly related to alcohol use). It is not possible to identify from death certificates which substance was the primary cause when more than one was involved.</p>
	<p pid=".1681W.8/5" class="indent">Teesside has not been a recognised administrative area since 1974 when major administrative re-structuring took place. Teesside county borough council now lies within three unitary authorities: Middlesbrough; Redcar and Cleveland; and, Stockton-on-Tees. Figures for these areas are provided in the table below.</p>
	<p pid=".1681W.8/6" class="indent">It is not known how many people die through tobacco use each year as this information is not recorded on the death certificate. Estimates can be made however and the most recent for England were published by the Health Development Agency in 2004. <sup>1</sup> This report estimated that in England an average of 86,500 deaths were caused by smoking each year over the period 1998&ndash;2002. Estimates were not published at unitary authority level, however for Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) the percentages of all deaths from causes associated with smoking at ages 35 and over were published. The unitary authorities of Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, and Stockton-on-Tees lie within the PCTs of Middlesbrough, Langbaurgh and North Tees. The percentages of deaths of those aged 35 and over in these areas from causes associated with smoking were 38 per cent., 32 per cent. and 35 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".1681W.8/7" class="indent">Figures for alcohol-related deaths to usual residents of the three unitary authorities registered in the years 1997 to 2004 are given in the table below. ONS compiles a special database to analyse mortality from drug-related poisoning, adding more detail than is available on routine annual extracts. This database is compiled using the annual occurrences extract of mortality data. Figures showing deaths related to drug poisoning involving heroin/methadone, ecstasy and amphetamines, occurring in the years 1997 to 2003, to usual residents of the three areas are given in the table below. Information on deaths involving illicit substances is not available, as how the deceased obtained a particular drug is not recorded at death registration.</p>
	<p pid=".1681W.8/8" class="indent">However the attached table does show the number of deaths where a controlled substance, other than heroin/morphine or amphetamines (including ecstasy), was mentioned.</p>
	<p pid=".1681W.8/9" class="indent">It should be noted that the figures on drug-related poisoning and alcohol-related deaths are not directly comparable for the following reasons:</p>
	<p pid=".1681W.8/10" class="indent">The figures for alcohol-related deaths include the long-term effects of alcohol use, such as cirrhosis of the liver, whereas the figures for drugs all relate to poisoning from drug use.</p>
	<p pid=".1681W.8/11" class="indent">Deaths from poisoning which involved both drugs and alcohol are coded as being due to drug poisoning, in accordance with international rules for coding cause of death.</p>
	<p pid=".1681W.8/12" class="indent">The figures on alcohol include only those where the underlying cause was alcohol-related. The figures on specific drugs include any mention of the substance where the death was related to drug poisoning.</p>

A recent review suggested that in approximately 5 per cent. of cases received, one or more fields were either not captured or were misinterpreted during the scanning process. This figure includes returns where the handwriting results in information being captured incorrectly. As a result of this review, HMRC have identified a number of modifications which will quickly reduce the percentage of cases in which there is a scanning error.</p>

	<p pid=".1701W.5/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question concerning what the incidence of testicular cancer per 1,000 population men was in <i>(a)</i> Gloucestershire and <i>(b)</i> Stroud District in each of the last five years. (13617)</p>
	<p pid=".1701W.5/4" class="indent">The most recent available figures for the incidence of testicular cancer are for the year 2002. Over the five year period 1998&ndash;2002, there were on average 22 cases of testicular cancer each year in the current county of Gloucestershire, too few to reliably calculate annual age-standardised incidence rates. For the five year period 1998&ndash;2002, the age-standardised incidence rate (directly standardised to the European standard population) for Gloucestershire was 8.0 per 100,000 men. For comparison, the corresponding rate for England was 6.5 per 100,000 men.</p>
	<p pid=".1701W.5/5" class="indent">In the five year period 1998&ndash;2002, there were 12 cases of testicular cancer in the local authority of Stroud. The numbers of cases are too few to reliably calculate either annual age-standardised incidence rates or an age-standardised rate for the five-year period.</p>
