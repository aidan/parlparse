	<p pid="b.1053W.6/1">DFID supported analysis of the human resources for health crises in Africa for the High Level Forum for Health in November 2005. The migration of skilled health workers from poorer African countries to developed countries in Europe, the United States and elsewhere has a significant impact on the capacity of African national health services to deliver HIV and AIDS treatment, prevention and care. However, migration to other more developed African countries and internal migration from rural to urban areas are also important factors. Health worker shortages are exacerbated by AIDS-related mortality among the health work force. The result is an overburdened health work force and weak health systems with inadequate capacity to deliver services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1053W.6/2">DFID is working at country level to address human resources capacity and support Governments to implement policies on retention, skill mix and deployment. For example, DFID is supporting the health sector in Malawi&mdash;one of the most severely affected countries, with &pound;100 million over five years. About &pound;55 million of this is earmarked for the Emergency Human Resources Programme of the Malawi Government. This programme is aiming to increase recruitment and retention of staff by raising health worker salaries by 50 per cent., providing housing and improving training. This is expected to double the number of nurses and triple the number of doctors in training&mdash;while using international volunteers to fill gaps in the meantime. DFID is also funding country HIV and AIDS programmes to mitigate the impact of HIV and AIDS on the health workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1053W.6/3">DFID is also working closely with the Department of Health (DH) to address &quot;pull&quot; incentives, preventing the targeting of developing countries in the international recruitment of health care professionals within the NHS through the Code of Practice for International Recruitment of Healthcare Professionals.</p>

	<p pid="b.1059W.0/3">The level of the obligation will rise from 2.5 per cent. in the financial year 2008-09 to 3.75 per cent. in 2009-10 and 5 per cent. in 2010-11. These levels will deliver a significant increase on current sales and will mean that by 2010 the vast majority of UK forecourts will be supplying renewable fuels in the form of biodiesel and bioethanol. The RTFO will deliver real environmental benefits and is projected to save around 1 million tonnes of carbon by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.1059W.3/1">The single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test is a well-established screening test for TB in cattle and the primary tool for live testing in Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1059W.3/2">The SICCT is approved and recognised by the EU Commission and the International Animal Health Organisation (OIE) as the primary tool for the diagnosis of TB in cattle and other species, by virtue of its overall accuracy, robustness and relative simplicity. This has been demonstrated in several field evaluations conducted throughout the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.1059W.3/3">The accuracy of any test is measured in terms of its specificity (proportion of uninfected animals identified as negative) and its sensitivity (proportion of infected animals detected as positive).

	<p pid="b.1063W.2/2">Local authorities are assessed against a number of indicators on household waste which include the percentage sent for recycling or composting and the total weight collected per head. The Audit Commission publishes information on local authority performance against these indicators each year. This is available from the Audit Commission website:</p>

	<p pid="b.1063W.2/4">Currently, there is no local authority statutory performance standard for waste minimisation. However, as part of the review of England's Waste Strategy, Defra is looking at what levels and what forms of targets and indicators will, in the longer-term, be the most efficient at continuing the recent improvements we have seen in waste performance. The review will take into account existing policies designed to make waste management more sustainable, and consider how best to present information on local authority waste performance, consistent with sustainable waste management objectives.</p>

	<p pid="b.1064W.8/1">Defra published the independent Review of the Environmental and Health Effects of Waste Management, in 2004, which was peer reviewed by the Royal Society. The review concluded that, based on the evidence from studies so far, the treatment of municipal solid waste&mdash;including by incineration&mdash;has, at most, a minor impact on human health and the environment. Defra has also recently published a study, &quot;Impact of Energy from Waste and Recycling Policy on UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions&quot;, in support of a review of the Government's waste strategy. This is available on the Defra website:</p>
	<p pid="b.1064W.8/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/strategy/pdf/ermreport.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/strategy/pdf/ermreport.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1064W.8/3">9 per cent. of waste is currently incinerated in England, but an increase is likely to be needed to be able to meet landfill directive targets, despite big improvements in waste recycling and minimisation. Recovering energy from waste through incineration produces many fewer greenhouse gas emissions than landfilling. Deriving energy from biodegradable waste also helps to offset fossil fuel generation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1064W.8/4">The Environment Agency ensures that emissions and other outputs from waste management facilities are within the limits set by the EU and the UK Government to minimise any negative impact. Incinerators are also required to conform to tighter emission standards than other types of combustion plants.</p>

	<p pid="b.1078W.5/2">We have a duty to deliver housing appropriate to the needs of those with serious disabilities. Housing Associations are now the main providers of new social housing. Regional Housing Boards recommend the allocation of resources to deliver regional and sub-regional priorities identified in Regional Housing Strategies. The Housing Corporation has invested &pound;3.3 million for 54 new supported housing units in West Yorkshire between 2004-06. For the period 2006-08, &pound;4.2 million has been allocated to provide 95 new supported housing units in West Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.1078W.5/3">In addition, Leeds are delivering through the private finance initiative high-quality accommodation and support services for people with learning disabilities. In addition to specialist provision, we continue to enable people with serious disabilities to live in their own homes if they wish to do so, with the appropriate level of care. Council housing adaptations are resourced through Council's Housing Revenue Account, or from other financial resources available to the local authority. Local authority tenants are statutorily entitled to assistance under the Disabled Facilities Grant programme but the present financial arrangements preclude the ODPM ring fenced fund being used for the provision of such adaptations for LA tenants. In the private sector, each year around 30,000 applicants benefit from a Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG), which since 1997 has increased from &pound;57 million to &pound;103 million in 2005-06. Leeds allocation for 2006-07 is &pound;1.5 million, a 37 per cent. increase. Provision for suitable accommodation will also be increased through our decision to implement the Lifetime Homes Standard through the new Code for Sustainable Homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1078W.5/4">I also understand that Leeds city council is preparing a Disability Housing Strategy and a Learning Disabilities Strategy (Valuing People), which will set out the approach that the authority needs to take in future years for provision of new housing which meets the needs of the seriously disabled in our communities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1079W.5/3">Government have increased overall spending in the south east since 2000 by 50 per cent. from &pound;30 billion to &pound;45 billion, including a 244 per cent. increase in housing and community funding, 67 per cent. increase in health, 59 per cent. in transport and 58 per cent. in education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1079W.5/4">The South East Plan has been recently submitted to Government and sets out the regional assembly's views on required house building levels in the south east to 2026. This work has been prepared in partnership with local councils, and so takes account of local assessments of need. In its draft the assembly has taken a view of infrastructure requirements across the region, and this will be debated at the forthcoming examination in public. In due course, the Government will give their approval to the final version, which will certainly take into account the issue of infrastructure delivery, on the basis of the best information available at the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1079W.5/5">The Government response to the Barker report included:</p>
	<p pid="b.1079W.5/6" class="indent">a cross-cutting review in the run-up to CSR 07 to co-ordinate infrastructure provision across Departments;</p>
	<p pid="b.1079W.5/7" class="indent">consultation on the Government's response to Kate Barker's recommendation for a Planning-Gain Supplement (PGS) to help finance infrastructure and ensure that local authorities share in the benefits growth brings.</p>

Formula grant comprises revenue support grant, redistributed business rates and, for authorities with responsibility for policing, principal formula police grant.

The Government are currently working with a number of locally led and managed projects in order to develop mixed communities in some of our most disadvantaged areas, while also testing out approaches to encourage mixed communities more widely.

The programme went live on <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, and brought together a range of pre-existing services and funding streams under a single strategic framework. This included the establishment of national quality standards&mdash;the Quality Assessment Framework&mdash;which include, among many other matters, ensuring proper procedures for risk assessment and health and safety of staff and against which all of these services have now been assessed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1083W.5/1">The Government's response to the Butler Review was presented to Parliament in March 2005 (Cm 6492) and its response to the recommendations regarding the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) is in Chapter 7.</p>
	<p pid="b.1083W.5/2">Lord Butler recommended that the relevant work of the DIS should be more closely integrated with the rest of the intelligence community. The DIS is now fully integrated into the central intelligence requirements and priorities process, although with the acknowledgement that the Ministry of Defence remains ultimately responsible for providing the DIS with its direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1083W.5/3">Lord Butler recommended that consideration should be given to the provision of proper channels for the expression of dissent within the DIS. As the Government response indicated, the MOD had already introduced new arrangements for raising issues of conscience and professional concern, including dissent, in order to address (inter alia) the concerns expressed by Lord Butler. The procedure for handling matters of conscience or professional concern was promulgated to staff in a standing instruction in March 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1083W.5/4">Lord Butler recommended that in future the Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence should be an intelligence specialist. The MOD recognises the advantage of appointing an intelligence specialist to this role, but as the post requires a wider skills base, increased staff development effort, including a leadership programme for members of the DIS, has been introduced and will enable more personnel with intelligence experience to be considered for the post.</p>

The institutions created under the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and the North South Cooperation (Implementation Bodies) (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 already facilitate work across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The current Ireland/Northern Ireland PEACE and INTERREG IIIA programmes are managed by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) and these structures have performed well.</p>

	<p pid="b.1095W.2/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question about how much the Department for Regional Development spent on structural maintenance for the road network in counties (a) Tyrone, (b) Deny and (c) Fermanagh in each of the past five years; and how much the Department has budgeted for structural maintenance in (i) the current year and (ii) the next two years in these counties. I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.2/4" class="indent">Firstly I should advise that whilst Roads Service does not maintain details of expenditure on a county basis, such information is available on a district council basis. The table below details Roads Service's expenditure, for the five-year period 2000/01 to 2004/05, on structural maintenance for the nine district councils whose boundaries straddle Counties Tyrone, Londonderry and Fermanagh. Expenditure details for 2005/06 year are not yet available.</p>

	<p pid="b.1095W.2/21" class="indent">In providing this information, I should explain that Roads Service does not simply apportion its total structural maintenance expenditure equally across district council areas. Resources available for each maintenance activity (e.g. resurfacing, patching, gully emptying, grass cutting etc) are apportioned to district council areas using appropriate indicators of need. This ensures, so far as possible, an equitable distribution of funds across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.2/22" class="indent">With regard to structural maintenance expenditure in the current year and the next two years, I can advise that Roads Service's structural maintenance budgets are not allocated at the outset of the financial year on a district council basis. Therefore, it is not possible to give an initial budget allocation for 2006/07 for structural maintenance in each district council area as requested. However, expenditure this year, coupled with the Revised Budget allocations, suggests that approximately &pound;170m will be invested in roads' structural maintenance across Northern Ireland in the three years to 2007/08.</p>

	<p pid="b.1096W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-13">13 June 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1096W.0/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding when the Department for Regional Development Roads Service will outline the options for the route of the proposed dual carriageway between Londonderry and Dungiven.</p>
	<p pid="b.1096W.0/4" class="indent">As this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service, I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1096W.0/5" class="indent">When the Secretary of State announced that this &pound;250m (estimated cost) scheme to provide a dual carriageway between Londonderry and Dungiven had been added to the Forward Planning Schedule, he indicated that it was expected to be completed in the latter part of the 10 year period to 2015.</p>
	<p pid="b.1096W.0/6" class="indent">A study is underway to identify the preferred corridor for the route. This involves preliminary studies of environmental, land form and traffic modelling, particularly at the Londonderry end of the route. It is well advanced and will report later this summer. Although it is not normal practice to make announcements at this stage in a scheme development, it is anticipated that a public exhibition and consultation will be undertaken as the next step in the more detailed development of the Londonderry to Dungiven scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1096W.0/7" class="indent">The next stage will be the development and assessment of possible road line options within the corridor identified in the current study. This will take several years and it is not anticipated that any announcement of a preferred line for the Londonderry to Dungiven dual carriageway will issue for some time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1096W.0/8" class="indent">It is worth reminding ourselves that this 30km scheme is the largest undertaken by Roads Service and will undoubtedly take several years in development.</p>

	<p pid="b.1108W.2/2">The records list countries of origin or export. Elephant products are likely to be listed under the headings &quot;Ivory&quot; or &quot;Parts and Derivatives&quot;.

	<p pid="b.1108W.2/3">The published statistics only list ivory as a separate heading with effect from 2002. Prior to this ivory is included under the Parts and Derivatives heading. Statistics on ivory seizures before 1999 are set out in HM Customs and Excise annual reports. The 1997 and 1998 annual reports list 11,907 and 51,675 seized CITES items as Parts and Derivatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1108W.2/4">Offences committed since 1997 breach either the import or export prohibitions contained in Council Regulation 338/97. These offences render ivory liable to forfeiture and it is, therefore, seized under the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979. In addition to seizure, the penalty for these breaches is the non-restoration of the ivory unless a valid retrospective CITES permit has been obtained from DEFRA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1108W.2/5">Most seizures made are from private individuals returning to this country or on occasion as gifts sent to them via the post.

At Budget, the Chancellor announced further reforms to VED, including a new higher band for the most polluting new cars, and a zero rate of VED for cars with less than 100g per kilometre of CO2 emissions to assist the development of the low carbon car market.</p>

Additional resource has been made available to considerably increase DVLA's level of wheel clamping activity against untaxed vehicles. The DVLA works closely with the police and clamping units are available to support them at roadside checks. Offending vehicles, the keepers of which are frequently involved in other criminal activity, are impounded in this partnership approach to the problem.</p>

Before considering the return of a child, full consideration is given to the Government's obligations under the immigration laws and the European Convention on Human Rights and the unique circumstances of each case including an assessment of the country of origin.</p>

	<p pid="b.1127W.3/1">The Criminal Records Bureau compensates customers for any loss which is a consequence of its maladministration. This includes errors and mistakes which the CRB have made that have delayed it from issuing Disclosures. However, there are a range of other factors that can contribute to delays in completing Disclosures, including incomplete or inaccurate application forms that require further information from the applicant or Countersignatory; the existence of criminal record information or other relevant non-conviction information and, for Enhanced Disclosures, the performance of Disclosure Units within police forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1127W.3/2">The CRB aims to return customers to the position they would have been in but for its maladministration; this is by making ex-gratia awards.

	<p pid="b.1127W.3/15">The fact that a Disclosure is proved to be inaccurate after a dispute, often following a fingerprint check, does not automatically incur a redress award. This is because in some instances an applicant's details are the same, or very similar, to those of an individual with a record on the Police National Computer (PNC). It may be that the applicant's details have been used by another individual when arrested or convicted and the CRB has a statutory obligation to disclose such records where they are identified.</p>

	<p pid="b.1128W.2/1">An individual may become known to the police within days of entering the country and eligible employers should therefore always be encouraged to undertake disclosure checks regardless of the length of time an individual has been resident in the UK. This applies to those who wish to obtain private hire and taxi licences.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.2/2">The CRB introduced the Overseas Faxback Service in February 2003, to provide details and guidance to employers and individuals on how to obtain a certificate of good conduct or a copy of a person's own criminal record from those countries included in the faxback service. This information can be used in conjunction with the full range of pre-appointment checks to ensure that the prospective employee is suitable for the post. These pre-appointment checks are the responsibility of the employer and a CRB disclosure is only one part of that process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.2/3">Full details of this service are available on the CRB's website at <a href="http://www.crb.gov.uk">www.crb.gov.uk</a>. For those seeking general advice about the countries covered by the faxback service, the CRB also has a national rate enquiry line on 0870 0100 450 and an e-mail enquiry facility at overseas@crb.gsi.gov.uk.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.2/4">Some countries, including most in the EU, also have arrangements enabling their citizens to obtain certificates of good conduct or extracts from any existing criminal record to show to prospective employers. These may be obtained once the prospective employees have arrived in the UK but it may be advisable for them to obtain the document before leaving their home country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128W.2/5">Following a recent EU Council decision, the CB has, in conjunction with Home Office colleagues and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), become involved in EU initiatives to explore how criminal record and disqualification data cross EU states might be used for employment vetting and disclosure purpose. These discussions are in the preliminary stages at present and more information will become available in due course. The CRB are also in discussion with ACPO and others about seeking access to other, non-EU, overseas conviction data.</p>

	<p pid="b.1129W.2/1">It is an offence under the Crossbows Act 1987 to sell or hire a crossbow to a person under the age of 17 and for a person under the age of 17 to purchase or possess a crossbow. In the Violent Crime Reduction Bill currently before Parliament, we are proposing to increase this age limit to 18. Those carrying a crossbow in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse could be committing the offence of carrying an offensive weapon in a public place under section 1 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953.</p>

	<p pid="b.1129W.5/1">It is not routine practice to fingerprint deportees under immigration powers, as the notice of intention to deport is often served by the prison service on behalf of the immigration service. However, fingerprints will be taken if the prisoner lodges a claim for asylum or as part of the re-documentation process. Fingerprints may also have been taken at an earlier stage if the deportee had been identified as an immigration offender or under police powers at the point of charging.</p>
	<p pid="b.1129W.5/2">Immigration legislation does not give immigration or police officers the power to take DNA samples from individuals. However, where the Immigration Service is looking to prosecute an individual, we will consider asking the police to take DNA samples on an individual case basis in accordance with their powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984. Under provisions in PACE, police officers may take a DNA sample from any person arrested or charged in connection with a recordable offence.</p>

	<p pid="b.1141W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. She will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie:</p>
	<p pid="b.1141W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question on how many jobcentre plus offices closed in 2005/06; and how many are planned for closure in (a) 2006/07 and (b) 2007/08. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141W.2/4" class="indent">The shape of the Jobcentre Plus network is under continual review. Following the creation of Jobcentre Plus in 2002 a programme of closures emerged. A detailed service delivery planning exercise was carried out in each District, in consultation with local stakeholders, to identify the locations from which new processes and services would be delivered. Jobcentre Plus inherited a network of around 1500 offices from the former Employment Service and Benefits Agency. It was established during the service delivery planning process that many were unsuitable due to the fabric of the building, location or both. These factors influenced the shaping of the future network. For these reasons a total of 206 offices have closed since 1st April 2005. A further 113 offices are scheduled to close in 2006/07 and 8 during 2007/08. In addition there are a number which are scheduled to close but for which final closure dates are subject to further planning and stakeholder consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141W.2/5" class="indent">Secondly, as a result of a decision in September 2004 to centralise the processing of benefits, 35 offices have been identified for closure once processing work has migrated out of those locations. Four have closed during 2005/06. The closure dates for the remaining offices is subject to more detailed planning but the assumption is that a further 10 will be closed during 2006/07 and the remaining 21 sites during 2007/08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141W.2/6" class="indent">We continue to evaluate our services and the network of offices from which they are delivered to ensure efficiency. Any site identified as a potential closure, as part of this process, is referred to the Minister of State for consideration. To date 12 offices have been agreed for closure. The actual dates for these closures are currently being finalised but the expectation is that they will occur during 2006/07.</p>

	<p pid="b.1142W.2/1">The Pension Service has written to every pensioner household to tell them about pension credit. In the last eight months the Pension Service has carried out a number of campaign initiatives such as the &quot;You're Missing Out&quot; direct mailings targeted at 1.5 million people most likely to be entitled. Full page adverts have also been taken out in the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, Sun, News of the World, Daily Record, and the People.</p>

	<p pid="b.1142W.2/5" class="indent">Writing again to everyone we believe may have an entitlement to pension credit, encouraging them to apply and advising how the Pension Service can help them do so&mdash; over two million mailings are planned.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.2/6" class="indent">Offering face-to-face visits and a full benefit entitlement check to the most highly eligible and vulnerable pensioners&mdash;with plans to undertake over one million successful home visits.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.2/7" class="indent">Handling over 1.3 million calls from customers and making telephone calls to around 250,000 customers to encourage and help them to apply for pension credit and council tax benefit and housing benefit&mdash;at one time and with one call.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142W.2/8" class="indent">Continuing to issue an invitation to claim the state pension approximately four months prior to customers reaching their state pension age.</p>

	<p pid="b.1144W.8/3">Initial contact by telephone is our normal and preferred way of taking claims.

Jobcentre Plus Contact Centres operate a local BT rate 0845 number although customers using mobile telephones or other landline networks are charged at their network provider's normal tariff. Customers can also use &quot;warm phones&quot; in local Jobcentre Plus offices to make this call free of charge and when asked we can arrange to call them back at any point during their call.</p>
	<p pid="b.1144W.8/6">In addition we are currently operating a free phone pilot within two of our Contact Centres, where we are offering a 0800 free phone number to customers using our services from a landline. If the pilot is successful we are considering extending this nationally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1144W.8/7">In delivering high quality services to our wide and diverse customer groups, we do recognise that some customers face particular difficulties. For example, we are working in consultation with stakeholder groups such as the Royal National Institute for the Deaf to continuously improve our processes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1144W.8/8">The Department has recently established a group to examine best practice in the use of telephony for people who have difficulty accessing services and this group will make recommendations on implementing service changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1144W.8/9">Jobcentre Plus is about to commission a programme of research to look at whether certain groups, such as customers with specific physical and/or learning difficulties have problems making contact. The results of this research will be available by early summer 2007.</p>

Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br/> <i> Diagnosis (primary diagnosis):</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br/> <i> Primary care trust (PCT) and SHA data quality:</i><br/> PCT and SHA data were added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br/> 5. Ungrossed data:<br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, that is the data are ungrossed.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Hospital episode statistics (HES), the Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="b.1153W.5/2">In the choice component of the DES, relevant patients for aspiration payments are those referred from primary care to secondary care, where a specialist's opinion is needed and the current nationally agreed guidance on choice exclusions do not apply.</p>

	<p pid="b.1156W.2/1">The Department has not collected data on the number of dentists accepting new patients. The Department has in the past asked primary care trusts (PCTs) to provide information to the nhs.uk (web resource) and NHS Direct on which dentists are accepting new patients. The main problem with these data is that they can change at a rapid pace and therefore may not be reliable, thus making them limited in their practical use. That is why the Department has given PCTs more flexibility in deciding how they most effectively inform the local public about access to dental services. The implementation review group, which includes patient representatives, dentists and national health service organisations, has been set up to monitor the NHS dental reforms; as part of this they will be assessing the level of information that is on the website.</p>

	<p pid="b.1160W.2/1">The Gershon Report, confirmed by the 2004 Spending Review, set the Department a target net reduction of 720 in its number of full-time equivalent (FTE) posts. As the Department had already embarked on its change programme, it was agreed that reductions made since the programme was announced in March 2003 would be included and the 720 target was calculated and agreed on this basis. The baseline level of staffing was therefore the 3,645 FTE posts that had previously been budgeted for in 2003-04. The Change Programme anticipated an eventual staffing level of 2,245 FTE posts, a reduction of 1,400 FTE posts. This consisted of the 720 Gershon target and a further 680 to be achieved through the transfer of work to other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1160W.2/2">As at <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase>, the Department's staffing was 2,387 FTE (this may not correspond with other published figures because of the way secondments into and out of the Department are counted). This represented a reduction of 1,258 FTE from the baseline of 3,645 FTE, and consisted of a 635 net reduction and 623 transfers to other organisations. The Department is therefore well on the way to meeting its April 2008 targets in terms of both net reductions and transfers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1164W.11/1">The Department has not undertaken a formal comparison of Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) with other fuel additives. However MTBE has been assessed separately.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.11/2">The Department's committee on the medical effects of air pollutants (COMEAP) published a statement on the air quality and health implications of MTBE in September 2000<sup>(1)</sup>. This concluded that</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.11/3" class="indent">&quot;The addition of MTBE to petrol is unlikely to increase significantly the health risks associated with exposure to ambient air in the UK&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.11/4">This conclusion was very similar to that of a major review of the potential health effects of oxygenates, including MTBE, carried out by the Health Effects Institute in 1996 in the United States of America (USA). This concluded that 'it is unlikely that fuel containing oxygenates would substantially increase the overall health risk from fuel used in motor vehicles' (levels of MTBE use in the USA are higher than in the United Kingdom).</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.11/5">MTBE has also been evaluated under the existing substances regulations<sup>(2)</sup>. This concluded that risks to consumers were not expected as risk reduction measures already being applied are considered sufficient. There were concerns for the potability of drinking water in respect of taste and odour as a consequence of leakage from underground storage tanks and actions to reduce this were recommended. Recommendations were also made to reduce repeated dose local skin effects in workers involved in maintenance operations and automotive repair.</p>

	<p pid="b.1165W.2/1">The Department has not carried out studies that cover birth settings or their effectiveness on specific client groups or the impact of their closure on antenatal and postnatal care. However, in a survey of patients conducted on behalf of the Department<sup>(1)</sup>, asking for a preference as to where the next delivery would take place, 36.9 per cent. wanted to give birth outside a hospital setting (home&mdash;13.1 per cent., midwife unit&mdash;20.4 per cent., general practitioner unit&mdash;3.4 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="b.1165W.2/2">Through the service delivery and organisation research and development programme, the Department has commissioned a three-year study, 'An Evaluation of Maternity Units in England', about the effectiveness, acceptability and efficiency of maternity units. We expect to be able to make an announcement about the award of the contract shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1165W.2/3">The maternity standard of the national service framework for children, young people and maternity services is quite clear that maternity services should be designed, reviewed and improved through a programme of consultation with users and that the full range of choices of types of birth, antenatal and postnatal care, and birth environment should be offered. It also advocates that local options for midwife-led care will include midwife-led units in the community. Ultimately, it is for local health communities to decide on the best pattern of service provision, taking into account the needs of local people, evidence of effectiveness and available resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.1165W.2/4">We have made commitments in the 2005 manifesto and in the White Paper 'Our Health, Our Care, Our Say' which was published in January 2006, to offer all women a choice over where and how they have their baby, including in hospital, a midwifery-led unit and at home&mdash;this will be in place by 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.1168W.3/1">We are developing plans for NHS Direct to become a national health service trust from April 2007 with the aim of becoming an NHS Foundation Trust (NHSFT) thereafter. NHS Direct is in the very early stages of considering its application for foundation trust status, including appropriate ways to ensure it can demonstrate that it is accountable to local communities, as other foundation trusts have done.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.3/2">Legislative provisions establish NHSFTs as independent public benefit corporations, free from Secretary of State powers of direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.1168W.3/3">As a NHSFT, NHS Direct will continue to plan delivery of its services in the most effective way. There are no plans to transfer its services abroad.</p>

			<tr pid="b.1186W.2/13"> <td colspan="5"><i> Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)</i><br/> An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br/> <i> Patient counts</i><br/> Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID. This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br/> <i> Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br/> <i> Main Operation</i><br/> The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br/> <i> Primary Care Trust (PCT) and Strategic Health Authority (SHA) Data Quality</i><br/> PCT and SHA data were added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of Treatment and SHA of Treatment are poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of GP practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 are also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br/> <i> Low Numbers</i><br/> Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &quot;*&quot; (an asterisk).<br/> <i> Ungrossed Data</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), Health and Social Care Information Centre.</td> </tr>
