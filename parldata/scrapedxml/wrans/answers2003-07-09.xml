Officials are holding discussions with in-country Iraqi women, who are legal experts, on constitutional and legal reform aiming to assess and improve women's rights. These discussions will feed into two of the workshops of the women's conference, mirroring the emergent political process and feeding recommendations into the system.</p>

	<p pid=".788W.3/1">We are committed to giving women&mdash;and men&mdash;the chance to improve their work-life balance. We have already increased maternity pay and leave, introduced paid paternity leave, extended these rights to adoptive parents, and introduced the legal right of parents of children under six and disabled children under 18 to get requests to work flexibly considered seriously.</p>
	<p pid=".788W.3/2">We will continue to promote best practice in flexible working through the work-life balance campaign. The campaign aims to persuade companies that they could see real business benefits through flexible working; for example, in a recent major work-life balance baseline survey by DTI, four fifths of employers who have work-life balance practices in place report a positive effect on employment relations, and three quarters said they had a more motivated and committed workforce as a result of these practices.</p>
	<p pid=".788W.3/3">We are also providing practical support through the work life balance challenge fund, which offers subsidised consultancy to develop flexible working projects. The current call for applications ends on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-31">31 July 2003</phrase>, and we are looking to support up to 200 projects this year.</p>
	<p pid=".788W.3/4">These measures, mean that women and men now have more choice and more support than ever before to balance childcare and work in ways that benefit everyone: employers, employees and their children.</p>

	<p pid=".789W.10/1">The Government believe that the key benefits of broadband for small and medium-sized businesses, as for all businesses, are speed and convenience. A broadband connection can carry 10 times more information than a narrow-band (dial-up) connection. Broadband services can change the way businesses operate, enabling new markets to be reached with potentially beneficial effects on productivity and competitiveness. Broadband allows businesses to respond faster to their customers' needs; supports greater flexibility in working practices; and with its fixed cost, allows businesses to budget more effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".789W.10/2">Through UK Online for Business, we continue to look at the benefits provided by broadband connection when promoting the use of this important technology. Evidence of benefits has come mainly in the form of case studies, where individual experiences in the use of broadband are examined. These case studies have shown that small and medium-sized businesses achieve real benefits through faster transmission, constant connection and increased productivity. Installation and connection costs have been seen to be outweighed by the benefits achieved.</p>

	<p pid=".791W.5/2">Chapter four of the Energy White Paper &quot;Our energy future&mdash;creating a low carbon economy&quot; sets out the Government's policy on the increasing role renewable technologies will play in our overall energy policy, and highlights many of the successes that have already been achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.5/3">We have put in place a framework of measures to encourage the renewables generation and supply industry: our target is that 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity sales should be from renewable-sourced electricity by 2010. To help achieve the necessary growth to reach that target, we have introduced a range of important measures:</p>
	<p pid=".791W.5/4" class="indent">The Renewables Obligation (and associated Renewables Obligation Scotland). Introduced in April 2001, these require all licensed electricity suppliers in Great Britain to supply a specified and growing proportion of their sales from renewable sources.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.5/5" class="indent">The Obligation is underpinned by a package of funding worth nearly &pound;350 million, which will support our ongoing New and Renewable R and D programme, and extensive programmes of capital grants for new and emerging technologies such as energy crops and other forms of bio-energy, offshore wind, solar photovoltaics, wave and tidal power.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.5/6" class="indent">In order to develop our offshore wind potential, last year we published a consultation entitled &quot;Future Offshore&quot;, which sets out a strategic framework to support the development of that industry. That document proposed that future development should take place in three strategically significant areas&mdash;namely the north-west (including Liverpool Bay), the Greater Wash and the Thames Estuary.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.5/7" class="indent">The Renewables UK unit was set up last year with the specific aim of maximizing the benefits of renewables to UK industry, and to help that industry develop.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.5/8" class="indent">Industrial users of renewable sourced electricity also benefit from exemption from Climate Change Levy payments. A proportion of the proceeds from the Climate Change Levy contributes to the New 2 Renewable R and D programme.</p>

	<p pid=".792W.5/1">Key performance targets for the Department of Trade and Industry are agreed as part of the Spending Review. The latest set were published in &quot;Spending Review 2002: Public Service Agreements 2003&ndash;06&quot; (Cm 5571). Progress towards these targets is monitored by the Department together with HM Treasury and the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit and is reported on regularly in DTI's annual Departmental Report (Cm 5916) and Autumn Performance Report (Cm 5731).</p>
	<p pid=".792W.5/2">The Departmental Report also sets out and reports on the key targets for DTI's seven Executive Agencies (Companies House, Patent Office, Insolvency Service, Employment Tribunal Service, National Weight and Measures Laboratory, Radiocommunications Agency and Small Business Service). These are agreed and set by the responsible Ministers each year in the context of discussion and agreement to the agency's corporate plan. Performance against the agencies' targets is monitored by their steering boards, which include independent members and Departmental representatives, and reported annually to Ministers.</p>
	<p pid=".792W.5/3">Information on the targets for DTI's Executive non-departmental public bodies is set out as follows for each body.</p>

	<p pid=".793W.2/2">DUKES 2003 (to be published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-31">31 July 2003</phrase>) lists 14 coal fired power stations with a total capacity of 23,214 MW; this excludes capacity which is mothballed or in receivership. In addition there exists dual fired plant (coal/gas or coal/oil) with a combined capacity 5,405 MW. The total UK coal fired plant including such dual fired installations hence comprises a total capacity of 28,619 MW; (28.6 GW).</p>
	<p pid=".793W.2/3">Three stations are currently fitted with flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) equipment: Drax, and Ratcliffe (combined total 5,870 MW) and West Burton. West Burton is not yet fully operational but this is anticipated by early 2004 producing then a total FGD capacity of 7,802 MW; (7.8 GW).</p>
	<p pid=".793W.2/4">Based on the full inclusion of West Burton, the percentage of UK coal fired plant capacity fitted with FGD is approximately 27 per cent. However the Environment Agency has also received applications for the installation of FGD at Cottam (2 GW), Eggborough (1 GW) and Rugeley (1 GW). Some additional installation activity is either under way or planned at these sites. Further stations are examining the feasibility of fitting FGD equipment.</p>

This represents an increase of over 12 per cent. on last year. The HEFCE formula for distributing the funding ensures it is targeted at the highest quality work. Our White Paper proposals encourage higher education institutions to engage increasingly in collaborative work giving them greater flexibility to determine the focus of their research. In Yorkshire and Humberside, Leeds, York and Sheffield universities are already working successfully together through the White Rose consortium.</p>

	<p pid=".801W.5/1">The Department has directly funded publicity materials aimed at parents, a number of practitioner conferences and the commissioning of research into truancy. Spending in these areas totals approximately &pound;700,000. In addition it has supported a wide range of work at local level by local education authorities and schools to improve both behaviour and attendance through the Standards Fund. Local education authorities have made decisions about local priorities, and much of the funding has been delegated to schools.</p>
	<p pid=".801W.5/2">Since September 2002, the Department has also allocated &pound;50 million of Behaviour Improvement Programme funding to 34 local education authorities to support work with targeted groups of schools in improving pupils' behaviour. One strand of this programme is focused on improving attendance. From April 2003, under the national Behaviour and Attendance strategy, initial payments totalling around &pound;14 million have been made to all local education authorities in support of the strategy objective of providing training and support to every secondary school in England.</p>
	<p pid=".801W.5/3">Because the aim of all these measures is to both improve behaviour and increase attendance&mdash;and action in respect of one will often have an impact on the other&mdash;it is not possible to identify separately the level of expenditure allocated to tackling truancy.</p>

	<p pid=".804W.3/1">Members of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) pay no direct contribution towards their pension entitlement, although the independent Armed Forces Pay Review Body abates comparator pay, currently by 7 per cent. to take account of the value of the pension relative to those of selected comparator schemes. An individual qualifies for a preserved pension and tax-free lump sum of three times the pension at age 60, provided they have been members of the AFPS for at least two years. Immediate pensions are paid after 16 years (officers) or 22 years (other ranks) and a full pension after 34 and 37 years respectively, at age 55.</p>
	<p pid=".804W.3/2">The only significant change to the criteria for members' pensions since 1970 has been the introduction of the preserved pension in 1975 for those leaving the Armed Forces too early to receive an immediate pension. Armed Service Pensions were awarded to those who served before 1975 but only to those who completed the necessary qualifying periods of 22 years (from age 18 for other ranks) and 16 years (from age 21 for officers). Prior to 1975 there was no requirement for pension schemes to preserve benefits for those who left the scheme early. The qualifying periods for the AFPS were much less than for most other schemes at that time and, in addition, those who left before qualifying for pensions, but who had completed nine years (for officers) or 12 years (other ranks), were paid a gratuity. The provisions were changed in 1975 to meet with the requirements of the Social Security Act 1973 but in keeping with the policy of successive Governments, the provisions were not made retrospective. A number of changes have been made to other scheme criteria, notably to the eligibility criteria for widows' pensions and recently those for unmarried partners.</p>

	<p pid=".807W.0/1">The Army's zero tolerance policy towards bullying is reviewed regularly to ensure best practice in the light of experience and to take account of emerging legislation. The policy was re-emphasised when the new Armed Forces Code of Social Conduct was issued to all personnel in January 2000. The Armed Forces Diversity policy, issued subsequently in June 2002, strives to create an environment that is free from harassment, intimidation and unlawful discrimination. In this spirit, the Army, in common with the other two Services, has set up a confidential helpline for use by personnel who consider themselves to be the victims of bullying or harassment.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.0/2">The Army's policy on bullying is promulgated extensively through the chain of command. Commanders at all levels are briefed specifically on it and the policy features widely in service literature. In addition each unit routinely publishes orders at least every six months reminding personnel of their rights as individuals and how to raise a complaint if they feel they are being bullied. The chain of command also issues reminders on bullying policy where it considers it necessary to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".807W.0/3">There is no legal definition of bullying. However, the Army defines bullying as the abuse of physical or mental strength or a position of authority to intimidate, persecute or victimise individual(s).</p>

Steps taken include drugs awareness lectures and regular poster campaigns to promote awareness on the dangers and consequences of the misuse of drugs. In recognition of the growing drug problem within the society from which it recruits, the Army introduced a Compulsory Drug Testing programme in May 1995. All measures to deter the misuse of drugs have, and continue to be, applied at Deepcut as they are applied at all military units.</p>

The situation in Bunia is reported to be much calmer since demilitarisation of the town. The UK has contributed five staff officers to the Force Headquarters and an engineer detachment (around 76 strong).</p>
	<p pid=".814W.3/2">There have been a series of military confrontations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's other troubled eastern provinces, the Kivus, between the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD-Goma) and various other groups. A ceasefire agreement was signed in the Burundian capital, Bujumbura, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-19">19 June</phrase> by the RCD-Goma, the Rally for Congolese Democracy-Liberation Movement and the FAC (DRC Government forces), which we welcome. We hope that the inauguration of the Transitional National Government in Kinshasa&mdash;anticipated later this month&mdash;will reduce tension in the Kivus.</p>

New Zealand will provide engineers for humanitarian and reconstruction tasks. Other nations are also expected to contribute. The multi-national force will be responsible for internal and external security in Iraq, until new Iraqi forces are capable of taking on these roles.

	<p pid=".819W.12/1">I recently received representations from Frank McAveety, Scottish Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, concerning the London Olympic bid, in which he generally welcomed the bid and identified the need, which I endorse, to work together closely to maximise the benefits of the Olympics for the whole of the UK. Mr. McAveety also raised concerns about the potential impact of the Olympics on the Lottery in Scotland and I intend to respond to his letter shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".819W.12/2">In January this year I discussed the London Olympic bid at Sports Cabinet, the body which brings together the four Home Country Ministers with responsibility for sport. At this meeting I outlined the key criteria on which the decision to support a London bid for 2012 would be based&mdash;affordability, deliverability, legacy and winnability.</p>
	<p pid=".819W.12/3">DCMS officials have also had various discussions with their Scottish Executive counterparts and I am keen that in taking forward work on the Olympic bid there is a clear and open dialogue between my Department and the Devolved Administrations.</p>

It has three trustees and is chaired by Peter Ellwood CBE. It shares the vision and objectives of The Royal Parks but is independent of Government, and will make its own decisions about the use of any funds which it raises. The Chief Executive of The Royal Parks is working closely with the Foundation and is in regular contact with its Chairman and trustees. The Royal Parks has not so far received any funding from the Foundation. The Foundation has yet to start its fund-raising work and its programme will take time to develop.</p>

The Department has commissioned no research itself since the report of the Gambling Review Body (Cm 5206) into difficulties faced by the gambling industry here or in other European countries, but in developing the proposals set out in Cm 5397 we have taken note of a number of economic and other assessments undertaken on behalf of business.</p>

	<p pid=".834W.11/1">The fifth ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation in Cancun this September will assess progress towards achieving the 'development' agenda set out in Doha in November 2001. As such, Ministers will consider the merits of already tabled proposals on increasing developing countries' access to the rich countries' markets. Specifically, the EU is pushing for an overall average tariff reduction of 36 per cent. in the agriculture negotiations, and a reduction of tariffs on non-agricultural goods to a maximum of 15 per cent. The EU is also arguing that all developed countries should match the commitment that it has already made to grant duty and quota free access for all products excluding arms originating in least developed countries.</p>

Reconstruction work has started in Kabul and the provinces on the rehabilitation of power supplies, hospitals, schools, housing and roads.</p>

	<p pid=".837W.0/1">Privatisation is not a pre-condition for countries to start receiving debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. In 1999, the UK pressed successfully for debt relief to be frontloaded, so that countries begin receiving relief at the start of the process, when they have developed an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy&mdash;a blueprint for a national strategy to tackle the causes of poverty and developed a satisfactory track record in economic management.</p>
	<p pid=".837W.0/2">However, in order to receive an irrevocable reduction in their stock of debt, there are three types of conditions that countries have to,meet in order to complete the HIPC process. Firstly, they must demonstrate commitment to poverty reduction by developing and implementing a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for one year. This is a nationally owned and led strategy, which analyses the causes of poverty, sets out how these will be tackled and specifies how government resources, including savings from debt relief, will be used. Secondly, countries must demonstrate sound economic management by remaining on-track with an IMF programme. Thirdly, countries must implement a set of reforms, known as Completion Point triggers, which are agreed between the government and the IMF at the start of the HIPC process. These reforms cover a range of measures. Among the 26 countries that have so far qualified for relief, there are a total of 317 Completion Point triggers. Of these, only 41 relate to privatisation and regulatory measures. The Government monitors progress towards meeting these triggers, including taking a view on whether the triggers are still relevant, through both the six-monthly progress reports from the IMF and World Bank, and through discussions at country level. Where overall progress is satisfactory but certain conditions are seen as no longer relevant, or delays have occurred that are beyond a country's control, countries can still complete the HIPC process. For example, Mauritania recently completed the process despite delays in the privatisation of their utility companies.</p>

	<p pid=".838W.2/1">DFID is currently engaged in the EU Water Initiative and leads on the Finance Component that focuses on improving the sustainable financing of water supply and sanitation services that will benefit the poor. Extensive research is being undertaken as part of this work to estimate the financial challenge facing the water sector at a global and regional level. The issues are also being addressed as part of the UN Millennium Project by the Task Force on Water and Sanitation.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.2/2">The water sector is funded by a variety of sources, including:</p>
	<p pid=".838W.2/3" class="indent">User charges and household and community investments;</p>
	<p pid=".838W.2/4" class="indent">Domestic public financing;</p>
	<p pid=".838W.2/5" class="indent">Private sector investment from either international or local operators;</p>
	<p pid=".838W.2/6" class="indent">Official development assistance (ODA) loans and grants; and</p>
	<p pid=".838W.2/7" class="indent">Donations from the local and international non-profit sector.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.2/8">A study undertaken by WaterAid in 2002 estimated current global spending on water and sanitation in the region of USD 30 billion, with the majority (approximately 70 per cent.) being provided by the domestic public sector. Private sector flows accounted for some 10 per cent. of global spending of which 7 per cent. came from the international private sector and 3 per cent. from the domestic private sector. External aid flows accounted for the remainder (approximately 20 per cent.) of spending.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.2/9">Meeting the water supply and sanitation targets within the Millennium Development Goals is estimated to require an additional US$9 billion to US$30 billion per year.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.2/10">The World Bank Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) database maintained by the World Bank includes information on infrastructure projects that include private sector investment and is the most comprehensive single source of data on private sector flows available. The PPI records initial investments rather than ongoing operational expenses.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.2/11">Around 3 per cent. of Investment in infrastructure projects with private sector participation between 1990 and 2001 was in Sub-Saharan Africa. Around 28 per cent. was in East Asia and the Pacific region. Globally in the period 1990 to 2001, water and sanitation has accounted for only around 5 per cent. of investment in infrastructure projects with private sector participation. Figures from the PPI database indicate that global investment in water and sewerage projects with private sector participation has fallen from some US$6.9 billion in 1999 to around US$2.2 billion in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.2/12">Private capital flows to the water sector have been mostly directed to Latin America and South-East Asia, as they are considered more stable in macro-economic terms than other regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa. Private sector participation in the water and sanitation sector has remained at very low levels and is showing no sign of increase because of the perception of high risks and limited revenue potential affecting the sector.</p>
	<p pid=".838W.2/13">DFID is supporting a range of initiatives to encourage private sector involvement for improving access to water and sanitation, while seeking to ensure that services are provided at an affordable price to the poor.</p>

	<p pid=".847W.5/1">Estimates of pension credit entitlement are not available at an individual constituency or county level due to insufficient sample cases in the survey data used. However, around half of all pensioner households across Great Britain will be eligible for pension credit. They stand to gain, on average, &pound;400 a year.</p>
	<p pid=".847W.5/2">Pension credit, unlike the means tested benefits of the past, is simple to apply for, involving a straightforward phone call. Once awarded the majority of pensioners, aged 65 and over, will not have to notify changes in their financial circumstances for a period of five years. Pension credit rewards, not penalises saving, ensuring that those who have worked hard to save modest amounts gain from having done so. By ignoring any income from savings below &pound;6,000, 85 per cent. of pensioners getting pension credit will see any income they receive from their savings ignored completely.</p>
	<p pid=".847W.5/3">Nationally around 1.8 million minimum income guarantee (MIG) claims will be automatically transferred to pension credit. As at February 2003 there were 2,600 people receiving MIG in the parliamentary constituency of Shrewsbury and Atcham and 8,100 in Shropshire county.</p>

	<p pid=".849W.3/25">3. Median gaps are uprated to 2003&ndash;04 prices and rounded to the nearest 10p.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.3/26">4. The Rent Officer data relate to all referrals made over a year. They will differ from the Housing Benefit caseload in that some claims will not be successful (for example, because the person's income is too high) and because some people may claim more often than others (for example, because they move house, or leave and then return to benefit). The figures will therefore over-represent short duration claims.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.3/27">5. The estimates do not take account of any effect on behaviour caused by the SLHA scheme. E.g. some people may currently sign up for tenancies which are much more expensive than the local reference rent, since they do not know how the rules work and are unable to find out how much rent HB will pay for. But one of the main objectives of the Pathfinders is to make tenants aware of their budget in advance.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.3/28">6. Local reference rents can change over time, depending on the rent officer's judgment about the local housing market. Local reference rent figures from 2000&ndash;01 (the latest currently available) may not give an accurate prediction of SLHAs in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".849W.3/29">7. The median differences between actual rents and local reference rents (LRRs) vary across the pathfinders depending on the impact of LRRs. Variations in median differences may be due to the type of area and availability of accommodation and will also depend on the calculation of the LRR and the judgment of Rent Officers as to the relevant local housing market.</p>

	<p pid=".859W.11/1">Workshops for primary care trusts (PCTs) and for dentists have been run by the NHS Modernisation Agency with the support of the NHS Confederation and the involvement of the Department of Health to consider these matters. Following appraisal of these events, discussions are taking place with strategic health authorities about what form of support would best ensure a successful transition.</p>
	<p pid=".859W.11/2">Subject to Parliament, funding for primary dental services will be allocated to PCTs. These funds, hitherto held centrally and administered by the Dental Practice Board, will then be part of PCTs' general allocation. Current spending will be protected and in the longer term, allocations will need to take health needs into account, as general allocationscurrently do. In some areas that may mean making additional funding for dentistry available to PCTs so that they can begin to address the long-term oral health inequalities that many of them face. That would be taken into account in future allocations within the framework of the funding formula.</p>

	<p pid=".860W.2/1">The Department has not commissioned research on the financial advantages for dentists who move to private practice from the national health service or the reasons why dentists choose to move to private practice.</p>
	<p pid=".860W.2/2">It is widely recognised that some dentists initially chose to increase their proportion of private practice as a consequence of the new contract introduced in 1990. The contract was implemented without fully piloting many of the changes it contained. As a result of problems with the new arrangements, there was a reduction in dentists' fees in 1992 to stabilise the system.</p>
	<p pid=".860W.2/3">It has been identified in successive reports from Bloomfield's &quot;Fundamental Review of Remuneration&quot; in 1992 to the Health Select Committee in 2001 that dentists' current main cause of disaffection with the NHS is the way in which they are paid. The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill puts in place a framework by which it will be possible to pay dentists differently and reward them for different types of work. This will mark a move away from the current item of service system, which many dentists complain of.</p>
	<p pid=".860W.2/4">The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) published a report in March into the private dentistry market in the UK. The government welcomed the report and share the OFT's concerns about the market. One of the broad conclusions of the OFT's survey research was that dentists face very little competitive pressure. It is therefore relatively easy for dentists to enter the private market and retain their patients, who may &quot;lack the information necessary to make informed choices&quot;, according to the report.</p>

	<p pid=".861W.3/1">The latest information available on electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) is contained in the Department of Health's publication Statistical Bulletin Electro Convulsive Therapy: Survey covering the period from January 2002 to March 2002, England. This was a follow-up to an earlier survey of the period January to March 1999 and it looked at information gathered from a survey of National Health Service and independent sector care settings, including nursing homes and was undertaken to provide data on ECT that are not currently available elsewhere. In summary the survey found that:</p>
	<p pid=".861W.3/2" class="indent">there were 12,800 administrations of ECT compared to 16,500 in January to March 1999;</p>
	<p pid=".861W.3/3" class="indent">2,300 patients received ECT treatment compared to 2,800 in 1999;</p>
	<p pid=".861W.3/4" class="indent">of the 2,300 patients who received ECT treatment 1,800 gave consent compared to 2,300 in 1999. The survey did not collect information on the formof consent given.</p>
	<p pid=".861W.3/5">The survey confirmed the continuing downward trend in the number of administrations of ECT.

	<p pid=".861W.3/6">Information on which primary care trusts do not provide written information on ECT before treatment is not collected centrally.

In particular, the Handbook contains two appendices. A factsheet for you and your family and additional information for out-patients receiving ECT which should be copied and given to patients.

	<p pid=".861W.3/8">The recently published guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) on the use of ECT will help health professionals and service managers to ensure that ECT is administered as safely, appropriately and effectively as possible.

	<p pid=".870W.0/1">The Government have implemented a comprehensive strategy to advance its long-term goal of employment opportunity for all, including tackling the range of barriers that can stand in the way of people taking up work.</p>
	<p pid=".870W.0/2">Delivered through Jobcentre Plus, the jobseeker's allowance regime provides individuals who are out of work and actively seeking employment with the advice and support they need to find jobs. For those who remain unemployed for longer, the Government's Welfare to Work strategy seeks to equip people with the skills and opportunities they need to compete successfully in the labour market, and this approach includes extending help to groups that may face particular barriers to work. For example, the New Deal for lone parents provides a comprehensive package of support including help with training, education and child care, and the New Deal for partners of benefit claimants will be enhanced from April 2004 to provide the same package of support. Participants in the New Deal for over 50s, who may have been out of the labour market for some time, are eligible for training grants to help update their skills. The New Deal for disabled people provides a national network of innovative job brokers to help disabled people locate and move into secure employment.</p>
	<p pid=".870W.0/3">Support has also been extended to local areas with high levels of worklessness where residents may face multiple barriers to work. For example, Employment Zones in 16 areas of England, Scotland and Wales allow jobseekers and their personal advisers to use funds with complete flexibility to overcome individual barriers to work.</p>
	<p pid=".870W.0/4">The Government have also reformed the benefits systems to improve work incentives and ensure that individuals are rewarded as they move into, and progress within, employment. The national minimum wage (NMW) provides fair minimum incomes from work, and the working tax credit, introduced in April 2003, is designed to tackle poor work incentives and persistent poverty among working people, providing support on top of the guarantee provided by the NMW.</p>

	<p pid=".871W.0/1">Entrust is a private, not-for-profit company limited by guarantee. It was appointed the regulator of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme (LTCS) by the previous Government in 1996. It works to Terms of Approval agreed with Customs and Excise and is closely monitored to ensure that it is carrying out its regulatory function in line with these obligations. The current Terms of Approval took effect on <phrase class="date" code="2001-10-05">5 October 2001</phrase>, and are available on the Entrust website at <a href="http://www.Entrust.org.uk">www.Entrust.org.uk</a></p>
	<p pid=".871W.0/2">Part of Customs' stewardship of Entrust is to monitor its expenditure. A survey in 2000/01 established that its administrative costs are in line with similar bodies. Later this year Customs will complete another survey. Under the Terms of Approval the Board of Entrust submits its annual report to the Commissioners of Customs and Excise.</p>
	<p pid=".871W.0/3">If Entrust were to cease to trade then the assets of the company would be transferred to a successor body or, where this does not exist, to a body with similar objectives. The company is financed through enrolment fees from approved environmental bodies and through an agreed percentage of qualifying contributions received by these approved bodies (currently 2 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid=".871W.0/4">Details on the Directors of Entrust and their experience can be found on their website. Also to be found there are the Terms of Approval which cover the appointment of Directors. It is the policy of the Board of Entrust that any appointment takes place in accordance with the principles laid down by Lord Nolan.</p>

	<p pid=".874W.5/1">The New Deal for Young People (NDYP), for 18&ndash;24 year olds, and the New Deal for those aged 25 and over (ND25+), provide comprehensive support for young and older long-term jobseekers. These programmes have helped to reduce both long-term and youth long-term unemployment by over three quarters since 1997. Almost 430,000 long-term unemployed 18&ndash;24 year olds have found jobs through NDYP, while ND25+ has helped more than 145,000 people back into work. Independent research has confirmed the positive impact of the New Deal, Chapter 4 of Budget 2003 (HC 500) provides further information</p>
	<p pid=".874W.5/2">The Government has extended this approach to support groups that experience particular labour market disadvantage. The New Deal for over 50s, introduced nationally in 2000, has assisted nearly 94,000 people into jobs and has helped increase the employment rate of those aged between 50 and state retirement age to 69 per cent. (winter 2002) from 65 per cent. in 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.5/3">All lone parents who are not working or working less than 16 hours a week are eligible for a comprehensive package of support through the New Deal for Lone Parents, which has assisted nearly 194,000 lone parents into jobs and helped to increase employment among lone parents from just over 40 per cent. throughout the early 1990s to 54 per cent. (summer 2002). The New Deal for Disabled People has helped nearly 9,000 people into work since its introduction in 2001&mdash;the employment rate of people with disabilities stood at 49 per cent. in summer 2002, up from 47 per cent. a year earlier.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.5/4">The Government has also taken steps to provide further support for local areas with high levels of worklessness. Action Teams have been introduced in 63 disadvantaged areas of England, Scotland and Wales, focusing resources on the long-term unemployed and economically inactive and using these resources in innovative ways to overcome specific local barriers to work. Employment Zones in 15 areas of England, Scotland and Wales allow long-term unemployed people aged 25 or over and their personal advisers to use funds with complete flexibility to overcome individual barriers to work, and have helped over 28,500 people into work. Budget 2003 announced details of further steps to extend the help provided by Employment Zones more widely and to encourage innovation among providers. In addition, the 2002 Pre-Budget Report announced the Government's intention to pilot a programme of intensive support, including accelerated access onto the New Deal after just three months of unemployment, in 12 neighbourhoods with very high concentrations of worklessness from April 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".874W.5/5">The Government's welfare to work policies have been supported by reforms to strengthen work incentives. The National Minimum Wage (NMW) provides fair minimum incomes from work, and will be increased to &pound;4.50 an hour for adult workers aged 22 or over, and &pound;3.80 an hour for workers aged between 18 and 21 or in approved training, from October 2003. The Working Tax Credit, introduced in April 2003, is designed to help tackle poor work incentives and persistent poverty among working people, providing support on top of the guarantee provided by the NMW. The table below demonstrates how the Government's reforms have increased the minimum income that people can expect when moving into work since the introduction of the NMW in April 1999 and the Working Families Tax Credit in October 1999, including through the increases in the NMW in October 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".878W.6/2">Claims for tax credits continue to arrive, and are processed as quickly as possible. Claims for which no further information is required, and which pass the various pre award checks, go through the stages of calculating the award quickly and will normally be in payment within a few days.</p>
