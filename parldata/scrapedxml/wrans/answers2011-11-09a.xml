The Government's decisive action to tackle our deficit has put the UK ahead of the curve, and helped mitigate the risks that are weighing down on confidence elsewhere. The Government will stick to their course.</p>

The new package of measures will give them the powers they need to reduce alcohol-related violence, deaths and personal injuries. They will make it easier for licensing authorities to remove licences from, or refuse to grant licences to, premises that are causing problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.315W.9/2">The 2011 Act will, for example, extend the scope of Early Morning Restriction Orders, which are an additional tool for licensing authorities to reduce levels of alcohol-induced crime and promote public safety in their area by restricting alcohol sales late at night.</p>
	<p pid="a.315W.9/3">The Act also contains provisions which give licensing authorities the power to introduce a 'late night levy' in their area. This will mean that businesses which profit from supplying alcohol late at night make a contribution towards the costs of policing the late night economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.316W.5/1">The Government recognise the importance of glassware bans in limiting alcohol-related violence and the harms it causes. We have taken steps, through the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 (the 2011 Act), to ensure that the police and licensing authorities have the powers they need to do impose them.</p>
	<p pid="a.316W.5/2">The Licensing Act 2003 allows licensing authorities (LAs) to impose conditions that promote public protection objectives, including the prevention of crime and disorder; and public safety. Bans on the use of bottles by customers; requirements for the use of safer alternatives to traditional glassware; and bans on customers exiting with glassware are common conditions. Other types of condition, such as those that require the use of security staff, or regular glass collections, can also reduce the potential for violent incidents involving glassware.</p>
	<p pid="a.316W.5/3">The 2011 Act put communities and the police in a much better position to prevent alcohol-related crime and disorder, including the imposition of conditions restricting glassware at specific premises. For example, the 2011 Act will lower the test that applies to LAs' decisions from</p>
	<p pid="a.316W.5/4">&#8220;necessary for the promotion of the licensing objectives&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.316W.5/5">to</p>
	<p pid="a.316W.5/6">&#8220;appropriate for the promotion of the licensing objectives&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.316W.5/7">This will mean, for example, that if the police have a concern about a particular premises, due to its nature or history, they will be able seek the imposition of appropriate conditions. We do not consider that a ban on glass bottles should apply to all premises of a particular type, because we recognise that many premises operate responsibly, and without violent incidents.</p>

	<p pid="a.322W.8/1">The Government recently announced that they were providing an additional &#163;150 million to improve mobile phone coverage in the UK. The principal consideration when considering the optimal use of the &#163;150 million for mobile masts will be to fill in not-spots in the national 2G mobile coverage and raise the coverage level to 99% and we will be working with Ofcom and other stakeholders to determine where best to site these new masts.</p>
	<p pid="a.322W.8/2">No decisions on locating masts have yet been made. In making those decisions, consideration will be given to the requirements of hosting other technologies such as 3G to improve the coverage of that technology too. Looking further in the future we envisage that 4G could be hosted on the new structures as well.</p>

The London 2012 Organising Committee (LOCOG)'s Games Makers scheme will recruit up to 70,000 volunteers, and is conducting 100,000 interviews across the United Kingdom, which will continue through until April 2012. The Greater London Authority's London Ambassador scheme will recruit up to 8,000 volunteers. There are also volunteer schemes in place in games venue cities at Cardiff, Coventry, Essex, Eton Dorney, Glasgow, Kent, Newcastle, Manchester, Surrey, and Weymouth and Portland. In addition the British Airports Authority, British Airways, Network Rail, the British Olympic Association and a number of local authorities are intending to run their own volunteer schemes connected to the games, either recruiting externally or redeploying existing staff. We are also aware that other local authorities are intending to use existing volunteer schemes to support games-related activity such as the Olympic and Paralympic Torch Relays. The publication of figures relating to the regional distribution of the volunteers recruited are a matter for each individual scheme, but it is clear that a number of opportunities exist for those across the entire UK to volunteer to support the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>

	<p pid="a.324W.6/1">The Government inherited a situation where, as a result of a failure of IT systems, two child maintenance schemes are running in parallel. Also, weaknesses in the IT systems mean around 100,000 cases have to be managed off the system. More than three million children live in separated families, but only around 50% of those benefit from an effective maintenance arrangement. In addition the annual running costs of the statutory maintenance scheme are approximately &#163;450 million, on average a cost of around 40p for each &#163;1 of child maintenance collected or arranged. This represents neither efficiency nor cost-effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.324W.6/2">The consultation document published in January&#8212;&#8216;Strengthening families, promoting parental responsibility: the future of child maintenance&#8217;&#8212;outlines our assessment of some of the issues of the current system and sets out our plans for the radical reshaping of the child maintenance system. The Government's response to the consultation was published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-12">12 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.324W.6/3">We want to make it the norm in society that parents take responsibility for putting in place financial support for their children post separation. Research suggests that just over half of parents currently using the statutory maintenance scheme feel they could make their own financial arrangements for their children with the right help. For those families who cannot make a family-based arrangement, the Government are continuing to invest in a new streamlined child maintenance scheme to replace the existing CSA schemes in order to deliver a significantly improved service.</p>

	<p pid="a.325W.6/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that all disabled people, including people with learning disabilities, have the opportunities, chances and support that they need to get a job and remain in employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.325W.6/2">For example, the Work programme, launched on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-10">10 June 2011</phrase> is the biggest single Welfare to Work programme which will provide more personalised back-to-work support for unemployed people, including disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.325W.6/3">For disabled people with more complex needs which cannot be met through the Work programme, they can access Work Choice, which provides tailored support to help disabled people who face the most complex barriers to employment, find and stay in work and ultimately help them progress into unsupported employment, where it is appropriate for the individual. Work choice contracted providers aim to help around 9,000 disabled people into work per annum. In addition to the contracted provision, Remploy Employment Services has a target to deliver 7,500 hob outcomes through Work Choice in 2011-12. Support can also be provided through Access to Work, Remploy and Residential Training.</p>
	<p pid="a.325W.6/4">In December 2010, the Government asked Liz Sayce, the chief executive of the disability organisation RADAR to undertake an independent review of specialist employment support for disabled people, specifically Remploy, Residential Training Colleges and the Access to Work programme. The Government's response and a separate public consultation was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-11">11 July 2011</phrase>. I as the Minister for Disabled People welcomed the central theme of the review, that resources for supporting disabled people into employment should be focused on disabled people themselves rather than on specific institutions. The consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-17">Monday 17 October 2011</phrase>. We are currently analysing responses and will produce a summary of responses as soon as practicably possible.</p>

This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living. 2. Net disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax, payments, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes. 3. Figures have been presented on a before housing cost and an after housing cost basis. For before housing costs, housing costs are not deducted from income, while for after housing costs they are. 4. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response. 5. The reference period for HBAI figures is the financial year. For countries and regions within the UK, three survey years have been combined because single year estimates are not considered to be sufficiently reliable. 6. Weekly incomes are presented in 2009-10 prices and have been rounded to the nearest pound. 7. Analysis has been carried out at the household level. 8. The estimates for all households include those households who are owner occupiers, as well as those in the social and privately rented sector. <i>Source:</i> Households Below Average Income (HBAI) 2007-08 to 2009-10</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.333W.0/1">I am the Minister for Fire and Resilience in the Department. Following the closure of the Government offices for the regions on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>, the functions of the former regional resilience teams transferred to the Resilience and Emergencies Division in my Department. The division comprises 53 FTE staff (which can be augmented by volunteers from elsewhere in the Department when necessary). This is approximately 20% fewer staff than employed in the former regional resilience teams, but provides the same Government support to local responders in emergency preparedness and response (the &#8216;regional response capability&#8217;), as well as continuing to discharge the Department's lead Government Department responsibilities. This includes the site clearance workstream. It is not possible to apportion staff time to individual workstreams as at any one time resilience advisers will be contributing to the full range of workstreams in the Capabilities programme according to the risks faced in a given locality. There is no budgetary provision for specific workstreams.</p>

We also plan to consult on statutory guidance to local authorities on the allocation of social housing, setting out the different ways in which provision can be made in councils' allocation schemes for all serving, or former, service personnel to be given appropriate priority, including using local preference criteria and local lettings policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.333W.3/5">Through the Ministerial Working Group on Homelessness we are tackling homelessness among ex service personnel. We have put measures in place to ensure there is better working across Government and with the Voluntary and Community Sector to support those veterans experiencing homelessness many years after discharge. We will be working closely with the new Veterans' Information Service and the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency to promote the through-life support available to former members of the armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.337W.3/1">There were serious deficiencies with the rough sleeping counts undertaken by the last Administration, under-estimating the true level of rough sleeping. In September 2010 the Government overhauled the way local areas assess the number of people sleeping rough with the introduction of a more accurate assessment that provides a snap shot of the number of rough sleepers on a given night made up of improved street counts and robust estimates. This provides a national picture of rough sleeping with information from every local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.337W.3/2">The Government are committed to tackling rough sleeping and preventing homelessness. We have maintained the level of Homelessness Grant, with &#163;400 million for local authorities and the voluntary sector over the next four years. A cross-departmental Ministerial Working Group has been set up to address the complex causes of homelessness and improve support for homeless people. We also recently announced &#163;42.5 million for the Homelessness Change Programme which will provide in excess of 1,500 new and improved bed spaces to improve hostels for rough sleepers and ensure that those coming off the streets get the support they need.</p>

In view of the bipartisan support for the loan to Ireland, the letters were copied to the Shadow Chancellor.</p>

In the course of that process, the Government will take into account all relevant criteria, including the need to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.

	<p pid="a.342W.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-07">7 November</phrase> HMRC launched a taskforce in Scotland to specifically address businesses indicating a high risk of tax evasion within this trade sector. HMRC will be visiting around 250 scrap merchants in a joint operation with British Transport police and local police forces. The results from this taskforce will help inform HMRC's future decisions on resource deployment across the UK as a whole in respect to scrap metal merchants and the industry supply chain.</p>

	<p pid="a.343W.3/1">The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) was established in October 2008. For 2008-09, records of DECC's grants are held on the accounting systems of predecessor Departments (the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills). They can only be retrieved and analysed at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.3/2">The value of grants paid directly by DECC to the voluntary and community sector (VCS) as a whole from 2009-10 onwards are shown in the following table. DECC's accounting system does not specifically identify registered charities. Most of these grants were made paid through the low carbon buildings programme which was scaled back in 2010-11 and closed on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>. This reflects a policy decision to promote energy efficiency and low carbon technologies through market mechanisms such as levies on energy bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.3/3">In addition, charities are free to apply for grant schemes funded by DECC and run by DECC's delivery partners such as the Carbon Trust. Details of DECC funded grants paid by third parties can be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

Following the closure of the Government offices for the regions on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>, the functions of the former regional resilience teams transferred to the Resilience and Emergencies Division in my Department. The division comprises 53 FTE staff (which can be augmented by volunteers from elsewhere in the Department when necessary). This is approximately 20% fewer staff than employed in the former regional resilience teams, but provides the same Government support to local responders in emergency preparedness and response (the &#8216;regional response capability&#8217;), as well as continuing to discharge the Department's lead Government Department responsibilities. This includes the site clearance workstream. It is not possible to apportion staff time to individual workstreams as at any one time resilience advisers will be contributing to the full range of workstreams in the Capabilities programme according to the risks faced in a given locality. There is no budgetary provision for specific workstreams.</p>

	<p pid="a.352W.6/10">From 2011-12 onwards, the Department's budgets for the mass casualties and health services workstreams include separate delivery budgets within NHS Finance, Performance and Operations. Programme funding for both sets of budgets has not yet been allocated for the remainder of the comprehensive spending review period beyond 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="a.352W.6/11">However, since the vast majority of emergency preparedness and civil resilience work is funded from within NHS organisations' own budgets, the level of departmental programme funding is not necessarily indicative of the extent of work being undertaken more widely within the health sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.359W.3/1">There has been no central assessment of the potential effects of implementation of the provisions of the Health and Social Care Bill specifically for people with speech, language and communications needs. The proposals in the Bill move the national health service towards a system that puts patients first, with local organisations responsible for assessing and responding to population needs and with a greater focus on health outcomes, improving choice and integrated service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.359W.3/2">The Bill provides the basis for better collaboration, partnership working and integration across local government and the NHS at all levels. The drivers of integration in the modernised health and care system will be clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), the NHS Commissioning Board, Monitor and local government. CCGs and the NHS Commissioning Board Will both have new duties to promote integrated working by taking specific action to secure integration, where beneficial to patients. In addition, the Bill gives Health And Wellbeing Boards a duty to encourage health and social care commissioners to work together in an integrated manner to advance the health and well-being of their community, and to involve users and the public in doing this.</p>

	<p pid="a.360W.2/1">Subject to the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill, general practitioners (GPs) will be given real responsibility through clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) to ensure that commissioning decisions are underpinned by clinical insight and knowledge of local health care needs. GPs, in partnership with other local health care professionals such as therapists and community nurses, are best placed to understand the speech, language and communication health needs of local populations and how to work with their local populations to design services that meet those needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.360W.2/2">In addition, CCGs will work with local authorities to develop a comprehensive analysis of health and social care needs in each local area, and to translate these into action through the joint health and well-being strategy and their own commissioning plans.

However there are some population groups who are at risk of having a low vitamin D status, including infants and young children, all pregnant and breastfeeding women, all people aged 65 and over, people with darker skins (especially those of South Asian and African-Caribbean origin), and people not exposed to sufficient sunlight (e.g. people whose clothing conceals them fully or those who are confined indoors). Vitamin D supplements are therefore recommended for these at risk groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.360W.5/29">The Department recommends all pregnant and breastfeeding women and all children from six months to five years take a daily vitamin D supplement as a precautionary measure.

	<p pid="a.375W.5/1">None. The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) does not make loans to countries. It provides guarantees to banks for export credit loans used to finance exports, and provides credit insurance policies to exporters against non-payment risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.5/2">The aggregate value of the guarantees and insurance policies issued in each of the last five years is shown in the following table by country. This information is routinely made available in ECGD's Annual Report and Accounts. ECGD would make payments under its guarantees or insurance policies in the event of a claim, typically due to a buyer default on payments due to the UK exporter.</p>

	<p pid="a.377W.5/2">The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has been undertaking a market awareness campaign across the United Kingdom, alongside UK Trade and Investment, banks, trade associations and professional bodies, to meet small and medium-sized exporters to inform them of the availability of its new products which it introduced earlier this year. It has an ongoing programme to raise awareness of its products to as many exporters as possible through direct contact, the media and other avenues.</p>

	<p pid="a.377W.8/2">The Export Credits Guarantee Department's (ECGD) credit insurance policy (the Export Insurance Policy) is designed to support single export contracts, for amounts greater than &#163;20,000, where cover from the private credit insurance markets is unavailable, with that limit set because of its administrative cost in processing business below that level. If requested by an exporter, ECGD will consider support for a contract below &#163;20,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.377W.8/3">ECGD intends to carry out a review of the product early next year and, in doing so, will consider the merits of setting no minimum contract value limit.</p>

	<p pid="a.379W.9/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.9/2">(a) While Business Enterprise Research and Development (BERD) declined by 4.1% in real terms between 2008 and 2009, the economy saw a greater drop in GDP, of 4.9%. As such, the intensity of business investment in the UK&#8212;BERD as a percentage of GDP&#8212;increased slightly over the period, from 1.10% to 1.12%.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.9/3">Innovation is an important driver of productivity, contributing 63% of all labour productivity growth between 2000 and 2008. Research and Development (R and D) is an important part of innovation, but many other factors are also crucial to this productivity growth, including process innovation and knowledge acquisition. The UK's industry and sector mix makes these other factors particularly important to productivity growth. In 2008, BERD accounted for around 10% of total investment in innovation.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.9/4"><i>(b)</i> The next wave of the UK Innovation Survey will be released next year. This will provide details of businesses' sales of innovative goods. The last wave of the survey, covering 2006 to 2008, showed that:</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.9/5">there were increases in the shares of firms with a product innovation and an increase in the shares of firms with a process innovation during the three-year period compared to the period 2004 to 2006;</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.9/6">nearly half of product innovations and a third of process innovations were &#8220;leading edge&#8221; or novel.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.9/7">Businesses invest in a wide range of innovation activities other than research and development. These include the acquisition of machinery, equipment and software, the acquisition of knowledge, design activities and training for innovative activities. In 2008 these activities accounted for over 57% of business expenditure on innovation activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.9/8"><i>(c)</i> While UK BERD experienced a real terms drop of 4.1% in 2009, research and development expenditure is pro-cyclical and as such is expected to rise and fall in line with GDP. As noted above, the UK's BERD intensity rose slightly during 2009. This contrasts with a fall in BERD intensity in countries including Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands and Japan. Small rises of a similar scale to the UK were seen in Germany and France. US data is not currently available for 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.379W.9/9">Despite the economic downturn, in 2009 the top 1,000 UK R&amp;D performing firms reduced their R and D investment less than the top R and D performing firms in many major competitors, including France, Germany and the US.</p>

A number of these build on actions from the Life Sciences Blueprint and other existing initiatives. The Healthcare and Life Sciences growth review actions include:</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.2/4">Clinical trials and health research:</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.2/5">reducing regulatory burden and improving the cost effectiveness of clinical trials;</p>

Sir Ian is working in consultation with industry, academia and intermediaries to inform the report which will be submitted to Government by November 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.380W.2/21">we are improving the take up of assisted living technology, including an &#163;18 million R&amp;D investment programme through the Technology Strategy Board, and</p>

The work is in the context of recent developments in life sciences, such as the changing research and development (R and D) business model.</p>

	<p pid="a.392W.2/1">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/2"><i>(a)</i> (i) Prison officers in public service prisons are normally entitled to a maximum of six months sick leave on full pay during any period of 12 months followed by half pay, subject to a maximum of 12 months sick absence in any period of four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/3">If the absence is as a result of an injury or illness sustained in the course of duty, the period of absence on full pay can be extended by up to a maximum of six months in any four years. If an injury is due to an assault in the course of duty (or an assault not on duty but clearly connected with official duties), the period of absence on full pay will be extended for the total period of sick leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/4"><i>(a)</i> (ii) Information from the private sector will vary from company to company. As an example from one prison establishment, a prison custody officer in a privately run prison is paid company sick pay equal to full pay up to the following maximum amounts in any 12 month period:</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/5">Up to two years' service&#8212;six weeks</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/6">After two years' service&#8212;eight weeks</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/7">After five years' service&#8212;10 weeks</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/8">After 10 years' service&#8212;12 weeks</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/9"><i>(b)</i> (i) Prison officers in public service prisons are eligible to be covered by the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS). The Civil Service has five different pension schemes:</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/10">Classic</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/11">Classic plus</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/12">Premium</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/13">Nuvos</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/14">Partnership</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/15">Classic, Classic Plus and Premium are defined benefit pension schemes, but were closed to new entrants from July 2007. Nuvos is a defined benefit pension scheme and Partnership is a stakeholder pension account with employer contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/16"><i>(b)</i> (ii) Information from the private sector will vary from company to company. As an example from one prison establishment, a prison custody officer in a privately run prison is eligible to be covered by a Group Personal Pension Plan which is a defined contribution pension scheme with employer contributions.</p>

In July 2011, the MOJ published a short report with the main findings from a range of research exploring the learning from the Intensive Alternatives to Custody (IAC) pilot schemes. Further process evaluations of the IAC pilot sites are currently being concluded and will be published in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.395W.0/1">An outcome study (Friendship, Mann and Beech, 2003) compared the two-year reconviction rates of 647 adult male offenders who had taken part in the core sex offender treatment programme (SOTP) between 1992 and 1994, with 1,910 adult male offenders who had not taken part in the core SOTP. The two samples were matched on year of discharge and shared the same broad characteristics. The treated offenders had statistically significantly lower sexual and/or violent reconviction rates at two years than the untreated offenders (4.6% compared to 8.1%). The biggest impact on reconviction occurred with medium risk offenders. Low risk offenders were very unlikely to reconvict whether treated or not, and the core SOTP did not seem to be sufficient treatment for high risk sex offenders. Following this research, an additional treatment programme has been developed to increase the intensity of treatment with high and very high risk sexual offenders.</p>

	<p pid="a.396W.3/1">ASSET is a structured assessment tool used by Youth Offending Teams in England and Wales on all young offenders who come into contact with the criminal justice system. The Youth Justice Board are currently developing a detailed business case for options to review and redesign ASSET.</p>
	<p pid="a.396W.3/2">Youth Justice practitioners and stakeholders have been consulted on a preferred option through a statement of intent consultation phase, and the outcome of this has fed into the business case development. A decision on any update of ASSET will be informed by the final business case and a decision is likely shortly.</p>
