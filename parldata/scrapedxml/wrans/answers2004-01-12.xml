	<p pid=".493W.2/1">It is not apparent from the question whether my colleague's interest relates to research into wild native species, exotic non-native species or agricultural animals. The answer below therefore reflects the wide range of activities that Defra undertakes.</p>
	<p pid=".493W.2/2" class="italic">(i) Illegal animal movements</p>
	<p pid=".493W.2/3">The Animal Movement Licensing System (AMLS) highlights any reports of potentially illegal movements of cattle, sheep, goats and pigs so that local authority Trading Standards Officers can investigate them and take any necessary enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid=".493W.2/4" class="italic">(ii) Illegal culling of wildlife</p>
	<p pid=".493W.2/5">The Department has not specifically undertaken or commissioned research into the illegal culling of wildlife. However, an assessment was made of the potential impact of this activity on certain birds of prey raptors as part of the UK Raptor Working Group, chaired by Defra (then DETR) and the JNCC, which reported in 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".493W.2/6" class="italic">(iii) Illegal hunting</p>
	<p pid=".493W.2/7">The Department's responsibilities include protection of wildlife through regulation of trade in those endangered species listed on the Appendices to CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species). Research has been commissioned to contribute to an assessment of the impact of exploitation, especially by poaching and illegal trade, on the conservation status of the CITES listed musk deer in the far east of the Russian Federation and to inform future conservation management.</p>
	<p pid=".493W.2/8">Through the Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime (PAW) the Department supports the network of Police Wildlife Crime Officers, which investigate reports of illegal culling and other breaches of wildlife law.</p>
	<p pid=".493W.2/9">In addition to our support of the Police, the Wildlife Incident Investigation Scheme (WIiS) investigates suspicious wildlife deaths in relation to the misuse, abuse and approved use of pesticides. The scheme is run by the Pesticides Safety Directorate and funded by government and through a levy on the pesticides industry.</p>

Member refers to the provision in Commission proposal COM(2003)14 which would amend Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2092/91 relating to standards for organic production. The proposal is intended to restrict the labelling of food with the term 'bio' to food which complies with the organic standards. The Explanatory Memoranda submitted on this proposal explain our view that the proposal to amend Article 2 is unnecessarily restrictive but note that it commands widespread support among other member states. Representations on the proposal have been received from a number of interests, most recently from the Dairy Industry Association Ltd., the British Retail Consortium and the Provision Trade Federation.</p>

	<p pid=".495W.12/1">Defra does not collect data on feed usage and composition from enterprises engaged in fish farming in the UK. However, industry estimates range from 1.0 to 1.3 kg of feed needed to produce 1 kg of farmed salmon of a marketable size.</p>
	<p pid=".495W.12/2">We do not have information on the weight of the raw marine material used in feed for farmed fish. The quantity involved will vary depending on the proportion of fishmeal used in the different grades of dry fish feed produced for fish at various stages of growth. Salmon, like other farmed piscivorous species, are unlikely to consume, through feed, more natural marine resources than would their wild counterparts in the natural environment.</p>
	<p pid=".495W.12/3">The fish used for aquaculture feed are generally small, bony pelagic species sourced from non food grade fisheries, usually off the coasts of Peru and Chile, and in the North Atlantic, North Sea and Baltic Sea.</p>
	<p pid=".495W.12/4">We understand that feed for farmed salmon includes protein and oils derived from marine sources, limited amounts of vegetable proteins, small amounts of carbohydrates to aid pellet formation, minerals and vitamins.</p>

	<p pid=".496W.8/1">There is little published information on this in the scientific literature, but what there is, suggests that avoidance of fishing gear by cod is largely a visual response. The escape characteristic of cod will vary between day and night, with avoidance being in either a vertical or a horizontal direction. Generally, fishing gears are rigged to reduce such escapements. In the case of bottom gears, for example, the warps tend to reduce the horizontal movement of fish and the headline is forward of the foot rope to reduce vertical escapement.</p>

Consequently, my Department will seek advice from the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) as to whether the evidence provided by applicants about the specific management practices associated with a GM crop present an increased likelihood of adversely affecting the environment as compared to conventional practices associated with the cultivation of its non-GM counterpart. It would also be within the scope of Directive 2001/18/EC to include conditions to the consent that circumscribed the herbicide regime permitted, if this was felt to be appropriate. The farm scale evaluations provide important data with respect to current management practices, which will be invaluable in making this assessment.</p>

	<p pid=".498W.2/1">Under Directive 2001/18/EC each application to release GM crops for commercial importation or cultivation is judged on a case-by-case basis according to the scientific evidence of any risks it may pose to human health or the environment. A person or company wishing to market such a GM crop must supply a detailed dossier of information including an environmental risk assessment on that GM crop. This information is open to scrutiny by all 15 member states and the European Commission, and an EU-wide public consultation must be held. In considering any application, the Government will consider all relevant evidence including results of its own investigations, for example including the Farm Scale Evaluations. No GM crop may be imported or grown commercially unless and until EU member states have agreed collectively under qualified majority procedures that it is safe. Once a GMO has the suitable consent, it can be imported and, if the consent conditions permit, cultivated within the EU, subject to other applicable legislation on seeds, pesticides and novel food and (animal) feed. No GM crop currently has all the required approvals for UK cultivation.</p>

	<p pid=".498W.8/1">The Environment Agency works closely with local authorities, water companies and other groups to ensure that the effects of flooding are, as far as possible, minimised. Proper maintenance and siting of sewers and septic tanks, and monitoring of groundwater levels, can help reduce the risks, though during a flood event itself there is little that can practically be done apart from ensuring that any sewage pumping does not contribute to contamination, that the situation is properly monitored, and that those affected are informed of the situation and risks. The Department has been working with the Environment Agency and others to produce a groundwater protection code of practice on septic tanks and other non-mains sewerage systems and public consultation on a draft will commence shortly.</p>

The precautionary principle does not mean that we only permit activities if we are sure that serious harm will not arise, or there is proof that the benefits outweigh all possible risks. Most regulation to protect the environment is based on product or use categories and would therefore cover such a release, whether or not based on nanotechnology processes.

	<p pid=".504W.9/1">The Government is committed to helping provide parents with more opportunities than ever before to balance work and family life. In April 2003, we introduced new laws for working parents which cover fathers as well as mothers, including the right for parents of children aged under six or disabled children under 18 to request flexible working, adoption leave available to men and women, and the right to two weeks paid paternity leave for fathers. These new rights together with the existing rights to parental leave and time off for dependents recognise that men increasingly want to play a greater role in sharing caring responsibilities for their children, and gives them more choices for doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".504W.9/2">To encourage take-up of the new rights, the Government is running an ongoing awareness raising campaign which includes national newspaper adverts targeted specifically at fathers, and is working in partnership with a number of key stakeholders such as Fathers Direct. The Government's Work-Life balance campaign also encourages employers to adopt best practice and provide family-friendly working practices right across the workforce.</p>
	<p pid=".504W.9/3">The Children Act Sub-Committee, working to the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Board on Family Law, published a report &quot;Making Contact Work&quot;, which amongst other issues highlights paternal responsibilities in caring for children. The Government is currently considering recommendations arising from the report, and plans to respond in full as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".504W.9/4">The Family Support Grant has provided funding for a number of projects over the last five years to encourage fathers to become actively involved in the care of their children. These have included supporting the Active Dads programme, which assists a range of joint father/child activities rolled out through the Community Education Development Centre (now ContinYou), and helping organisations such as Fathers Direct provide support and guidance to fathers and professionals working with them.</p>

If access to the requested location cannot be granted, then every reasonable effort must be made to satisfy the IAEA's requirements, without delay, at adjacent locations or through other means. Neither the Safeguards Agreement nor the additional protocol apply to nuclear material required for national security reasons.</p>

	<p pid=".507W.0/4">The Enterprise Grant scheme was allocated a budget of &pound;45 million between January 2000 and March 2003. The scheme deadline has been extended to March 2004 and in England, to date, small businesses have benefited from the scheme as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".507W.0/7"> <th></th> <th>Expenditure (&pound;)</th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".507W.0/10"> <td>2000&ndash;01</td> <td>3,758,000</td> </tr>

			<tr pid=".507W.0/12"> <td>2002&ndash;03</td> <td>11,800,000</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".507W.0/15">The report covering the Regional Selective Assistance scheme, was undertaken in 2002 and found that businesses who benefited from Enterprise Grant were able to invest in projects that enabled them to increase their productivity and profitability and raise their skills levels, in areas of England that would not normally attract capital investment. By offering a grant of 15 per cent., we encourage private investment covering 85 per cent. of the capital investment costs, again in areas that traditionally struggle to gain investment finance.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/16" class="italic">(b) STEP</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/17">For STEP (the Shell Technology Enterprise Programme), DTI has contributed approximately &pound;0.68 million in 2003&ndash;04 and intends to fund STEP at about this level in 2004&ndash;05. An exit survey of businesses that participated in STEP in 2003 showed that:</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/18" class="indent">94 per cent. of host company managers stated that their STEP project would have a positive impact on their business's future performance;</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/19" class="indent">94 per cent. said their expectations had been met or exceeded (38 per cent. exceeded);</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/20" class="indent">89 per cent. of companies believe the benefits of their STEP project either equalled or exceeded the cost of taking part; and</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/21" class="indent">68 per cent. thought the project contributed to new processes or procedures within their business.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/22" class="italic">(c) Faraday Partnerships</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/23">Faraday Partnerships aim to bring new products and processes, based on the UK science base, to the market more effectively. DTI and the Research Councils support 23 of the 24 Faraday Partnerships: the other is supported by the Scottish Executive and Defra.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/24">DTI spend on Faraday Partnerships to date has been:</p>

	</table>
	<p pid=".507W.0/37"><sup>(6)</sup> First two quarters.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/38">Based on a five-year business plan, DTI offers each Faraday Partnership up to &pound;400,000 per year for an initial three years. Subject to an interim review of the Partnership's progress, further support may be made available, but on a tapered basis.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/39">In 2002&ndash;03, Faraday Partnerships managed research portfolios totalling over &pound;101 million; over 1,700 firms and nearly 400 University research teams are actively involved.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/40">Initial studies of the impact of the Faraday Partnerships on business have revealed the following generic effects:</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/41" class="indent">more focussed application of research results to new products in many fields;</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/42" class="indent">greater understanding of global competitiveness and winning new business;</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/43" class="indent">opportunities for SMEs to work with universities and large firms;</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/44" class="indent">improvements in manufacturing efficiency and marketing; and</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/45" class="indent">new networks linking businesses and researchers.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/46" class="italic">(d) Manufacturing Advisory Service</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/47">The Manufacturing Advisory Service (MAS) was launched in April 2002. The Department's funding commitment is &pound;15 million over the period 2001&ndash;02 to 2004&ndash;05, as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".507W.0/50"> <th></th> <th><i>&pound; million</i></th> </tr>

			<tr pid=".507W.0/56"> <td>2004&ndash;05</td> <td>2</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".507W.0/59">Of this sum, &pound;13.75 million is provided to the English Regional Development Agencies and Welsh Development Agency as part-funding for the 10 Regional Centres for Manufacturing Excellence through which the service is delivered. The remainder of the Department's funding has supported the development of a complementary network of centres of expertise in manufacturing, a national website, and other essential central functions.</p>
	<p pid=".507W.0/60">The DTI sees the MAS as a real success as a major source of advice and support for manufacturers. Since it was launched, the MAS has handled over 15,000 inquiries. Over 4,500 manufacturing firms have benefited from MAS diagnostic consultations and over 1,000 have gone on to undertake in-depth projects to drive up their productivity and competitiveness. Latest figures show that the total added value to UK firms using the service is approaching &pound;30 million.</p>

These elements were withdrawn in May 2003 following the review of DTI business support.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.0/6">Development Project grants were another element of Smart and the funding provision and payments for this element were not shown separately. This element has now been subsumed within the new Grant for Research and Development which was introduced in June 2003 following the review of DTI business support.</p>

	<p pid=".509W.0/22">An evaluation of the Smart scheme as a whole was undertaken in 2001 (the Review element of Smart was briefly touched upon as it had only just been introduced). At the time the research was undertaken annual turnover in the economy was nearly &pound;500 million higher than it would have been without the scheme. It is also estimated that annual exports were nearly &pound;270 million higher and employment was more than 8,000 higher.</p>
	<p pid=".509W.0/23">Almost all award winners said that their projects had improved their technological knowledge/skills. Large majorities also reported quality improvements, increased investment in R and D/innovation, and an improved market position. Four in ten winners had sought further finance to enable them to introduce their products into the market. The majority of these thought that the Smart award had enabled them to do so.

	<p pid=".514W.5/1">In November 2002, DTI published a consultation document, &quot;Future Offshore&quot;, which outlined a strategic approach to the arrangements for site leasing for offshore renewable development. Consultees associated with the shipping industry included the Chamber of Shipping, the Maritime and Coastguards Agency, the Port of London Authority, Associated British Ports, British Ports Association, International Tanker Owners, and the Society of Maritime Industries. Of these, replies were received from the Chamber of Shipping, the Maritime and Coastguards Agency and the Port of London Authority.</p>

Over 400 organisations and individuals were consulted on the SEA. Organisations responding who represent the shipping industry included the Port of London Authority and Trinity Light House Services, the Royal Yachting Association and the Maritime and Coastguards Agency. A summary of the responses to the consultation and the DTI's response to them can be found on the SEA website at: <a href="http://www.og.dti.gov.uk/offshore-wind-sea/process/envrepresponse.htm">http://www.og.dti.gov.uk/offshore-wind-sea/process/envrepresponse.htm</a></p>

	<p pid=".519W.2/1">EU and US cotton subsidies are among the clearest examples of trade distortion by OECD countries. Failure to address them satisfactorily was a key issue behind the collapse of WTO talks at Cancun. Four West African countries (with support from European donors including the UK) presented an initiative at the WTO calling for the end to developed country subsidies, and compensatory support to developing country cotton producers who are negatively affected by them in the meantime. US subsidies are the largest, but recent research supported by my Department and the EU Directorate General for Development shows EU subsidies also affect West Africa because of market structures.</p>
	<p pid=".519W.2/2">Reform of the EU's own support to its cotton sector is currently being discussed in Brussels. While these discussions continue, DFID has not had direct contacts with the US administration on the issue. The UK is pressing for more significant reform of the EU cotton regime than is currently proposed, both as an end in itself and also to help push the US to address their subsidies.</p>

We welcome the Government of South Africa's commitment to a transparent, accountable and legal process of land reform&mdash;through restitution to previous owners of land acquired under pre-1994 legislation, through supporting purchase of agricultural land by previously disadvantaged groups, and through reform of communal land tenure arrangements in the former homelands.

	<p pid=".523W.0/1">Poverty reduction and sustainable development are closely inter-linked since development will only be sustainable if it tackles problems of global poverty alongside pressures on the environment. DFID policies and programmes therefore support sustainable economic and social development at both global and country levels. Resources provided as a result of the forthcoming Spending Review will enable us to continue these efforts. We will be developing plans for the next Spending Review period over the coming months.</p>

If President Kadyrov showed clearly that he was prepared to work for reconciliation, to promote a genuinely open political process and to uphold human rights, the OSCE would be ready to assist, though any activities would have to take full account of the security situation in the region.</p>

After the elections had taken place the EU issued a further statement, which the UK also supported. That statement expressed concern over the condition of refugees in neighbouring Ingushetia, repeating the EU's rejection of any attempts of involuntary return of refugees to Chechnya.

	<p pid=".526W.2/1">In 2003, average unemployment in the 10 accession countries was 10.2 per cent., caused largely by the restructuring required for EU accession. It is expected that this figure will fall as the adjustments become embedded. Unemployment in the EU15 in 2003 remained unchanged at 8.0 per cent. The average GDP per capita in the 10 accession countries in 2002 (latest figures) was US$7,105, compared to US$24,689 in the EU15. While this demonstrates the current disparity between existing and new member states, the real GDP growth in accession countries over the last five years has been 18.9 per cent. (4.1 per cent. in 2003), compared with 10.1 per cent. in the EU15 (0.8 per cent. in 2003).</p>
	<p pid=".526W.2/2">Combined with the political and economic reforms enacted for EU membership, this sustained growth should facilitate a gradual reduction in the current disparity, as has been the case in previous waves of enlargement. (All figures are from the IMF).</p>

All UK exports are assessed against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria on a case by case basis. In line with our obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 661 (<phrase class="date" code="1990-08-06">6 August 1990</phrase>) and its amendments, the UK did not sell or supply any weapons to Iraq prior to the onset of the conflict in 2003. Since the conflict ended the UK has rigorously enforced UNSCR 1483 (<phrase class="date" code="2003-05-22">22 May 2003</phrase>) which maintains the prohibition on the sale of all arms and related material, other than those required by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) to serve the purposes of UNSCR 1483 and other related resolutions.</p>
	<p pid=".527W.11/2">Since the introduction of UNSCR 1483 the Government have approved export licences for the sale and supply of weapons to the CPA and for the protection of CPA personnel and personnel contracted to assist with the reconstruction of Iraq. I made clear in a Written Statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-14">14 October 2003</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2003-10-14.7"><i>Official Report</i>, column 7WS</phrase>, that we have licensed sub-machine guns and pistols for this purpose. The Government have also licensed smoke grenades and ammunition for the protection of CPA personnel, as well as ammunition for the CPA's work with the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior. A statement on both of these will be issued in January.</p>
	<p pid=".527W.11/3">We are unable to comment on the export control policy of other countries, although EU countries apply substantially the same criteria under the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports and are similarly bound by the UN arms embargo.</p>
	<p pid=".527W.11/4">Given the ongoing problems of security in Iraq, the Government are unable to assess the illegal flow of weapons across Iraq's borders since the end of the conflict in the spring of 2003. Such exports are in breach of the UN arms embargo, which was reaffirmed in UNSCR 1483.</p>

However, the UK firmly believes that possession or deployment would be extremely destabilising for the region. We have consistently urged Israel to clarify its nuclear status by acceding to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapons state, and signing a full-scope safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Under the agreement with IAEA, Israel's nuclear facilities would be subject to regular inspection to detect and eliminate any diversion of nuclear materials for weapons production. The UK has consistently supported UN Resolutions calling for the establishment of a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction. That zone would include Israel.</p>

The system is known as &quot;Total Asset Visibility (Minus)&quot; (TAV (Minus)), and is a radio frequency identity system that enables remote and automated scanning of electronically tagged containers, pallets, and other consignments. It is linked to existing United Kingdom information systems.</p>

The remaining elements of Phase 1, to give more comprehensive detail of strategic Supply Chain activity into Theatre, were completed by <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March</phrase>. Phase 2 of the system, to support redeployment and recovery, was installed from the end of decisive operations on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May</phrase>, and was completed by the end of July. TAV (Minus) technology has since been integrated with information systems used by the Royal Navy. TAV (Minus) has genuinely enhanced our consignment tracking capability and offers an opportunity for further exploitation.</p>

	<p pid=".541W.8/1">Many of Northern Ireland's hospitals have come under considerable pressure in recent days, with large numbers of patients having to wait on trolleys for admission. In preparation for the pressure of winter, a significant range of additional services were put in place, including extra medical beds and enhanced facilities in primary care and community care services, which help to minimise the number of potential hospital admissions. An additional &pound;7 million was allocated to support this extra service provision. Work is also well under way to increase overall hospital capacity and, over the past year, the number of available hospital beds has increased by over 70. A further 30 beds will be coming on stream later this year. To complement this expansion, an additional &pound;6 million is being spent in the current year on providing extra community care services.</p>

	<p pid=".544W.7/1">Following the scheme's entry into the Government's Targeted Programme of Improvements in March 2001, a contract to design and build a new 5 km dual carriageway to bypass the communities between Parton and Lillyhall was awarded by the Highways Agency in December 2002. The Agency is currently developing the scheme in sufficient detail to enable the publication of draft orders under the Highways Act, later this year. The public and other interested parties will have an opportunity to comment on the draft proposals and, if necessary, a public inquiry will be held to hear representations. Subject to completion of the statutory processes and availability of funding, construction could start in 2006. The scheme is expected to cost around &pound;25 million and will bring much needed relief to the local communities.</p>

	<p pid=".545W.5/2">International civil aviation is governed by the Chicago Convention. Under the Convention the International Civil Aviation Organisation is responsible for establishing minimum safety standards. Contracting States are required to recognise the certificates of other Contracting States unless they have reason to believe that they have not been issued in accordance with ICAO standards. ICAO also audits Contracting States' aviation authorities to help identify and address any deficiencies in the implementation of international standards.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.5/3">Any airline from outside the EU or EEA which wishes to pick up or put down passengers or cargo in the UK requires a permit from the Secretary of State. It is a condition of the permit that the airline should be operated in accordance with international safety standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.5/4">Permits may be refused, suspended or revoked if the Secretary of State considers it appropriate to do so, taking into account any relevant information available to him, including the outcome of inspections of aircraft carried out by the Civil Aviation Authority at the request of the Department. We have now placed on the Department's web site information about UK permit action as set out in my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-08">8 January</phrase>, which includes the reasons for and duration of such action. This information will be updated as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".545W.5/5">We are not able to publish similar information with respect to permit action by other countries. Our inspections of foreign airlines are carried out in accordance with a procedure established under the European Civil Aviation Conference's Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft Programme, soon to be enshrined in European Community law. The results of inspections are entered on a central database and may be accessed by all ECAC States on the strict understanding that their use will be restricted to State organisations. The database includes information on some permit action by Member States, but what constitutes permit action varies from State to State. Some States include short restrictions on the use of an individual aircraft which may have been lifted before the report of the inspection reaches the database. The database cannot therefore be used to determine whether an airline currently has restrictions on its operations to an ECAC state. We are urgently considering with our ECAC colleagues how we can extend and refine the information on the database and whether it is possible for further information to be made public.</p>

	<p pid=".546W.2/2">Among the proposals, the paper invited comments on increasing the theory test fee for all learner drivers and riders. This was considered of particular interest to, for example, organisations representing trainers and employers of motorcycle and moped riders. The paper was therefore sent to the Motorcycle Retail and Rider Training Associations and to the Despatch Association. A copy was also sent to the Pizza, Pasta and Italian Food Association whose members employ large numbers of moped riders for home delivery services, some of whom only hold provisional licences and could therefore be affected by the proposed fee increase.</p>

Under normal maintenance procedures, it will be necessary to resurface small sections of these motorways over the next two-three years, and low noise surfacing will be used. Full resurfacing using low noise materials will not be undertaken until a comprehensive renewal of the existing surface is needed.</p>
	<p pid=".551W.8/2">The Highways Agency has plans to fully resurface the M60 between Junctions 1 and 2. In order to keep to a minimum any disruption to road users, the Highways Agency would wish to avoid work on this section of the M60 whilst widening is taking place between Junctions 5 and 8. That widening will include low noise surfacing and is due for completion in spring 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".553W.5/1">Last year the Strategic Rail Authority consulted the rail industry, local authorities, passenger representatives and other stakeholders on the future pattern of service on the West Coast Main Line, including through Northampton. In June their 'West Coast Main Line Strategy' was published, indicating the likely level of service from September 2004 and beyond. The timetable for September 2004 has not yet been finalised, but it should be agreed at least 12 weeks prior to implementation, and made available to the public at least four weeks prior to the timetable change date. A further consultation on the emerging timetable will take place with key stakeholders, including rail user groups and Rail Passengers Committees, before it is finalised.</p>

	<p pid=".555W.5/1">The Department for Work and Pensions is combating age discrimination in the workplace through our Age Positive campaign. Age Positive is vigorously promoting the business benefits of an age diverse workforce by encouraging employers in both the public and private sector to adopt the voluntary Code of Practice: Age Diversity at Work, A Practical Guide For Business.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.5/2">The Age Positive campaign highlights the good practice of private and public sector employers&mdash;such as local authorities who promote age equality.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.5/3">Age Positive targets the public sector through advertising, internet, specialist press&mdash;and exhibits at public sector events such as the annual conference of the Society of Personnel Officers in Government Services.</p>
	<p pid=".555W.5/4">The Department for Work and Pensions was one of the first Departments to give people the choice of when they retire between the ages of 60 and 65. Many Departments have now given employees the choice and over 75 per cent. of civil service staff (outside the Senior Civil Service) now have the opportunity to stay on until they are 65. We have, in fact, responded to inquiries from staff seeking to work beyond 65 and introduced arrangements to allow them to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".558W.5/2">The department's pay offer to its staff for 2003 for negotiation with its trade unions included proposals on performance bonus payments to be paid in addition to consolidated, pensionable pay. Under these proposals, the bonus payable would be performance related and take account of the total contribution made. It was envisaged it would be reduced proportionately for periods of absence beyond annual, public and privilege leave and other absences of five days or fewer. This provision was included as part of the effort to improve levels of attendance within the department. It could have had a limited effect on the bonus earnable by those, including justices of the peace, who were granted special leave by the department.</p>
	<p pid=".558W.5/3">The department has decided that the new attendance condition will not form part of the 2003 pay offer. Any future change of this kind would be a matter for negotiation with the department's unions.</p>

	<p pid=".565W.3/4" class="indent">'Road Traffic Accidents involving injury to pedestrians and cyclists' based on data available from the Department of Transport's STAT19 database. This data will provide an indictor of the risk of injury to non-motorised road users.</p>

It is proposed that four composite indicators are constructed (burglary, theft, criminal damage and violence) covering some 33 different categories of recorded crime. These indicators will be constructed either using full recorded crime data from the 39 geographic regional police forces or if this is not possible, full recorded crime data for the majority of the police forces but modelled crime data for the areas that are unable to provide recorded crime data.</p>

The local authorities and emergency services in the surrounding counties, including the South East of England, have been actively involved in this work and have had detailed discussions over the past year with officials in the London Resilience Team and the Regional Resilience Team based in the Government Office for the South East.</p>
	<p pid=".566W.2/3">The principal role of local authorities in the event of any serious emergency, whether or not it necessitates mass evacuation, is to provide support for the people in their area; in general this will involve close co-operation with the emergency services. In the event of mass evacuation of areas of London being required, the local authorities in the surrounding counties&mdash;including those in the South East of England as need be&mdash;would be involved in providing initial rest and reception facilities for evacuees.</p>

	<p pid=".569W.0/1">It is anticipated an Order will be made by May 2004 to bring into force the remaining provisions of the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002. These provisions include those relating to property insurance, to the new Right to Enfranchise companies, and to accounting and forfeiture. Commencement dates will vary depending on the lead-in period needed by landlords to prepare for the changes, but the provisions relating to insurance should be effective by September 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".569W.6/1">The Government is committed to ensuring that all vulnerable people receive the housing-related support they need including, where appropriate, sheltered housing and associated support services such as provision for wardens, to help them improve their quality of life by providing a stable environment, enabling greater independence. The Supporting People programme, introduced in April 2003, provides an integrated framework for planning and funding housing-related support services.</p>

Local authorities are encouraged to use it as part of drawing up local delivery and capacity plans for older people's services, which includes working in partnership with housing authorities. It stresses that older people's strategies on housing need to engage with and consult older people.</p>

	<p pid=".569W.6/7">In York there are currently 595 tenancies in council sheltered housing schemes and a further 887 tenancies in the independent sector. Over the next year York council will be improving facilities in two of its sheltered schemes to provide the potential to deliver 78 extra-care tenancies.</p>

	<p pid=".570W.2/1">The Independent Housing Ombudsman, who managed the pilot voluntary tenancy deposit scheme, has no information on the proportion of completed tenancies requiring independent adjudication under those schemes.

	<p pid=".570W.2/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no reliable estimate of the number of disputes that would require adjudication under a statutory tenancy deposit scheme. The Survey of English Housing 2001&ndash;02 noted that some 20 per cent. of households with a tenancy ending in the previous three years claimed to have had their deposit unreasonably withheld in full or in part. The number of disputes, for which independent adjudication might be required under any statutory arrangements for tenancy deposit protection, might well be lower than this figure.</p>

	<p pid=".572W.0/1">2003/04 was the last year for which housing capital allocations were made to local authorities on the old basis of recommendations made to Ministers by Government Offices (the Yorkshire and the Humber Regional Housing Board was not therefore involved). As was standard, 80 per cent. of the resources available were allocated using a needs-based formula and 20 per cent. according to performance. Local authorities in Yorkshire and the Humber had an allocation of &pound;65.9 million. This was for authorities to use according to their own priorities, without having to identify specific purposes such as repair and renovation of council housing or supporting stock transfers.</p>
	<p pid=".572W.0/2">Under the new arrangements (introduced last year in the Communities Plan) the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Housing Board recommended capital allocations to local authorities totalling &pound;76 million for 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;81 million for 2005&ndash;06. The recommendations, which we accepted, included a fixed sum based on a needs-based formula (95 per cent. in 2004&ndash;05 and 70 per cent. in 2005&ndash;06 of what they would have received under the old arrangements).</p>
	<p pid=".572W.0/3">The balance is being used to commission proposals to deliver regional housing strategy priorities, and, in 2005&ndash;06, &pound;10 million for 'transformational proposals' of regional significance, which deliver one or more of the regional housing strategy priorities. The Board has said that it will consider applications for gap funding from this &pound;10 million in specific circumstances. Gap funding proposals have been submitted by north-east Lincolnshire and one other local authority. I understand that the Regional Housing Board will be considering at its meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-22">22 January</phrase> all proposals submitted.</p>
	<p pid=".572W.0/4">Separate from the above, local authorities in Yorkshire and the Humber also benefited from support for capital investment through the major repairs allowance (current figures are &pound;172 million in each of 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05). This allowance, calculated formulaically, covers the bulk of support for the repair and renovation of council housing.</p>

	<p pid=".575W.3/1">The Government have funded a major expansion in child care through their National Childcare Strategy. Since 1997, 808,000 new places have been created, benefiting well over 1.4 million children. Following the more than doubling in child care expenditure agreed as part of the 2002 Spending Review, the number of children benefiting from new places will rise to over 2 million by 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".575W.3/2">Specific initiatives such as Sure Start local programmes, Neighbourhood Nurseries and our new Children's Centres, are extending high quality child care in disadvantaged communities, increasingly provided alongside early education and health and family support.</p>
	<p pid=".575W.3/3">Our National Standards set a benchmark of quality below which no registered child care provider should fall and Ofsted inspects against these Standards.</p>
	<p pid=".575W.3/4">Substantial help with child care costs is provided to lower and middle income families through the child care element of the working tax credit. The Chancellor announced new plans in his Pre Budget Report in December to encourage employer supported child care from April 2005 through tax exemptions of up to &pound;50 per week for employees.</p>

	<p pid=".577W.5/1">From September 2000, &pound;6,000 training bursaries have been offered to postgraduate trainee teachers. &pound;4,000 Golden Hellos are also available to those who go on to teach priority subjects, including information and communication technology, in a maintained school. Since September 2002, these incentives have been reinforced by the Repayment of Teachers' Loans scheme piloted for three years for new teachers of priority subjects. These incentives have helped to more than double recruitment to courses of initial teacher training in information and communication technology between 1999/2000 and 2003/04.</p>

	<p pid=".586W.2/1">Ability grouping is one measure by which schools can personalise the learning and tailor teaching to the needs of pupils. However, it is possible to identify a list of benefits and limitations for the main kinds of ability grouping at the level of the institution, teacher and pupil. It is for schools within the context of their particular circumstances to develop and determine for themselves which forms of ability grouping have the most positive impact for different groups of pupils within different learning contexts (such as different subject areas).</p>

	<p pid=".587W.5/1">Value added measures for schools can only be calculated using existing data. Given that all pupils of compulsory school age attending maintained mainstream schools follow the National Curriculum, there are only a very small number who were not assessed at the end of the earlier key stage&mdash;for example, only 3 per cent. of 15-year-olds had no prior attainment data at Key Stage 3 in the 2003 performance tables.</p>
	<p pid=".587W.5/2">Though most schools will be unaffected, we accept that a small number might have a significant proportion of pupils with no prior attainment data&mdash;for example, pupils from overseas. This is why we publish a coverage indicator in the performance tables which shows the percentage of pupils on which the value added calculation is based.</p>

	<p pid=".592W.2/2">The NHS has been using US sourced plasma since 1998 because of the unknown and unquantifiable risk of transmission of vCJD through blood. The US was the only country able to supply the quality and quantity of plasma required. The US also has a well established pool of donors, a well regulated environment and a developed collection industry. We are aware of the one case of BSE reported in the US, which is considered to be a negligible risk to the safety of the blood supply.

	<p pid=".592W.11/1">The safety of blood and blood products used in the National Health Service is of paramount importance. The current high levels of safety are achieved by screening out potential high-risk donors and then further testing of every unit of donated blood for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV before it is released to hospitals. Diagnostic tests became available for Hepatitis B in 1972, for Hepatitis C in 1991 and for HIV in 1984. It is a matter for health professionals to ensure that consent for testing is obtained. Guidance on consent to examination and treatment is available on the Department's web-site at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/consent">www.doh.gov.uk/consent</a>.</p>

A key element of this guidance concerns the training of staff. The guidance states that agencies should provide training for staff and volunteers on the policy, procedures and professional practices that are in the place locally, commensurate with their responsibilities in the adult protection process.</p>

	<p pid=".606W.3/2">All strategic health authorities have developed stringent winter plans to cope with increased seasonal demand for health services, such as that caused by the flu season. These set out escalation procedures, which are activated in the event of increased pressure on the national health service.</p>
	<p pid=".606W.3/3">In addition, a daily winter reporting system has been instigated so that the Department of Health is aware of any Trusts experiencing winter pressures. If pressures are identified, the Department of Health works with the responsible strategic health authority in developing a solution, such as the introduction of improved working practices or the opening of additional beds.</p>

This assessment has included details from the post-mortems received in the initial report or via follow-up information obtained from the marketing authorisation holder. The MHRA has concluded that the two cases did not require alteration of the advice to health professionals in the summary of product characteristics and did not affect the balance of risks and benefits of mifepristone. The Committee on Safety of Medicines was not asked to consider these cases.</p>

Many factors, such as the medical condition that is being treated, other pre-existing illnesses or other medications might have contributed.

	<p pid=".614W.8/1">It is ultimately only the employer which can take action with regard to its employees. The code of conduct for national health service managers states that where there has been an alleged breach of the code, it is for a local employer to decide whether to investigate the matter informally or under the terms of local disciplinary action. In the majority of cases the authority with which the contract lies will carry out investigations of alleged breaches of the code.</p>
	<p pid=".614W.8/2">There are therefore no specific duties placed on a strategic health authority in circumstances where an authority is notified of a possible case of misconduct by the chief executive of an NHS trust. If a case of this kind did occur, strategic health authorities and other bodies can offer advice.</p>

	<p pid=".615W.2/3">In terms of hospital treatment, in England at <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-30">30 September 2003</phrase> there were 228 patients waiting for elective inpatient admission for treatment by a consultant in the speciality of orthodontics. Of these 205 were waiting up to six months, and a further 23 were waiting over six months. No patients were waiting over 12 months. Mid-Essex Hospital Services National Health Service Trust had no patients waiting for the orthodontics speciality on the same date.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.2/4">The NHS Plan (July 2000) sets out how waiting times will fall year on year. Maximum waiting times have already been reduced to 21 weeks for a first outpatient appointment and 12 months for inpatient treatment. However, the Government recognises that there is still some way to go.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.2/5">Waiting times for hospital care will continue to fall, so that by the end of 2005, the maximum waiting time for a first outpatient appointment will be cut to 13 weeks and the maximum wait for inpatient treatment will be cut to six months.</p>
	<p pid=".615W.2/6">In the twelve month period ending September 2003 GDS dentists in the Mid-Essex area claimed payment for 2,631 courses of treatment involving orthodontic appliances for children aged less than 18 years. This is equivalent to 27.5 claims per 1,000 population aged under 18, almost twice the England average of 14.5. The mid-Essex figure is for the area covered by the PCTs; Chelmsford; Maldon and South Chelmsford; Uttlesford; Witham, Braintree and Halstead.</p>

	<p pid=".616W.5/1">The Department of Health does not collect data on the precise medical conditions of patients delayed in hospital, but it does have information on overall numbers of delays. Good progress has been made in reducing the number of delayed transfers of care from hospital year on year, with the number of acute patients delayed on any one day going down from around 6,000 in 2001, to 5,000 in 2002, to 4,000 in 2003. This reflects increased investment in services to tackle delays following the introduction of the Building Care Capacity Grant, and the introduction in October 2003 of new duties of communication between the National Health Service and councils required by the Community Care (Delayed Discharges, etc. Act). In January 2004 the Act requires local authorities to begin to reimburse the NHS for those delays for which they are solely responsible. This requirement will act as a further incentive to partners to identify and tackle the causes of delay in their local system.</p>

	<p pid=".620W.5/2">The testing of shellfish for toxins is a public health matter, which falls within the policy responsibility of the Food Standards Agency (FSA).</p>
	<p pid=".620W.5/3">Unusual results have been observed over the last two years in tests for diarrhetic shellfish poisoning toxins under the statutory monitoring programmes, which point to the possible presence of a new neurotoxin. These have therefore resulted in the temporary closure, from time to time, of some shellfish harvesting waters, as a precautionary measure to ensure that public health continues to be protected. The FSA is pursuing an extensive programme of work to resolve the issues associated with these findings.</p>

	<p pid=".621W.2/2">The Department has commissioned the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to develop guidance on skin tumours, including melanoma, for use in the National Health Service in England and Wales. This guidance will advise on the optimal configuration of diagnostic and treatment services for patients with skin cancer. In developing this guidance, NICE will assess the best available evidence in order to make recommendations on the optimum provision of skin cancer services. This will include consideration of a variety of settings and workforce roles. The guidance is due to be published in March 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".621W.2/3">In addition, we have asked NICE to update the referral guidelines for suspected cancer published by the Department in April 2000, to assist general practitioners in determining those patients who are most likely to have cancer and therefore need to be referred urgently to see a specialist. Both the existing guidance and the revised guidance will address skin cancers.</p>

	<p pid=".623W.5/2">National health service foundation trusts, like all NHS trusts, would in principle have the power to pay both the tuition and top-up fees of recruits. It would be up to each NHS foundation trust as to whether and in what circumstances to do so. Section 18(1) of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act gives NHS foundation trusts the power to do anything which appears to it to be necessary or desirable for the purposes of or in connection with its functions.</p>

The information UK Transplant collects and analyses on organ donation and transplant activity is available on its web-site at <a href="http://www.uktransplant.org.uk">www.uktransplant.org.uk</a>. In developing their transplant services, it will be for primary care trusts and specialist commissioning teams to take account of local needs and priorities to allocate resources and benchmark their performance against published activity data. As organ transplantation is of proven clinical and cost effectiveness, maximising donation and transplantation rates will be important for both patients and the National Health Service.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.5/2">We envisage that voluntary organisations will continue to play an important part in research, raising awareness about organ donation, particularly by encouraging people to join the organ donor register and supporting the families of donors and transplant recipients.</p>
	<p pid=".624W.5/3">The Department has provided around &pound;7 million via UK Transplant since 2001 to boost organ donation through the employment of 35 donor liaison nurses working with staff in critical units to help identify potential donors and how to approach and support relatives; 23 living donor co-ordinators working with families considering live donation and funding 10 non-heartbeating programmes to increase the number of organs from non-heartbeating donors.</p>

	<p pid=".626W.0/1">The Transfusion Medicine Epidemiology Review is a collaborative project between the United Kingdom National CJD Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU) and United Kingdom Blood Services (UKBS). The main purpose is to investigate whether there is any evidence that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease may have been transmitted via the blood supply.</p>
	<p pid=".626W.0/2">Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases are notified to the UKBS by NCJDSU; a search establishes whether any have acted as donors. Donation records are checked and all components traced through hospital records. Details of all identified recipients are forwarded to NCJDSU for subsequent checking.</p>
	<p pid=".626W.0/3">In the reverse procedure, patients with variant CJD reported to have received blood transfusions are identified by NCJDSU and notified to UKBS. Details of transfusions are traced through hospital records and relevant blood donors identified. The identity of donors is notified to NCJDSU for subsequent checking.</p>
	<p pid=".626W.0/4">The safety of blood used in the National Health Service is of paramount importance. Every reasonable step has been taken to minimise any risks during blood transfusion. The current high levels of safety are achieved by screening out potential high risk donors and then further testing of every unit of donated blood for HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Human T Cell Leukaemia Virus, and Syphilis before it is released to NHS hospitals.</p>
