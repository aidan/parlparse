	<p pid="a.1574W.5/2">Mindful of the requirements of relevant legislation, the Department for Transport is currently funding a rail replacement bus service between Ealing Broadway station and Wandsworth Road station. This service, which is a temporary measure until the Department can arrange a replacement rail service in this area, has been operating since <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-14">14 December 2008</phrase> at a four-weekly cost of &pound;1,880 to the Department for Transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574W.5/3">The Department for Transport does not recoup any revenue from this service. As a rail replacement bus service, a rail ticket has to be purchased for travel on the bus, therefore revenue will be directed to the appropriate train operator for that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574W.5/4">The Department for Transport intended the bus service to be advertised from <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-14">14 December 2008</phrase>. Following a contractual delay, the bus service has been advertised, from this week, at the stations it is contracted to call at which are Ealing Broadway, Kensington Olympia and Wandsworth Road.</p>

	<p pid="a.1578W.6/1">The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) has always recognised that places of worship are a very special part of the United Kingdom's heritage, and it therefore continues to ring-fence funds for them. Although the Fund's grant budgets will reduce from 2009-13, a higher proportion of its overall budget has been set aside in recognition of the role these buildings play in community life.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578W.6/2">The Heritage Lottery Fund and English Heritage remain committed to providing grants to historic places of worship. The joint Heritage Lottery Fund and English Heritage funding scheme has offered over &pound;133 million for the repair of historic places of worship since it began in 2002. In 2009, &pound;25 million will be offered to listed places of worship: &pound;17.5 million will go to Grade I and II* buildings, and &pound;7.5 million to Grade II buildings. &pound;15 million of this is provided by the HLF, and &pound;10 million by EH. Both bodies anticipate continuing this grant scheme at its current level until 2010-11.</p>

As of December 2009 Deloittes estimate that it has saved grassroots sports more than &pound;48 million since its inception. This money has gone back into sport and has enabled clubs to spend it on everything from facilities to kit. Additionally, all community sports clubs will benefit over the next year from the reduction in VAT from 17.5 per cent. to 15 per cent. which will help to increase the funds available to clubs, and moreover provide more money in the pockets of potential donors.</p>

As part of the process of negotiating this proposal we shall be seeking clarification from the Commission on a number of issues relating to Article 47. Until we have that clarification it is difficult accurately to assess its potential impact in the areas referred to in these questions. We shall be seeking stakeholders views on these points and considering them in more detail in the impact assessment that my officials are drawing up and which we shall publish as part of the formal consultation procedure.</p>

	<p pid="a.1589W.0/1">DEFRA was formed in June 2001. However, inquires with policy leads have revealed the following examples of where DEFRA has convened a Citizen's Jury since 2001:</p>
	<p pid="a.1589W.0/2" class="indent">In December 2005-January 2006, the Air and Environment Quality Division (now Atmosphere Quality and Industrial Pollution programme) ran a Citizen's Jury to explore public views on air quality in order to inform the development of future policies and strategies. Members of the jury were paid to participate in the event.</p>
	<p pid="a.1589W.0/3" class="indent">In November 2007, a DEFRA-funded research project (WU0112) employed a Citizen's Jury approach to explore people's understanding of risk associated with the microbial pollution of water courses; public attitudes to culpability given the current scientific and policy evidence base, particularly as this related to the role of livestock farming; where public priorities were in terms of appropriate level and types of policy intervention and mitigation; and views regarding responsibilities for taking action to reduce microbial risks. Members of the jury were paid to participate in the event.</p>
	<p pid="a.1589W.0/4">When used carefully and appropriately, Citizens' Juries can be a helpful way of eliciting public preferences to factor into policy decision making.</p>

	<p pid="a.1592W.3/1">For some time, the Government have been concerned that the Hague Preference mechanism does not provide the necessary support to coastal communities in the UK and Ireland that it was intended to do. We have, therefore, sought to open discussions with the Irish on suitable replacement arrangements. To date, they have been reluctant to engage. We will, however, continue to press them on this, and plan to explore options with the Commission and other member states in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1592W.3/2">In recent years, we have limited our actions to offsetting the impacts of Irish invocation in the Irish Sea and adjacent areas to ensure the UK fleet is not put at a disadvantage. However, in the December 2007 EU Fisheries Council, we also invoked on both North Sea haddock and whiting, in recognition of the particular importance of these stocks to UK fishermen, and the concerns expressed within the industry that the scientific advice (on which the quotas were based) was somewhat at odds with fishermen's experience on the ground. For the same reasons, we repeated these invocations last December. In both years however, we restricted the scale of our invocations, recognising the concerns of other member states who lose out as a result of our actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1592W.3/3">The effects of the December 2008 EU Fisheries Council invocations on the scale of UK quotas for the stocks in question, are included in the following table:</p>

	<p pid="a.1597W.8/1">Lord Lester acted as the Secretary of State's expert adviser on constitutional reform between July 2007 and November 2008, and made a declaration of political activity prior to his appointment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1597W.8/2">The Ministry of Justice does not hold a central list of all expert advisory appointments made by it and its agencies since 1997. The Department makes a number of appointments to public bodies, including advisory non-departmental public bodies, and compiling such a list would incur disproportionate cost. Since 2003 the Government have published on an annual basis the names and overall cost of special advisers and the number in each pay band.</p>

	<p pid="a.1612W.2/1">Planning work has been underway since September 2008 to determine how the Ministry of Justice will live within its spending review settlement, secure &pound;1 billion of savings by 2010-11. Regular meetings have been held with the unions throughout this period, with the next planned meeting at the corporate level provisionally scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-22">22 January 2009</phrase>. Regular engagement has also been maintained at the business group and business area levels, where business area specific issues have been consulted, including HM Courts Services (HMCS).</p>
	<p pid="a.1612W.2/2">The budgets for business groups for 2009-10 will be published in the MOJ Corporate Plan on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-19">19 January 2009</phrase>, a copy of which together with other performance and efficiency related communications to staff will be shared with the unions ahead of wider circulation. The Corporate Plan will also be available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1612W.2/3">Following issue of the Corporate Plan, business groups will work in earnest to develop their own business plans. These plans will address in detail how the Department will meet the performance and efficiency challenges. Going forward consultation will take place with the unions at a local level or, when appropriate, at a corporate level. For example the chief executive of HMCS plans to discuss budgetary allocations with the unions on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-17">17 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1612W.2/4">The recent pre-Budget report contained an announcement of an additional &pound;5 billion value for money saving to be delivered in 2010-11 across the public sector. Decisions have yet to be made as to how those savings will be allocated between Departments but once this is clear we will need to consider the implications for us. This means it will be a little while before we can publish figures for that year. Once they have settled, we will share again details of the allocations with union colleagues.</p>

	<p pid="a.1614W.3/1">There has been an 18.7 per cent. reduction in the frequency rate of youth reoffending between 2000 and 2006. The Youth Crime Action Plan, published in July 2008 details the cross-Government approach to reducing youth crime, including youth reoffending. It sets out a 'triple track' approach of enforcement and punishment where behaviour is unacceptable, non-negotiable support and challenge where it is most needed, and better and earlier prevention. The Youth Justice Board leads on the target of a 10 per cent. reduction by 2011 of the frequency rate of youth reoffending against the 2005 baseline, and is working with Departments, to influence the key services to ensure young people have access to mainstream and specialist services before, during and after justice.</p>

Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.<br/> <i> Alcohol-related admissions</i><br/> The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) &quot;Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions&quot;.<br/> Figures for under-16s only include admissions where one or more alcohol-specific conditions were listed. This is because the research on which the attributable fractions are based does not cover under-16s. Alcohol-specific conditions are those that are wholly attributed to alcohol&mdash;that is, those with an attributable fraction of one. They are:<br/> Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6)<br/> Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br/> Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br/> Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br/> Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br/> Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br/> Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br/> Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br/> Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br/> Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br/> Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9).<br/> <i> Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis</i><br/> These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br/> <i> Finished admission episodes</i><br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> Primary diagnosis</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br/> <i> Secondary diagnoses</i><br/> As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> <i> Data Quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), the NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

However, the number of courses of treatment delivered to charge payers and non-charge payers by treatment band in 2007-08 is available in Table 25 of &quot;NHS Dental Statistics for England: 2007-08&quot;.

	<p pid="a.1618W.5/3">National health service dental contracts require dentists to provide all proper clinically necessary dental care and treatment that the patient is willing to undergo. A band 1 course of treatment (diagnosis, treatment planning and maintenance) includes examination, diagnosis (for example x-rays), advice on how to prevent future problems, and scaling and polishing if clinically needed.

	<p pid="a.1618W.5/4">Patients who are assessed as not clinically needing a scale and polish are free to obtain it privately. As with any treatment if there is no clinical need for the patient to receive a scale and polish it is entirely appropriate that it is provided, if at all, outside the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1618W.5/5">We take very seriously the need to ensure that all NHS patients receive clinically appropriate treatment. A dentist who identified a clinical need for a scale and polish under NHS treatment and then refused such care would be potentially in breach of contract. The NHS Business Services Authority is enhancing the role of the dental reference service to ensure that primary care trusts (PCTs) have the tools to check that dental care provided is appropriate to patients' needs. Patients who have concerns about any aspect of their dental care should in the first instance raise this with the practice and then if not satisfied, with the PCT.</p>
	<p pid="a.1618W.5/6">The independent review of NHS dentistry chaired by Professor Jimmy Steele will also look at how we can ensure that NHS dentists deliver consistently high quality care and provide the right level of preventative work.

	<p pid="a.1637W.9/2">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is vacating one office in Leicester, Attenborough House. Enkalon House, which formerly housed one member of HMRC staff, has already been vacated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1637W.9/3">HMRC expects staff to relocate with their teams to another office within reasonable daily travel, almost all of them to one of the two offices in Leicester that are being retained, Saxon House and City Gate House. Daily Travel Assistance (DTA) may be payable to individual members of staff who incur additional costs in commuting to a new office. The total cost of DTA for staff relocating from Attenborough House will not be known until solutions have been found for all staff involved, but is unlikely to be substantial. As HMRC expects that staff will relocate, no estimate has been made of potential redundancy costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1637W.9/4">The closure of Attenborough House, Leicester will contribute to estimated estate savings of &pound;10.4 million per year in the east midlands. These savings are only part of the overall savings HMRC expects to achieve as a result of business efficiencies arising from restructuring.</p>
	<p pid="a.1637W.9/5">HMRC is unable to disclose the estate savings for a particular office on grounds of commercial sensitivity.</p>

	<p pid="a.1641W.0/1">We expect CO2 emissions to fall to about 15 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010, taking into account the impact of credits surrendered through the EU emissions trading scheme. Our goal, which we adopted in 1997, was challenging, but that was its purpose. It was designed to give a clear signal of the direction in which policy was moving, allowing long term planning and stimulating innovative responses. In these respects it has been successful.</p>

	<p pid="a.1644W.5/1">The UK's policy towards the Ethiopia-Eritrea border dispute has three aims: to avoid any return to war; for the border to be demarcated; and for the parties to normalise their relations. Ethiopia and Eritrea should agree a way forward to allow demarcation to proceed and for a normalisation process to begin, as set out in the Algiers Agreements of June and December 2000, to which both Ethiopia and Eritrea are signatories.</p>
	<p pid="a.1644W.5/2">My right hon. Friend, the then Minister for Counter Terrorism and Immigration (Mr. McNulty) discussed the border issue when meeting the Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi on a visit to the horn of Africa in June 2008. My noble Friend, the Minister for Africa, Asia and the UN, Lord Malloch-Brown also discussed this issue with the Eritrean ambassador in December 2008. In addition, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) officials regularly reiterate these messages to both the Ethiopian and Eritrean ambassadors to London and to their interlocutors in the Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea in Addis Ababa and Asmara respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1644W.5/3">From July 2000 to July 2008, we funded the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) through our assessed contributions. Our embassies in Addis Ababa and Asmara along with other members of the FCO are involved in efforts to resolve the dispute. However, as this is one of many issues with which they have to deal with, it is difficult to offer a precise figure for resources used for this purpose.</p>

	<p pid="a.1650W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1650W.3/2">Fire resistance for electric cables is covered by European standards developed under the Construction Products Directive (89/106/EEC). The 1991 UK Construction Products Regulations (SI 1620) implement this directive in the UK, and require that all products used in construction works must satisfy essential requirements (including safety in fire) for their use, where that use is regulated. In turn, the England and Wales Building Regulations (regulation 7) require that products must be fit for purpose in use. The guidance to this functional requirement states that testing and certification to a harmonised EU standard is one way of demonstrating compliance. In addition, the guidance to part B of the Building Regulations (Fire Safety) states that cables showing the appropriate classification against harmonised EU standard (BS EN 50200:2006) can be deemed compliant with the relevant requirements of part B. Scotland and Northern Ireland have similar provisions. These conditions apply equally to products manufactured in the UK or imported from either the EU or elsewhere. These requirements govern the fire resistance of cables in use: there is no mandatory requirement for testing or certification at point of manufacture or marketing.</p>

The ODA increases by the G8 and other donors towards the 2005 targets are monitored by the DAC, the European Commission and by civil society, and are discussed in intergovernmental bodies including the United Nations, the G8, the European Council, and DAC High Level meetings. The UK Government is continuing to work with others to ensure effective delivery of the commitments made in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.1651W.2/1">At Gleneagles, the UK announced a timetable to provide 0.7 per cent. of gross national income (GNI) as official development assistance (ODA) by 2013. The European Union agreed to provide 0.56 per cent. of its GNI as ODA in 2010, with at least half of the increase allocated to sub-Saharan Africa. On the basis of these commitments, and those of other donors, the OECD estimated that total annual ODA would increase by around $50 billion between 2004 and 2010, and annual ODA to Africa would increase by $25 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1651W.2/2">In the comprehensive spending review settlement announced in October 2007, the Government announced that DFID would spend &pound;7.9 billion in 2010-11, and projected that total UK ODA would reach &pound;9.1 billion (0.56 per cent. of projected GNI), compared to ODA of &pound;4.3 billion in 2004. This projected increase of &pound;4.8 billion is equivalent to US$7.3 billion at today's exchange rates, about 15 per cent of the $50 billion increase expected to result from the Gleneagles commitments. The Government has not announced a projection of total UK ODA to Africa, but has announced that DFID will increase its total multilateral and bilateral aid to Africa from &pound;1.3 billion in 2004 to more than &pound;3 billion in 2010&mdash;equivalent to $2.6 billion at today's exchange rates, and over 10 per cent. of the $25 billion increase for Africa announced at Gleneagles commitments.</p>

For example, within the education programme which will provide &pound;6 million over three years, we are strengthening the ministry's capacity for policy making and management of the education system.

DFID is complementing capacity-building support to the Burundian parliament, provided by other donors, through our &pound;6 million over six years Joint Governance Programme with the Swedish International Development Agency. This aims to reinforce other institutions important for transparency and accountability&mdash;the media, civil society, oversight institutions&mdash;by building their capacity to scrutinise government action.

	<p pid="a.1655W.6/1">The UK Government are concerned about human rights violations and lack of police accountability of the kind described in the Amnesty International report on Mozambique&mdash;'Licence to Kill'. In July 2008 the Secretary of State wrote to the government of Mozambique, highlighting some of the key measures required in order to make demonstrable progress in tackling corruption&mdash;including in the policing and justice sectors&mdash;and to strengthen the legislative framework to eliminate any idea of impunity under the law in Mozambique. The British high commissioner has also raised the issue of police accountability and reform with relevant Ministries on a number of occasions in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.1655W.6/2">In the process of drawing up its Country Assistance Plan in 2007, the Department for International Development (DFID) decided not to enter the justice sector in Mozambique as a number of major donors&mdash;including the World Bank, UNDP, the European Commission, USAID, the Netherlands and Denmark&mdash;were already actively engaged. However, well established donor co-ordination mechanisms in Mozambique allow for regular technical dialogue between donors and with government, throughout the year, on the justice and other sectors. UK concerns about policing issues are also specifically raised with the Mozambique government through the EU and high commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.1658W.2/1">The Homes and Communities Agency has been set a national target to provide 10,300 affordable homes in smaller rural communities from 2008-09 to 2010-11 for both social rent and low cost home ownership. Grant will be allocated to those schemes which meet the needs of local people, the regional strategy and demonstrate strong value for money from the &pound;8 billion National Affordable Housing Programme. The target itself is a significant increase in comparison with previous delivery and represents a significant challenge, by its focus on completions not allocations. However, given current market conditions, it is too early to predict outputs with certainty over the period to 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.1658W.2/2">In addition, provisions in the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 will enable all providers of shared ownership houses to restrict the equity share which shared owners may acquire in order to retain the benefit of the shared ownership homes for future purchasers in areas, such as small rural settlements, where replacement would be difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.1658W.2/3">The Government are also committed to helping the development of a viable, well managed and financially robust Community Land Trust sector. Community Land Trusts have the potential to get the weight of the community behind the development of affordable housing and bring forward land for development, particularly in rural areas. We recently published a consultation on the development of a viable Community Land Trust sector and we have received 63 responses from a wide range of stakeholders which we are currently analysing. We will publish the results in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1658W.2/4">Access to social rented housing is determined by the allocations legislation. This is designed to ensure the widest possible access whilst ensuring that priority goes to those people who are in the greatest housing need.</p>
	<p pid="a.1658W.2/5">Access to low cost home ownership schemes funded through the Affordable Housing Programme is open to first time buyers with an annual household income of &pound;60,000 or less who are unable to buy a home in the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.1658W.2/6">The Prime Minister commissioned a report from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> who has been looking at how land use and planning can better support rural business and deliver affordable housing in rural communities. His report, published in July 2008, provides a comprehensive review of the issues that our rural communities face, including access to affordable housing, and provides a number of practical recommendations. We are looking at the report in detail and will publish a full response shortly.</p>

In addition, the HCA is responsible for the management of the programme for the delivery of more and better homes on surplus public sector land, with a target of 200,000 homes by 2016, of which the aspiration is that up to 50 per cent. of homes delivered will be affordable homes.

These figures are broken down into three categories: Medically Fully Fit, Medically Not Fully Fit and Medically Unfit.

	<p pid="a.1664W.2/36">Since <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> the Army has collated quarterly figures for its deployable elements only, rather than for its total trained strength. For this reason the figures are not comparable to those provided by the Navy and RAF in the same period. The Army's deployability returns provide a snapshot, on a specific day, of the deployability of Army personnel broken down into the following categories: fully deployable; limited deployability (LD); personnel unable to deploy (PUD). Many of those personnel classed as LD can and will deploy to operational theatres, likewise PUDs will be able to undertake non-deployed duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1664W.2/37">The following table provides the figures for calendar years 2007-08, personnel numbers are rounded to the nearest 10, and percentages rounded to one decimal point. It should be noted that since September 2008 the deployability return has extended the categories it collects against with the intention of providing greater granularity to limited deployability and PUD data. As result the September and December returns report against different metrics which may account for the increase in numbers.</p>

	<p pid="a.1666W.5/12">The unit tour interval is a less relevant measure when applied to other corps (such as Royal Engineers and the Royal Corps of Signals). This is due to the frequency with which personnel move between formed units within these corps (the personnel deployed with a unit will be substantially different from the personnel deployed with the same unit on a previous occasion). Unit tour interval data for these Corps are not, therefore, routinely collated.</p>

	<p pid="a.1672W.2/1">The Department's final audited outturn underspend for 2007-08 comprised principally depreciation charges and movements on provisions, requested in the spring supplementary estimate through request for resources 1 (RfRl&mdash;provision of defence capability), that did not materialise. This underspend was in indirect resource which, as non-cash, does not contribute to the Department's spending power. Moreover, it was agreed in comprehensive spending review 2007 that any RfR1 non-cash resource underspend would be set at zero at the start of 2008-09 and could not therefore be subject to end year flexibility (EYF), with any requirement for further non-cash provision to be considered with the Treasury when it arose.</p>
	<p pid="a.1672W.2/2">A small proportion of the 2007-08 underspend was attributable to RfR2 (peacekeeping and operations), for which the Department is not entitled to claim EYF.</p>

HMS Endurance normally undertakes her duties in the austral summer so this year's patrol has, through force of circumstance, been curtailed. Operational deployments are continually weighed against defence responsibilities around the world and therefore it would be inappropriate to provide detail at this point in the planning stage for HMS Endurance's repairs and return to duty.</p>

	<p pid="a.1677W.3/1">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission is responsible for the child maintenance system. I have therefore asked the Child Maintenance Commissioner to write to the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty:</p>
	<p pid="a.1677W.3/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Child Maintenance Commissioner. The Child Support Agency is now the responsibility of the Child Maintenance Enforcement Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677W.3/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what steps the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission may take when it has good reason to believe that a parent with liability to pay child maintenance plans to leave the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677W.3/5" class="indent">The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission has no powers to impede or to take any action simply on the basis of a current liability to pay child maintenance should a non-resident parent plan to leave the country. If a non-resident parent does not owe arrears of child maintenance payments through the Child Support Agency, then the Commission, quite rightly, has no power to prevent parents from moving abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677W.3/6" class="indent">In cases where a non-resident parent has fallen into arrears, the Commission's current enforcement powers may in some cases make it more difficult for a non-resident parent to realise any assets and leave the country without settling outstanding child maintenance arrears. Whilst a non-resident parent both resides overseas and either has no assets in the UK or does not work for an employer based in the UK, there is no mechanism by which either the Commission or the parent with care may enforce the collection of Child Support Agency debt that accrued whilst the non-resident parent resided in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677W.3/7" class="indent">New enforcement powers provided by the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008, which are yet to be commenced, will allow the Commission to apply to a court to seek an order disqualifying non-resident parents who have wilfully refused or culpably neglected to pay child maintenance from holding or obtaining a travel document (such as a passport).</p>
	<p pid="a.1677W.3/8" class="indent">If a non-resident parent has left the Commission's jurisdiction, the Official Solicitor and Public Trustee is the authority in England and Wales responsible for the enforcement of maintenance orders overseas. The UK has reciprocal arrangements with more than 100 countries, which enable maintenance obligations to be established or recognised and enforced if the non-resident parent resides in one of those countries. The parent with care may apply to a magistrate's court for a maintenance order to be enforced overseas and procedures also exist to enable the parent with care to ask the foreign authorities to create an order for maintenance on their behalf. This route cannot be used to enforce Child Support Agency debt that was incurred prior to the non-resident parent's move abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677W.3/9" class="indent">Further information on the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders can be found at:</p>

In addition to this, DLA Operations have their own Quality Improvement Support Team that performs random checks on a sample of all recent DLA outcome decisions from each operational unit. Local operational managers also have technical checking teams who target areas of known difficulty before decisions are issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.1681W.2/3">Each year, PDCS also performs 12,000 random case interventions under the Right Payment Programme, to ensure the accuracy and correctness of the DLA live load.</p>
	<p pid="a.1681W.2/4">To encourage consistency of approach and better quality decisions, PDCS has introduced Customer Case Management (CCM), which provides comprehensive medical guidance for decision makers on the effects of disability, and guidance on focused further evidence gathering including more direct contact between decision makers and customers. To complement the existing checking regime, work is underway to introduce post decision checks targeted at those decisions that do not appear to conform to the medical guidance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1684W.2/2"><i> </i>We concluded that the contract for the Post Office card account should be awarded to the Post Office without completing the tender process. In reaching that conclusion, we took into account that the Post Office card account is a simple product&mdash;essentially a means of paying benefit&mdash;and that it provides an important social service to vulnerable people, particularly in rural and deprived urban areas. Direct debits, and other additional functionality, are already available through the basic bank accounts which can be accessed at Post Office branches. And we hope, over time, that the Post Office will be able to develop accounts with wider features, on a commercial basis.</p>

However, this growth has taken place against a background of declining numbers of students studying towards HNDs and HNCs. This decline predates the introduction of foundation degrees. According to a study by the Learning and Skills Development Agency (LSDA), even when foundation degrees were first introduced, this was not the main reason for institutions discontinuing HND and HNC provision (LSDA 2002). Since then the decline in HND and HNCs has accelerated, at least in part due to the growth in foundation degrees.</p>

Proposals to the Strategic Development Fund are developed iteratively between the HEIs and the Council's institutional teams, sometimes over a lengthy period.

	<p pid="a.1693W.2/1">A functioning intellectual property system is an essential enabler to encourage innovation and economic recovery. The Gowers Review concluded that the intellectual property framework in the UK was broadly right. It did however highlight a number of areas for reform which it set out in a number of specific recommendations. Over half of these recommendations have been implemented. Work is continuing on the remainder. Meanwhile, the Government continue to attach priority to IP issues. The Creative Britain Report recognised the importance of IP, in particular copyright to the creative industries. As part of this report the Government have improved IP crime intelligence gathering and coordination of enforcement agencies. I also recently announced a broad review of the future of copyright to ensure that it continues to support creativity, promote investment and job growth while also inspiring business and consumer confidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.1693W.5/2">The Department has not made a formal assessment of the benefits of fieldwork and out-of-classroom activity. However, there is a body of research that demonstrates the value of learning outside the classroom to which the Department has contributed; key reports can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1693W.5/4">Ofsted's report &quot;Learning outside the classroom: how far should you go?&quot; was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-02">2 October 2008</phrase>. A key finding is</p>
	<p pid="a.1693W.5/5" class="indent">&quot;When planned and implemented well, learning outside the classroom contributed significantly to raising standards and improving pupils' personal, social and emotional development.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1693W.5/6">To support and develop teachers in using fieldwork as high quality learning experiences, a network of science learning centres provides a range of continuing professional development opportunities throughout the year. These cover chemistry, physics and biology and all key stages of the science curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1693W.5/7">Through the Government funded Action Plan for Geography, the Royal Geographical Society and the Geographical Association have developed online resources and guidance. These are available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.1693W.5/9">and include a virtual fieldwork and local learning centre to help teachers make the most of geography in their local areas. The website contains expert advice on embedding fieldwork in the curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1693W.5/10">The Department has made no assessment of whether the encouragement of fieldwork as a teaching method is adequately supported by teacher training courses. However, the current standards for the award of qualified teacher status (QTS) set out what trainee teachers must demonstrate before they can be recommended for the award. QTS Standard Q30 requires that all trainees demonstrate that they can</p>
	<p pid="a.1693W.5/11" class="indent">&quot;establish a purposeful and safe learning environment conducive to learning and identify opportunities for learners to learn in out-of-school contexts&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1693W.5/12">Training and Development Agency for Schools guidance to this standard states that</p>
	<p pid="a.1693W.5/13" class="indent">&quot;trainees should be able to identify opportunities for children and young people to learn in the school grounds and in out-of-school contexts such as museums, theatres, field centres and work settings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1693W.5/14">All initial teacher training provision is inspected by Ofsted to ensure that training is designed and delivered to enable every trainee to meet all of the QTS standards, including standard Q30 that relates to learning outside of the classroom.</p>

	<p pid="a.1694W.2/1">Repayment of student loans depends on the income of the borrower: the repayment rate is 9 per cent. of income over the equivalent of &pound;15,000 per annum which is collected through HM Revenue and Customs alongside income tax and national insurance contributions. The repayment amount therefore varies according to their income.</p>
	<p pid="a.1694W.2/2">The Student Loans Company (SLC) reconciles borrowers' loan accounts at the end of each financial year. There may be overpayments when a borrower comes to the end of repaying their loan, which are refunded with interest, but these are not caused by late notification by HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1694W.2/3">The SLC is putting a number of measures in place to help customers avoid overpayment by giving them the option to make final repayments outside the tax system, via direct debit, to ensure they do not overpay. SLC have also introduced new guidance and tools, including an online calculator, to help customers work out their loan balance, and therefore when they are likely to pay their loan in full.</p>

That is why we want to increase internship opportunities for unemployed graduates, as just one part of this Government's overall package to support individuals through the economic downturn. We have not made an estimate of the number of internships offered in 2007-08 but a significant proportion of the larger graduate employers offer such places as part of their recruitment processes. We will build on such existing good practice as we work with relevant stakeholders to develop our proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.1699W.0/1">It is not possible to quantify the number of cases referred to inspectorates by the Department for Children, Schools and Families. The Department receives representations across a wide range of issues including on child protection, mostly in the form of correspondence. Some of these are shared with inspectorates for information whilst other matters may be passed to them on a more formal basis where specific action may be appropriate. In addition, local authorities are required in particular circumstances to notify Ofsted of the details of particular events, including those relating to serious incidents involving children or with respect to incidents occurring in settings for which Ofsted has regulatory functions. Other issues raised by correspondents with the Department may be pursued directly with local authorities or other agencies through the Department's regional Government office network.</p>

	<p pid="a.1707W.5/1">The Department does not collect this information. Decisions on food procurement are down to individual schools and local authorities. To assist them in this the School Food Trust has published &quot;A fresh look at school food procurement: efficiency and sustainability&quot;&mdash;guidance for schools and local authorities on how efficient and sustainable food procurement can be pursued in tandem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1707W.5/2">The guidance actively promotes the Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative (PSFPI), which aims to increase tenders from small and local producers and improve their ability to do business. The guide encourages buyers to identify and reduce barriers to small and medium-sized local enterprises (which may prevent them from tendering) and recognises that smaller suppliers can compete with larger businesses. It also recognises that their participation in the public sector supply chain can benefit local and regional economies.

When the new Vetting and Barring Scheme is introduced, such staff will be required to register with the Independent Safeguarding Authority and to obtain a CRB enhanced disclosure. The new scheme will be phased in over a period of up to five years, but staff&mdash;including school staff&mdash;who have never had a CRB disclosure will have high priority in the phasing-in process. Although we cannot say precisely when this will be complete, staff without CRB disclosures will be taken early in the phasing process. The arrangements apply equally to head teachers, teachers and other staff.</p>

This work is currently examining how these priorities could be met locally by new or existing training and development routes and with new Government investment. Feasibility studies on an accreditation system to accredit existing and prior experience, and the delivery of training resources to support managers in identifying workforce needs for the third sector are also being undertaken. Leaders and managers in the third sector will also have access to a leadership and management programme designed to train up to 5,000 strategic leaders and managers from across young people's services over the next three years, starting this year. In addition the DCSF has recently created the Youth Sector Development Fund, which is designed to promote and support growth and build capacity within third sector organisations, particularly those working with the most vulnerable young people, including supporting the development needs of staff.</p>
