Birds registered under section 7 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 are primarily captive bred birds. The UK's biodiversity targets are aimed at improving the conservation status of wild species. Only six species of wild birds subject to registration are also subject to biodiversity action plans, and these are only kept in very low numbers. Therefore any discontinuation of the bird registration scheme is unlikely to affect the UK's biodiversity targets.</p>

	<p pid="b.736W.5/1">The formal comprehensive spending review settlement for 2008-09 to 2010-11 for Departments has been announced and will now be followed by DEFRA's own financial allocation process, during which the budget for British Waterways will be determined. The final allocations will not be known until the new year after further discussions with Ministers. The process of allocation will be based on careful prioritisation across the Department and all its sponsored bodies. We are engaging British Waterways in this and working with them to develop a long-term strategy which will maximise public benefits while delivering an affordable sustainable network within the total funding available.</p>

	<p pid="b.738W.14/1">The areas of Kent at the greatest risk of flooding are those within the low lying fringes of the coastline. Flooding from the sea has major consequences due mainly to the speed at which the flood can occur. Two thirds of the 71,000 people at risk of flooding in Kent are at risk from the sea.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.14/2">The Environment Agency is the principal operating authority with responsibility for flood risk management in England and uses long-term plans to identify the best way to reduce flood risk. These 100-year plans, developed with key partners, set out the schemes required. This year the Environment Agency is spending a capital budget of &pound;18 million in Kent to reduce flood risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.14/3">Specific allocations for future years have not yet been set but spend for flood and coastal erosion risk management across all operating authorities will rise progressively from the current level of &pound;600 million a year to &pound;800 million in 2010-11. DEFRA funding will be directed to the most pressing problems on a national basis using a prioritisation system which reflects new Outcome Measures for the programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.740W.9/2" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.740W.9/3">The Government have put in place a wide set of programmes to encourage the building and construction industry to build zero carbon housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.740W.9/4">My Department has commissioned English Partnerships to run the Carbon Challenge. The aim is to accelerate the house building industry's response to climate change by creating a number of zero carbon communities and to equip the industry with the appropriate skills and technology. In the first phase of the Carbon Challenge around 1,000 zero carbon homes will be built all of which will be required to meet Level 6, which is the highest level, of the Code for Sustainable Homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.740W.9/5">Furthermore, the industry, together with local authorities and other stakeholders have been invited to come forward with proposals for eco-towns. Eco-towns will be entirely new settlements which are exemplar &quot;green developments&quot; of five to 20,000 homes and designed to meet the highest standards of sustainability. The development as a whole (including all homes) should reach zero carbon and should use the standards set out in the Code for Sustainable Homes as a guide.</p>
	<p pid="b.740W.9/6">The stamp duty relief for new zero carbon homes will also act as a financial incentive to the industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.740W.9/7">The building and construction industry are also represented on the 2016 task force which was established to look at the barriers to achieving zero carbon homes by 2016 and the measures needed to address them.</p>

	<p pid="b.744W.0/1">The Building Research Establishment, as part of the 2006 review of the UK Climate Change programme, estimated that adopting British summer time (BST) all year round would lead to approximately a 1 per cent. increase in carbon dioxide emissions. Switching to continental time (BST in the winter and BST plus one hour in the summer) would increase these emissions by about 2 per cent. Continental time was found to generate savings from domestic lighting and cooling in non-domestic buildings, but these effects are likely to be offset by increases in non-domestic heating and lighting, and by a small increase in domestic heating.</p>

	<p pid="b.744W.3/1">The Environment Agency is expected to take action against abstraction licences where the abstraction is adversely impacting on conservation sites, in particular those designated under European legislation. Where it needs to revoke or modify an abstraction licence, compensation is generally payable. The compensation payments form part of the cost of meeting its duty to manage water resources and will therefore be recovered via abstraction charges.</p>

Estimates for West Chelmsford for 2006 and for the previous five years are shown in the following table. These small area estimates are based on very small samples and are therefore subject to high sampling variability. They should therefore be treated with caution and in particular changes from year to year should not be used in isolation from the figures for a run of years. Regional and national estimates have been shown for comparison.</p>

The LSC and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills are working very closely to analyse the full impact of the ESOL policy changes on demand, as well as on provider behaviour. We have commissioned additional impact assessment work to help us do this and expect to have results in the new year.

	<p pid="b.749W.0/2">Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies funded through block grant and free to decide their own strategies including the organisation of teaching and learning, in the light of their relative strengths and student demand. That said, I expect them as a matter of good practice to consult local Members of Parliament on any major reorganisation which affects their constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.749W.0/3">I understand that Bath university has decided to withdraw the offer provision of higher education from the Oakfield campus in the light of its assessment of student demand. That is a matter for the university, but I would expect all institutions contemplating changes of this sort to engage in early dialogue with HEFCE so that wherever possible, options for other alternative provision can be considered and they should also keep hon. Members informed of their future intentions. I am aware that a number of proposals about enhancing opportunities for higher education study in Swindon are currently under consideration.</p>

This is the sum of the HE initial participation rates for individual ages between 17 and 30 inclusive. It covers English-domiciled first time entrants to HE courses, which are expected to last for at least six months, at UK higher education institutions and English, Scottish and Welsh further education colleges, and who remain on their course for at least six months. The earliest figure is 39.3 per cent. for 1999-2000 and the latest available figure is 42.8 per cent. for 2005-06.</p>

There is no reason why applications for visas which are made in good time and with the necessary supporting documentation would be delayed. UKVisas' latest published statistics for the F/Y 2005/2006 indicate that a total of 284,447 student applications were received, of which 194,827 visas were issued and 88,897 applications refused.

Many of this group are likely to be part-time students from lower income backgrounds. The overall effect of these changes on the income of individual institutions will depend on how successful they are in attracting students who meet our priorities. No students currently studying for equivalent and lower level qualifications will be affected, no institution will lose grant in cash terms and future students studying for such qualifications will be able to look at what is on offer at over 250 providers. But they cannot be more deserving of public funding than those who have not obtained a first qualification.

These regulations temporarily lift restrictions on travel and the requirement to seek official permission for interviews, up to and including the 2008 Olympic Games. While these regulations are welcome, we continue to urge the Chinese to lift all media restrictions, both before and after the Games, including on domestic media.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.12/2">I made similar representations during my previous visit to Beijing in September 2006, and in a meeting with the Chinese Information Minister in London in April 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.759W.0/1">In June of this year, the Home Office, Department of Health and Department for Children, Schools and Families jointly launched 'Safe. Sensible. Social'&mdash;The next steps in the National Alcohol Strategy which builds on lessons learned and progress made since the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England published in March 2004. The renewed strategy outlines the Government's long-term commitment to tackling alcohol-related harms. New measures outlined in this Strategy include:</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.0/2" class="indent">support for local areas to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder,</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.0/3" class="indent">earlier identification interventions and treatment for drinking that could cause harm,</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.0/4" class="indent">continuing to tackle underage sales of alcohol,</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.0/5" class="indent">greater effort to tackle alcohol &mdash;related offending,</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.0/6" class="indent">a review of the relationship between price, promotion and harm,</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.0/7" class="indent">a review on the effectiveness of the alcohol industry's social responsibility standards document in contributing to a reduction in alcohol harm,</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.0/8" class="indent">promoting a sensible drinking culture through sustained national campaigning to challenge the tolerance of drunkenness and drinking that causes harm, and</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.0/9" class="indent">preventing harms to those under 18 years of age.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.0/10">We will shortly publish a local strategy toolkit and guidance on the use of tools and powers to help local areas tackle alcohol related harms. We have recently carried out a Tackling Under Age Sales of Alcohol campaign which saw overall failure rates falling to 14 per cent. and will shortly undertake a Responsible Alcohol Sales Campaign. We recently undertook a Confiscation of Alcohol Campaign to support the commencement of new powers (section 27 Directions to leave) available through the Violent Crime Reduction Act to disperse persons who are likely to cause or contribute to alcohol related crime or disorder, and support the use of existing powers in relation to the confiscation of alcohol (Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997). We launched Alcohol Arrest Referral Pilot pilots in Cheshire, Ealing, Manchester and Liverpool in October that aim to reduce re-offending by individuals who have been arrested for alcohol-related offending.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.0/11">We have also gone out to tender for the independent review on the effectiveness of the alcohol industry's social responsibility standards document in contributing to a reduction in alcohol harm, we expect the review's findings to be published in April 2008. In addition, the Department of Health are taking forward the independent review the relationship between alcohol price, promotion and harm, we expect the review's findings to be published in the summer of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.0/12">We are currently drawing up plans for a wide ranging communications campaign to promote a sensible drinking culture by challenging the tolerance of drunkenness, raising the public's knowledge of units of alcohol and ensuring that everyone has the information they need to estimate how much they really do drink, and developing a range of new kinds of information and advice aimed at people who drink at harmful levels, and their families and friends.</p>
	<p pid="b.759W.0/13">We believe that through a combination of continued tough enforcement of the law and the promotion of a sensible drinking culture, we can continue to see significant reductions in alcohol-related crime and disorder.</p>

	<p pid="b.760W.8/1">The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 makes provision for the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes and subjected to regulated procedures which may cause pain, suffering distress or lasting harm. As genetically modified animals are assumed to be potentially more prone to pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm as a result of the genetic alteration than the background strain from which they are derived their production, breeding and use is regulated under the 1986 Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.8/2">It has, however, always been accepted that there will be some lines of genetically modified animals that are not predisposed to these harms, and administrative provision has been made for the discharge of such animals (at least for breeding purposes) from the controls of the Act. However, in practice, no such lines have, so far, been discharged from the controls of the Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.8/3">In view of this, and as the current discharge criteria were formulated some years ago, the Animal Procedures Committee has been asked to advise on whether the discharge criteria should be revised in the light of the current state of knowledge regarding refined methods of welfare assessments and phenotyping of genetically altered animals. Should they so advise, the aim would be to remove any unnecessary obstacles currently preventing strains being discharged from the controls of the 1986 Act without weakening the provisions for the welfare of protected animals.</p>

	<p pid="b.770W.11/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-28">28 June</phrase> the Home Office has handled 14 pieces of correspondence from hon. Members and members of the public on the subject of UK/US extradition arrangements. The hon. Gentleman himself also raised the issue with me in a recent meeting.</p>
	<p pid="b.770W.11/2">The representations supported inaccurate claims in the press that I was about to introduce an additional statutory bar to extradition called &quot;forum&quot; which could prevent extradition where a case could be tried in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.770W.11/3">The Government keep extradition legislation under review, but have no plans to introduce this additional bar, which would apply to all countries with which the UK has extradition relations, including the US. I am satisfied that the Extradition Act 2003 already contains full and effective safeguards for the rights of requested persons. Introducing a ground for refusal of extradition based on forum is not only unnecessary, but would make the Act operate in a manner that is inconsistent with all of the UK's bilateral extradition treaties&mdash;including the bilateral treaty between the UK and the US. It would also give rise to real practical difficulties for prosecutors and would risk allowing criminals to evade justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.770W.11/4">Home Office Ministers have consistently made it clear in Parliament and to the press that the new extradition treaty with the United States is not one-sided, and we are satisfied that the provisions ensure that extradition is dealt with under procedures that are as broadly comparable as it is possible to achieve between two different jurisdictions.</p>
	<p pid="b.770W.11/5">The UK/US extradition treaty means that both the UK and the US are under an international obligation to assist with extradition requests to the extent compatible with the law. The key issue is to ensure that offences are dealt with in the place where they can be most effectively prosecuted. Where the main witnesses and the main evidence are in another state, then it makes sense for the defendants to be extradited to face justice there.</p>
	<p pid="b.770W.11/6">Taking all these matters into account, I am satisfied that the right balance has been struck between the need to safeguard the rights of defendants against the need to uphold the rule of law.</p>

	<p pid="b.772W.8/1">It is estimated that at <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-31">31 October 2007</phrase> there were approximately 646,890 replicate profiles from individuals on the National DNA Database. If a crime scene profile matches replicate profiles from individuals, a match report showing all the apparent individuals matched will be sent to the force. Thus the presence of these replicate profiles does not impact on the effectiveness and integrity of the database. Nonetheless, a long term exercise is under way to identify issues associated with the removal of such redundant replicate profiles.</p>
	<p pid="b.772W.8/2">Of the 646,890 replicates, 107,966 are due to upgrading samples from the SGM to the SGM Plus method of analysing DNA. When the NDNAD was set up in 1995, the SM profiling system was used which looked at six areas of DNA plus the area sowing the person's sex. In 1999 SGM was replaced by SGM Plus which looks at 10 areas of DNA plus the sex area. SGM has a one in 50 million chance of being incorrect, and SGM Plus has a better than one in 1,000 million chance of being incorrect, when applied to the general population, though they are less discriminating between individuals who are related, or if matched against partial profiles from crime scenes i.e. where the DNA found at the crime scene is too degraded to look at all the relevant areas of DNA. It was decided when SGM Plus was introduced that it was too costly to reanalyse all the samples taken between 1995 and 1999 to upgrade them from SGM to SGM Plus. However, if a match occurs involving an SGM profile, or a partial crime scene profile, the original samples are routinely reanalysed using SGM Plus to provide the best possible match. This may lead to the existence of both an SGM and an SGM Plus profile for the same person.</p>
	<p pid="b.772W.8/3">The information requested on the number of multiple profiles of the same individuals under different and the same names is not available. However, since July 2004 the NDNAD Custodian's Data Quality and Integrity Team has been carrying out a programme to analyse replicate profiles of the SGM Plus type that are shown on two or more Police National Computer records. This work is in support of police operations and is not an exhaustive review of all replicates. It has revealed 3,752 pairs of false/dual identities on PNC where the owning force has now merged the PNC records, and 3,327 pairs of identical twins and five sets of identical triplets on the NDNAD. A marker is entered on the Police National Computer to alert officers to the existence of these twins or triplets.</p>
	<p pid="b.772W.8/4">To date no adventitious matches between unrelated individuals have been discovered where the SGM Plus profiling system has been used.</p>

	<p pid="b.774W.0/1">It is expected that the full cost of Identity Services provided by the National Identity Scheme will be recovered through charges to individuals and to private and public user organisations. A detailed charging strategy is still to be fully developed, although it is intended that running costs of the scheme will be recovered from fees just as they are now for passports.</p>
	<p pid="b.774W.0/2">The previous best estimate for the average unit cost of the combined passport and ID card package was &pound;93, based on 2005 prices. A figure at 2007-08 prices would be subject to increase, in line with the rate of inflation. Decisions on the actual fee structure will be made before the first identity cards are issued and so it is not possible to give a precise figure for the cost of an identity card and passport package at present.</p>

For example, all lessons delivered within the college would have been audited for human rights compliance and officers involved in firearms training would also receive twice yearly training on human rights. Therefore, a breakdown of costs for individual aspects of training courses is not readily accessible. To collate the figures would require a manual trawl of records and this could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.808W.2/1">Any decision on whether a Great Britain football team participates at the 2008 Olympic games is a matter for FIFA, the four Home Nations' Football Associations, and the organisers of the Olympic tournament. I believe that the participation of a GB women's football team in the 2008 Beijing Olympics would have strongly benefited women's football and raised its profile across the whole of the UK. I am therefore very disappointed that, despite encouragement from Government and the current enthusiasm for the women's game, no agreement could be reached between the four Home Nations' Football Associations to allow a GB women's football team to participate.</p>

	<p pid="b.820W.2/1">Our judgment remains as set out in the 2004 Defence White Paper, 'Delivering Security in a Changing World', that a fleet of eight of the current classes of attack submarines will be sufficient in the medium term to meet the full range of tasks. We expect to reduce to a fleet of eight attack submarines by December 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.820W.2/2">For the future, the more capable Astute submarines will represent a significant addition to the delivery of effects-based warfare. Our current planning assumption envisages an attack fleet of seven submarines after 2022, but this will remain subject to review. Over the next 15 years, attack submarine numbers will fluctuate between seven and eight as the Astute submarine replaces the Swiftsure and Trafalgar class submarines.</p>

	<p pid="b.828W.2/1">While there are regiments which can be considered as having direct Scottish lineage, there is no single recognised definition of a 'Scottish Regiment'. I can, however, advise that since 2003, Regular Army units which recruit predominantly from, and are historically affiliated to, Scotland have represented roughly between 4 per cent. and 5 per cent. of the British Army.</p>

	<p pid="b.839W.5/2">In line with generally accepted current practice, pure tone audiometry is the main method used to inform determination of claims for hearing loss by former military personnel under the War Pension and Armed Forces Compensation Schemes. Pure tone audiometry is undertaken to quality assured standards by suitably trained technicians. Where the test is considered unreliable, unrepeatable or in some other way unrepresentative of true hearing level, other tests may be used such as evoked response audiometry.</p>

	<p pid="b.839W.8/2">The approach used by the Department in the assessment of noise-induced hearing loss for the purposes of the War Pension Scheme was upheld by an independent expert review in 1998-99 and further endorsed by the November 2002 Industrial Injuries Advisory Council report on occupational deafness. The audiological literature is kept under review including research on technical aspects of, and new approaches to, hearing loss assessment and possible application to MOD's no fault compensation schemes. The scheme rules governing the assessment of noise induced sensorineural hearing loss are currently in article 42 of and part VI of schedule 1 to the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc.

	<p pid="b.842W.6/1">The nuclear non-proliferation treaty makes an invaluable and irreplaceable contribution to multilateral nuclear disarmament and is the cornerstone of UK policy in this area. All actions that the UK undertakes on nuclear disarmament are concomitant to our legal obligations under Article VI of that treaty, which are equally applicable to the other recognised nuclear weapons states. The White Paper on The Future of the UK's Nuclear Deterrent (Cm 6994), published in December 2006, set out the UK's record on nuclear disarmament and announced the reduction of operationally available warheads to fewer than 160, which has now been achieved.</p>

Under the Department's restoring efficiency procedures, measures are applied to restore and maintain acceptable levels of attendance and deal with staff whose excessive sickness absence and attendance record has become a cause for concern. Employment can be terminated where patterns of irregular attendance from staff becomes unacceptable or where long term sickness absence persists and there is no prospect of a regular return to work. Staff also have their employment terminated when they are medically assessed as being so unwell in the longer term that ill-health retirement is approved. A new method of recording the termination of employment in the above circumstances was introduced in 2003 on a gradual basis. The data for 2003 are therefore unreliable.

	<p pid="b.877W.5/2">Dropping litter is an offence under section 87 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, punishable by a fixed penalty fine, which can be set locally by a council within a range of &pound;50 to &pound;80, or prosecution (with a fine of up to &pound;2,500 on conviction). Police community support officers, persons accredited under community accreditation schemes, parish councils and local authority authorised officers have enforcement powers, although responsibility rests primarily with the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.877W.5/3">Data on the number of fixed penalty notices (FPNs) issued and cases taken to court can be found on the DEFRA website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.877W.5/5">The deposit of waste without a licence, or fly-tipping, is an offence under section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The offence carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both. Due to the serious nature of fly-tipping, there is no FPN available. Local authorities must prosecute offenders through the courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.877W.5/6">Flycapture, the national fly-tipping database, was set up in 2004 and records the number of fly-tipping incidents dealt with by the Environment Agency and local authorities, The database also records enforcement actions taken, including prosecutions.</p>

	<p pid="b.883W.2/2">Under the provisions of the Children Act 2004, local authorities are required to consult children and young people as part of their strategic planning for children's services. More recently, empowering young people to shape their local services became a key theme in CLG's 'An Action Plan for Community Empowerment: Building on Success' (October 2007) and DCSF's 'Aiming High for Young People: a Ten Year Strategy for Positive Activities' (July 2007). Examples of current initiatives include the Young Advisers scheme which trains young people aged 15 to 21 to act as consultants to ensure the views of young people are considered in local authority decisions affecting them and the Youth Capital Fund (YCF) and Youth Opportunity Fund (YOF) where in 2006-07 over 8,000 teenagers participated in youth panels deciding on funding allocations for youth activities and facilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.883W.9/19" class="indent">Our standard for the average actual clearance time for Crisis Loans is 2 working days and for Community Care Grants it is 9 working days. We have kept within the standard average actual clearance time for Crisis Loans in every year from 2002-03 and for Community Care Grants in every year except 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.883W.9/20" class="indent">As we have modernised Crisis Loan delivery by making our service more accessible to our customers, the number of Crisis Loan applications has risen to an unprecedented level. Jobcentre Plus received 202,000 applications in October this year compared to 132,000 in October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.883W.9/21" class="indent">In order to deal with this rise and continue to keep within our 2 day standard for Crisis Loans we have temporarily diverted resources from Community Care Grants, and have been putting in extra resources. By taking this action we have kept within our 2 day standard for Crisis Loans, this has resulted in a knock on effect on time taken to clear applications for Community Care Grants. As the extra resources come on stream we expect to see improvements and move back to our usual standards.</p>

	<p pid="b.887W.2/1">Entitlement to disability living allowance is not linked to particular disabling conditions, but on the extent to which a severely disabled person has personal care needs and/or walking difficulties as a result of their disability. People with Marfan syndrome can claim disability living allowance in the same way as anyone else.</p>
	<p pid="b.887W.2/2">There is a range of help available to customers who may experience difficulty in completing the claim form. People can call the freephone Benefit Enquiry Line, where an operator will offer advice and answer individual questions as well as arranging for someone to call back to complete a copy of the claim form over the phone. The completed form will then be sent to the customer for checking, signing and return.</p>
	<p pid="b.887W.2/3">In cases where the customer does not want to fill in the self-reporting form, or cannot make use of the other help available, the Disability and Carers Service may be able to send out a visiting officer to help with the form. Customers can also go to their local Jobcentre Plus office or Citizens Advice Bureau for advice.</p>

	<p pid="b.889W.0/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.0/2" class="italic"> Letter from Lesley Strathie, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-03">3 December 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.0/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions about improving access to Jobcentre Plus services for people who are elderly or for whom English is not a first language and managing appropriately contact with people who have mental health or learning difficulties. These are things that fall within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.0/4" class="indent">Our services are delivered over the telephone, face to face, in writing and through the internet. We recognise that some people have particular needs linked to age, disability and language and strive to meet these in the delivery of our services.</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.0/5" class="indent">The steps we take are tailored to meet individual circumstances and include:</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.0/6" class="indent">working with customer advocates and intermediary organisations such as Citizens Advice;</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.0/7" class="indent">providing interpreter services to support interviews and telephone calls;</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.0/8" class="indent">using alternative interview venues; and</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.0/9" class="indent">producing a range of materials in other languages and alternative formats.</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.0/10" class="indent">Additionally, we provide targeted help for customers with particular needs. For example, our Disability Employment Advisers are experts at helping people with health conditions and disabilities into work, including people with mental health conditions or learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.0/11" class="indent">Whilst some benefits end at State Pension Age, many of the services available through Jobcentre Plus to help people return to work have no upper age limit. This includes the use of Jobpoints to search for job and learning opportunities. Programmes like New Deal 50 plus, and Work Trials are among those available on a voluntary basis to people who have been in receipt of certain benefits for six months or more, including the Pension Credit which is a qualifying benefit for all currently available back to work programmes and services.</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.0/12" class="indent">Our staff receive training to ensure they understand equality legislation. We also work closely with the voluntary sector, including organisations that represent customer interests. This helps us to understand better our customers' needs and to make appropriate referrals to external support in local communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.889W.0/13" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.896W.3/1">In respect of gas and electricity, each supplier has a range of tariffs which are generally related to payment method. While these will be available to all customers, there will be circumstances where a customer cannot access a particular tariff, for instance, an internet-based tariff or, where a customer is repaying debt through a prepayment meter. Most suppliers now offer social tariffs to their fuel poor customers, while others offer a range of measures designed to assist these customers. Among other things, these activities help low-income households reduce their energy costs. I am in continued discussion with suppliers to encourage them to maintain and build on these activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.896W.3/2">Ofgem and Energywatch have undertaken activities to inform consumers about the range of tariffs available and the benefits of switching. A number of intermediaries now also exist to inform customers about different tariffs and provide an easy means of switching. In respect of the cheaper tariffs that are available through direct debit, the key is access to a bank account. The Government are tackling this through its work on financial inclusion and specifically work with the banking sector to improve access to bank accounts.</p>

	<p pid="b.905W.8/1">The 2007 Energy White Paper sets out the Government's policy to promote energy innovation in renewable and low carbon technologies. The Government are supporting a wide range of technology push measures to stimulate research and development through the Research Councils, Technology Strategy Board, Energy Technologies Institute (all DIUS funded) and the Environmental Transformation Fund (DEFRA and BERR funded). The ETF will be the key mechanism for supporting demonstration and early phase deployment for low carbon energy and energy efficiency technologies and will be operational from April 2008. It will include BERR's existing sector specific demonstration programmes such as; Hydrogen Fuel Cell and Carbon Abatement Demonstration Programme, Marine Renewables Deployment Fund Programme, Low Carbon Buildings Programmes, Bioenergy Capital Grants Programme, Offshore Wind Capital Grants Programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.905W.8/2">In addition market pull comes by providing the market mechanisms and incentives such as the renewables obligation (RO) and the renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO). The RO will provide by 2010 some &pound;1 billion support for renewable deployment. We are introducing measures to allow banding of the RO, this will provide the generation industry with greater incentive to develop and deploy those technologies which are currently further from commercial deployment. The UK has shown its commitment to a responsible biofuel strategy through the development of the RTFO, which would require the totality of road transport fuel to include a minimum proportion of biofuel, reaching 5 per cent. by volume by 2010-11.</p>

	<p pid="b.914W.0/1">The UK is the second largest bilateral donor on HIV and AIDS and has pledged to spend &pound;1.5 billion on AIDS programmes over the three years up to 2008. While our statistical system tracks broad areas of expenditure such as HIV and AIDS it does not codify specific subsets such as care and palliative care.</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.0/2">However, care and palliative care are an essential part of a comprehensive response to AIDS. Where DFID is providing significant support to country programmes on HIV and AIDS, this includes components to increase capacity of health systems to provide treatment and care, or to develop home and community-based projects. Examples include DFID's support to develop integrated, community-based, HIV and AIDS home-based care in Zambia, and the Kenyan government's HIV and AIDS prevention and care project which includes a package of community-based care and support.</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.0/3">In addition to our bilateral support to developing countries we also provide support for care and palliative care through our multilateral partners. Fore example we recently made an unprecedented long-term commitment to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria of up to &pound;1 billion by 2015. The Global Fund is providing significant funds for care and palliative care including support for the roll-out of palliative care in South Africa and Uganda.</p>

	<p pid="b.915W.0/1">The UN estimates there are between 1.2 and 1.4 million Iraqi refugees in Syria. The UK Government are very concerned about the humanitarian situation for these refugees. Our engagement and support has been through the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), which has an internationally recognised mandate to lead the international response to refugee situations. Their operations are closely co-ordinated with the Syrian Government. Activities include rehabilitation of vacant buildings for housing, food distribution and education initiatives. UNHCR is also investigating reports of increased refugee returns from Syria and the reasons behind such returns. We await the outcome of this work.</p>
	<p pid="b.915W.0/2">Since January, DFID has committed &pound;3 million to UNHCR for their work with Iraqi refugees. This takes our overall Iraq humanitarian response to &pound;15 million this year and to over &pound;130 million since 2003. DFID officials are working closely with American and European aid agencies, such as the European Community Humanitarian Aid Department (ECHO), as well as with other partners to co-ordinate programmes and share information.</p>

	<p pid="b.915W.3/1">The Department for International Development monitors all of its programmes rigorously, including its reconstruction projects in Iraq. In addition to ongoing evaluation and monitoring, we conduct annual reviews&mdash;known as &quot;output to purpose reports&quot;. At the end of the project's life, we conduct project completion reports. These reviews are designed to evaluate the extent to which the projects have achieved their purpose, and they include recommendations for future changes in our programmes. Every programme is given a score from one to four to indicate how successful it has been in meeting its objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.915W.3/2">In addition to our bilateral programmes, we have channelled a significant share of DFID reconstruction funds for Iraq through multilateral agencies such as the United Nations and the World Bank. These agencies have their own internal evaluation processes. For example, DFID has channelled &pound;70 million to the international reconstruction fund facility for Iraq (IRFFI), a multi-donor trust fund which supports projects of the World Bank and UN agencies. We have argued for increased attention to be paid to monitoring and evaluation of IRFFI-funded programmes on Iraq and as a result an independent review of its work is now under way. This is being co-ordinated by the United nations Office Project Services (UNOPS).</p>

	<p pid="b.918W.8/1">Security is one of the major challenges in delivering humanitarian assistance to Somalia. Relief agencies are unable to work effectively to assist the most needy people, especially in Mogadishu and the surrounding area, and the threat of piracy makes the delivery of humanitarian assistance more difficult. Transporters demand higher rates because of the risks, and delays are caused when willing transporters cannot be found or cargoes are seized. Three ships have been attacked in 2007. All were returning empty from Somalia to Kenya, and so there was no loss of humanitarian cargo.</p>
	<p pid="b.918W.8/2">The overland route via Kenya does not, however, provide a suitable alternative since it is less efficient and more expensive, with the exception of a few delivery locations adjacent to the Kenya border. There are many incidents of militia groups setting up checkpoints along roads inside Somalia and demanding payments for passage. This happens to such an extent that the World Food Programme (WFP) still prefers to send the bulk of its humanitarian cargo by ship. At present, approximately 80 per cent. of deliveries of WFP food aid to Somalia are by sea.</p>

	<p pid="b.919W.2/1">The humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe continues to deteriorate as a result of economic mismanagement made worse by the effects of a severe drought during the last growing season. An estimated 4.1 million people will need international food aid by the end of the year. Malnutrition has reached concerning levels in a number of districts. The collapse of urban water and sanitation systems in Zimbabwe's main cities has increased numbers of life-threatening diarrhoea outbreaks. HIV/AIDS remains a major problem with 1.8 million affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.919W.2/2">DFID's aid programme is providing substantial direct assistance to protect the livelihoods of more than 1.5 million poor people in Zimbabwe, tackle HIV/AIDS and help meet humanitarian needs. This year we have made an additional contribution of &pound;8 million to the World Food Programme to ensure that food aid reaches those who need it most and &pound;1 million to UNICEF to prepare for and respond to emergency disease outbreaks.</p>

	<p pid="b.922W.2/2">We are unable to provide definitive figures for numbers of bullying incidents at school as we do not collect this data centrally. However our recent guidance on cyberbullying, incorporated as part of our comprehensive anti-bullying guidance &quot;Safe to Learn: embedding anti-bullying work in schools&quot;, included a range of survey evidence on the extent of cyberbullying. This is summarised as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.922W.2/3" class="indent">Research carried out for the Anti-Bullying Alliance by Goldsmiths College found that 22 per cent. of 11 to 16-year-olds had been a victim of cyberbullying;</p>

	<p pid="b.922W.2/5" class="indent">Noret and River's four year study on bullying (2007) found that 15 per cent. of the 11,227 children surveyed had received nasty or aggressive texts and e-mails, and demonstrated a year on year increase in the number of children who are bullied using new technology;</p>
	<p pid="b.922W.2/6" class="indent">Research conducted as part of the DCSF cyberbullying information campaign found that 34 per cent. of 12 to 15-year-olds reported having been cyberbullied.</p>

	<p pid="b.927W.0/1">We welcome the report 'Making ContactPoint Work', published last week by the Children's Rights Director for England, Roger Morgan. In fact, my Department specifically requested Roger Morgan to ask children what they thought of the proposals set out in draft Government guidance about ContactPoint. We acknowledge fully and understand that children and young people quite reasonably want reassurances about security and access.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.0/2">The views of children and young people are central to the development of ContactPoint. In fact, 'Making ContactPoint Work', representing the views of 62 children, is a small part of the overall consultation DCSF has undertaken with children and young people. More than 1,000 children have already been consulted about ContactPoint and overall findings have shown that, once young people understand what ContactPoint is, they usually agree it is a positive thing. The views and issues they raise have played, and continue to play, an important role in the development of ContactPoint. Further consultation with young people and parents and carers is planned.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.0/3">Access to ContactPoint will be limited strictly to those who need it to do their job (currently estimated at around 330,000 practitioners). All users will be subject to stringent security controls and, before being granted access, must have completed mandatory face-to-face training, have obtained security clearance (including enhanced Criminal Records Bureau clearance) and have a user name, a password, a PIN and a security token to control their access to ContactPoint. Mandatory face-to-face training will include the safe and secure use of ContactPoint and the importance of compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and Human Rights Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.0/4">To gain access to a child's record, all users will have to state clear reasons why they are accessing ContactPoint. All use of the system will be monitored and audited and every access to a child's record will be detailed in the ContactPoint audit trail. This will be regularly monitored by local authorities, using online User Activity Reports, to ensure that any misuse is detected and that appropriate action is taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.0/5">ContactPoint will include all children in England because it is not possible to predict accurately, in advance, which children will need additional services. Any child or young person could require the support of additional services at any time in their childhood. We want to support early intervention for children to help prevent situations becoming critical.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.0/6">Officials at the DCSF were briefed, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November</phrase>, by Treasury colleagues about the loss of the data at the HMRC. DCSF Ministers have been kept closely informed about how the issue is being dealt with at HMRC and the other agencies involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.0/7">As soon as we were aware of the issue, we made contact with the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre and HM Treasury to identify any potential children's welfare issues. As child safety and welfare issues are an absolute priority for us, we are maintaining close contact with the agencies involved to ensure that we all remain vigilant to any child welfare issues that may arise.</p>
	<p pid="b.927W.0/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">Tuesday 20 November</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children Schools and Families, asked the Department's Permanent Secretary to conduct an immediate assessment of how personal data is stored and protected in the Department. The Permanent Secretary reported back within 24 hours to confirm the Department is confident that we have very robust procedures in place. In light of the security breach at the HMRC, we are continuing to check our procedures to ensure standards are as high as they can be. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">Wednesday 21 November</phrase>, the Prime Minister confirmed this approach when he asked all Departments to check their procedures for the storage and use of data. Given the obvious importance of ensuring that ContactPoint has extremely robust security measures in place, the Secretary of State, also on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">Tuesday 20 November</phrase>, asked for an independent assessment of its security procedures, which will be conducted by Deloitte.</p>

	<p pid="b.928W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.2/2">It is up to local authorities to ensure there are sufficient child care places available to meet local demand. They receive funding from the Department for Children, Schools and Families which can be used to secure sufficient child care in line with local needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.2/3">Subject to their individual circumstances, refugees have access to the full range of benefits and services provided by the Department for Work and Pensions. This includes Jobcentre Plus customers on New Deal for Lone Parents or New Deal for Partners, who can access child care to allow them to participate in the provision. This includes English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) training.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.2/4">More generally, ESOL classes are provided by the Learning and Skills Council. Attendance for ESOL training is voluntary and while attending such courses, there are a number of ways that learners can access child care provision. DWP' Employability Skills Programme learners in receipt of jobseeker's allowance and undertaking a programme of a minimum of 20 hours per week are eligible for help with child care costs. The discretionary Learner Support Fund allocated to providers by the Learning and Skills Council can be used to support child care costs for learners aged 20 and above. Some local European Social Funding allocations can also be used to support child care costs. This varies from project to project depending on the scope and purpose of the project. In addition to this, learning undertaken by parents through Family Literacy, Language and Numeracy can also offer child care provision in some places. This support is not mandatory but informal arrangements are made by a number of providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.928W.2/5">None of the funding available from Department for Work and Pensions or the Learning and Skills Council is available to asylum seekers; The Border and Immigration Agency (BIA) provide support to asylum seekers, and their dependants, who are destitute or likely to become destitute in the immediate future. No specific child care provision for asylum-seeking women who are taking English for speakers of other languages classes is given.</p>

	<p pid="b.930W.2/1">The Department has taken a number of steps to tackle child sexual exploitation, including publication in April 2006 of the updated 'Working Together to Safeguard Children', the main inter-agency guide to working together to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. 'Working Together' stresses the need to treat children involved in prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation primarily as the victims of abuse and advises that agencies should work together to develop local protocols. It also includes guidance for practitioners on sharing information with children's social care and the police about underage sexual activity, in response to recommendation 13 of the Bichard Inquiry Report, and sets out a number of considerations that practitioners should take into account in assessing when and how to share information about underage sexual activity. These include indicators of possible sexual exploitation. We have also established Local Safeguarding Children Boards, which have a role in co-ordinating work to safeguard children from sexual exploitation in each local area; and have published draft guidance to help agencies safeguard children who may have been trafficked. We are currently updating 'Safeguarding Children involved in prostitution', which was originally published in 2000 as supplementary guidance to the 1999 edition of 'Working Together'. The revised guidance will have a wider scope and cover safeguarding children from sexual exploitation more generally.</p>

	<p pid="b.948W.2/4" class="indent">Developing through the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority a second mathematics GCSE aimed at students who wish to gain a deeper appreciation of mathematics.

	<p pid="b.948W.5/1">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is piloting new functional mathematics assessments at Entry Level to Level 2 for use both by young people and adults. These are being developed by awarding bodies to the functional skills standards, which have also been reflected in the new national Curriculum programmes of study at Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4. I shall place copies of the latest version of the functional mathematics standards in the House Library. The standards include financial literacy skills, which are vital to equipping people with the skills they need to operate in life and at work. The functional skills standards at Entry Level 1 include note and coin recognition. Entry Level 1 is of comparable standard to National Curriculum Level 1&mdash;the study done during Key Stage 1&mdash;and is being designed to be suitable for those needing to develop very basic mathematics skills.</p>

	<p pid="b.951W.5/1">Since 2006 the Music Standards Fund has comprised two elements. First the baseline grant to local authorities of &pound;59 million to enhance opportunities for pupils to access high quality music education, with a priority on instrumental and vocal opportunities at Key Stage 2. Second local authorities received a new allocation through the Music Standards Fund grant, of &pound;3million in 2006-07 and &pound;23 million in 2007-08, to be devolved to schools serving Key Stage 2 pupils. This allocation allows primary and special schools themselves to begin buying in instrumental and vocal tuition at Key Stage 2, either from the Local Authority Music Service or from other local providers. We understand that in many local authorities schools have decided to buy in support from their local music service. In each of the years from 2008-09 to 2010-11 the whole &pound;82 million available will go to local authorities to support the new music education ambitions set out on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November</phrase>. However, they will be expected to secure the agreement of the School Forums as to its precise use.</p>

	<p pid="b.952W.5/1">This is a matter for Ofsted. HM Chief inspector, Christine Gilbert, has written to the hon. Member and a copy of her reply has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/2" class="italic"> Letter from Christine Gilbert, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/3" class="indent">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to me, as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, for a response. I shall cover each area of Ofsted's remit in turn.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/4" class="indentitalic">  1. Early Years</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/5" class="indent">Current regulations for the inspection of childcare and funded nursery education were introduced in October 2005 and stipulate that the present prescribed cycle will run until <phrase class="date" code="">31 August 2009</phrase>. However, Ofsted has given a commitment that these inspections will be carried out by the end of March 2008. Of the 101,614 providers, 21,081 remain to be inspected. It will be a significant challenge for Ofsted to complete all of these by the end of March 2008, but we are optimistic that we can do this. This will be over a year ahead of the prescribed cycle and will enable us to start inspecting the new Early Years Foundation Stage from its inception in September 2008, on a new prescribed cycle agreed with Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/6" class="indentitalic"> 2. Maintained schools</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/7" class="indent">Under the current inspection framework for maintained schools, the Education (School Inspection) (England) Regulations 2005 stipulate that all maintained schools should be inspected between <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">1 August 2009</phrase>; and thereafter, they should be inspected within three school years from the end of the school year in which the last inspection took place. There are nearly 23,000 maintained schools in England. In 2005-06, 6,128 schools were inspected and in 2006-07 8,323 schools were inspected. Ofsted is therefore on target to complete inspections within the time limit prescribed by the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/8" class="indentitalic"> 3. Colleges of further education</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/9" class="indent">Ofsted commenced a second four-year cycle of inspections of further education colleges in September 2005. Ofsted is on course to complete this cycle of inspections by August 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/10" class="indentitalic"> 4. Non-association independent schools</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/11" class="indent">Ofsted is up to date with its inspections of non-association independent schools. By April 2008 it will have completed the first cycle of inspections in these schools and will have completed 455 inspections during this financial year.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/12" class="indentitalic"> 5. Joint area reviews of local services for children</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/13" class="indent">Under the Framework for the inspection of children's services, a joint area review of each local authority area will be carried out between September 2005 and December 2008. The scope of joint area reviews includes services for children and young people aged 0-19 years inclusive, whether provided by statutory, voluntary or private providers. There are 150 local authority areas in England. In 2005-06 fieldwork for 28 joint area reviews was completed; in 2006-07 fieldwork for 49 was completed; in 2007-08 fieldwork for 41 joint area reviews is scheduled to take place; and in 2008-09 fieldwork for 32 is scheduled. Ofsted is therefore on target to complete all joint area reviews within the time limit specified in the framework</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/14" class="indentitalic"> 6. Secure settings for young people</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/15" class="indent">The 2007-08 programme for the inspection of secure children's homes and secure training centres is on schedule to be completed as planned.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/16" class="indent">Young offender institutions and immigration removal centres are inspected by Ofsted in partnership with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP). Ofsted works in partnership with HMIP and inspects in line with their schedule. The 2007-08 programme is on schedule to be completed as planned.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/17" class="indentitalic"> 7. Initial teacher education</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/18" class="indent">The current initial teacher training inspection (primary and secondary provision) framework and the three year formal service agreement between Ofsted and the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) stipulate that all providers of initial teacher training should be inspected at least once between <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">31 July 2008</phrase>. There are 192 providers of initial teacher training in England. In 2005-06, 54 were inspected; in 2006-07, 73 were inspected; in 2007-08 Ofsted is scheduled to inspect the remaining 70 providers. Ofsted is therefore on target (192 scheduled inspections, three re-inspections, one early inspection on behalf of the TDA and one inspection spread over two years) to complete the inspection of initial teacher training within the agreed time limit for the current initial teacher training Framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/19" class="indent">The current framework for the inspection of further education teacher training stipulates that all providers of further education teacher training should be inspected at least once between <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-01">1 September 2004</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">31 July 2008</phrase>. There are 58 higher education institutions providing further education teacher training in England; in 2004-05 13 were inspected; in 2005-06 12 were inspected; in 2006-07 12 were inspected; in 2007-08 Ofsted is scheduled to inspect 17. Four higher education institutions providing initial teacher training had their inspections deferred according to the agreed deferral criteria and will be inspected early in the next inspection cycle. Ofsted is therefore on target to complete the inspection of further education teacher training within the agreed time limit for the current Framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/20" class="indentitalic"> 8. Children's social care</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/21" class="indent">Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Education, Children's Services and Skills (Fees and Frequency of Inspections) (Children's Homes etc) Regulations 2007 set out the required frequency of inspection for each type of social care. The variety in the frequency of inspection stipulated makes reporting upon progress complex. However, as at <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-30">30 September 2007</phrase>, Ofsted has 3,707 active institutions to inspect. (Registered children's home must have two inspections during every 12 month period). Since April 1,673 inspections have been completed. We are confident that, although the timescale is demanding, Ofsted remains on target to complete each inspection cycle.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/22" class="indentitalic"> 9. Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS)</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/23" class="indent">There is no cycle of inspections of CAFCASS. Instead, there is an annual programme of inspection of CAFCASS which focuses on issues of priority and risk. The 2007-08 programme is on schedule to be completed as planned.</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/24" class="indentitalic"> 10. Adult learning</p>
	<p pid="b.952W.5/25" class="indent">Ofsted is up to date with its cycles of inspection of adult learning and on course to complete them on time. The four-year cycle of work based learning should be complete by summer 2009; that for step provision by April 2009; that for adult and community learning by summer 2010 and that for leamdirect by November 2010. Ofsted is also on course to complete the various cycles of inspections of Department of Work and Pensions training providers within the planned timescales.</p>

Although no formal assessment of progress has been carried out by the Department. I am aware that many local information services have responded positively to the prospect of the broadened duty and are already providing more information than is currently required. We undertook a formal consultation with all authorities and CISs last year, and have had ongoing feedback through regular official level contact with information services and others.</p>

	<p pid="b.970W.5/1">At the beginning of the financial year, local authorities are required to provide to the Governors of a school a budget based upon the number of pupils on roll at the School Census in the previous January. In order to provide stability to schools, that budget may not be amended after the start of the financial year and schools are therefore required to organise within that budget for the whole year, taking into consideration admission numbers. No adjustments may be made, regardless of whether a pupil leaves or joins and there may be turnover in both directions. Local authorities may, however, choose to include within their formula a factor for schools with significantly rising rolls. This is likely to be based upon an estimate of numbers where it is anticipated there will be a significant influx of pupils arriving after the School Census is taken the previous January, or a factor which provides additional funds in the following financial year.</p>
	<p pid="b.970W.5/2">The Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG) gives ring-fenced funding for minority ethnic pupils and pupils with English as an Additional Language (EAL). The grant is approx &pound;179 million in 2007-08, rising to &pound;206 million in 2011. Longstanding guidance and funding is in place to support schools in teaching English as an additional language. Furthermore, the New Arrivals Excellence Programme (NAEP), launched in July 2007 gives support, advice, guidance and training to schools in offering the best provision for learning EAL. Selected local authorities with schools that have little experience of integrating children who are new arrivals will have access to outreach support from a dedicated Regional Adviser. This will ensure they can access the curriculum as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.970W.5/3">The Department for Children, Schools and Families has recently announced an additional Exceptional Circumstances Grant to local authorities with significant extra pressures on their schools budgets from new arrivals, between January and the start of the school-year. This will be on a case-by-case basis when there is a significant increase in pupil numbers in a local authority; or where the proportion of EAL pupils significantly increases in a local authority.</p>

	<p pid="b.976W.5/1">Members of an interim executive board (IEB) are chosen and appointed in individual school cases by the appropriate authority, which may be either the local authority (LA) or the Secretary of State. When the Secretary of State considers an LA's application for an IEB to replace a governing body, he will give particular attention to whether the membership of the Board represents the right mix of skills and experience to meet the school's needs. In the majority of cases, the LA's proposals contain one or more officers from that authority, and where this is not proposed the Secretary of State sometimes invites the LA to consider such membership. In other cases, the Secretary of State has invited extra membership from experienced professionals outside the LA, to secure an independent view on the Board.</p>
	<p pid="b.976W.5/2">In the case of the IEB for Alderman Blaxhill School, in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, Essex county council had already proposed an LA officer, but the Secretary of State invited them to nominate a second, though he did not require them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.976W.5/3">In summary, there is no prescriptive policy in this area: each case is considered on its merits, based on the needs of the school.</p>

	<p pid="b.977W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.977W.2/2" class="italic"> 169492 and 169616</p>
	<p pid="b.977W.2/3">We are unable to provide definitive figures for numbers of bullying incidents at school as we do not collect this data centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.977W.2/4">However, tables showing the number of permanent and fixed period exclusions in each local authority area by reason for exclusion have been placed in the Library. This includes a category relating to bullying.</p>
	<p pid="b.977W.2/5" class="italic"> 169613</p>
	<p pid="b.977W.2/6">The Government are spending around &pound;1.8 million this year supporting schools to meet their legal obligations to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils. Earlier this year we issued comprehensive new guidance to schools on how to prevent and tackle bullying called 'Safe to Learn: Embedding anti-bullying work in schools'. It includes practical advice for schools on how to develop robust anti-bullying policies and embed effective practice, and specific advice on tackling cyberbullying and homophobic bullying. This suite of guidance links to the guidance we produced last year for schools on 'Bullying Around Race Religion and Culture', and we will publish further guidance in the spring on how tackle the bullying of children with special educational needs and disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.977W.2/7">In the Education and Inspections Act 2006, we introduced new powers for head teachers and school staff to ensure proper discipline both inside and outside schools. The Act empowers school staff to impose disciplinary penalties for bad behaviour, and to regulate the behaviour of pupils when they are off the school site.</p>
	<p pid="b.977W.2/8">We fund a number of voluntary organisations including: the Anti-Bullying Alliance who provide support and training for local authorities and schools on anti-bullying work; ChildLine in Partnership with Schools (CHIPS) who run peer mentoring schemes on behalf of the Department; and ParentLine Plus who provide advice and support for the parents of children and young people who are being bullied. We are working with the Cyberbullying Taskforce to take forward a comprehensive programme of work to tackle cyberbullying and have launched an online digital campaign targeted at children and young people. We are working with the national strategies' regional advisers to embed effective anti-bullying practice on the ground, and to work with identified schools to support and challenge them in improving their anti-bullying policies and strategies.</p>
	<p pid="b.977W.2/9">In anti-bullying week we announced that we would be providing &pound;3 million over the next two years to run peer mentoring pilots. We have also commissioned Childnet International to produce a resource pack to provide school staff with practical information and advice on how to tackle cyberbullying, and how best to introduce the topic in the classroom.</p>
	<p pid="b.977W.2/10" class="italic"> 169494 and 169494</p>
	<p pid="b.977W.2/11">The Department has not commissioned any research which compares incidents of bullying with levels of school performance or educational attainment. However, we are aware that there is research evidence to suggest bullying impacts on educational attainment and attendance. We have made clear in our published guidance that providing a safe and happy learning environment is integral to achieving the wider objectives of school improvement, raising achievement and attendance, promoting equality and diversity as well as ensuring the welfare of all members of the school community.</p>
	<p pid="b.977W.2/12" class="italic"> 169482</p>
	<p pid="b.977W.2/13">The Department consulted with all the major school staff unions in drawing up the Safe to Learn comprehensive anti-bullying guidance for schools, and its constituent elements covering cyberbullying and homophobic bullying. The school staff unions are also represented on the Department's Cyberbullying Taskforce, which brings together representatives of school staff, children's charities and the new technology providers to discuss strategies for addressing and preventing cyberbullying. There are no plans at this stage to involve employers in such discussions.</p>

	<p pid="b.978W.2/3">The Department has issued guidance &quot;Licensing of Incidental Drivers of the School Minibus&quot; which states that school staff are in general exempt from the D1 PCV requirement since they receive no consideration for such driving. It also states: &quot;In the medium term, when a school replaces its minibus, it is likely to lose exemption because newer minibuses tend to weigh more than 3.5 tonnes, and the Government has no plans to change the weight limit on the exemption. Therefore we advise schools to consider investing in D1 PCV training over the next few years, since the law will require it in the longer term, if or when they move to a heavier minibus.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.984W.2/1">The EYFS defines milestones in the form of Early Learning Goals which provide the basis for assessing children's development at the end of the EYFS&mdash;normally at the end of reception class. Children's progress during, and at the end of the EYFS (age five) when the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile will be completed, are based on observational assessment of them in everyday activities, by practitioners using their professional judgement. One of the 13 scales used to assess young children's development at age five relates to physical development. Targets both at national level and local authority level relate to overall achievement across the Foundation Stage Profile, rather than specific targets relating to the physical development.</p>
	<p pid="b.984W.2/2">Government invest some &pound;3 billion each year in the delivery of the free entitlement to nursery education for three and four-year-olds. Funding is provided to local authorities through the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) and covers provision delivered in accordance with the Foundation Stage Curriculum and the National Daycare Standards by providers in the maintained, private, voluntary and independent sectors (PVI). In addition, we announced in the summer over &pound;4 billion Revenue and &pound;893 million Capital three year (2008-11) allocations for local authorities of Sure Start, Early Years and Childcare Grant (SSEYCG) (formerly General Sure Start Grant). The Department has provided specific funding of an additional &pound;7 million in each of 2007-08 and 2008-09 to LAs through the Standards Funds and the SSEYCG to support EYFS training of practitioners in schools and PVI settings.</p>

	<p pid="b.990W.2/2"><i> </i>The Government are committed to reducing substance misuse among young people, including that relating to alcohol. In June of this year, the Government published the updated Alcohol Strategy for England, &quot;Safe. Sensible. Social.&quot; For the first time, it identifies under-18s as a priority group for Government action on alcohol and sets out the reduction of drinking by young people as a Government objective. As part of this strategy, this Department has committed to:</p>
	<p pid="b.990W.2/3" class="indent">Establishing a panel of experts who will produce authoritative, accessible guidance about what is and what is not safe and sensible in the light of the latest available evidence from the UK and abroad, to help young people and their parents make informed decisions about alcohol; and</p>
	<p pid="b.990W.2/4" class="indent">Raising awareness of young people's alcohol use and&mdash;through a social marketing campaign&mdash;to work to create a culture where it is socially acceptable for young people to choose not to drink and, if they do, to do so later and more safely.</p>
	<p pid="b.990W.2/5">Alcohol education continues to be a vital element of our approach. The Department's guidance, &quot;Drugs: Guidance for Schools (DfES 2004)&quot; is clear that pupils' education about alcohol and its effects should start in primary school, before drinking patterns become established and should be revisited as pupils' understanding and experience increases.</p>

	<p pid="b.1002W.0/1">We are advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that genetically modified (GM) crops may be used in animal feed in the European Union provided they have been authorised and that a safety assessment forms a key part of the authorisation process. GM food is subject to a similar, rigorous, safety assessment before being permitted to enter the food chain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1002W.0/2">The labelling requirements for GM food are set out in the directly applicable Regulations (EC) Nos. 1829/2003 (GM Food and Feed) and 1830/2003 (Traceability and Labelling of GM Organisms), the intention of which is to facilitate consumer choice. There is no requirement for food produced from animals fed on GM feed to be labelled as such, nor is there any provision for 'non-GM' and 'GM free' labelling. We are advised by the FSA that such labelling may, however, be used on a voluntary basis, as appropriate to the product concerned. The FSA has expressed the view that the use of the terms 'non-GM' and 'GM free' should mean that food labelled in this way is completely free from the use of GM technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.1002W.0/3">Local authorities are responsible for enforcement of the legislation at retail level and checks for the presence of GM material in foods on the basis of sampling form part of their enforcement activities. Local authorities also carry out checks on documentation to ensure that the traceability requirements are being met. These enforcement activities play an important role in consumer protection.</p>

	<p pid="b.1013W.2/1">There are no consultation procedures when a pharmacy wishes to open premises. However, if a pharmacy wishes to provide national health service services, there are procedures under the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations (SI 2005/641) for notifying details of pharmaceutical applications, which vary according to the type of application received. Some, such as a minor relocation of existing premises, are decided administratively by the primary care trust (PCT) without prior notification while others are subject to quite extensive notification. The PCT therefore has quite a wide discretion as to which local interests it notifies. Those notified usually have 45 days to respond.</p>

	<p pid="b.1013W.2/5">The Family Health Services Appeal Unit of the NHS Litigation Authority has been directed to deal with appeals against decisions of primary care trusts relating to pharmaceutical applications on behalf of the Secretary of State (Alan Johnson). The unit will notify appeal details concerning a new pharmacy to the applicant and to relevant primary care professionals and local representative groups who were originally notified of the application by the PCT and who made representations within the stipulated time. However, the unit is not required to notify local individuals who made representation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1026W.14/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what assessment has been made of the effect of inward migration on (a) economic activity and (b) the labour market in (i) North West Cambridgeshire, (ii) Cambridgeshire and (hi) the East of England over the last 10 years. (169391)</p>
	<p pid="b.1026W.14/4" class="indent">Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the main summary indicator of economic activity in the UK. Because data collection, estimation and reporting are not structured according to demographic groups, the national accounts framework does not however make it possible to identity the direct contribution of immigrants to the measured levels of economic activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1026W.14/5" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics compiles statistics for labour supply indicators for local areas from the annual Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) following International Labour Organisation definitions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1026W.14/6" class="indent">The data for analysing migrants also come from the above surveys. The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is routinely based on the number of people at a given time who were born abroad, are of working age (16-64 for men, 16-59 for women). This question has been answered on this basis. It means, for example, that some people who are UK nationals will be included in the total of &quot;foreign born&quot; and that people who are working but are above state pension age are not included.</p>
	<p pid="b.1026W.14/7" class="indent">When interpreting these figures, it is important also to bear in mind that the LFS and APS are not designed to cover everyone who is present in the UK. The survey may undercount the numbers of people who were born overseas. The reasons are set out in the table footnote.</p>
	<p pid="b.1026W.14/8" class="indent">The annual LFS and APS estimates at this detailed level are only available consistent with the UK population estimates published in February and March 2003 and are not comparable with the estimates published in the Labour Market Statistics First Release on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November 2007</phrase>, which are based on latest population estimates.</p>

Those employees would have otherwise seen anomalous gains in their contracted out rebates and S2P benefits following the announcement at Budget 2007 to align the UEL for national insurance contributions with the higher rate threshold for income tax from 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="b.1040W.3/2">The reductions in the rebates result in an increase in national insurance contributions paid into the National Insurance Fund. The National Insurance Fund (NIF) is maintained under the control and management of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. It is run on a &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; basis; current income, mainly from national insurance contributions, pays for current expenditure mostly on contributory benefits. The uses to which the NIF can be put are clearly specified in legislation, with the majority spent on state pensions.</p>

The police believe that the lead was stolen for resale. The police in BiH, and Interpol, are investigating the theft.</p>

	<p pid="b.1043W.5/1">In response to the continuing security and humanitarian crisis in Chad, in September the UK co-sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 1778, which authorises the deployment of an EU force (EUFOR) and a UN multidimensional mission (MINURCAT) to Chad. The force aims to contribute to the stabilisation of the regions in eastern Chad and north eastern Central African Republic which border Sudan. Improved security will facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and help create the conditions necessary for voluntary, secure and sustainable return of refugees and internally displaced persons. EUFOR and MINURCAT support the larger African Union/UN mission to Darfur, which is mandated to protect civilians and is in the process of being deployed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1043W.5/2">Long-term peace and security in the region needs to be underpinned by a lasting political solution. The UK supports the agreement reached between President Deby and Chadian rebel groups on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-25">25 October</phrase> in Sirte, Libya and urges all parties to implement the ceasefire. The EU is also sponsoring a process of dialogue between President Deby and the political opposition forces in Chad, which should contribute to creating a more stable political environment in which to promote peace. The UK takes every opportunity to call on the governments of Chad and Sudan to fulfil their obligations under the Tripoli agreement, which calls for a ceasefire between Chad and Sudan, and an end to support for armed movements, which destabilise the region.</p>

	<p pid="b.1046W.2/1">Over the years, Famagusta and the port of Famagusta have been the subject of a series of proposals for confidence building measures. A 2004 proposal from the Government of Cyprus linked preferential Turkish Cypriot trade with the EU through the port of Famagusta with the return of the closed city of Varosha. Although it has not been possible to agree a confidence building measure involving Varosha, we continue to encourage the parties to think creatively about all such symbolic aspects of the Cyprus problem. If it does not prove possible to address Varosha in isolation, it will undoubtedly have to be addressed as part of a comprehensive settlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1046W.2/2">Ministers and officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office hold discussions with their Turkish counterparts and Turkish Cypriot community leaders on a range of issues relating to the current situation in Cyprus, including the issues relating to the return of Famagusta/Varosha. Ultimately, we believe that the ongoing division of the island, and the issues attached to it, can only be resolved through a comprehensive settlement brokered by the UN. We continue to urge both sides to show the political will and flexibility to bridge the gap between words and deeds, and to engage constructively with the UN's efforts to broker a comprehensive and durable settlement.</p>

	<p pid="b.1046W.5/1">The UK/Turkey Strategic Partnership (formerly UK/ Turkey Action Plan) is a formalised dialogue that has existed between the UK and Turkey since 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1046W.5/2">The UK/Turkey Agreement reflects our longstanding commitment to helping secure a lasting settlement of the Cyprus problem. We continue to support wholeheartedly the <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-08">8 July 2006</phrase> agreement between the two leaders. In support, the UK/Turkey Strategic Partnership includes a section reiterating longstanding commitments to bring the Turkish Cypriot community closer to Europe, which we believe will facilitate any future Cypriot settlement agreement by reducing economic disparities and putting market forces at the service of a settlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1046W.5/3">Both Greece and the Republic of Cyprus have made representations over the Agreement. Dialogue with both the Republic of Cyprus and Greece show that, while we share the same strategic objective of reunifying Cyprus, there are honestly held differences of opinion on how to achieve this. We continue to discuss all such differences of opinion, with the ultimate objective of achieving a Cyprus settlement acceptable to all Cypriots. The UK shares many vital interests with both countries, and its bilateral relations with both countries remain, as ever, very important.</p>

	<p pid="b.1051W.3/1">It is a condition of their employment that members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children also have a legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the age of five years. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) helps staff meet these potentially conflicting obligations by providing financial support for their children's education in the UK (or overseas, where free state schooling in English is not available locally).</p>
	<p pid="b.1051W.3/2">With staff and families having to move at regular intervals, sometimes at times which may disrupt schooling for their children, and education facilities at posts overseas varying, continuity of education can prove problematic particularly during the important exam years. The FCO addresses this problem by providing a continuity of education allowance to enable children to board at schools in the UK, while their parents remain subject to the world-wide mobility obligation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1051W.3/3">The amounts we have spent each year on financial support for the costs of private education in the UK and travel for visits by children to their parents during school holidays are set out in the following table. We have also listed the number of staff in receipt of the allowance (where known) and the number of children who have benefited.</p>
	<p pid="b.1051W.3/4">Children covered by the allowance currently attend 180 different schools in the UK. We are not able to break the figures down by individual school without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1065W.2/1">The UK plays a prominent role in building and maintaining the coalition of anti-whaling countries within the International Whaling Commission (IWC). In advance of the 2007 annual meeting in Anchorage, the UK and its like-minded allies recruited a further six countries into the IWC, with the net result that the pro-whaling majority in that organisation was overturned. In a further response to UK lobbying efforts, several other countries have indicated willingness to support our opposition to Japanese whaling and to join the IWC in time for next year's annual meeting.</p>
	<p pid="b.1065W.2/2">British embassies and missions will shortly deliver to certain governments an updated version of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs publication &quot;Protecting Whales&mdash;A Global Responsibility&quot; as part of a lobbying campaign to encourage more countries to join the IWC, to strengthen further the global opposition to commercial whaling.</p>

	<p pid="b.1066W.0/1">The UK believes that any scientific whaling should be confined to non-lethal research, and should be undertaken only if relevant proposals have been approved by the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC).</p>
	<p pid="b.1066W.0/2">The right of member states to issue permits for the killing of whales for scientific purposes is enshrined in article VIII of the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, the IWC's parent treaty. However, 'Scientific purposes' are not defined by the Convention. Furthermore, we doubt that the authors of the Convention anticipated that parties would undertake research on the scale now practised by Japan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1066W.0/3">Contrary to Japan's claims, its research programmes have not met with universal support or acclaim from the IWC Scientific Committee. That committee has not endorsed this research and has expressed many reservations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1066W.0/4">Japan says its scientific whaling programmes are essential to understand better whale populations and the ecosystems in which they reside. They state that a range of information is needed for the management and conservation of whales, such as population, age structure, growth rates, reproductive rates, feeding&mdash;and that this can only be obtained through lethal research.</p>
	<p pid="b.1066W.0/5">The UK has consistently voiced its opposition to Japanese scientific whaling. Like most IWC members, the UK does not believe that scientific research can justify the large-scale killing of whales. In our view, Japan's research programmes are deeply flawed.</p>
