	<p pid="c.1646W.8/2">The definition for brownfield land is currently set out in Annexe C to Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 &mdash;Housing. This says that:</p>
	<p pid="c.1646W.8/3" class="indent">&quot;Previously-developed land is that which is or was occupied by a permanent structure (excluding agricultural or forestry buildings), and associated fixed surface infrastructure<sup>(1)</sup>. The definition covers the curtilage of the development<sup>(2)</sup>. Previously-developed land may occur in both built-up and rural settings. The definition includes defence buildings and land used for mineral extraction and waste disposal<sup>(3 )</sup>where provision for restoration has not been made through development control procedures<sup>(4)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1646W.8/4" class="indent">The definition excludes land and buildings that are currently in use for agricultural or forestry purposes, and land in built-up areas which has not been developed previously (e.g. parks, recreation grounds, and allotments&mdash;even though these areas may contain certain urban features such as paths, pavilions and other buildings). Also excluded is land that was previously developed but where the remains of any structure or activity have blended into the landscape in the process of time (to the extent that it can reasonably be considered as part of the natural surroundings), and where there is a clear reason that could outweigh the re-use of the site&mdash;such as its contribution to nature conservation&mdash;or it has subsequently been put to an amenity use and cannot be regarded as requiring redevelopment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.1646W.8/5">The definition is based on the Land Use Change Statistics classification (LUCS) introduced in 1985.</p>
	<p pid="c.1646W.8/6">In December last year we published draft PPS 3, which is designed to update planning for housing policy. Annexe A of draft PPS 3 proposes some clarificatory changes to the definition of previously developed land. We are currently considering representations that were received to the consultation on draft PPS3, and are due to publish final PPS 3 later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1662W.2/1">The Department for Communities and Local Government's monthly house price index is a weighted average of prices for a standard mix of dwellings. Dwelling prices come from mortgage completion data from the regulated mortgage survey of the Council of Mortgage Lenders and BankSearch.</p>
	<p pid="c.1662W.2/2">The index is &quot;mix-adjusted&quot; to allow for the fact that different houses are sold in different periods and is achieved partly by fitting a model. The variables in the model include two variables that define similar areas. One is a classification of local authorities into clusters derived by the Office for National Statistics and the other neighbourhood type based on postcode data produced by CACI Ltd. (ACORN). In addition weightings in the &quot;mix-adjustment&quot; are based on transaction data, partly based on data from the Land Registry and partly on past data from the mortgage survey.</p>

	<p pid="c.1664W.11/1">The social homebuy scheme became available in April 2006 and provides a new opportunity for tenants of participating local authorities and housing associations to purchase a share in their home. The scheme is currently being offered by 42 housing associations and one local authority. My officials are in discussions with other local authorities which have expressed an interest in social homebuy. The Housing Corporation plans to hold a further bidding round in the autumn to enable more housing associations to participate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1664W.11/2">To date, there has been one completed sale in the housing association sector. The purchaser bought outright with the available discount. More sales are expected shortly. Although a number of local authority tenants have applied to buy shares in their homes, no sales have yet been completed.</p>

	<p pid="c.1664W.14/2">The London borough of Newham created a registered social landlord called Local Space to acquire properties to be leased to the council for temporary occupation. Local Space received a social housing grant allocation from the Housing Corporation in 2005-06 totalling &pound;25 million over two years to acquire a minimum of 1,000 properties.</p>
	<p pid="c.1664W.14/3">Ealing's Safe Haven London, a charity specially established for the purpose, is to acquire houses and flats over a two-year period, including some new build stock and lease them back to the council under an arrangement which provides for the transfer of the properties to a housing association at expiry of the lease. The project does not benefit from a Housing Corporation grant, or any other grant. To date 50 properties have been purchased and occupied.</p>
	<p pid="c.1664W.14/4">The London and Quadrant Housing Trust (LQHT) homelessness initiative leasing scheme (HILS) is a programme which commenced in 2003-04, administered by the Housing Corporation and was designed to help eliminate the use of bed-and-breakfast accommodation as temporary housing. Its remit was to deliver 500 units at a cost of &pound;17.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1664W.14/5">The trust has delivered 401 units in agreed local authority areas, which they have leased back to the local authority for a period of 10 years. The local authority nominates households who would otherwise be housed in bed and breakfast to be accommodated in these units.</p>
	<p pid="c.1664W.14/6">Building on these initiatives, &pound;30 million will be made available through an extra homes pilot in London to help families move from temporary accommodation into settled homes. Detailed guidance on submitting proposals for this pilot will be issued later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="c.1668W.2/1">The Government have set a target for all local authorities to operate choice-based lettings by 2010; and an interim target of 25 per cent. of local authorities by 2005. As at April 2005 some 27 per cent. of local authorities said that they offered choice-based lettings.</p>
	<p pid="c.1668W.2/2">The report of the evaluation of the pilot schemes was published in May 2004, and showed that they were successful in achieving their aim of establishing more open systems that are seen to offer customers choice. They also did not appear to disadvantage vulnerable households, who continue to access a significant proportion of vacant properties and often bid successfully for the most popular, and led to improvements in housing management performance with, for example, re-let times reducing substantially in some areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.1670W.9/2">DEFRA has not assessed in detail the merits of integrating these services. However, we are aware of a number of studies which show that where waste collection and waste disposal are split between two tiers of local government, there can be real benefits in authorities working together to deliver an integrated waste service. For example, a recent report by the Innovation Forum, a group of excellent rated authorities, highlights the benefits of joint working on waste in two-tier areas, citing possible efficiency savings of up to &pound;150 million nationally.</p>
	<p pid="c.1670W.9/3">Our consultation on the waste strategy review stresses the need for joint working between authorities, integrating strategy development and spatial planning. The Government are considering further how we can facilitate joint working by authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1670W.9/4">Partnership working is one of the ways local authorities can realise the &pound;300 million of efficiency savings identified in the Gershon review from waste and street cleansing during the period 2005 to 2008. The Department for Communities and Local Government strategic partnering taskforce's final report, published in 2004, said that strategic partnerships are one of the main service delivery options available to local authorities in their quest for efficient and effective high quality services.</p>

	<p pid="c.1672W.3/1">There are two projects under the National Land Use Database heading. One is the National Land Use Database of Previously-Developed Land (NLUD-PDL). This was launched in 1998 and has been an annual survey since 2001. The latest report is on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/embedded_object.asp?id=l147698">www.communities.gov.uk/embedded_object.asp?id=l147698</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1672W.3/2">The other is the Full National Land Use Database, also known as NLUD-Baseline. This would show land use and, separately, land cover for all land parcels in England. The Department for Communities and Local Government has funded developmental work, a report on which is on the Department's website at: <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/embedded_object.asp?id=l161713">www.communities.gov.uk/embedded_object.asp?id=l161713</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1672W.3/3">At present there are no plans to implement the full database. A simplified version, the Generalised Land Use Database has, however, been created and is available on the website at: <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/embedded_object.asp?id=l146084">www.communities.gov.uk/embedded_object.asp?id=l146084</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1672W.3/4">NLUD-PDL is run jointly by the Department and English Partnerships. English Partnerships carries out the data collection at a cost of &pound;250,000 a year. It is not known what the cost of Full NLUD would be. This would depend on the outcome of competitive tendering, the scope of the database and the potential for cost recovery through sales. As stated, however, there are no plans to implement Full NLUD.</p>

It is important to note, however, that the majority of medically downgraded personnel remain fit enough to work in some other capacity. For example, for the first quarter of year 2006-07 whereas 94.5 per cent. 83.7 per cent. and 90.2 per cent. of Royal Navy, Army and RAF personnel respectively were fit for task, only approximately 0.5 per cent. in each Service were considered unfit for any military duties.

	<p pid="c.1692W.7/15">&quot;Establishment&quot; is the listing of an individual unit's funded appointments/posts. It is different to the &quot;Requirement&quot;, which are those posts necessary to support defence planning assumptions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1692W.7/16">To date the Defence Medical Services (DMS) have met all operational requirements placed on them. Medical support to deployed operations is absolutely vital and there is no question of British forces deploying on military operations without the appropriate medical support.</p>
	<p pid="c.1692W.7/17">It is important to note that the overall DMS manning requirement covers a much broader spectrum than just medical support to operations, since it includes all the personnel involved in the delivery of medical services to the non-deployed armed forces as well.</p>
	<p pid="c.1692W.7/18">DMS manning requirement figures were initially drawn up as a consequence of the strategic defence review (SDR). These remain the official, formally endorsed figures. Since then, however, overall defence planning assumptions have changed and DMS manning requirement figures have evolved. In order to support the defence planning assumptions contained within defence strategic guidance 03, the defence medical capability (DMC) phase 2 study was carried out. The DMC study has produced interim revised DMS manning requirement figures which more accurately reflect defence planning assumptions and have thus overtaken the SDR figures. Elements of these interim manning requirements have previously been released, prior to a new definitive set of figures (as set out in my predecessor's answer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1402W.</p>
	<p pid="c.1692W.7/19">Work is ongoing to establish the overall requirement, with the overall requirement expected to decrease, although increases are expected within some individual specialties. I anticipate that new endorsed DMS manning requirement figures will be available later this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1692W.7/20">It is acknowledged that currently there are manpower shortages across the DMS, especially in some key specialties. The following tables show the manning levels as at April 2006 in the key shortage specialties for Medical Officers and Nurses (requirement figures shown are the SDK figures and the DMC figures):</p>

	<p pid="c.1694W.2/1">The process to close military hospitals began in 1994 because they no longer had sufficient patient volume and case mix to develop and maintain the skills of our medical personnel. To meet this training need we have established Ministry of Defence hospital units (MDHUs) located within NHS hospitals at Derriford, Frimley Park, Peterborough, Portsmouth and Northallerton, and the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine within the University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust (UHBFT) in Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid="c.1694W.2/2">The integration throughout the NHS trusts of service personnel in those specialisms which are required on deployed operations enables Defence Medical Services staff to take advantage of NHS expertise and to maintain their own clinical skills in an active, up-to-date environment. Additionally, treating Service patients within the NHS trusts which host MDHUs provides the most effective means of giving the UK armed forces benefit from the latest advances in medical treatment and the recent investments in NHS facilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1694W.2/3">In the last two years, enhanced command and control structures have been introduced. Each MDHU now has a dedicated command team. This has improved administrative, business and training functionality and enables clinical staff to concentrate on honing their professional skills, both medical and military. Although service staff work in a NHS environment, military ethos is maintained through regular collective events. Military uniform is worn by all command and serving administrative staff and also by clinical staff, except where duties require specific clinical dress. Clinical staff have their working time apportioned between &quot;Trust Protected Time&quot; and &quot;Military Protected Time&quot;. The former guarantees sufficient clinical exposure to maintain standards, while the latter ensures that service operational and training requirements are met.</p>

Records indicate that DESO made arrangements for Ethiopian officials to visit the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) and Hunting Engineering (now Insys) in March 1997. Subsequently, DERA won contracts for project management advice on the upgrade programme. We have found no evidence of discussions involving the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency of the US Government.

As the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have said, the UK was a target for international terrorism before Iraq. Over the last 12 years there have been terrorist attacks in over 36 countries, not all of whom have been involved in&mdash;or even supported&mdash;military action in Iraq. There is no excuse or justification for terrorism and we cannot let our foreign policy be dictated by it. The establishment of a stable, democratic Iraq, enjoying the rule of law, will be our and Iraq's best defence against terrorism.</p>

	<p pid="c.1702W.6/1">Much of the RAF data were transferred from legacy systems to JPA by a team of RAF clerks to ensure that data input was effectively controlled. Wherever possible, data are input by using lists of values contained in drop-down menus which reduces the opportunity to input data incorrectly. Free text boxes are used in only a handful of scenarios where drop-down menus are deemed to be inappropriate. Where errors have been identified in data transferred from legacy systems the individual is encouraged to amend the details either through the self-service facility or though unit HR staff. Improved training packages for users are currently being developed.</p>

	<p pid="c.1704W.6/1">To my knowledge, no Foreign Office or other UK Government personnel have been transported in Mambas operated by Blackwater Consulting in Baghdad, though records may not cover such detail and the possibility cannot be excluded.</p>
	<p pid="c.1704W.6/2">We have not carried out a specific evaluation of the use of Mambas by Blackwater Security Consulting in Baghdad for personnel protection, nor have we carried out a specific assessment of their vulnerability to improvised explosive device (IED) attack.</p>

	<p pid="c.1704W.6/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-26">26 June</phrase> my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence informed the House that the Ministry of Defence was urgently reviewing the options for protected patrol vehicles, with a view to identifying what else could be done as quickly as possible and in the longer term. The RG-31, a more modern vehicle derived from the Mamba family, was considered, alongside a number of alternatives. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-24">24 July 2006</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 75WS, he announced the results of the review.</p>
	<p pid="c.1704W.6/5">We do not comment on the relative protection of our vehicles, or those used by our Allies, as to do so would prejudice the safety of our and our allies' personnel. The additional vehicles announced by the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-24">24 July</phrase> will provide more options for commanders to use as they see fit to best meet the mission and counter the threat.</p>

	<p pid="c.1711W.8/3">The Porton Down science park was founded in October 1997 as a result of the defence diversification White Paper of November 1998. The aim was to work in partnership with other local research and development organisations to promote Porton Down, and to act as an incubator unit for small start-up biotechnology companies by allowing them access to the support infrastructure. The tenancy agreement with Regma was the same as for any other small start-up biotechnology company.</p>

Similarly, details of personnel who have been discharged as a result of a mental health condition that can be attributed specifically to service in Iraq and whose continued medical care has therefore been transferred to the NHS is not held centrally and to obtain it would require the examination of the individual medical records of every patient. These can only be viewed for non-clinical reasons with the express consent of the individual concerned, to protect patient confidentiality.

	<p pid="c.1715W.5/1">The Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force personnel staffs who answer such requests work to the same guidance and criteria in discharging MOD's duty to process personal data fairly and in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. Key issues include whether the subject of the record is alive; whether the next of kin are making or are aware of the request; and the precise nature of the information held and requested. This inevitably involves case by case consideration of often complex circumstances. A number of reports of apparently inconsistent outcomes have led officials to launch a review with the aim of providing more detailed guidance on the release of information from service records. I will write to the hon. Member when that work is complete, which I expect to be before the end of the year.</p>

This was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February 2006</phrase> and we are now working to take this forward. Agreement was reached in principle shortly after the announcement with the prospective Surface Ship Support Alliance (SSSA) partners (Devonport Management Ltd., Babcock International Group and Fleet Support Ltd.) on the work-share for the autumn 2006 upkeep packages. These packages of work will not be contracted under the yet-to-be-agreed alliance umbrella, but will instead form part of an initial test of principle for the alliance concept. Subject to affordability and this work continuing to offer best value when set against the Department's other priorities, it is intended to enter into contracts within the next few months.</p>

	<p pid="c.1720W.0/1">Not all personnel who leave the armed forces want to continue to work. Of those service leavers who discharged in 2005 after using the career transition partnership (CTP) to prepare themselves for future employment and who have provided feedback on their post-discharge working status, nearly 57 per cent. had found employment on or before their final day of military service, and a further 13 per cent. within one month of discharge. Since CTP contract performance-related recording began in April 2000, about 95 per cent. of service leavers who accessed CTP support and wanted to work after departure from the armed forces were employed within six months of their discharge.</p>
	<p pid="c.1720W.0/2">In keeping with the philosophy of providing a high quality resettlement service to all entitled military personnel who will be entering a common civilian job market, post-discharge employment success statistics are not maintained on leavers by service or age cohort. Also, no statistics are held on the civilian employment status of veterans beyond the six-months post-discharge point.</p>

Where an individual does fall into one of these categories details of previous convictions, cautions, reprimands and warning that are held on the police national computer are disclosable. In the event the person will be regularly caring for, training, or otherwise responsible for a young or vulnerable person then it may be appropriate to disclose information held by the police, but only where it would be proportionate and relevant.</p>

	<p pid="c.1726W.5/2">The Home Office's five-year strategy for protecting the public and reducing reoffending, published in February 2006, outlined the commitment to work with judges, magistrates and other agencies to improve the quality of recording of ethnic monitoring data.

	<p pid="c.1726W.5/3">The Department for Constitutional Affairs has no specific measures to monitor the sentencing practices of individual magistrates. However, the Judicial Studies Board (JSB) through a variety of mechanisms ensures that diversity is addressed at all stages of a magistrate's development to ensure that they do not discriminate against black and minority ethnic people. The Magistrates National Training Initiative competence framework contains a number of knowledge and performance elements requiring magistrates to demonstrate an understanding of</p>

The results from this campaign will be released shortly. Previous AMECs have been shown to be very effective in dealing with alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder, including town-centre violence and under-age sales of alcohol. Early indications are that AMEC4 saw the highest-yet level of activity by the police and trading standards officers. One of the purposes of AMEC4 was to set the tone of acceptable behaviour during the World Cup competition, and the relatively low level of disorder seen during the competition is testimony to its effectiveness.</p>

	<p pid="c.1736W.2/2">A key part of each crime and disorder reduction partnership's (CDRP) antisocial behaviour strategy is promoting the community's awareness of actions taken to tackle specific problems. This includes ensuring that victims, witnesses and the community are aware of any ASBOs in force in their area. Publicity also helps the community to police such orders, acts as a deterrent to other potential offenders, and increases public confidence that local agencies are able to deal effectively with this type of problem. Publicity has to be proportionate to the achievement of these objectives, and is therefore the norm, not the exception.</p>

	<p pid="c.1741W.3/1">Ryecroft is approved by the Secretary of State to accommodate a maximum of 16 residents. Actual occupancy will vary on a day to day basis. Statistical information about the type of offences committed by offenders residing at an approved premises and the licence conditions to which they are subject at any one time is not collected centrally. Certain offenders are placed in approved premises, where they can be closely monitored by offender managers and by staff in approved premises. Since offenders are managed locally, it is appropriate that local offender managers should have comprehensive information on offenders, including the type of offence they have committed. Information about the numbers of staff at individual approved premises and their qualifications is not collected by the Home Office.</p>

	<p pid="c.1741W.6/1">We do not hold information on the supply of interpreters in particular languages to individual police forces. Code C issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 states (at paragraph 13.1) that chief officers of police are responsible for ensuring appropriate arrangements are in place for people who cannot speak English and provides that interpreters should be drawn from the National Register of Public Service Interpreters. There exists more detailed national guidance regarding interpreters in the criminal justice system and this is currently under review by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform, with the Association of Chief Police Officers and other interested parties. The National Register of Public Service Interpreters is maintained by a not-for-profit limited company, which is a subsidiary of the Chartered Institute of Linguists. I understand that there are 120 Arabic interpreters on the current Register and that many of these are available to work in more than one police area.</p>

The Centre has tracked research in this field and has been in discussion with the National Offender Management Service on potential applications for gait recognition.</p>
	<p pid="c.1750W.5/3">Gait recognition is one of a group of biometric technologies which are predominantly behavioural in character, in contrast with the mainly physiologically determined technologies such as facial recognition, fingerprint identification and iris biometrics, where there is more performance data and a longer history of research, development and deployment. Work on development of robust solutions using gait recognition is relatively recent and the Home Office is aware that one of the premier centres of research in the field is in the UK at Southampton University. It is recognised that automatic gait recognition has potential to support systems that protect the public, but this technology needs further development and validation before it can be considered for deployment on a routine basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.1751W.0/1">I hope that, as the subject matter of the above questions are closely linked, it will be helpful if I deal with them in one reply. The Reporting Application Registration Card (RepARC) Project was introduced in 2004 to create an automated link between compliance with reporting restrictions attached to temporary admission and access to asylum support payments. All asylum applicants are issued with an Application Registration Card (ARC), which is a biometric card containing fingerprint data and is also used as the method of collection for asylum support payments. In the RepARC system, ARCs are electronically revalidated at reporting events. Such events take 3-4 minutes including the process of checking identity and revalidation. Failure to report on two consecutive occasions leads to expiry of the card, and presentation of an expired card at a post office leads to denial of asylum support payments. This supports our policy of having in place a link between compliance with all aspects of the asylum process and access to support. If payment is suspended as described above, the remedy for the applicant is to resume reporting. If this does not happen, the case is referred to enforcement officers to locate the applicant; formal discontinuation of support may follow after eight weeks. Rollout of the RepARC process to all 11 IND reporting centres commenced in October 2005, in conjunction with the implementation of section 69 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the payment of travel expenses for reporting). Key external stakeholders have been kept fully informed of the rollout timetable, which has so far delivered the system to the reporting centres in Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Croydon, Glasgow, Solihull and two London centres. Rollout to the remaining reporting centres (north London, North Shields and Folkestone) will be complete by <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-31">31 July 2006</phrase>, by which date it is expected that all NASS-supported applicants reporting to these sites will be reporting with an ARC. Non NASS-supported applicants are not covered by the RepARC scheme, although all asylum applicants are issued with ARCs. As of <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-30">30 April</phrase>, 4250 asylum seekers with biometric ARCS, the total of all NASS supported asylum seekers who report to RepARC-enabled centres, were reporting within the RepARC system. Non NASS-supported applicants do not fall within the RepARC system but are still issued with ARCs, which are frequently used at reporting events to verify identity.</p>

	<p pid="c.1752W.2/1">Code C issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 states (at paragraph 13.1) that chief officers of police are responsible for ensuring appropriate arrangements are in place for people who are deaf. The Code provides that sign language interpreters should be drawn from the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People Directory of British Sign Language/English Interpreters. The Code also makes it clear that if a person appears to be deaf or there is doubt about their hearing or speaking ability, they must not be interviewed in the absence of an interpreter unless they agree in writing to being interviewed without one. There exists more detailed national guidance regarding interpreters in the criminal justice system and that is currently under review by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform, with the Association of Chief Police Officers and other interested parties.</p>

Since then, the main data source for criminal information has changed from the Offenders Index to the Police National Computer. No similar sample or programs are currently available for us to conduct more up to date analysis. The table gives the numbers sentenced for their third burglary offence. The numbers are for a four week period in 2001, derived from the Offenders Index. The figures include attempted burglaries, as it is not possible to distinguish between an actual and attempted burglary on the Offenders Index.</p>

	<p pid="c.1753W.2/1">No scientific assessment has been made by HOSDB of the merits of using thermal imaging cameras for the detection of cannabis factories. The ability to detect cannabis factories was first recognised in the 1990s with the introduction of thermal imaging equipment to police air support craft. Small hand-held thermal imagers have more recently become available to the UK law enforcement community leading to the recent increase in ground use.</p>
	<p pid="c.1753W.2/2">In detecting other crimes, assessments are being made of the technology for detecting prison escape and breaches of security barriers. Assessments are being made of the technology in a variety of other circumstances, however revealing the exact nature of the offences or the results could compromise the effectiveness of the technique. No formal scientific assessment has been made for detecting property crimes (e.g. vehicle theft, burglary) but these are frequently detected by the use of thermal imaging equipment from police operated aircraft and helicopters.</p>
	<p pid="c.1753W.2/3">The vast majority of police forces in England and Wales have access to an air support unit and these are all fitted with thermal imaging technology. No formal purchasing arrangement is in place for police forces to procure hand-held thermal imagers and thermal imaging equipment is still perceived as an expensive technology by the service (typically &pound;6,000 to &pound;8,000 per unit).</p>
	<p pid="c.1753W.2/4">The Home Office Scientific Development Branch owns five different types (over twenty items) of thermal imager, which can be used for a variety of activities including the detection of cannabis factories. These are available to all police forces in England and Wales to borrow free-of-charge for specific operations.</p>

	<p pid="c.1754W.3/1">Between 1999 and 2003, major investment was made in CCTV through the Crime Reduction Programme (CRP). A total of &pound;170 million of Home Office capital funding was made available to local authorities following a bidding round. Through this, more than 680 CCTV schemes were installed in town centres. The end of the Crime Reduction Programme signalled the end of a dedicated central funding regime for CCTV. After the conclusion of the CRP, crime reduction funding moved to a structure that saw it being directly allocated to local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) and Basic Command Units to enable them to tackle local crime priorities using a number of interventions including CCTV.</p>

	<p pid="c.1761W.14/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1761W.14/2" class="italic"> Perceptions of discrimination by key public services</p>
	<p pid="c.1761W.14/3">The public service agreement examines an aggregate target; it seeks to decrease the percentage of BME people who believe that <i> one or more</i> of the eight key public services (the five criminal justice system agencies (Police Service, Prison Service, Courts, CPS and Probation), local GPs, local schools and council housing / housing associations) would discriminate against them and the percentage of BME people feeling they would be treated worse than people of other races by <i> one or more</i> of eight public service organisations has remained unchanged since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="c.1761W.14/4">These data are disappointing but it is positive to note that individually perceptions of discrimination among BME people across the range of key public services have fallen since 2001, with the exception of council housing/housing associations where the figure remains the same.</p>
	<p pid="c.1761W.14/5">We are keen to learn what the key factors are which influence people's views of prejudice and have commissioned research into the drivers of perception which will report this autumn. We are hopeful that final report from this research will enhance our knowledge in this area and our ability to assess what more might be done.</p>
	<p pid="c.1761W.14/6" class="italic"> Perceptions of discrimination in the labour market</p>
	<p pid="c.1761W.14/7">On the labour market side, HOCS 2005 provided the first milestone since the 2003 baseline. Although there is no significant change on 2003, movement is in the right direction for one of the elements (refused a job). The percentage of people perceiving that they have been discriminated against because of their race when applying for a promotion did not change significantly although it has not moved positively in the direction we would have hoped.</p>
	<p pid="c.1761W.14/8">We recognise the need to address issues of progression in the work place for ethnic minorities The CRE's new &quot;Code of Practice on Racial Equality in Employment&quot; took effect from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-06">6 April</phrase> and will help business to promote diversity, by providing case studies, best practice and other practical guidance. In addition, the Ethnic Minority Employment Task Force, led by my hon. Friend the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform is coordinating work to improve employment chances for ethnic minorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1761W.14/9" class="italic"> Perceptions of community cohesion</p>
	<p pid="c.1761W.14/10">As the data for this element of the target were only baselined in the Citizenship Survey 2005, there is no current slippage here.</p>
	<p pid="c.1761W.14/11" class="italic"> General</p>
	<p pid="c.1761W.14/12">A perceptions based target, this objective is extremely challenging. It requires not just working towards ensuring that the experiences that people have are fair and can be seen to be fair, but also tackling the inequalities which still exist for many groups and being open about the progress we are making and the work which remains to be done.</p>
	<p pid="c.1761W.14/13">This work is a long term objective and the impact that any progress made has on changing perceptions broadly, may take time to be seen in the data collected for this PSA. The PSA forms part of the Government's strategy to increase race equality and community cohesion, &quot;Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society&quot;, and the first annual progress report on this will be published this summer.</p>

	<p pid="c.1764W.9/1">Most consumers use credit in a productive and prudent way, however a small minority of individuals show signs of financial distress. The Government needs to strike the right balance between enabling a competitive consumer credit market, and protecting those at risk of over-indebtedness. It is the Government's view that the amount an individual can borrow is a matter between the individual and the lender concerned. Government, however, are working with lenders to promote responsible lending through increased data sharing and industry codes of practice.</p>

	<p pid="c.1764W.12/1">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 contained a wide range of different measures designed to improve the protection of the public and the operation of the criminal justice system. Some of the main areas included the establishment of crime reduction partnership arrangements, the introduction of antisocial behaviour orders and of sex offender orders, the establishment of the Youth Justice Board, sentencing for both adults and juveniles, the establishment of the Sentencing Advisory Panel and the creation of specific racially aggravated offences. Although the measures in the Act have worked well, we have kept them under review and in the light of experience and of specific reviews we have made a number of changes to further improve them. In particular we have strengthened and improved upon the arrangements for antisocial behaviour orders and have built upon sex offender orders to create sexual offences prevention orders; we have extended racially aggravated offences to include religious aggravation; we have reviewed the whole of the sentencing framework for adults and introduced new arrangements in the Criminal Justice Act 2003; the youth justice arrangements have also been reviewed and proposals for change published in March 2004; and we have reviewed the partnership arrangements, with proposals for change being introduced in the Police and Justice Bill while others are subject to further consultation. The Government attaches a very high priority to public protection, the reduction of crime and to ensuring that the criminal justice system works effectively. We set out, in our document 'Rebalancing the Criminal Justice System in favour of the Law Abiding Majority', which we published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-20">20 July</phrase>, further proposals for improvements across a range of areas. Representations are made from time to time in relation to individual provisions in the Act. The statutory instruments made under the Act are in the following list.</p>

	<p pid="c.1766W.2/1">The Home Office established the Vehicle Crime Reduction Action Team (VCRAT) in September 1998 to develop and oversee implementation of a strategy to reduce vehicle crime. The strategy was published in 1999 and contributed to the reduction of 1,780,000 incidents of vehicle crime (51 per cent.) estimated by the British Crime Survey between 1997 and interviews in 2005-06. The main initiatives the Home Office has participated in since 1997 have included: supporting improved vehicle security through publication of security guidance documents aimed at manufacturers and publication of Car and Bike Theft Indices; spreading good practice, for example through the vehicle crime toolkit on the website <a href="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk">www.crimereduction.gov.uk</a>; improving car park security through support for the Safer Parking Scheme (owned by the Association of Chief Police Officers and managed by the British Parking Association).</p>
	<p pid="c.1766W.2/2">This includes financial support amounting to &pound;1,409,000 over the period 2001-02 to 2005-06; making the motor salvage industry subject to statutory regulation under powers contained in the Vehicles (Crime) Act 2001; and raising motorists' awareness of the steps they can take to prevent themselves becoming victims of car crime through national communications campaigns (with funding of &pound;28.6 million over the period 1999-2000 to 2005-06) and other communications initiatives.</p>

No admission of guilt is required and payment of the penalty discharges all liability for the offence. Data on the number of PNDs issued for these offences in each police force area in England in 2004 and 2005 (provisional) can also be found in the following tables.

	<p pid="c.1774W.8/1">The organisations that make up the Criminal Justice System use a variety of information systems designed to meet their local needs, but which were not originally designed to share information with colleagues working in other criminal justice organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1774W.8/2">This is why, in response to the &quot;Justice for All&quot; Government White Paper, the Criminal Justice System Information Technology (CJS IT) programme was established in 2002 with the following vision: &quot;By March 31 2008, anyone involved in the CJS&mdash;users of it or people working within it&mdash;should have access from any browser enabled device, to a seamless, coherent set of computer systems and information to cover the breadth of their dealings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.1774W.8/3">The overall cost of the CJS IT programme, across both SR2002 and SR2004, is &pound;1.95 billion. This funding is ring-fenced, with spending controlled by five key-holders: the Home Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Lord Chancellor, the Minister with responsibility for the CJS and the Director of Criminal Justice IT (CJIT).</p>
	<p pid="c.1774W.8/4">The programme sits under its own NCJB (National Criminal Justice Board) Sub-Group, chaired by the Minister with responsibility for the CJS&mdash;a role that has been delegated to me&mdash;dedicated to tracking progress and assisting in the resolution of cross-cutting issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.1774W.8/5">The programme also reports to the Operational Board of the Office for Criminal Justice Reform&mdash;a cross-departmental organisation that supports all criminal justice agencies in working together to provide an improved service to the public and which reports on an equal basis to the Home Office, Department for Constitutional Affairs and Law Officers' Department.</p>
	<p pid="c.1774W.8/6">Criminal Justice IT (CJIT), which was created to co-ordinate the CJS IT programme, is working with the criminal justice organisations to identify and implement ways to join up the individual processes, systems and services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1774W.8/7">CJIT has developed a set of key tools, techniques and repeatable processes to ensure successful delivery of this large-scale IT programme, many of which are creating best practice. These include evidence-based CJS IT portfolio prioritisation/investment appraisal, active benefits realisation, performance management, and full open, factual and transparent reporting to all stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="c.1774W.8/8">Expenditure and deliverables for the CJS IT programme are approved annually by the five key-holders and monthly progress reports are provided to various governance bodies (including the Operational Board of the Office for Criminal Justice Reform) and key stakeholders (including Her Majesty's Treasury).</p>

	<p pid="c.1777W.2/1">No central record is kept by either the Home Department or the Treasury Solicitors department of the number of cases in which damages were paid or what the total sum paid out was. This information could be obtained only by searching through some 10,000 transaction sheets and then identifying the damages elements of these payments. This would involve a disproportionate cost. Detailed figures are not kept on how many lawyers are or have been involved in claims against the Home Office. Such information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The way that damages payments are accounted for in the departmental accounts is seen in section 29, Losses and Special Payments, of the annual Resource Accounts. Also in the 2004-05 accounts there is a record in section 25, Contingent Liabilities, concerning the claims for compensation received by the Criminal Records Bureau. Ministers take responsibility for their own areas. Therefore ministerial responsibility for claims against the Home Office will depend on the particular area of the Department that the claim is made against.</p>

	<p pid="c.1778W.6/1">The Home Office undertakes a wide range of research activities that support the development of information-led policy, including surveys of public opinion that consider Home Office issues and its related areas of responsibility. The Department commissions such work only when it is justified by the specific needs of a particular policy or programme and when this is the most economic, efficient and effective way to achieve the purpose. Consulting and informing the public helps inform both policy formulation and the delivery of better quality public services. A table showing the available information on the subject matter of market and opinion research undertaken in 2004-05 has been placed in the Library. Where this is for a specific region this has been indicated in the table, otherwise the coverage is for England and Wales (except for immigration topics). Information on the costs of individual market and opinion research projects is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The Home Office has used external public relations companies to help deliver messages and advice to the public in press and magazines as part of integrated communication campaigns, often with a local focus. Campaigns include Year of the Volunteer, Holocaust Memorial Day, Sexual Offences Act, Crime and Anti Social Behaviour. A table showing spend on a monthly basis between September 2004 and October 2005 has also been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.1791W.0/1">The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) collect data at London borough level on domestic violence-related arrests broken down by offender's age and ethnicity (see tables). The MPS do not collect data at constituency level. The data demonstrates a steady increase in domestic violence-related arrests by the MPS. This is in line with the Home Office's objectives of increasing the reporting of domestic violence and police pro-activity in responding to domestic violence.</p>

	<p pid="c.1811W.2/1">The number of arrests for domestic violence in each London borough is only available from 2001-02. The total number of domestic violence arrests for each London borough are contained in the following table. The data demonstrate a steady increase in domestic violence-related arrests by the MPS. This is in line with the Home Office's objectives of increasing the reporting of domestic violence and police proactivity in responding to domestic violence. The CPS does not hold a historical record of domestic violence data for each London borough. The following data are for the number of domestic violence convictions as a proportion of domestic violence prosecutions in the jurisdiction of the London courts. 2005-06&mdash;2,503 convictions (51.7 per cent. of prosecutions). 2004-05&mdash;1,365 convictions (48.6 per cent. of prosecutions). Comparable figures are not held for years prior to 2004-05.</p>

	<p pid="c.1812W.2/1">The British Crime Survey (BCS) measures victimisation against adults living in private households in England and Wales. Domestic violence is included as part of the survey's core measure of violent crime. The results from the 2004-05 and 2005-06 BCS surveys have been published in the Home Office Statistical Bulletins 11/05 &quot;Crime in England and Wales 2004-05&quot; and 12/06 &quot;Crime in England and Wales 2005-06&quot;.

	<p pid="c.1814W.0/1">The drug driving offence under the Road Traffic Act 1988 is that of driving whilst unfit through a drug. Field impairment tests are intended to help an assessment of whether a driver is impaired and whether that impairment might be due to alcohol or a drug. Whether the drug is a controlled substance or obtained legally on prescription or over the counter is not relevant to the offence. There is no offence if the driver has a drug in his body but his driving ability is not impaired. We understand from the police that the tests are useful in making such an assessment. If impairment is suggested and it appears a drug may be responsible, the driver can be required to provide a specimen of blood or urine for laboratory analysis.</p>

	<p pid="c.1816W.2/1">Section 5 of the Drugs Act 2005 gave police forces in England and Wales the power to require a person believed to have swallowed a class A drug to undergo an x-ray or ultrasound scan in certain circumstances. The provision was commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>. Such a procedure may only be carried out by a suitably qualified person, and only at a hospital, a registered medical practitioner's surgery, or some other place used for medical purposes. It follows that no scanners are used solely by the police or solely for this purpose.</p>

	<p pid="c.1816W.8/1">Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, those sentenced to determinate sentences of four years or more are eligible for parole halfway through their sentence. If parole is not granted then release occurs at the two-thirds point of the sentence (or at a subsequent parole review if earlier). Numbers of prisoners recommended for parole are shown at table 10.4 of the offender management caseload statistics 2004, a copy of which can be found in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1816W.8/2">Prisoners sentenced to determinate terms of under four years under the 1991 Act are generally released automatically at the halfway point of their sentence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1816W.8/3">The Home Detention Curfew scheme (HDC) has been in operation since January 1999. Subject to meeting the eligibility criteria and passing a careful risk assessment, prisoners serving sentences of between three months and less than four years may be released up to four and a half months (135 days) early from prison subject to an electronically monitored curfew normally between 7pm and 7am. Although not its primary purpose, HDC plays an important role in managing the prison population by reducing overcrowding at the same time as improving resettlement opportunities for less serious offenders. Information on the numbers of prisoners released under Home Detention Curfew (HDC), can be found in tables 10.3 in the offender management caseload statistics 2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.1816W.8/4">The figures provided in the tables referred to have been drawn from administrative IT systems. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large-scale recording system, and so is not necessarily accurate to the last whole number.</p>
	<p pid="c.1816W.8/5">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced new arrangements for prison sentences. They apply only to offences committed on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase>. A new indeterminate public protection sentence was introduced. Those offenders judged to be dangerous, and who have committed serious sexual or violent offences, can be kept in prison until the Parole Board judges it is safe to release them. If they have committed less serious offences they may serve a determinate sentence followed by an extended period on licence after release of up to eight years for sexual offences and five years for violent offences. Other determinate sentence prisoners will be released automatically at the half-way point of their sentence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1816W.8/6">At any one time about 2,700 people&mdash;who would otherwise be filling prison places&mdash;are serving the last part of their sentence on HDC. The other early release arrangements described above inform projections of the prison population. Projections to 2011 have been produced for a range of scenarios and are published in Home Office statistical bulletin 10/05, a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library. Further projections will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.1817W.2/1">Prisoners sentenced to a determinate sentence of 12 months or over who fall to be released under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 are subject to probation supervision from the point at which they are released until their licence expiry date (which will extend up until the three-quarter point of their sentence). Prisoners recalled during that period are re-released at the discretion of the Parole Board and are normally subject to further probation supervision until the expiry of their sentence. Prisoners sentenced to a determinate sentence of 12 months or over under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 are subject to probation supervision from the point of release until the expiry of the sentence. Prisoners sentenced to an extended sentence are subject to probation supervision for the normal licence period as well as the extension period of the sentence. All prisoners subject to probation supervision are required to report to their supervising officer and may be required to live where directed and to comply with a range of other licence conditions which assist the Probation Service to monitor their behaviour in the community. Failure to comply can result in the offender's licence being revoked and the offender's being returned to custody. Determinate sentence prisoners serving a sentence of three months or over but less than four years may be released up to 135 days before their automatic release date on the home detention curfew scheme. These prisoners are subject to an electronically monitored curfew and liable to recall if they breach the terms of the curfew. Young offenders (those aged under 22 years upon their release) who are serving a sentence of less than 12 months and who fall to be released under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 receive a period of statutory supervision upon their release, which runs for three months (or until the offender reaches 22 years of age).</p>

	<p pid="c.1819W.2/1">The primary aim of the effective trial management programme is to reduce the number of ineffective trials by improving case preparation and progression from point of charge through to trial or earlier conclusion. By increasing the certainty of trial or hearing dates, the programme aims to bring more offences to justice and improve public confidence in the criminal justice system, particularly that of victims and witnesses. Effective trial management formed part of the wider criminal case management programme aimed at improving the end-to-end process, and which included the setting up of 165 Witness Support Units under the No Witness No Justice project, and the roll-out of the new charging scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1819W.2/2">Implementation of the effective trial management programme, together with the other two elements of the wider criminal case management programme, has been completed in all criminal justice areas across England and Wales. The indications are that reductions in headline ineffective trial rates have been achieved. Stakeholder confidence and satisfaction in the changes remains high, with effective trial management being a priority at local and national level.</p>

	<p pid="c.1820W.2/1">The setting up of a central register of ex-offenders was a key recommendation of Sir Michael Bichard's report into those working with children and vulnerable adults. This particular area of policy is led by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES).</p>
	<p pid="c.1820W.2/2">After considering all the options very carefully, including a licensing route, DfES introduced the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill in February 2006. This seeks to enact agreed proposals to establish a new central Vetting and Barring Scheme to ensure all those seeking jobs that give significant access to children or vulnerable adults are properly vetted. This approach has been consulted upon and endorsed by Sir Michael Bichard.</p>

We aim to release all eligible prisoners who pass the risk assessment but public safety will not be compromised; prisoners who are considered to present a risk to the public will not be released on HOC. Officials are investigating the reasons for the decreasing numbers of prisoners released on HOC. The factors that may contribute to the numbers released on HOC are complex and more work needs to be done to analyse the available information.</p>

	<p pid="c.1833W.0/2">The recently published document &quot;Rebalancing the criminal justice system in favour of the law-abiding majority&quot; reflected the results of a review carried out inside Government, informed by experience and research and by consultation with the frontline on how the Human Rights Act impacts on the criminal justice system. This revealed that the Human Rights Act provides a powerful framework to protect the rights of individuals but secure a proper balance with the safety of the law-abiding majority. It gives effect in UK law to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights to which we have been bound for over half a century.</p>
	<p pid="c.1833W.0/3">The document stated that where the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg interprets the Convention in a way which prevents the proper application of this balance (in particular the 1996 Chahal case where the Court found the UK Government could not consider the protection as a balancing factor when arguing the case for the deportation of a dangerous person) we will work with European partners to challenge this.</p>
	<p pid="c.1833W.0/4">The review also identified the need to do more to ensure that the Human Rights Act is not misinterpreted to prevent action to protect the public. In the light of recent cases such as the tragic murder of Naomi Bryant the Government are conducting a thorough review of how police, probation, parole and prison service balance public protection and individual and collective rights. If necessary we will legislate to ensure that public protection is given priority. In other cases, the review identified instances where organisations are over-cautious in their interpretation of competing rights. To combat this, we will make better practical advice available to practitioners on how rights should be balanced between offenders and the wider community and create an advice service to allow front-line practitioners to obtain fast online access to relevant legal resources.</p>
	<p pid="c.1833W.0/5">We will also institute a routine process of review through a scrutiny panel (made up of practitioners and lawyers) reporting to the National Criminal Justice Board (which includes relevant CJS Ministers) which will scrutinise the application of rights and ensure that the approach to administration is robust and fair and propose further changes to the law and guidance where it detects problems or imbalances.</p>

	<p pid="c.1836W.2/1">The Home Office works with the police and law enforcement agencies, including the Serious Organised Crime Agency, other Government Departments and the private sector to consider intelligence, information, surveys, and statistics which provide an indication of the scale of the problem of identity fraud. Evidence from CIFAS&mdash;the UK's Fraud Prevention Service&mdash;and our updated estimate of the cost of identity fraud to the UK economy, suggest that the problem has grown in recent years, but data covering the timeframe of this question are not yet available.</p>

	<p pid="c.1836W.5/1">In the view of the Identity and Passport Service (IPS) there are two principal factors for the reduction in the number of recorded cases of passport applications made in the identities of deceased persons detected. The figures for the number of passport applications detected in which a deceased identity has been used are a combination of infant and adult death cases. The IPS received the infant death data from July 2001 in a number of tranches. Retrospective checks of the index of passports issued using this data identified a number of passports issued in the identities of deceased children. These retrospective checks significantly increased the number of cases of deceased identity fraud detected and confirmed between 2001 and 2004. Since then the rate of detection is based on the number of new fraudulent applications being detected. Secondly, since IPS started using this data 184 people have been arrested for making fraudulent passport applications. 82 of these people have been convicted of offences and 34 deported. Although deterrence is very difficult to measure, it is likely that this success has deterred other criminals from submitting applications in the identities of deceased persons.</p>

	<p pid="c.1836W.8/1">The Government are concerned about identity fraud and there is ongoing activity within the EU and the G8 about security of travel documents and borders that will contribute to combating the problem. This includes the work at EU level on enhancing the security of travel and identity documents, such as ePassports (also known as biometric passports) that we began issuing in March 2006. The use of biometric information to link a person to a passport helps to detect counterfeit or manipulated documents and it confirms the identity of the individual.</p>

C-NOMIS is planned to replace the CRAMS case management system (which dates back to the mid-1990s) and is needed to support end-to-end offender management. Data are shared electronically between some of these systems already. Data sharing is planned to be extended as part of the development of C-NOMIS.

	<p pid="c.1843W.2/1">The main Home Office website for the public&mdash;<a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">www.homeoffice.gov.uk</a>&mdash;was redeveloped in October 2005. The information published on it follows a design and navigational structure that was heavily tested on actual public users of the website, who helped dictate its user-friendly structure. Indeed the main Home Office website was recognised in a recent independent report published by Precedent Communications as being the best of the 32 UK public sector websites they assessed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1843W.2/2">The main information on child protection on the internet is held in the 'police' area of the site as most of it is aimed at practitioners. But, in addition to this the information aimed at the general public is cross- referred on the main site. Under the top-level navigational title 'Crime &amp; victims', there is a section that describes what government is doing to reduce crime (which has a page dedicated specifically to internet crime) and another section that describes what members of the public can do to prevent crime (which in turn has a page on how to stay safe online).</p>
	<p pid="c.1843W.2/3">In both of these cases there is a wealth of useful information about how to keep children safe online, as well as a link under 'Related Documents' to a document called 'Guidance on how to search safely'.</p>
	<p pid="c.1843W.2/4">Also, using terms such as 'child protection' or 'internet safety' in the Home Office site search will readily find this key information.</p>
	<p pid="c.1843W.2/5">In addition about 70 per cent. of traffic to most websites comes from Google and other search engines, so someone interested in child safety online is very likely to type a set of keywords to find what they are looking for. If that person is very distinctly interested in the guidance issued by the Home Office on child safety online, and typed 'internet child safety, Home Office' into Google, the ThinkUKnow website and the Home Office Child Protection pages on the police website are the first two entries delivered.</p>

While the Home Secretary would normally make a written statement to the House, due to the timing of recess and the Council, and to make this most useful to you, I preferred to write after the pre-Council COREPER. There will, of course, be a written statement on discussion at the Council after recess. Due to other commitments, the Home Secretary will not be attending the Council, but Baroness Ashton, the Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, and I will be representing the UK. There will be a debate on the future of Europol with the presidency seeking to agree Council conclusions. While we are supportive of the Conclusions and in making Europol's legal instrument more flexible, we believe there is a need to consider the implications of changing the legal instrument before taking a final decision. The presidency will seek to reach a general approach on the European Evidence Warrant. Several issues remain to be resolved, including the terms of the ground for refusal based on territoriality and the concerns of those who wish to clarify the scope of the offences for which dual criminality will not apply. We are supportive of the presidency's proposals on the territoriality clause, which would allow us to refuse an EEW where the conduct concerned took place in this country and would be legal here. The UK does not share the concern of those who wish to provide clarification in the Framework Decision of the offences for which dual criminality will not apply but we are hopeful that a solution can be reached based on compromise proposals from the presidency. There will be discussion on the Framework Decision for the Mutual Recognition of Custodial Sentences within the EU. The presidency has put forward a proposal for the circumstances in which a prisoner could be transferred without his or the executing State's consent. The Government accepts the proposal, and believes that the prisoner's consent should not be required where the prisoner was to be transferred to the State in which he had his normal permanent residence. This has clear benefits for prisoners being able to serve sentences close to their communities and families and should have an impact in terms of likelihood to re-offend. There is likely to be a political discussion on the presidency proposal for a framework. Decision on certain procedural rights. The UK would like to continue discussion and at this stage and not to close down any options for taking forward the work. The UK continues to place a strong emphasis on practical measures to benefit citizens. The presidency intends to invite Council to agree the General Approach to the proposed Regulation establishing a European Small Claims procedure. This text will provide improved and cost-effective access to justice for European citizens in small claims across borders and is an initiative which the Government has welcomed. The presidency will be seeking to achieve agreement on the Draft Conclusions on the Organised Crime Threat Assessment (OCTA). This is the first annual OCTA, which replaces the Organised Crime Situation Report. The UK welcomes the first annual OCTA and supports the priorities as currently drafted. There will be a report on the implementation of the EU Counter Terrorism Strategy/Action Plan. We expect the presidency to reach a general approach on the Council Decision on Asset Recovery Offices. The UK negotiated changes in relation to civil recovery proceedings, so that the initiative relates both to confiscation and civil recovery cases. The UK supports measures to strengthen international cooperation concerning the recovery of the proceeds of crime. The Austrian presidency will be seeking to agree a general approach on the New Financial Frameworks general funding programme &quot;Security and Safeguarding Liberties&quot; and to one specific programme within the general programme on &quot;Fundamental Rights and Justice&quot;. The UK welcomes the presidency's efforts to secure agreement and considers the texts now represent a good basis for future funding activity. In the mixed committee formation, there will be a presentation on Common Visa Application Centres. Finally, there will be a political discussion on the outstanding issues on the regulation on the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and the presidency will be hoping to resolve these. The UK does not participate in this Regulation. However we feel the text needs to be more explicit on access for asylum authorities. In the margins there will be presentations on reinforcing the EU emergency and crisis response capacities and the May 2006 external relations ministerial conference in Vienna and Sweden will raise security arrangements in relation to the World Cup and the list of safe countries for the purposes of asylum.&quot;</p>

Following the amnesty, many forces are focusing on enforcement operations, targeting those who carry knives without good reason. Operation Shield, run by the British Transport Police, continues to operate at mainline and underground stations using search technology to detect people carrying weapons on the transport network.

	<p pid="c.1850W.14/1">There is no single percentage discount figure available on hotel bookings. The Home Office, through its appointed contractor, negotiates rates for individual hotels or hotel chains subject to city location. All hotels offer their standard rate (the rack rate) which will then be discounted either to a Government rate available to all individuals carrying out work on behalf of the Home Office or other public sector bodies or, subject to there being sufficient volume room usage, special rates for individual departments. Generally the Home Office achieve savings on average of 30 per cent. on standard rates.</p>

Foreign nationals who visit the UK are not required to inform the authorities when they leave the country. It is not possible to obtain the figures of Nigerian citizens who arrive in the UK with a visitor's visa. Scheduled to commence in 2008, the e-Borders programme will strengthen and modernise our border control including providing an electronic record of all those entering and leaving the UK.</p>

	<p pid="c.1860W.0/1">The Home Office along with the Department for Communities and Local Government is developing the Respect agenda to assist local authorities in dealing with nuisance neighbours. The Respect Action Plan recognises the important role social landlords play in tackling antisocial behaviour, including local housing authorities. We have provided local authorities in their housing role with a wide range of tools and powers to tackle antisocial behaviour, including injunctive powers, demoted tenancies, antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) and acceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs). We have encouraged and supported them through the Together campaign in delivering preventative approaches, providing support to victims and witnesses, and taking enforcement action.</p>
	<p pid="c.1860W.0/2">As part of the Respect programme we will also intervene with highly problematic families that account for a disproportionate amount of antisocial behaviour. We will also establish Family Intervention Projects in 50 areas by the end of 2006 to address the causes of their behaviour, alongside supervision and enforcement tools to provide them with the incentives to change. In some communities, we know that there are premises which are a constant focus for antisocial behaviour and we will be consulting on a new power to allow the closure of any residential or licensed premises for a set period, regardless of tenure, that is causing significant, persistent and serious nuisance to local communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1860W.0/3">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has also introduced a number of extra powers for local authorities to deal with nuisance neighbours under the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005. The statutory nuisance regime can already be used to deal with noise.</p>

	<p pid="c.1877W.2/1">The Government introduced a measure in 2003 to record the amount of time that police officers spend on frontline duties in order to help to maximise the time spent on their core roles of preventing and reducing crime. More police officer time was spent on front line duties in 2004-05 (64.1 per cent.) than in 2003-04 (63.6 per cent.) and we are determined to see this improvement continue, with police authorities setting robust targets for improvement. The Home Office expects that the police service can increase this to a national average of around 72 per cent. in 2008. This will be a gain in time on frontline duties equivalent to an extra 12,000 police officers. These frontline duties include providing a visible patrolling presence in communities&mdash;a role which has been greatly enhanced by the creation of Police Community Support Officers, whose core function it is to provide high visibility reassurance policing to local communities, primarily on foot patrol. The Government have also been working with the Association of Chief Police Officers since 2002 to reduce the burden of paperwork. Already we have:</p>
	<p pid="c.1877W.2/2" class="indent">made nearly 9,000 forms obsolete across all 43 forces;</p>
	<p pid="c.1877W.2/3" class="indent">nearly 125,000 fixed penalty notice tickets were issued in 2005&mdash;around 90 minutes saved per ticket;</p>
	<p pid="c.1877W.2/4" class="indent">207 Livescan Units, which enable electronic fingerprint images to be taken from people instantly, in 37 forces. This saves 7.5 minutes per arrest over ink and roller (5 minutes as opposed to 12.5 minutes);</p>
	<p pid="c.1877W.2/5" class="indent">the introduction of street bail in 2003 enables an officer to grant bail elsewhere other than a police station, remain on front-line operational duties and better plan the investigation to meet operational needs; and</p>
	<p pid="c.1877W.2/6" class="indent">the use of designated (police staff) detention officers and investigation officers at police stations to take forward arrest processing and case preparation thereby enabling operational officers to return to front-line duties.</p>

These are only available for 2002-03 and later years. To avoid imposing an excessive administrative burden on forces, the Home Office does not request these data at Basic Command Unit (BCD) level, so numbers of front line officers are not available for Milton Keynes specifically. They have instead been provided for the relevant force (Thames Valley). Numbers of officers at BCD level are available only from 2002 onwards, as they were not collected by the Home Office's Research, Data and Statistics Directorate before this time; again, where figures for Milton Keynes specifically are not available they have been provided for Thames Valley. It should be noted that non-front line functions include call-centres, training, custody suites and criminal justice units for the processing of cases.</p>

The majority of these authorisations were in respect of short-term assistance, on a wide range of matters and to numerous countries. Longer term deployments are mostly in the form of support to international Peace Support Operations (PSOs), and last up to a year. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-24">24 July 2006</phrase> the United Kingdom had 140 serving police officers working in Peace Support Operations in Bosnia (11); Kosovo (58); Iraq (21); Jordan (47); Sudan (2) and Afghanistan (1). Of these 140 police officers, 67 are from forces in England and Wales. Those forces are: Avon and Somerset; Cheshire; Cleveland; Cumbria; Devon and Cornwall; Durham; Dyfed Powys; Essex; Greater Manchester; Hertfordshire; Humberside; Kent; Lancashire; Lincolnshire; Metropolitan; Merseyside; Norfolk; Northumbria; North Wales; Nottinghamshire; South Yorkshire; Surrey; Sussex; Staffordshire; Thames Valley; West Mercia; West Yorkshire and Wiltshire. The other serving officers on PSOs are from the Ministry of Defence Police, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and Scottish police forces. 10 other longer term deployments have been authorised since <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase> for officers from forces in England and Wales. All last for a year or more. Three authorisations were in respect of assistance to Trinidad and Tobago by officers from Wiltshire and Cambridgeshire. In respect of the remaining seven authorisations, there are sensitivities which mean I am unable to reveal further details of their deployment.</p>

	<p pid="c.1885W.5/1">Airwave provides modern, integrated, secure and efficient radio communications for the police service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1885W.5/2">The Airwave service had to pass a rigorous series of tests before being accepted by a force as being ready for service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1885W.5/3">The Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) continually evaluates the performance of Airwave through a national service support structure, managing any arising issues jointly with the service provider, O2 Airwave.</p>
	<p pid="c.1885W.5/4">Police communications at special events, such as the G8 summit at Gleneagles in 2005, have been facilitated by the adoption of a common technology and since the service first started rolling out in 2001 new features such GPS location sensing and direct access to the police national computer have become available to benefit the safety and effectiveness of individual police officers. The use of Airwave radios has meant improved coverage and clarity compared to the old analogue radios.</p>
	<p pid="c.1885W.5/5">The decisions of the ambulance and fire services to move to Airwave will enhance the capabilities of all three emergency services to work together, both on a day-to-day basis and during major incidents.</p>
	<p pid="c.1885W.5/6">As part of its operational benefits strategy, PITO is in the process of carrying out baseline reviews using several forces in order to gauge the benefits that Airwave has brought to police users.</p>
	<p pid="c.1885W.5/7">Currently over 160,000 police officers are using Airwave and 50 forces have fully migrated to the new service. The remaining forces, the Metropolitan police and North Wales, are in the process of migration and will have fully migrated by the summer of 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.1886W.2/1">No curfew notices have been issued under this power as no local child curfew scheme has been established. However other powers have been introduced and used. My answer on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-05">5 December 2005</phrase>, <i> Official Report</i>, column 968W explained that section 30 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 provides the police with a power to disperse groups and remove under-16s to their place of residence, within designated areas. The Act also inserted paragraph 4A into Schedule 4 to the Police Reform Act 2002 to allow designated community support officers to use these powers. These powers came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-20">20 January 2004</phrase>. From a Home Office data collection exercise, we estimated that 809 areas were designated between January 2004 and June 2005. Police officers and community support officer dispersed 14,375 people from the 293 areas where data were available. They also removed 520 young people under 16 to their place of residence from 236 areas where data were available. We do not hold the information on whether these powers were exercised by police officers or community support officers.</p>

York is a Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) area and data at CDRP level have only been collected centrally since 1999-2000. Since 1986, there have been two major changes to the way in which crime is recorded. The effect of the extended coverage and the change in counting rules in 1998 was to artificially increase recorded violent crime nationally by more than 80 per cent. while it is estimated that the effect of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002 caused a further 20 per cent. increase in recorded violent crime in its first year.</p>

PSO 8460 &quot;Conduct and Discipline&quot; describes the procedures to be followed where allegations of bullying require formal investigation and identifies bullying as gross misconduct which, depending on the circumstances of the case, may result in dismissal from the Service.

	<p pid="c.1923W.2/2">Any offender sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment or more is subject to probation supervision and to licence conditions. The offender must adhere to any conditions attached to the licence, including standard conditions set in all cases, which require him to remain in contact with his supervising officer and live at a suitable address. Any offender in breach of licence conditions risks recall to prison. Although it is not possible from national data to categorise the breaches in question, the probation service has achieved a significant improvement in performance in relation to all breaches of licence conditions. Its target is to enforce 90 per cent. of breaches overall within 10 working days. In 1997-98 the enforcement rate for licences stood at 34 per cent. It is now 93 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1923W.2/3">In addition, any offender subject to sex offender registration requirements is required to notify to the police a home address within three days of leaving prison, and to notify any subsequent change of address within three days of the change thereafter while still subject to registration. Failure to supply that information, or supplying false information, is an offence punishable by up to five years imprisonment. Registration requirements were strengthened recently by the Sexual Offences Act 2003.</p>

	<p pid="c.1924W.2/1">The measure records subsequent contact with the criminal justice system by offenders who were under probation service supervision at a particular point in time. It is based on matching offenders who are recorded as being under supervision at the end of a given quarter with the Police National Computer (PNC). Once offenders are matched, automated programmes search for whether the offenders had an entry on the PNC in the two months following the end of the quarter. The PNC entries could be for (i) arrest, charge, summons, or report, and/or (ii) conviction, and/or (iii) caution. It does not show weekly data, only monthly summaries. The bulk of the entries are not proven offences; an arrest or charge cannot be equated with admission or proof of guilt. These data are in development, and are released as experimental statistics. At the moment, they have not been assessed as fit for purpose and could be inaccurate or misleading. The assessment of accuracy and fitness will proceed during the financial year 2006-07.</p>

Under the scheme the police are able to issue persons committing specified minor offences with a fixed penalty notice. No admission of guilt is required and payment of the penalty discharges all liability for the offence.

However, for the last two years the Home Office Anti-social Behaviour Unit has carried out a survey of Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in England and Community Safety Partnerships in Wales asking about their actions taken to tackle antisocial behaviour. From those who responded to the surveys the results are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1927W.2/2">5,094 acceptable behaviour contracts were issued from <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-01">1 October 2003</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-30">30 September 2004</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.1927W.2/4">A Home Office data collection exercise carried out in July 2005 estimated that between January 2004 and June 2005 809 areas were designated as dispersal areas. From April 2006 the Home Office will be collecting information on dispersal powers on a quarterly basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.1927W.2/5">In 2004, 12,818 penalty notices were issued in London and provisional data shows that 17,915 were rolled out to all police forces in England and Wales during 2004-05. It is not possible to provide details of how many penalty notices for disorder were issued in each of the five London boroughs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1936W.5/1">Information on the average length of time served by prisoners on non-life determinate sentences can be found in table 10.1 of the &quot;Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2003 and 2004&quot;, and tables 3.13, 3.14, and 4.11 of &quot;Prison Statistics in England and Wales 2000 to 2002&quot;. Copies of these publications are available in the House of Commons Library. The figures provided in these tables were drawn from administrative IT systems. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large-scale recording system, and so is not necessarily accurate to the last whole number. Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, those sentenced to determinate sentences of four years or more are eligible for parole halfway through their sentence. If parole is not granted then release occurs at the two-thirds point of the sentence (or at a subsequent parole review if earlier). Prisoners sentenced to determinate terms of under four years under the 1991 Act are generally released automatically at the half way point of their sentence. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced new arrangements for prison sentences. They apply only to offences committed on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase>. A new indeterminate public protection sentence was introduced. Those offenders judged to be dangerous, and who have committed serious sexual or violent offences, can be kept in prison until the Parole Board judges it is safe to release them. If they have committed less serious offences they may serve a determinate sentence followed by an extended period on licence after release of up to eight years for sexual offences and five years for violent offences. Other determinate sentence prisoners will be released automatically at the halfway point of their sentence. The Home Detention Curfew scheme (HDC) has been in operation since January 1999. Subject to meeting the eligibility criteria and passing a careful risk assessment, prisoners serving sentences of between three months and less than four years may be released up to four and a half months (135 days) early from prison subject to an electronically monitored curfew normally between 7 pm and 7 am. Information on the numbers of prisoners released under Home Detention Curfew (HDC) can be found in table 10.3 in the &quot;Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2004&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="c.1938W.8/2">Schedule 10 to the Police and Justice Bill will enable the Secretary of State to confer a new function on police authorities &quot;to secure that arrangements are made for (their) force to co-operate with other police forces whenever necessary or expedient&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.1938W.8/3">In addition, I will shortly be writing to police forces and police authorities setting out the next steps in the light of the decision not to proceed with enforced police force mergers. I will be inviting forces and authorities to consider how improvements in protective services might be achieved through greater collaboration and co-operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1938W.8/4">I have also dedicated an extra &pound;33 million extra this year and &pound;65 million the year after to expand the police specialist counter terrorism capacity outside London. This is in addition to an extra &pound;30 million this year and &pound;45 million next year for the Metropolitan police. This will help strengthen the police service's intelligence and investigative capability and capacity and complements the additional funding awarded to the security and intelligence services.</p>

	<p pid="c.1941W.2/1">There are no plans to introduce procedures to check whether candidates for public office are subject to the notification requirements of part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which are often known as the sex offenders register.</p>
	<p pid="c.1941W.2/2">The notification requirements serve a specific purpose: to ensure that the police are kept informed of convicted and cautioned sex offenders' personal details by obliging offenders to notify information to the police, notify the police of any changes to that information and re-confirm their details at least once a year. This is to assist the police and probation services in the management of any risks offenders may pose and in the detection of sexual crime. They do not exist to punish offenders or bar them from certain occupations or posts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1941W.2/3">Under the Local Government Act 1972, however, an individual will be disqualified from being a local councillor if he receives a conviction carrying a prison sentence of over three months (suspended or not) if convicted of an offence within five years before election. Similarly, under the Representation of the People Act 1981, a person found guilty and sentenced or ordered to be imprisoned or detained for more than one year is disqualified from membership of the House of Commons while detained in pursuance of the sentence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1941W.2/4">Moreover, the fact that a sex offender is a councillor or MP would not relieve the police and probation services' responsibility to manage any risks the individual may pose. They would include in their risk assessments any details of the individual's duties and if it was thought that they posed a risk of serious sexual harm, then the police could apply for a sexual offences prevention order (SOPO) to impose prohibitions on the individual's behaviour.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-09-04c.84914.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-09-04c.1948W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" speakername="Vernon Coaker" colnum="1948W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060904/text/60904w0071.htm#0609077017375">
	<p pid="c.1948W.2/1">The information requested is given in the following tables.</p>
	<p pid="c.1948W.2/2">Since 1997 there have been a number of significant changes to the way that sex offences are defined and recorded by the police. These make it impossible to compare in a direct way recent figures with those from earlier years. Changes include:</p>
	<p pid="c.1948W.2/3" class="indent">(i) A revision to the counting rules for recorded crime and the expanded coverage which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="1998-04-01">1 April 1998</phrase>;</p>
	<p pid="c.1948W.2/4" class="indent">(ii) The revised detections guidance issued in April 1999;</p>
	<p pid="c.1948W.2/5" class="indent">(iii) The introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in April 2002;and;</p>
	<p pid="c.1948W.2/6" class="indent">(iv) The Sexual Offences Act 2003 in May 2004, which altered the definition and coverage of sexual offences, in particular, indecent exposure is now classified as a sexual offence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1948W.2/7">The existing statistical evidence suggests that both the changes to detections guidance and the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) had a marked impact on the reduction in detection rates for rapes since 1997. The Home Office is currently researching in detail recent changes in detection rates in rape cases in England and Wales, including variation between forces.</p>
	<p pid="c.1948W.2/8">In 2002 the Government published the &quot;Rape Action Plan&quot;, in response to the thematic inspection into the investigation and prosecution of rape cases. A follow-up inspection took place earlier this year, and its findings and recommendations will be published in the autumn. This will inform us how far the recommendations of the &quot;Rape Action Plan&quot; have been implemented by the police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).</p>
	<p pid="c.1948W.2/9">&quot;Guidance on the Investigation of Serious Sexual Offences&quot; was published by Centrex and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) in 2005. The guidance presents detailed recommendations for all stages of an investigation, from when the crime is reported to when an offender is identified and charged.</p>

	<p pid="c.1958W.2/3">It is difficult to quantify the number of child victims of trafficking because traffickers go to great lengths to conceal their exploitation of children.

	<p pid="c.1972W.12/50">In January 2006, the Department published a report entitled 'Mathematics and Science in Secondary Schools: The Deployment of Teachers and Support Staff to Deliver the Curriculum'. The research, sponsored by the Department, was conducted during 2005 by the National Foundation for Education Research. Their sample survey found that an estimated 66 per cent. of maths A-level curriculum time was delivered by a teacher with a degree in maths, 15 per cent. by a teacher with a PGCE incorporating maths and 13 per cent. by a teacher with a B.Sc, BA with QTS or a B.Ed in maths. For further mathematics, an estimated 73 per cent. of curriculum time was delivered by a teacher with a degree in maths, 13 per cent. by a teacher with a PGCE incorporating maths and 10 per cent. by a teacher with a B.Sc, BA with QTS or a B.Ed in maths.</p>
	<p pid="c.1972W.12/51">For biology A-level, the study found that an estimated 61 per cent. of curriculum time was delivered by a teacher with a biology degree and 31 per cent. by a teacher with a degree in another (including general) science. For chemistry A-level, an estimated 61 per cent. of curriculum time was delivered by a teacher with a chemistry degree and 26 per cent. by a teacher with a degree in another (including general) science. Finally, for physics A-level, an estimated 53 per cent. of curriculum time was delivered by a teacher with a physics degree and 13 per cent. by a teacher with a degree in another (including general science). For physics it is useful to note that an estimated 17 per cent. of the curriculum time was delivered by a teacher with a B.Sc, BA with QTS or B.Ed in science, and 13 per cent. by a teacher with a PGCE in science.</p>

	<p pid="c.1976W.2/1">The national minimum standards for fostering services make clear that proper consideration should be given to a child's racial, religious, cultural and linguistic background when making any decisions regarding the care of that child. In cases where a child is placed with carers who do not share his or her ethnicity or culture, the standards state that the responsible authority should provide the foster family with additional training, support and information to enable the child to receive the best possible care and to develop a positive understanding of his or her heritage. It is for fostering providers themselves to determine the most appropriate arrangements for doing so. Volume 3 of the 'Children Act Guidance and Regulations' does, however, recognise that</p>
	<p pid="c.1976W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;the religion of foster parents [...] may in some cases be more important than their ethnic origin.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.1976W.2/3">With regard to adoption, the 2005 statutory guidance on the Adoption and Children Act 2002 requires adoption agencies to consider the child's religious and cultural upbringing as well as any wishes and feelings which the child's parent or guardian may have about the child's religious and cultural upbringing. The guidance also requires agencies to provide the child with counselling, in a manner which is sensitive to the child's religious beliefs.</p>

	<p pid="c.1976W.5/1">The Government have carefully considered the Practitioners' Group's conclusions about a National Behaviour Charter, in consultation with key partners in the education service represented on the Ministerial Stakeholders' Group on School Behaviour and Attendance. The Stakeholders' Group was mindful of the fact that events have moved on since the Practitioners' Group reported, particularly with the clear new statutory framework for disciplining pupils in the Education and Inspections Bill. It was therefore concluded that the role of a National Behaviour Charter might more appropriately be fulfilled through the guidance which my Department is preparing for schools on the relevant provisions in the Education and Inspections Bill.</p>

	<p pid="c.1978W.2/1">Research evidence, such as my Department's effective provision of pre-school education (EPPE) study, shows that the quality of the learning environment in the home (where parents are actively engaged in activities with children such as teaching songs and nursery rhymes, playing with letters and numbers, and reading to the child) promoted intellectual development, including literacy skills, in children at the end of key stage 1 compared to children whose parents did not engage in such activities. In fact the quality of the home learning environment is a more significant factor than parent's social class and education levels. A review of the literature on parents' involvement in their children's education funded by my Department (Desforges and Abouchaar, 2003) also found that such parental activities in the home were associated with early literature and communication and skills development. In addition to the actual activities, the review found that the values a parent has, such as enthusiasm for learning and a positive parenting style, are associated with improved outcomes for the child such as increased self-perception as a learner, more motivation and self-esteem and higher educational aspirations.

	<p pid="c.1984W.5/1">In the main, schools are very safe places and the majority of pupils have never carried a knife. It is a criminal offence to carry an offensive weapon on school premises and to assist schools with those pupils who choose to ignore the law, we propose a power in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill to enable schools to search, without consent, pupils they suspect are carrying a knife or other weapon. Where schools have suspicions they can call the police, and should do so if they believe pupils or staff are at risk of serious harm. Schools and local police can agree a Safer School Partnership to prevent crime in and around a school. Programmes to improve behaviour; curriculum opportunities for learning about responsibility, conflict, and safety, and other DfES programmes for young people and parenting also help.</p>

	<p pid="c.1993W.0/1">Up to and including 2005, data on non-core teacher assessments was collected as an aggregate value in a variety of formats including paper forms. For 2006 NAA have changed the data collection so that all teacher assessment data including non-core is collected at an individual pupil level. The data is collected electronically alongside core subjects using the Common Transfer File format (CTF). The CTF is the same standard that is used for transferring pupil data from one school to another. The change to pupil level data has also reduced the burden on schools by removing the need to transcribe and manipulate the source data. The NAA supports the Protocol on Data Sharing and Rationalisation in the Schools Sector and recognises a collective responsibility to minimise the burdens of data collection on schools and local authorities and to ensure that data collected is used effectively to support individual learning, whole school improvement and system-wide capacity building.</p>
	<p pid="c.1993W.0/2">Errors can occur at any stage of the data collection process. Our investigations indicate that most of the errors in SFR 32/2005 were in the data supplied by schools or due to data being supplied in the wrong format.</p>

These estimates are approximate as significant changes in the fee level would be likely to have an effect on assumptions. The Government's policy is to have income- contingent loans where repayments are tied to salary (i.e. graduates make repayments of 9 per cent. of salary in excess of &pound;15,000 per annum) and the repayment period is not pre-determined, so estimates based on fixed repayment periods of five and 10 years have not been made.

	<p pid="c.1996W.3/3">At the G8 summit, there were long discussions on the situation in the Middle East, including Gaza. Leaders agreed a statement, which outlines the steps required of both sides to create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of violence in the Middle East, and to lay the foundations for a more permanent solution in the region. The UK has pushed strongly for a Temporary International Mechanism to help meet the basic needs of Palestinians. The European Community has committed &euro;105 million to it. G8 leaders decided that the mechanism should be expanded immediately to provide wider assistance to the people of Gaza. We are working closely with the Quartet and others to ensure that this happens.</p>

	<p pid="c.1997W.0/2">The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 require employers to provide reasonable working temperatures for employees in indoor workplaces, including those working in schools. The Regulations are accompanied by an Approved Code of Practice and guidance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1997W.0/3">Since April 2005, the HSE has made available general guidance on temperatures and thermal comfort for all indoor workplaces on the HSE website: <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/temperature/thermal/index.htm">http://www.hse.gov.uk/temperature/thermal/index.htm</a>. This guidance applies to employees and staff working in schools, but excludes transport such as school buses.</p>
	<p pid="c.1997W.0/4">Minimum temperatures for classrooms are given as 18&ordm;C in the Education (School Premises) Regulations, SI No2, 1999, which are a responsibility of the Department for Education and Skills. DfES has recently issued guidance about maximum and minimum temperatures in classrooms on the popular questions website: <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/popularquestions/">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/popularquestions/</a> This explains that:</p>
	<p pid="c.1997W.0/5" class="indent">&quot;heat stress and dehydration can be serious problems at temperatures above 35&ordm;C so that should be regarded as the maximum reasonable temperature for prolonged periods of time in school classrooms. This temperature is above comfort temperatures but healthy children should be able to cope with this if they are given generous supplies of cool water to drink. More sensitive children may experience problems at much lower temperatures and staff need to watch for signs of heat stress at temperatures above 28&ordm;C.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.1997W.0/6">We are not aware of any specific guidance issued in respect of temperatures in school buses.</p>

The UK Climate Change Programme 2006 and the recently published Energy Review, set out the Government's plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in respect of the 2010, 2020 and 2050 climate change targets and includes a number of co-ordinated policies and measures from across Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid="c.2012W.8/2">We are also working to set up an Office for Climate Change in the near future that will take up the drive for progress on the climate change agenda. The Office will have an important contribution to make and will be a shared resource, reporting to Ministers across Government.</p>

	<p pid="c.2012W.14/2">The West Midlands Region covers an area of 13,000km<sup>(2)</sup> and comprises two major conurbations&mdash;Birmingham, Coventry and the Black Country in the centre, and Stoke on Trent and the Potteries to the north. Around 80 per cent. of the land area is in agricultural or forestry use, with the Region having a greater proportion of Grades 1, 2 and 3 land (Agricultural Land Classification of England and Wales) than the average for England.</p>
	<p pid="c.2012W.14/3">The region has four Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), three Environmentally Sensitive Areas, 14 National Nature Reserves, 60 Local Nature Reserves, 19 Special Areas of conservation, one Special Protection Area, 19 Ramsar sites (Wetlands of International Importance) and 439 Sites of Special Scientific Interest. It is covered by 26 Character Areas, which describe and define its natural and man-made landscape.</p>
	<p pid="c.2012W.14/4">Approximately 30 per cent. of the agricultural land in the West Midlands is managed under the provisions of agri-environment schemes. There are currently 4,890 live agreements and the annual spend totals &pound;27.63 million. Coverage is increasing annually towards the target of 70 per cent. of the land to be included in entry level schemes by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.2012W.14/5">The formation of Natural England, following the Rural Strategy 2004, brings together English Nature, parts of the Countryside Agency, and the environment and land-based activity of the Rural Development Service. The new agency will help land managers to improve biodiversity, landscape, access, recreation and sustainable food and farming.</p>
	<p pid="c.2012W.14/6">In the financial year 2006-07, Natural England have offered a total of &pound;890,000 in the form of grants for core funding and projects in the West Midlands. This includes 240,000 from the Sustainability Development Fund to the four Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty: Cannock Chase, Malvern Hills, Shropshire Hills and Wye Valley.</p>
	<p pid="c.2012W.14/7">In 2005-06 the Environment Agency habitat creation projects covered a total of 103 hectares in the West Midlands; these received funding totalling &pound;147,000. These projects form part of the Environment Agency's work on Flood Risk Management. They endeavour to maximise the impact of its investment by protecting properties from flooding as well as enhancing the natural environment, in line with the DEFRA strategy, &quot;Making Space for Water&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="c.2013W.2/1">There is considerable overlap in the geographic areas to which these designations apply. Moreover, funding from a variety of different multi objective mechanisms is available in these areas, in support of all these designations but also for other purposes not listed here. These mechanisms include, for example, the various agri-environment schemes which are funded by my Department, as well as wider funding such as lottery programmes and EU funds.</p>
	<p pid="c.2013W.2/2">Total funding from these sources in support of each of these designations cannot therefore be calculated. However, it is possible to identify the following DEFRA funding via its grant in aid to the different delivery bodies involved, which is exclusively in support of one or more of the different designations listed.</p>
	<p pid="c.2013W.2/3">English Nature's designated sites programme supports its work on Sites of special scientific interest, national nature reserves, biosphere reserves and marine nature reserves. The programme covers the cost of their work associated with these different designations including the management of land owned by English Nature and management agreements with landowners. The spend relating to this programme is set out in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="c.2015W.3/1">The Local Government Act 1988 repealed the old dog licence on the grounds that it cost more to administer than the revenue it produced. Recent information shows that there has been very little change in the population of dogs and the number of straying dogs since 1988. There is no evidence to suggest that the opinion of dog owners has changed and that any new scheme introduced would be adopted.</p>
	<p pid="c.2015W.3/2">We currently have no plans to reintroduce a dog licence, or to introduce requirements for dogs to be microchipped. Responsible dog owners voluntarily undertake having their pets permanently identified and registered on nationwide databases. We also continue to support voluntary identification. The effectiveness of dog licensing was also limited by the fact that in the last year licenses were administered, only 44 per cent. of owners applied for their licence.</p>

	<p pid="c.2016W.0/2">Information on the cultivation of energy crops is only available for crops planted under DEFRA's Energy Crops Scheme. The first plantings were in 2001 for short rotation coppice (which is harvested on a three-year cycle) and 2002 for miscanthus (harvested annually from the second year). Based on actual plantings from 2001-05 and forecasts prepared in 2005 for plantings in 2006-09, based on industry estimates at that time, and assuming average yields of 9 and 14 tonnes per hectare for short rotation coppice and miscanthus respectively, the estimated yields are as follows:</p>

	<p pid="c.2016W.0/13">However, actual planting will depend on commercial decisions by growers and is likely to be influenced by the nature of contracts and support which are available.</p>
	<p pid="c.2016W.0/14">The Government currently provides support to help establish energy crops, develop supply chains, and create end-use markets. The Government set up a Biomass Task Force in 2004 to identify the barriers to developing biomass energy, including energy crops, and to recommend ways to overcome the problems. The Government's response to the Task Force report was published in April 2006 and sets out 12 key initiatives and over 60 associated actions to help realise optimum use of biomass as a resource. These measures include agreement in principle to support energy crops under the new Rural Development Programme for England, further grant support for biomass supply chains, a capital grant scheme for biomass boilers, a commitment to consider using biomass in the Government estate, and the establishment of a new biomass energy centre to provide expert information and advice to industry and the public. We also intend to publish a UK Biomass Strategy in the coming year.</p>

	<p pid="c.2017W.2/1">For a number of years now we have been actively seeking to raise awareness about the European Union's Protected Food Name Scheme and encourage more UK applications. The scheme provides a means for farmers to add value to their produce and market it in a more imaginative way, particularly given consumers' growing interest in food with a clear regional provenance. Promotion of the scheme forms part of our wider strategy of support for the quality regional food sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.2017W.2/2">DEFRA has written to a large number of trade associations and producers to remind them of the economic benefits to producers of achieving protected name status. We have also written to a large number of trade associations and producers to remind them of the economic benefits to producers of achieving protected name status.</p>
	<p pid="c.2017W.2/3">In addition, the Department has held positive meetings with a number of key organisations including the National Farmers Union, the Country Land and Business Association, the Meat and Livestock Commission, the British Pig Association and the Milk Development Council to discuss possible applications.</p>
	<p pid="c.2017W.2/4">We have also commissioned research to determine the awareness, perception, and attitudes towards, the EU protected food name schemes among UK retailers available on the DEFRA website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/foodname/reglocal/adasresearchpdo.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/foodname/reglocal/adasresearchpdo.pdf</a> and contributed to press articles promoting the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.2017W.2/5">Finally, we have tasked Food from Britain with working with the Regional Food Groups and producers to raise awareness of the scheme and encourage more applications.</p>
	<p pid="c.2017W.2/6">I am pleased to say that all this effort is bearing fruit. There are currently 36 UK products registered including Stilton Cheese (PDO), Scotch Beef (PGI), Welsh Lamb (PGI), Cornish Clotted Cream (PDO) and Arbroath Smokies (PGI). A further 24 applications are currently being considered.</p>

	<p pid="c.2028W.5/2">Local authorities in England collected an estimated 798 thousand tonnes of organic material (kitchen and garden waste) for composting in 2000-01, 940 thousand tonnes in 2001-02, 1.2 million tonnes in 2002-03 and 1.4 million tonnes in 2003-04. It is provisionally estimated that this has increased to around two million tonnes in 2004-05. This organic waste is collected for centralised composting schemes from households via kerbside schemes or taken by householders to Civic Amenity sites.</p>
	<p pid="c.2028W.5/3">Composting is high up the waste hierarchy and is supported by a range of policies that promote sustainable waste management. Composting, including home composting of kitchen and garden waste, is also likely to play an increasingly important role in diverting biodegradable waste from landfill in line with the Government's waste strategy objectives and obligations under the Landfill Directive.</p>
	<p pid="c.2028W.5/4">The Waste and Resources Action programme (WRAP) indicate that over 34 per cent. households participate in home composting schemes, with 23 per cent. of British households composting both kitchen and garden waste. WRAP is working with local authorities and other partners to improve the uptake of home composting through the distribution of one million home composting bins to households across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.2028W.5/5">No estimate has been made by the Department on the level of use of food waste digesters for kitchen waste, nor has any assessment been made of the use, (or barriers to the use) of these, or home composters. Advice and best practice for home composting is available from a range of organisations including WRAP: <a href="http://www.recyclenow.com/home_composting/">http://www.recyclenow.com/home_composting/</a>.</p>

	<p pid="c.2030W.0/1" qnum="81091">To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent assessment he has made of the extent to which the Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) is adequately fulfilling its statutory remit in respect of all water companies, with particular reference to Thames Water; what measures he is able to take to ensure that it does so; and if he will make a statement.</p>

	<p pid="c.2030W.1/1">Ofwat is responsible for setting leakage targets and has powers to deal with poor performance.</p>
	<p pid="c.2030W.1/2">Should Ofwat conclude that the failure of a water company to manage leakage constitutes a failure of the duty under section 37 of the Water Industry Act to maintain an efficient water supply system, it has two options for regulatory action. It has powers to initiate enforcement action under section 18 of the Water Industry Act to require the water company to take specified steps to reduce the level of leakage. Since April 2005, it also has powers to impose a financial penalty under section 22A of the Water Industry Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.2030W.1/3">I have discussed with Ofwat the issues of leakage and enforcement options available, but Ofwat is independent of Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="c.2030W.1/4">Following Thames Water's failure to meet its leakage, Ofwat announced it has secured a legally binding undertaking, committing Thames Water to &pound;150 million of additional investment in replacing leaking mains. This is more than double the maximum imposable fine and will come from the shareholder, not the bill payer. Ofwat has also set revised leakage targets for the period up to 2010 to get the company's leakage reduction back on track and to take leakage down to 720 megalitres/day by 2009-10 rather than the old target of 725 megalitres/day. It is right that the consumer does not bear the burden of the increased investment needed for Thames Water to deal with its failure to meet its leakage targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.2030W.1/5">Ofwat will closely monitor the company's progress. Subsequent failures will lead to further enforcement action, including fines if appropriate, from 2007. Ofwat will not hesitate to use its tough powers against any company that clearly fails to meet its responsibilities to consumers.</p>

	<p pid="c.2030W.4/1">Ofwat sets demanding efficiency targets at each price review. The companies judged to be least efficient by Ofwat must make the biggest reductions in costs. In addition, there are incentives for companies to beat Ofwat's efficiency assumptions, which reward the companies in the short term (up to five years) and customers, through lower bills in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="c.2030W.4/2">Ofwat estimates that savings from efficiency improvements between privatisation and <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> have resulted in bills &pound;90 lower than they otherwise would have been. The price limits set by Ofwat in 2004 assume further savings in bills of at least &pound;16 in the five years up to 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="c.2030W.4/3">The impact of past efficiency savings on the average household bill along with a reduction for future efficiency improvements are published at each price review in Ofwat's Final Determinations publication.</p>
	<p pid="c.2030W.4/4">Drinking water in England and Wales is of a very high quality. Between 1994 and 2003 tests were taken according to the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 1989 that arose from the 1980 Drinking Water Directive. Table 1 shows a year-on-year improvement in compliance with the standards. Table 2 shows the reduction in the numbers of samples failing to meet standards.</p>

	<p pid="c.2030W.4/43">Both bathing water quality and river water quality have also improved. Monitoring by the Environment Agency has shown compliance with the mandatory standard of the Bathing Water Directive has risen from 79.3 per cent. in 1990 to 98.8 per cent. in 2005. Compliance with its more stringent guideline standard has risen from 34.2 per cent. in 1990 to 83.8 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.2030W.4/44">In England, 62 per cent. of rivers were of good quality in 2004 compared with 43 per cent. in 1990. In all years since 1993 over 90 per cent. of rivers in Wales have been of good chemical quality. Table 3, shows the chemical quality of rivers from 1990-2004.</p>
	<p pid="c.2030W.4/45">Further improvements in water quality are anticipated as the Water Framework Directive is implemented between now and 2015. Based on a more sophisticated understanding of water quality than existing assessment methods, this Directive sets demanding targets for the ecological and chemical quality of surface waters and chemical and quantitative quality of groundwaters.</p>

We assess that the recent upsurge in violence in the south of Afghanistan is in part&mdash;if not wholly&mdash;a response to the Coalition's current vigorous activity in the area, and that overall it does not represent an increased threat to the stability of the Afghan state. However, the International Community and the Afghan Government are monitoring the situation closely.</p>

	<p pid="c.2040W.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has made no assessment of the impact on each African state's economy of Chinese migrant workers. The best way for Africa to reduce poverty and meet the Millennium Development Goals is through increased trade and investment. The movement of people to Africa, where well managed, can bring benefits to African economies and new skills, technology and knowledge which support growth and development. The Government have raised common issues of interest in Africa with the Chinese Government and we will continue to encourage China to engage with Africa in a way that reinforces the principles set out in the African-led New Partnership for Africa's Development agenda of democracy, transparency, promotion of peace and stability, competitiveness and sustainable growth.</p>

	<p pid="c.2040W.8/1">I represented the UK at the Euro-African Conference on Migration and Development that took place in Rabat from the 10-<phrase class="date" code="2007-07-11">11 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.2040W.8/2">The UK continues to work closely with EU and African partners to address migratory flows from Africa across the Mediterranean. In December 2005, at the last European Council under the UK presidency, member states agreed the &quot;Global Approach to Migration&quot; paper, a comprehensive, practical guide to managing migration in partnership with third countries in Africa and the Mediterranean. It lays out a number of priority actions, including:</p>
	<p pid="c.2040W.8/3" class="indent">following the Rabat conference on West Africa, the development of regional initiatives examining further migration routes through co-operation with source, transit and destination countries;</p>
	<p pid="c.2040W.8/4" class="indent">enhanced co-ordination and increased sharing of information within member states' networks of Immigration Liaison Officers on key illegal immigration routes in Africa;</p>
	<p pid="c.2040W.8/5" class="indent">support for a Regional Protection Programme in Tanzania, designed to strengthen the capacity of Tanzanian institutions to protect refugees;</p>
	<p pid="c.2040W.8/6" class="indent">a risk analysis compiled by Frontex, the EU Border Agency, on irregular migration flows through Africa, and two feasibility studies, one exploring the possibility of a regional network to reinforce maritime controls and surveillance in the Mediterranean and a second to examine the technical feasibility of establishing a surveillance system to cover the entire southern EU maritime border.</p>
	<p pid="c.2040W.8/7">The UK particularly supports work that seeks to strengthen the commitment of all partners, African and European, to work together to maximise the benefits of well-managed legal migration and minimise the risks of uncontrolled, illegal immigration.</p>
	<p pid="c.2040W.8/8">In addition to this long-term approach, the UK is also working to address the impact of sudden influxes of migrants. In response to the ongoing crisis in the Canaries, the UK is deploying two immigration officials to the area to assist in conducting nationality and identity interviews with intercepted migrants. Malta also faces acute socio-economic challenges as a consequence of illegal sea-borne migration from North Africa. In response to a request from the Maltese authorities via Frontex, the UK has deployed an official to Malta to assist with nationality and identity interviewing, offered strategic advice on returns and, pending the outcome of a forthcoming planning meeting, will assess the possibility of offering further assistance through an expert in maritime intelligence and experts in de-briefing irregular migrants for the purposes of intelligence gathering.</p>

	<p pid="c.2050W.3/1">The UK, with other G7 members, has encouraged Russia to move forward during its G8 Presidency and ratify the Energy Charter Treaty, of which it is already a signatory and applies on a provisional basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.2050W.3/2">The UK is concerned that the proposed Russian Gas Export law would appear to contradict several of the major provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty, including the provisions on Transit. Through the EU, we continue to work with Russia towards an agreed text for the Transit Protocol while at the same time emphasising to Russia the importance of open, transparent, efficient and competitive markets at all stages of the energy supply chain as the key to global energy security.</p>

The potential chemical hazards associated with the sequence itself would be covered by the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (as amended); if DNA sequences were to be used to create a biological agent, the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2000 (as amended) are likely to apply. These provide for a high level of protection for human health and the environment (including animal and plant health). In addition, the Specified Animal Pathogens Order 1998 (SAPO), administered by DEFRA, regulates possession of nucleic acid derived from any animal pathogen specified under SAPO.

	<p pid="c.2055W.0/1">Large-scale stationary industrial tools are specifically mentioned as being outside the scope of Category 6 of the RoHS and WEEE Directives. The term 'fixed installations' does not appear in the Directive, but derives from Article 2 (1) of the WEEE Directive. In its Frequently Asked Questions non-binding guidance document, the European Commission refers to the definition of fixed installation that has been developed in connection to the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Directive and lists them as outside scope.</p>
	<p pid="c.2055W.0/2">Following discussions held in Brussels, the UK has understood that 'fixed installations' is a general derogation applying across all the categories in both Directives. Recently this understanding has been discussed by the Technical Adaptation Committee of Member States that is chaired by the Commission. It will now be up to the Commission to decide whether or not to revise its Frequently Asked Questions document, but as it stands that document currently reflects the UK's understanding.</p>

	<p pid="c.2055W.3/1">Since RoHS is a Single Market Directive (based on Article 95 of the EU Treaty) that aims to harmonise member states' legislation on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, it should be implemented in the same way across the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="c.2057W.9/1">The Department has not undertaken a formal assessment. However, patient safety and clinical quality remain, at the heart of the national health service reforms and the changes will strengthen the incentives on provider organisations to improve the clinical quality of the services they offer to patients. Experience from leading-edge organisations in the United Kingdom and other countries shows that safe care is also efficient care.</p>
	<p pid="c.2057W.9/2">The responsible regulator will be assessing all providers against core standards of safety and quality. This assessment will include ensuring that providers have robust processes for continuous improvement of their safety, including local reporting and analysis of patient safety incidents and full participation in the national reporting and learning system. The National Patient Safety Agency will continue to work with NHS trusts to promote a culture of continuous quality improvement; reporting patient adverse events and near misses is a key component of that culture.</p>
	<p pid="c.2057W.9/3">Commissioners may also wish to incorporate quality standards in their contracts with providers, and we will be publishing information on quality indicators to help inform patient choice. These could in future include objective measures of patient safety and clinical outcomes. Extensive comparable information on the quality and safety of care will give patients and commissioners a real understanding of the quality and services available.</p>

	<p pid="c.2062W.3/1">The Department sets national response time requirements for ambulance trusts, and works with the Healthcare Commission to ensure that both ambulance trusts and primary care trusts, as commissioners of ambulance services, are assessed on performance against these requirements.</p>

In addition, in 2008 changes to performance reporting will be introduced, which will align the reported response times more closely to patients' experience. To support trusts in preparing for this change, the Department is currently giving support to ambulance trusts through the provision of advice and specialist support, and the sharing of data, analysis and best practice.</p>

	<p pid="c.2064W.2/1">We recognise that older people are the largest users of audiology devices and therefore have a particular interest in waiting times for audiology services. The national service framework (NSF) for older people includes hearing as one of the senses to be investigated in assessing an older person's health and social care needs. One of the aims of the Healthy Ageing programme, in &quot;A New Ambition for Old Age&quot;, which updates the NSF, is to reduce hearing impairment as a barrier to active ageing.</p>
	<p pid="c.2064W.2/2">Audiology and adult hearing services in particular are mainly accessed directly by primary care and are predominantly outside the scope of the 18-week pathway, which is focused on changing traditional hospital consultant pathways. A separate national action plan is being developed on improving access to adult hearing services. The needs of older people and the NSF commitments will be taken into consideration in relation to the action plan.</p>

	<p pid="c.2069W.3/1">Radiotherapy treatment is often fractionated, i.e. given over a number of days.

	<p pid="c.2069W.6/1">The Department has conducted two public inquiries into the deaths of children in the last 30 years (1976 to 2006). The only one that relates to deaths of children in a health establishment is the Bristol Royal Infirmary (BRI) inquiry, established in June 1998 and reported in July 2001.</p>
	<p pid="c.2069W.6/2">The BRI public inquiry followed a General Medical Council investigation into the conduct of the two surgeons and the chief executive of the trust. The inquiry was established in response to major public concern about the paediatric cardiac service at the BRI. The inquiry was an opportunity to learn lessons more widely for the national health service as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.2069W.6/3">The Victoria Climbi&eacute; inquiry (April 2001 to January 2003) was also a public inquiry into the death of a child, but her death was not due to treatment received in a health establishment.</p>
	<p pid="c.2069W.6/4">Victoria Climbi&eacute; died on <phrase class="date" code="2000-02-25">25 February 2000</phrase> in the intensive care unit at St. Mary's hospital Paddington, as a result of months of appalling ill-treatment at the hands of two individuals (Marie-Therese Kouao and Carl John Manning) who were supposed to be caring for her. The purpose of the inquiry was:</p>

	<p pid="c.2070W.5/1">The Department has made no formal assessment of the impact that sedentary behaviour such as watching television or using computers or other game consoles has on obesity levels in children. However, a large-scale cross-national body of survey-based research conducted on children and on teenagers is emerging, which generally shows a moderate correlation between the amount of television viewed and children's diet or health.</p>
	<p pid="c.2070W.5/2">Although there is no clear United Kingdom evidence that obese children are more likely to have low levels of physical activity compared to non-obese children, there is plenty of evidence showing that high levels of sedentary behaviour such as watching television or playing computer games are predictive of being obese and overweight.</p>
	<p pid="c.2070W.5/3">The correlation could be because watching television or playing computer games does not expend any energy; in fact, it may even depress the metabolic rate. The correlation could also be owing to television and playing computer games substituting for physical exercise, or because children watch television while consuming food and drinks that are high in fat and sugar.</p>
	<p pid="c.2070W.5/4">As part of its work on developing a healthy living campaign, the Department is currently looking into what correlations there may be between obesity and sedentary behaviour. It has not found any clear evidence of the impact on obesity of television or video gaming but has made an intuitive assessment of a possible correlation, which has been supported by stakeholder and expert groups as part of a focus area review.</p>

	<p pid="c.2076W.8/1">The main element of national health service dental services in the last five years has been the primary dental care services provided by dentists working within the general dental services (CDS) or personal dental services (PDS) pilots.</p>
	<p pid="c.2076W.8/2">The tables, which have been placed in the Library, show the available CDS data on gross item of service fees and patient registration payments, together with the cost of certain additional payments made to dental contractors, and patient charge income for CDS contracts in England and each strategic health authority area for the financial years 2001-02 to 2005-06. The data excludes certain elements of gross costs, such as employers' superannuation contributions, vocational trainee salaries and expenses, and the cost of salaried general dental practitioners and emergency dental services, where data is not readily available in this localised format.</p>
	<p pid="c.2076W.8/3">The PDS pilots were generally based not on item of service fees but on regular contract payments for defined services. Localised data on PDS expenditure are only available for the financial year 2004-05. The data include regular PDS contract payments but excludes some additional payments authorised locally. They also exclude the cost of PDS services directly managed by NHS trusts such as some dental access centres. Data on PDS charge income may also be incomplete because some primary care trusts (PCTs) instituted temporary arrangements to collect charge income directly from dentists. These factors make it very difficult to make comparisons between the 2004-05 and 2005-06 data, when PDS pilot schemes rapidly expanded, and earlier periods.</p>
	<p pid="c.2076W.8/4">Charge income levels will have been influenced by the proportion of services delivered by PDS contractors, who until the reform of primary care services introduced from April 2006 were required to apply the patient charge regime originally designed for the item of service remuneration system operating within CDS. This patient charge regime was not sensitive to the new ways of working and treatment patterns associated with PDS contracts, and generally resulted in lower levels of charge income within PDS pilot schemes. In addition, as noted above, some PCTs have collected some patient charges direct from PDS dentists locally and this income may not be reflected in the centrally recorded data. All these factors will have distorted the proportion of patient charge income recovered particularly in 2004-05 and 2005-06.</p>

	<p pid="c.2083W.2/1">The main element of national health service dental services is the primary dental care services provided by dentists working in the general dental service (GDS) or personal dental service (PDS) pilots.</p>
	<p pid="c.2083W.2/2">The following table shows the available data on the main components of expenditure on those services in the Selby and York Primary Care Trust (PCT) from 1997-98 to 2005-06. Comparable localised data for previous years are not available. As the notes to the table record, certain other elements of GDS and PDS costs are also excluded because they are not readily available on a localised basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.2083W.2/3">Payments to dentists as shown in the following table represent remuneration for the provision of dental services. As independent contractors, dentists are responsible for meeting their own practice expenses. Remuneration levels reflect the volume of NHS work undertaken by dental contractors, which can vary from practice to practice and may not equate to a full-time commitment to NHS services.</p>

However, there is a national target that by 2008 all patients will be treated within 18 weeks of general practitioner referral, and this will include diagnostics such as echocardiography. Reducing waiting times for diagnostics is central to delivering the 18-week patient pathway. The national health service began measuring waiting times for long wait diagnostic tests for the first time this year to assess the scale of the 18-week challenge.</p>

	<p pid="c.2090W.8/2">The national service framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease includes the recommendation that ambulance services put in place systems of care that transfer people with suspected heart attack to hospital in less than 30 minutes from the call. Response times are set for ambulance trusts to reach the scene of an incident.</p>
	<p pid="c.2090W.8/3">The NSF standard, which national health service organisations are working towards, is that people with heart attack are treated within 60 minutes of calling for professional help. In most parts of the country, ambulance trusts are training paramedics to treat patients with clot-busting drugs before arrival at hospital. Fifty-eight per cent. of patients are currently treated within 60 minutes of calling for help, compared with 24 per cent. before the NSF.</p>
	<p pid="c.2090W.8/4">The Department has not issued guidance on safe travelling times for stroke patients. However, revised guidance on management of stroke for ambulance services is due to be issued by the Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee.</p>
	<p pid="c.2090W.8/5">The Department does not collect hospital level data. Population data at hospital or trust level are not collected centrally as NHS trusts do not have specific catchment areas. However, the Department collects data which showed that 286 NHS organisations (NHS trusts, primary care trusts and care trusts) had beds in acute wards open overnight in England in 2004-05. This figure is not necessarily the number of trusts in England that accept acute admissions. Some trusts may accept acute admissions and not have a ward classified as acute.</p>

	<p pid="c.2103W.2/1">Reducing deaths from coronary heart disease (CHD) is a top priority for this Government. The national service framework (NSF) for CHD, published in March 2000, sets the agenda for the modernisation of CHD services over a 10-year period. The NSF was drawn up by clinicians, patients, managers and Government and sets 12 standards for improved prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation and goals to secure fair access to high quality services. The NSF is already making a real difference for patients.</p>
	<p pid="c.2103W.2/2">The national health service on the south-east coast has advised that following the publication of the NSF for CHD, a significant amount of work was undertaken to improve access to services for patients with CHD, and to ensure that future services meet the needs of the Kent population.</p>
	<p pid="c.2103W.2/3">In March 2004, the Kent cardiac network ratified a strategy to develop a network of cardiac catheter labs and associated facilities across Kent and Medway. This resulted in the agreement to build catheter laboratories at Dartford, Margate, Maidstone, Medway and Tunbridge Wells to support the one already existing laboratory in Ashford.</p>
	<p pid="c.2103W.2/4">In addition to the development of new catheter labs, &pound;14.5 million capital funding has enabled the local hospitals to redesign their cardiology departments to enable the catheter labs to become the focal point of local heart centres. Complex cardiac surgery will continue to go to the specialist surgical centres at St Thomas's and Kings College Hospital in London.</p>
	<p pid="c.2103W.2/5">Across the Gravesham area, the NHS on the south-east coast has advised of the following improvements to cardiac services since the publication of the NSF for CHD:</p>
	<p pid="c.2103W.2/6" class="italic"> Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust</p>
	<p pid="c.2103W.2/7">A new heart centre at Darent Valley hospital is under construction. This new building will bring together cardiac services and will be a centre of excellence. Coronary angiography commenced at Darent Valley in November 2005 as an interim service while the heart centre build is completed. The cardiac team anticipate moving into the building during November 2006. The opening of the heart centre will allow the service to be extended by doing more angiograms and also offering angioplasty locally by spring 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.2103W.2/8">At the trust's rapid access chest pain clinic patients are seen and start their treatment within two weeks of referral from their general practitioner.</p>
	<p pid="c.2103W.2/9">The introduction of specialist nurses at the Darent Valley Hospital to help reduce the door-to-needle time. Patients having some type of heart attack now receive clot-busting drugs as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.2103W.2/10" class="italic"> Dartford, Gravesham and Swanley Primary Care Trust (PCT)</p>
	<p pid="c.2103W.2/11">The PCT runs healthy lifestyle days in the local community where the general public can discuss health matters and receive advice from community nursing staff and dieticians, and physiotherapists.</p>
	<p pid="c.2103W.2/12">The development of a breathlessness clinic provides community diagnostic services for patients, many of whom may have heart failure.</p>

	<p pid="c.2104W.5/1">The number of HIV tests offered and taken in the genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics within the London strategic health authorities (SHA) is shown in the table. The dataset used to compile this data was taken from the KC60 return, which is made by all GUM clinics to the health protection agency. Only tests offered and taken in GUM clinics are recorded in the KC60 return. Testing undertaken in other clinical settings, such as general practice, is not recorded in the dataset.</p>
	<p pid="c.2104W.5/2">The data do not represent the number of HIV tests offered and taken up by the population resident in each SHA, as many patients cross health boundaries to access GUM clinics. In addition, the gender and sexual orientation mix varies between clinics. Some clinics are attended by a high number of homosexual and bisexual men and consequently this influences the number of HIV tests offered and taken.</p>

Currently, the gap is 19 per cent. The latest data show no change in the gap between these groups and the rest of the population, 2002-04, compared with the data for the previous year, 2001-03, which were set out in 'Tackling Health Inequalities&mdash;A Status Report on the Programme for Action', published last August.</p>

This will help contribute to meeting the target by narrowing the gap between these groups and the rest of the population, and build a long-term sustainable reduction in health inequalities. The results of the review will be published in due course.</p>

	<p pid="c.2129W.2/1">The Department's 2006-07 and 2007-08 revenue allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs) separately identify &pound;211 million in 2006-07 and &pound;342 million in 2007-08 to support the implementation of the &quot;Choosing Health&quot; White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="c.2129W.2/2">For the two years covered by this allocation, a total of &pound;14 million has been identified nationally to invest in the well-being support programmes initiative to support the implementation of the &quot;Choosing Health&quot; White Paper commitments. However, only a total amount to cover the implementation of the White Paper has been identified within each PCT's 2006-07 and 2007-08 revenue allocations. No breakdown of the funding by initiative is shown in the individual PCT's allocations. It is PCTs' responsibility to decide how to use these funds. That said, the &quot;Choosing Health&quot; White Paper delivery plan sets out in detail the expectations of how this funding should be utilised.</p>
	<p pid="c.2129W.2/3">As made clear in the &quot;Choosing Health&quot; White Paper, the Government recognises that people with poor mental health tend to experience worse physical health than the rest of the population. This is why it is supporting well-being support programmes in spearhead PCTs and through the Shift initiative. Guidance for commissioners on well-being support programmes will be published shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.2134W.5/1">The Department has placed the protection of individual rights at the heart of the new national health service care records service. The Department is working closely with the Information Commissioner to ensure that the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 are met in full, and is sympathetic to the Commissioner's call for increased penalties for those who misuse personal health and other information under Section 55 of the Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.2134W.5/2">However, the Data Protection Act does not provide individuals with the right to restrict access to information where the information is processed in accordance with the principles set out in the Act. The rights of individuals to restrict access to information that relates to them stem from common law confidentiality obligations rather than the Data Protection Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.2134W.5/3">Where information is held in confidence, the common law allows individuals to prevent information from being shared without their consent unless, exceptionally, there is a reason for sharing that requires obligations of confidentiality to be overridden. The new system of electronic care records is therefore being designed to enable patients to restrict access to information that the NHS holds in confidence. Many older NHS systems were not designed to safeguard confidentiality in this way and these will be phased out over the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="c.2134W.5/4">A person's right to confidentiality can, however, be overridden by statute or by a court order and, where these apply, restrictions placed on access by patients have to be set aside. Patients are not permitted to place restrictions on access to information where it is clear that to do so would put others at risk of serious harm. Also, exceptionally, patient restrictions may have to be overridden by a health professional where the public interest in sharing information outweighs obligations of confidentiality, for example in child protection cases. Where an individual's restrictions are overridden the system will generate an alert to enable senior staff to check that the decision was appropriate and lawful.</p>
	<p pid="c.2134W.5/5">The Department has produced what we believe is the most comprehensive privacy statement of any public service in the form of the NHS care record guarantee for England, setting out 12 commitments the NHS makes to patients in order to protect their confidentiality. A major campaign is planned to inform the public about what information the NHS keeps about them, how it is used, the safeguards in place, and their options for putting restrictions on who can access information about them.</p>
	<p pid="c.2134W.5/6">In addition to ensuring compliance with the law, we are committed to best practice in maintaining the security and confidentiality of information systems by applying role-based access, smartcard technology and individual regulation to manage the use of NHS care records. More generally, the Department promotes the highest standards of information governance across the whole health and social care sector in the interests of all patients and clinicians.</p>

	<p pid="c.2137W.2/1">The devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales have adopted different approaches to the development of information technology support in their respective health services from those being delivered through the national programme to the national health service in England, based on their own functional requirements and assessment of priorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.2137W.2/2">England, Scotland, and Wales co-operate closely to ensure a common approach to technical standards, through, for example, the NHS information standards board, so that, where appropriate, information can be exchanged between the health services quickly, safely and securely. Where the countries are following a common approach, there are opportunities for using the same systems. For example, Scotland is using the same N3 network services as England, and is adopting the same picture archiving and communication systems that are used in some English cluster areas. However, because of differing functional requirements and administrative arrangements, systems are not necessarily applicable across all the home countries.</p>

	<p pid="c.2137W.5/1">National programme for information technology contracts do not provide for the payment of fines by national health service organisations. However, an arrangement known as the managed authorities employees scheme provides for the secondment of NHS staff on a temporary basis to work with local service providers (LSPs) to ensure that the systems and services being developed and deployed meet the needs of the NHS. This arrangement was factored into the contracts with LSPs and reflected in the contract price. In some, though not all, cluster areas it is underpinned by a financial liability on NHS organisations for failure to source sufficient numbers of staff with the necessary expertise.</p>

	<p pid="c.2138W.2/1">None of the national health service trusts referred to has dispensed with the national programme for information technology (IT). All remain committed to the programme and its objectives, and to realising the benefits it is already bringing, and will continue to bring to NHS patients and staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.2138W.2/2">We have always said that the programme will make maximum use of existing systems when deciding local implementation priorities. We are adopting an incremental approach to replacing existing systems, and this strategy ensures that best use is made of the existing asset base. There is scope within deployment plans in each cluster for existing systems to be replaced in either the shorter or the longer term depending on the circumstances of NHS trusts and primary care trusts locally. It makes no sense to replace prematurely systems with appropriate functionality that are delivering demonstrable benefit to patients and staff when other NHS organisations have systems that are in urgent need of replacement.</p>
	<p pid="c.2138W.2/3">This approach to local deployment lies behind decisions made by the Northumbria Healthcare NHS trust, the Dudley Group of Hospitals NHS trust, and the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS trust to defer migration to the patient administration system supplied by the local service provider (LSP). The approach is set out in programme-wide implementation guidance. The guidance which is aimed at providing structured and consistent mechanisms, and describing the critical tasks necessary to maximise benefits from the changes being enabled by the national programme, is published on the Department's NHS Connecting for Health agency's website at: <a href="http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/implementation">www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/implementation</a> The circumstances of the South West Yorkshire Mental Health Trust are slightly different.</p>
	<p pid="c.2138W.2/4">The trust was established in April 2002 from three separate organisations, and inherited nine different clinical information systems. Due to the complexity of the current systems and the need to consolidate them it is not currently possible for the Trust to be an early development site for the national programme. The trust board has taken a decision to procure an interim clinical information system which will put it in a stronger position to transfer data onto the LSP-delivered system as soon as this becomes available.</p>
	<p pid="c.2138W.2/5">NHS organisations that retain use of their existing systems typically incur annual maintenance costs, which are paid locally. These costs are saved following migration to solutions provided under the national programme. Information is not collected centrally about the amounts in each case. However, in the case of the Dudley Group of Hospitals NHS trust, all IT services and applications were included in the trust's overall public finance initiative contract, and no separate IT maintenance costs are payable.</p>

	<p pid="c.2146W.5/1">In the autumn of 2003, the Department conducted the procurement and supply chain review. It identified the significant value brought to the national health service through the supply chain activity managed by the NHS Logistics Authority and the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency. The review recommended that this valuable service must develop and expand, allowing the NHS to obtain even greater benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.2146W.5/2">The Department looked at a number of options for delivering the needed development, investment and expansion, and concluded that the best potential opportunity might exist in a new partnership with the independent sector. This reflected the Government's belief that partnerships between the public and independent sectors can be used successfully to develop essential services in the NHS and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="c.2146W.5/3">Therefore in August 2004, in accordance with European Union procurement regulations, a notice was published in the Official Journal of the European Union announcing the Department was considering a potential private sector partnering of the supply chain functions of logistics and certain procurement functions of NHS PASA.</p>
	<p pid="c.2146W.5/4">This process has been governed by clear public procurement regulations and in March the full business case received ministerial approval and it was stated that subject to final commercial negotiations a contract would be signed with DHL. If approved by Ministers, an announcement will be made soon. Under the terms of the contract, the infrastructure would transfer to DHL.</p>
	<p pid="c.2146W.5/5">Details of the proposed cost savings are commercial in confidence at this time but it is estimated that they should be three times greater than the savings that could be achieved in-house.</p>
	<p pid="c.2146W.5/6">Since the process began, ministers have met with staff, the unions (UNISON and DTUS), union shop stewards, local Members of Parliament and suppliers. All have sought reassurance that the outsourcing would be in the best interests of staff and the NHS. In addition, ministers have consulted with both legal and commercial advisors.</p>

	<p pid="c.2148W.0/1">A consultation document, &quot;Delivering 21st Century IT support for the NHS: National Specification for Integrated Care Records Service&mdash;consultation draft&quot;, issued in July 2002, outlined the requirements for a national patient care records service and the national standards and specification which would underpin it. Its purpose was to provide an initial review of electronic patient records and to describe a direction of travel for the whole range of information technology standards in the national health service. Nearly 200 initial responses were received from organisations and individuals, and these were taken into account in drawing up the specification for a care record service used in the procurements phase during 2003. A broad spectrum of NHS stakeholders was then engaged to review the specification, including leading clinicians, practitioners, policy advisors, health informaticians, and managers.</p>
	<p pid="c.2148W.0/2">Following the closure of the Modernisation Agency in 2004-05 (as a result of the Department's arms length body review) a service implementation directorate has been established within NHS Connecting for Health whose purpose is to help to maximise the value gained from investment in the national programme. This is done by providing support and guidance to the NHS to realise benefits and achieve performance improvement through synergy with other change programmes and system reform, in particular through effective education, training and development. The emphasis is to optimise the use of technology to manage knowledge and information to improve care and treatment, safety and clinical governance, and to re-design processes, supported by appropriate information technology, to improve patient, clinician and managerial satisfaction.</p>
	<p pid="c.2148W.0/3">Examples of work done to date in pursuit of these objectives include establishment of an integrated service improvement programme (ISIP) to promote and support the planning and delivery of this kind of transformational change across the NHS. ISIP is focused on helping the national programme for information technology (NPfIT) products to be adopted and exploited by clinicians and managers rather than be seen as peripheral to other NHS priorities and primarily the domain of the IT community.</p>
	<p pid="c.2148W.0/4">In addition, the do once and share programme, initiated in March 2005 and involving over 6,000 clinicians, has been set up to minimise unknowing duplication of effort, and to help clinical specialist networks plan improvements in care that will be made possible by the NPfIT. Forty-four national action teams have been established supported by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, specialist libraries, and the Healthcare Commission to distil the current best practice derived from the NHS's knowledge bases into fifty national care pathways representing current best practice. By the end of June 2006 thirty-nine of the action teams will have produced their final reports, which will enable the distilled knowledge to begin to be integrated into national electronic care pathways.</p>
	<p pid="c.2148W.0/5">NHS Connecting for Health has also been working with the NHS to compile programme-wide national programme implementation guidance. The guidance is intended to act as an entry point to all NPfIT implementation-related guidance for programme and project managers in NHS trusts, but is also useful to many other groups including clinicians, human resources, and training professionals. The purpose of the guidance is to provide a structured and consistent mechanism for implementation, and to describe the critical tasks necessary to maximise benefits from the changes being enabled by NPfIT, irrespective of the type of implementation a local health community is undertaking.</p>
	<p pid="c.2148W.0/6">The guidance, the first version of which was issued in 2004, is published on the NHS Connecting for Health website at</p>

	<p pid="c.2150W.8/1">Entitlement to access free national health service hospital treatment is based on whether someone is ordinarily resident in this country, not on British nationality or the past or present payment of national insurance contributions or UK taxes. Anyone who is not ordinarily resident is subject to the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989, as amended. These regulations place a legal duty on NHS hospitals to establish whether a person is ordinarily resident, or exempt from charges under one of a number of exemption categories, or liable for charges, and to make and recover a charge for the full cost of treatment to those found liable to pay. The onus is on the patient to provide satisfactory evidence to support a claim for exemption from charges.</p>
	<p pid="c.2150W.8/2">Where it is established that charges apply they cannot be waived for any reason. NHS trusts are instructed to take all reasonable measures, based on the circumstances of each individual case, to pursue overseas visitors' debt. Nevertheless, we have also made very clear to NHS trusts that immediately necessary treatment, needed to save life or prevent a condition from becoming life-threatening, should always be provided without delay, with charging issues dealt with as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
	<p pid="c.2150W.8/3">Successive Governments have not required the NHS to provide statistics on the number of overseas visitors seen or treated under the provisions of these regulations or on the costs of treatment. It is therefore not possible to provide the information requested on how many chargeable overseas visitors have received free NHS treatment, nor on the costs involved.</p>

	<p pid="c.2154W.0/1">The main source of data on the prevalence of obesity is the Health Survey for England (HSE).

All data in the tables are the most recent available.</p>
	<p pid="c.2154W.0/2">Tables one and two show the prevalence of obesity among adults and children respectively, by sex and age, in England in each year from 1997 to 2004. Table three shows the prevalence of obesity among adults in North West London SHA (the SHA which contains Brent) as a three-year moving average for the period 1995 to 2002. Table four shows the prevalence of obesity among children aged two to 10 in London Government Office Region (GOR) based on combined 2001 and 2002 HSE data.</p>

	<p pid="c.2158W.2/1">Over 75 per cent. of the Department's total expenditure on health research is currently devolved to and managed by national health service organisations. Details of individual projects including a large number concerned with osteoarthritis are available on the national research register (NRR) at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/research">www.dh.gov.uk/research</a>. NRR entries include the address of the hospital or other location at which the principal researcher is based.</p>
	<p pid="c.2158W.2/2">The Department funds research to support policy and to provide the evidence needed to underpin quality improvement and service development in the NHS. Information about osteoarthritis research commissioned by Department's national research programmes can similarly be found on the NRR.</p>
	<p pid="c.2158W.2/3">The Government also support medical and clinical research by funding the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC is an independent body funded by the Department of Trade and Industry via the Office of Science and Innovation.</p>
	<p pid="c.2158W.2/4">The MRC spent &pound;6.8 million on arthritis and rheumatism research in 2003-04, and is about to issue a highlight notice encouraging researchers to submit innovative proposals aimed at identifying factors involved in the maintenance of musculoskeletal health, especially where such research could underpin the development of new diagnostic approaches.</p>
	<p pid="c.2158W.2/5">The approaches to the research are also important and the MRC wishes particularly to support longer- term collaborative research from new partnerships working at the interface of basic and clinical research. To this end, the MRC will consider collaborative funding with other research councils, charities and industry.</p>

	<p pid="c.2158W.5/1">As part of the negotiations for the new general medical services contract for April 2006 an expert panel was engaged by NHS Employers to receive and review submissions on clinical areas for possible inclusion in the quality and outcomes framework (QOF). The number of submissions to the panel for the inclusion of osteoporosis totalled seven out of 514. All submissions were considered and the expert panel produced reports which have been published on the University of Birmingham website at: <a href="http://www.pcpoh.bham.ac.uk/primarycare/QOF/index.htm">www.pcpoh.bham.ac.uk/primarycare/QOF/index.htm</a>.

	<p pid="c.2158W.5/2">During the negotiations many clinical conditions were considered. The key criteria for inclusion in QOF were:</p>
	<p pid="c.2158W.5/3" class="indent">an evidence base for the effectiveness of intervention in primary care;</p>
	<p pid="c.2158W.5/4" class="indent">the health benefits likely to result from improved primary care; and</p>
	<p pid="c.2158W.5/5" class="indent">Government health priorities for investment through the contractual arrangements with general practitioners.</p>
	<p pid="c.2158W.5/6">Due to technical problems with the proposed indicators and the degree of priority attached to other changes to the QOF, the proposals for osteoporosis were not taken forward for the 2006 contract changes. As part of the continuing development of the framework, indicators will be reviewed in the light of emerging evidence.</p>

	<p pid="c.2160W.5/1">The United Kingdom (UK) parallel import licensing scheme, as required by the European treaty, allows medicinal products already authorised in other European Union (EU) member states to be marketed in the UK provided the imported products have no therapeutic difference from the equivalent UK products and do not appear in the light of scientific knowledge to differ as regards their safety and efficacy.</p>
	<p pid="c.2160W.5/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) liaises closely with the relevant competent authorities in the EU to obtain the necessary information to ensure that only those products which fully comply with the stringent criteria for parallel import are granted a licence.</p>
	<p pid="c.2160W.5/3">Quality and patient safety are further ensured by a thorough assessment of the proposed labelling and/or packaging and the patient information leaflet by assessors prior to the issuing of a licence. Repackaging of the imported product when it occurs is carried out by an approved company in possession of a manufacturer's or assembler's licence, issued by the MHRA. In addition, patient information leaflets and/or packaging are kept up to date by variations to the parallel import licences when relevant information becomes available via the MHRA's pharmacovigilance activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.2160W.5/4">Parallel import traders are also subject to routine inspections by staff of the MHRA's inspection and standards division.</p>

The issues faced by rural areas have been looked at by ACRA on numerous occasions when considering the allocation of funds to PCTs.</p>
	<p pid="c.2165W.3/3">In 1997 a team of researchers was contracted to examine the effect of rurality on the cost of providing certain services. Accident and emergency services and patient transport costs were examined but no evidence of unavoidable geographical costs were found for these services. However, geographical cost differences were found for emergency ambulance services. This led to the introduction of an emergency ambulance cost adjustment (EACA) from the 1998-99 health authority allocations. The results of this study are recorded in &quot;Study of Costs of Providing Health Services in Rural Areas Progress Report to Resource Allocation Group&mdash;Volumes 1 and 2&quot;. This research was published by Mallender Hancock Associates/Operational Research in Health Ltd.</p>

	<p pid="c.2167W.2/1">Nationally, the Department rural proofs policy across much of its business. In policy development we ensure that all communities, including those in rural areas, are able to benefit from our national objectives for healthcare. Examples of our rural proofing activity can be found in the Commission for Rural Communities annual report on rural proofing at: <a href="http://www.ruralcommunities.gov.uk">www.ruralcommunities.gov.uk</a>. This commends our White Paper &quot;Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services&quot; highlighting policies aimed at providing care closer to the home. Proposals for social care and integration, initiatives to support carers, such as a dedicated telephone helpline, and set of community hospitals will be particularly beneficial to rural populations.</p>
	<p pid="c.2167W.2/2">The Department's document &quot;Health reform in England: update and commissioning framework&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-13">13 July 2006</phrase>, sets out a framework for strengthening commissioning in the new primary care trusts (PCTs). An essential part of this is the effective assessment of the health needs of all communities, including those in rural areas. PCTs' effectiveness is assessed by the strategic health authorities, as well as by the Healthcare Commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.2167W.2/3">To further support delivery of health objectives in rural communities, the Department with the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs funded the Institute of Rural Health, an independent research charity, for the production of a rural proofing toolkit. This was launched at the House of Commons in October 2005, and now acts as a resource for primary care organisations to help ensure that all health care delivery is accessible and appropriate for people living in rural areas.</p>

The number of cases of gonorrhoea has decreased by 14 per cent. in England since 2004. The report is freely available from the HPA website at:</p>

	<p pid="c.2169W.2/3">Sexual health and access to genito-urinary (GUM) clinics is one of the six top priorities for the national health service in 2006-07. By 2008 everyone should be offered an appointment within 48 hours of contacting a GUM clinic. Strategic health authorities (SHAs) have all submitted plans to meet this target.</p>
	<p pid="c.2169W.2/4">The GUM clinic waiting times audit collects data on waiting times for all GUM clinics in England for a period of one week every quarter. All patients attending a GUM clinic with a new episode or registering for the first time are asked to complete the short questionnaire on waiting times. This audit has been chosen as the initial method of monitoring and improving access to genito-urinary medicine services. Current analysis is published on numbers seen within 48 hours. The most recent survey is for May 2006 which shows that in England 54 per cent. of attendees were seen within 48 hours and a further 4 per cent. were offered an appointment but did not attend. This compares with 45 per cent. seen within 48 hours in May 2004. A summary of the data is published on the HPA website at the following web address:</p>

	<p pid="c.2169W.2/6">In addition the Department is working with SHAs and primary care trusts to establish a new continuous monitoring system for GUM access to all local areas to better performance manage their progress to the 2008 target. We expect GUM services to start returning data in August 2006.</p>

	<p pid="c.2170W.11/3">For the 56 trusts that have joined for finance and accounting, they are achieving savings of over 30 per cent. (which is relative to their previous in house costs) and greater than the original commitment by the JV of achieving 20 per cent. savings. This amounts to a saving, for the 56, of circa &pound;3.9 million per annum.</p>

	<p pid="c.2175W.2/1">The Committee on Medical Aspects of Air Pollution made a statement on swimming pools and asthma in August 2003. The committee was examining a paper that had been published in the Journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine 2003; 60:385-394.</p>
	<p pid="c.2175W.2/2">The committee felt that the study was of interest and that further focused research in this area was advisable to take further these preliminary findings. Members accepted that exposure to airway irritants such as chloramines could trigger the symptoms of asthma. It was argued that it was important to distinguish clearly between induction of asthma as a disease and the triggering of symptoms. The primary cause of most cases of asthma is unknown as are the reasons for the increase in asthma in the United Kingdom over the past 20 years. That exposure to chlorine and associated reaction products had played a significant part in causing this increase was felt to be unlikely.</p>

This report published in March 2005 outlined and reviewed all the relevant research into the safe levels hydrogen peroxide used in tooth whitening and concluded that in the opinion of SCCP:</p>
	<p pid="c.2175W.8/2" class="indent">the use of tooth whitening products up to 0.1 per cent, hydrogen peroxide is safe;</p>
	<p pid="c.2175W.8/3" class="indent">the proper use of tooth whitening products containing greater than 0.1 per cent, to 6 per cent, hydrogen peroxide, or equivalent for hydrogen peroxide releasing substances, is considered safe after consultation with and approval of the consumer's dentist.

	<p pid="c.2175W.8/8">Tooth whitening products, along with other oral hygiene products are regulated by the Cosmetics Directive, implemented in the United Kingdom in the Cosmetic Product (Safety) Regulations. The European Commission and member states are currently considering how the SCCP opinion can be implemented to allow consumers to buy products containing up to 6 per cent. hydrogen peroxide. Any proposal will address the concerns of the SCCP including requiring industry to conduct epidemiological studies to assess the long-term effects of usage of this type of product.</p>

	<p pid="c.2176W.2/1">Every national health service trust has responsibility for the safe use of medical equipment within their hospitals and should undertake a local risk assessment to determine those areas where it is safe to permit mobile telephone usage and those areas where usage should be prohibited, due to the presence of electrically sensitive medical devices.

	<p pid="c.2176W.2/2">Restrictions in other areas of the hospital premises may be introduced for reasons other than their impact on the safety of medical equipment, such as the desire to reduce the disruption caused by the uncontrolled use of mobile telephones and the possible invasion of patients' privacy from phones with built in cameras, for example. Mobile telephone ring tones may be confused with medical device alarm signals by hospital staff, which could have a direct impact on patient safety.</p>

	<p pid="c.2187W.11/19">It is important to note that a report of an adverse reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease. Other factors such as the time since a drug was first marketed, media interest, the reason for prescribing or regulatory action can also influence the frequency of reporting. This means that reporting rates based on numbers of spontaneous reports and numbers of prescriptions are not true measures of the frequency of reactions or the ideal basis for comparisons between drug substances or classes. For these reasons, no firm conclusions can be drawn from a possibly higher reporting rate in 2005, of suspected adverse reactions with the more recently marketed atypical anti-psychotics, based on yellow card data, compared to more traditional anti-psychotics.</p>

	<p pid="c.2190W.2/1">I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that the information requested is not available centrally in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="c.2190W.2/2">Local authorities (LAs) are required to report to the Food Standards Agency the number of food premises subject to formal enforcement action, including those to which written warnings, improvement notices, prohibition orders and emergency prohibition orders were issued. But the monitoring data returns from London boroughs cover the enforcement of both food hygiene and food standards, and the total enforcement action data cannot be divided between the two.</p>
	<p pid="c.2190W.2/3">Information on general food law enforcement action by LAs in 2004-05 was set out in the paper presented to the Food Standards Agency Board in February 2006, paper FSA 06/02/04. I have arranged for a copy of the paper to be placed in the Library.</p>
