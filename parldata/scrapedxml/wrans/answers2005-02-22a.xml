	<p pid="a.467W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.3/2">We continually raise, bilaterally and with our EU partners, the importance of respect for human rights and good governance in Kazakhstan. When I met the Kazakh Minister for Justice last May I raised democratic reform and human rights issues, including the death penalty and conditions in Kazakh prisons. Following the parliamentary elections in September/October 2004, the EU released a statement reflecting the concerns of the OSCE Election Observers that the elections had failed to meet international standards. The concerns were also raised by our Ambassador with the Foreign Minister in October 2004. More recently, in February, along with our EU partners we raised human rights issues at an EU-Kazakhstan sub-committee meeting. This month, we supported an EU statement in Vienna expressing concern at the new law on Extremism and the recent banning of an opposition party.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.3/3">Wherever possible we also look to work with the Kazakh authorities to improve the human rights situation and have funded projects aimed at improving the conditions in prisons, preventing torture in places of detention and encouraging the abolition of the death penalty. We have an on-going dialogue with the government of Kazakhstan on transparency issues and are working closely with NGOs on this too.</p>
	<p pid="a.467W.3/4">We will continue to stress the importance of human rights and good governance with the Kazakh authorities and look for opportunities to provide suitable assistance. Kazakhstan has recently been identified as a priority country under the sustainable development strand of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Global Opportunities Fund. This will provide further scope for the UK Government to support rule of law, torture prevention and death penalty abolition initiatives.</p>

	<p pid="a.468W.3/3">It was originally stated that the expenditure on advertising for 2004&ndash;05, which was then believed to be higher than that for 2003&ndash;04, reflected a higher number of posts being advertised in 2004&ndash;05. On re-examination this is incorrect. The number of recruitment competitions for which advertisements were placed was in fact slightly more in 2003&ndash;04 than the number to date in 2004&ndash;05.</p>

	<p pid="a.476W.5/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking which local authorities fall within NUTS <i>(a)</i> 1, <i>(b)</i> 2 and <i>(c)</i> 3. (216560)</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/4" class="indent">The current relationships between local authority districts and NUTS levels 1, 2 and 3 are contained in the <i>Gazetteer of the old and new geographies of the United Kingdom</i> (ISBN 1 85774 298 2) published by the Office for National Statistics in 1999. The publication can be viewed on the National Statistics website, and can be downloaded in pdf format at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/gazetteer.asp">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/gazetteer.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/5" class="indent">The relationships between the local authority districts and the NUTS 1&ndash;3 levels are shown in tabular form on pages 10&ndash;40, and the full NUTS 1&ndash;3 classification with maps, is shown on pages 88&ndash;113.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/6" class="indent">Since local government reorganisation in 1998, there have been minor changes to local authority district boundaries in Wales in April 2002 and April 2003, and in Scotland in June 2002. However, these have not impacted on the NUTS 1&ndash;3 areas because the NUTS boundaries moved to retain the relationships. There have not been any local authority district boundary changes in England since 1998 or in Northern Ireland since 1973.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/7" class="indent">The NUTS 1&ndash;3 areas were frozen by EU Regulation in July 2003 and, in consequence, the small change in the boundary between Powys and Neath Port Talbot, effective on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, will result in part of Powys falling within Bridgend and Neath Port Talbot&quot; NUTS 3 area, and within West Wales and the Valleys&quot; NUTS 2 area. There are no other local authority district boundary changes being effected in the UK in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.476W.5/8" class="indent">The EU Regulation does not permit the NUTS classification to be amended to reflect small changes to administrative area boundaries more frequently than every 3 years but amendments can be made at lesser intervals if the administrative structure is substantially reorganised.</p>

I am replying in his absence. 216036</p>
	<p pid="a.477W.2/4" class="indent">ONS's practice is to provide analyses by region where this is meaningful in terms of the statistics concerned, subject to the reliability of the figures and providing that release does not create a risk of disclosure of confidential personal information. Following the establishment of Government Offices in 1994, the decision was taken in 1996 that the Government Office regions should become the standard statistical regions for England.</p>
	<p pid="a.477W.2/5" class="indent">It is standard practice in ONS data collection to include suitable geographic referencing in surveys of businesses and individuals, allowing statistics to be analysed and published at a variety of geographic levels including region. The bulk of ONS statistics can therefore be produced by region, including the Census of population and household and business surveys. A list of major statistical collections indicating the levels at which figures are available will be placed in the House of Commons library.</p>
	<p pid="a.477W.2/6" class="indent">ONS also publishes a number of statistical reports&mdash;such as Regional Trends and Region in Figures&mdash;that include regional figures obtained from other Government departments. A list of the contents at regional level will also be placed in the Library. In addition, the Neighbourhood Statistics service includes a wealth of data relating to much smaller geographic areas which can be aggregated to regional level.</p>
	<p pid="a.477W.2/7" class="indent">Following the 2004 report of the review by Christopher Allsopp of statistics for economic policymaking, the Office is looking to improve the information on its web site about the availability of regional and other sub-national statistics.</p>

	<p pid="a.478W.2/6" class="indent">A recent review, with representatives from the Department for Education and Skills, has confirmed that data on pupil absences has the highest priority. As a result the Office for National Statistics is working with the Department for Education and Skills to make available details of authorised and unauthorised absences in primary and secondary schools for the periods 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04. The level of detail (including the geographical level) cannot be guaranteed at this time as it would depend on whether the information would be disclosive. To protect the confidentiality of information about identifiable individuals, information will be published in strict accordance with the National Statistics Code of Practice.</p>

It describes a number of measures the Revenue has put in place to protect against hardship being caused by the recovery of an overpayment.

	<p pid="a.480W.5/2">The estimated current cost of tax-exempt savings plans, with an annual premium limit of &pound;300 is around &pound;70 million per year and in recent years this cost has been increasing at an annual rate of about 10 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.480W.5/3">Increasing the limit to &pound;600 or &pound;1,200 per annum would potentially cost the Exchequer an extra &pound;30 million or &pound;120 million per year respectively in the long run. Doubling the limit would not necessarily double the cost because many tax-exempt savings plan customers do not save at the current maximum.</p>

	<p pid="a.483W.2/14">Information is not available on patients who are unable to register with a dentist, but we are undertaking a wide range of initiatives to improve access to NHS dentistry. In the Durham and Chester-le-Street PCT, a local dental access scheme has been developed at a cost of &pound;65,770 from central funds. Under the scheme, 10practices, which were not previously taking on new NHS patients, have been funded to provide an agreed number of new patient contacts. From September 2004, the scheme has delivered 1,000 additional NHS appointments and expects shortly to deliver a further 300 appointments. As a result, between late September and November, all patients seeking a NHS dentist should have been able to access occasional NHS dental treatment and, in addition, some were able to register with a NHS dentist.</p>

It will take five years to implement LBC across England as all staff, who read the tests or take the tests will have to be retrained. The Department is providing &pound;1.2 million for 2003&ndash;04 and &pound;6 million for 2004&ndash;05 to kick-start this process. The nine regional cytology training schools in England are being converted to train the rest of the programme. As of January 2005, eight out of the nine training schools in England had been trained or had a specific date to begin their retraining. The ninth is awaiting a local decision on which system they will use.</p>

	<p pid="a.489W.2/1">The Government have put in place a programme of national health service investment and reform since 1997 to improve service delivery in all parts of the United Kingdom. There is significant evidence that these policies have yielded considerable benefits for the Blackpool South constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/2">For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/3" class="indent">At the end of November 2004, the number of people waiting more than nine months for in-patient treatment within Blackpool Primary Care Trust (PCT) has fallen to zero, from 342 in June 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/4" class="indent">At the end of September 2004, the number of patients waiting over 13 weeks for out-patient treatment within Blackpool PCT has fallen to 260, from 724 in June 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/5" class="indent">In June 2003, at Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre Hospitals NHS Trust, 87.9 per cent. of patients spent less than four hours in accident and emergency from arrival to admission, transfer or discharge. Figures for September 2004 show an improvement to 93. per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/6" class="indent">The latest figures, September 2004, show that all urgent general practitioner referrals with suspected cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/7" class="indent">Figures for December 2004 show that all patients within Blackpool PCT are able to be offered an appointment with a GP within two working days and a primary care professional within one working day.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/8" class="indent">In 1997&ndash;98 the Lancashire Ambulance Service was able to attend 66.1 per cent. of category A emergency calls within eight minutes. During 2003&ndash;04, 77.7 per cent. of category A emergency calls were attended within eight minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/9" class="indent">Work has started on a 5.8 million twin theatre day case unit at Blackpool Victoria hospital. This is due for completion in March 2006. The new facility will enable the hospital to increase the number of operations it carries out as day cases and will help cut waiting times for patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/10" class="indent">A new &pound;45 million regional cardiac centre is being developed at the Blackpool Victoria hospital, which is scheduled to open in 2006. This will increase the number of beds by 38 and provide three additional operating theatres. There will also be a new 10-bed high dependency unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/11" class="indent">A second computed tomography scanner became operational at the Blackpool Victoria hospital in April 2004, enabling an extra 4,600 scans to be undertaken each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.489W.2/12" class="indent">Fleetwood hospital is to undergo a &pound;2.6 million redevelopment, providing additional x-ray equipment, treatment rooms, a new endoscopy unit and a new main entrance to the hospital. This is due to be completed in June 2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.492W.8/1">The Health Protection Agency rapid review panel assesses all products for which applications have been received from companies, provided the product falls within the panel's remit. There are currently 58 product reports available on the Health Protection Agency's website, together with the minutes of the panel meetings and a list of products reviewed by the panel. This information can be found at <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/rapid_review/">www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/rapid_review/</a>. A further 25 applications received since <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-13">13 January</phrase> will be reviewed later this month. Information on those products awaiting review is not publicly available as information provided by applicants is regarded as commercial in confidence until the applications have been assessed.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.8/2">Of the 58 reports available on the panel's website so far, 19 contain recommendations for further research and development before the product is ready for evaluation and 10 contain recommendations for in-use evaluation/trial in a national health service clinical setting. Two products have been identified as showing benefits that should be available to NHS bodies to use as appropriate. These products are being considered for inclusion in future workplans for the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (PASA) and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. Information on which products are currently used in NHS facilities is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.492W.8/3">Where the rapid review panel suggests further work, it is generally the company's responsibility to organise this; the panel itself does not organise product evaluations. Some evaluations may be performed as part of normal PASA tendering exercises. Also, some products may be included in the Department's research and development programme for healthcare associated infection if it is thought they may have a particular impact in a priority area.</p>

Agency framework agreements have been negotiated with external agencies providing temporary staff to NHS employers, to drive up standards and improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness. NHS Professionals has been established as a special health authority to bring greater co-ordination and consistency to the use of temporary staff within the NHS and in turn, offer better quality patient care and better value for money.</p>

HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>

	<p pid="a.508W.0/2">The Ml motorway is equipped with cameras for traffic and incident management purposes such as comprehensive surveillance of accidents, traffic and weather conditions. They do not measure individual vehicle speed. However, some cameras measure the average speed of the traffic for the purposes of setting automatic queue-warning signs. These cameras are not used for speed enforcement. The provision of CCTV cameras is controlled by departmental standards and they can only be used for the purposes described. Most cameras are fixed to free-standing masts installed in the motorway verge. In Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, 12 cameras (installed early in 2004) have been fitted to traffic message sign gantries.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.0/3">On the Al just north of the end of the Ml near Wetherby, a number of traffic and incident management cameras are being provided on message sign gantries. These works are part of the ongoing Al Darrington to Dishforth Design Build Finance and Operate (DBFO) scheme which is converting parts of the Al into new motorway.</p>
	<p pid="a.508W.0/4">These cameras have all been provided as part of a much larger project, thus an accurate cost of camera only provision cannot be determined. However it is estimated that the typical cost of installing a single camera on a traffic message sign gantry and making it operational is around &pound;15,000.</p>

Members of parish and town councils have the same rights as any other citizen. The Licensing Act 2003 provides that interested parties, including persons living or involved in a business in the vicinity of a premises or bodies representing them, may make representations about applications for provisional statements and about the grant or variation of premises licences or club premises certificates, except where a simple conversion of an existing licence or certificate is made under the grandfather rights provisions in Schedule 8 of the Act. Interested parties may also apply for a review of a licence or certificate at any time as well as make representations about a review once it has been applied for. Representations must be about the effects of the application on the promotion of the licensing objectives. Members of parish and town councils will be able to make representations if they are interested parties under the terms of the Act. They are not free to make representations in their own right unless they live in the vicinity of the premises concerned. However, there is nothing to prevent a council member acting on behalf of any resident living in the vicinity of the premises and making the representations that the resident would like to have made.</p>

	<p pid="a.515W.3/1">The Government have introduced a range of programmes to reduce crime committed by young people which also have an impact on antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/2">The Home Office is supporting a wide range of schemes targeted at young people who are most at risk. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/3" class="indent">Youth Inclusion Programmes (YIPS), Youth Inclusion and Support Panels (YISP) and Positive Futures.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/4" class="indent">The Youth Inclusion Programmes (YIPs) and Youth Inclusion and Support Panels (YISPS) are part of the Government's wider programme to target young people at risk of getting involved in criminal and antisocial behaviour. These are essentially intensive intervention programmes that target the risk factors often associated with young people's offending.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/5" class="indent">Positive Futures programme was launched in March 2000 and is targeted at 10&ndash;19 year olds living in the most deprived neighbourhoods in England and Wales. Its objective is to have a positive influence on drug use and other negative behaviours of vulnerable young people. Since its launch over 51,000 young people have taken regular part in Positive Futures activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.515W.3/6">The Government will also be publishing in the near future a green paper on young people, which will consult on proposals for more places to go and things to do for teenagers, as well as on ways to improve advice and support on the choices and challenges they face. The proposals in the green paper are intended to contribute to the Government's efforts to divert youngsters from crime and antisocial behaviour, and more generally to contribute to positive outcomes for teenagers. There is evidence that a lack of things to do can lead people into offending. A 2003 MORI/Youth Justice Board Survey showed that 25 per cent. of offenders in mainstream education and 42 per cent. of school-excluded offenders said their motive for offending was they were bored. There will be a specific focus within the green paper on those who are at risk of crime and antisocial behaviour, and other poor outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="a.516W.5/1">The British Crime Survey (BCS) is the most reliable and robust measure of crime in England and Wales today. Although no formal evaluation of the BCS has been undertaken, both the criminological and policing communities respect it as an authoritative measure of crime trends. The overwhelming value of the BCS is that it provides the most reliable measurement of crime trends as it has measured crime consistently since 1981.</p>
	<p pid="a.516W.5/2">The BCS provides the best reflection of the true extent of crime because it also includes crimes that are not reported to the police. We have never claimed that the BCS counts all crimes that occur in England and Wales, but rather that it provides a reliable measure of trends in the crimes that it does count from one year to the next. The design of the survey ensures statistically robust data is obtained. The BCS count also gives a better indication of trends in crime over time than police recorded crime because it is unaffected by changes in levels of reporting to the police and in police recording practices.</p>

	<p pid="a.518W.9/1">The Government are firmly committed to tackling illegal migrant working. Our strategy involves increasing enforcing capacity, encouraging compliance by business, and developing joint working between agencies responsible for enforcing workplace regulations. In 2004, the UK Immigration Service carried out 1,600 enforcement operations against illegal work, a 360 per cent. increase on the previous year, and apprehended 3,330 illegal migrant workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.518W.9/2">During the course of 2004, we strengthened section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, the law preventing illegal migrant working, by adjusting the requirement on employers to check and copy certain documents for prospective employees, and by making the summary offence under section 8 triable either way. Following conviction on indictment, there is no upper limit to the level of fine that can be imposed. We introduced a new, separate criminal offence of trafficking for the purpose of exploitation. We also provided monitored access to our labour market for EU accession state workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.518W.9/3">As we made clear in our five-year strategy for asylum and immigration, we are continuing to examine ways to develop joint working and the sharing of intelligence between workplace enforcement agencies. We will pilot a joint team from April this year to target the use of illegal migrant workers in the West Midlands and explore the scope for closer collaboration between departments. We are setting up a new authority to regulate gangmasters in the agricultural and shellfish gathering sectors. We will also introduce civil penalties for employers found to be using illegal workers. In the longer term, the establishment of a national identity card system will provide a simple and secure means of verifying entitlement to work in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.524W.2/1">The Department for Education and Skills has commissioned an evaluation of the Toe by Toe scheme, run by the Shannon Trust. The evaluative exercise offers a structured analysis that will identify the success factors in the secure estate, determine the role of the learner/tutor relationship in the scheme's success, and consider its applicability to all learners. The evaluation will ascertain the potential for mainstreaming the scheme within the wider Skills for Life learning community and establishing stronger links with the overall Skills for Life initiative.</p>

	<p pid="a.535W.2/1">The Marriage and Relationship Support Grant (MARS) has provided funding of &pound;4.9 million in 2004&ndash;05 to voluntary and community sector groups specialising in the provision of help, advice and information to support people to maintain successful relationships with their partners. The MARS Grant does not directly fund the provision of counselling services. It is used for work to prevent relationship problems and so to provide a stable environment for any children in the family.</p>
	<p pid="a.535W.2/2">The MARS Grant has now been amalgamated with the former Family Support Grant to form the Strengthening Families Grant. The same amount of money is available for relationship support.

	<p pid="a.541W.2/1">Stockton South has two Sure Start local programmes (Parkfield &amp; Victoria and Mandale, Village &amp; Stainsby) approved by the Sure Start Unit in December 2002 supporting around 1,560 young children and their families living in the area. They deliver a wide range of child, family health and parental support services seeing on average around 17 per cent. of these children. The Parkfield and Victoria local programme has visited 100 per cent. of families with newborn babies within the first two months of their child's life.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.2/2">Linked to these programmes are two neighbourhood nurseries delivering a total of 100 full daycare places. Both programmes were designated as children's centres in September 2004 and are contributing towards achieving our goal of a children's centre in every community by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.541W.5/1">Telford and Wrekin local authority is served by two Sure Start local programmes: Sure Start Lawley Plus, which serves the communities in Lawley, Arleston and College, The Rock, Overdale and Newdale and Ketley Bank; and Sure Start Jubilee, which serves Madeley, Woodside and Cuckoo Oak. The programmes between them support over 1500 local young children and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.5/2">Prior to the establishment of Sure Start Lawley Plus at the end of 1999, the area was identified as an isolated area with no early years infrastructure. It now has a nursery closely integrated with the local primary school and with social care and health services. It has strong links with the Carpenter Family Centre which has a parent and toddler group and training sessions. The programme also supports mothers with post-natal depression. It had meaningful contact with over 95 per cent. of the children in its catchment area in the year ending <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.5/3">Sure Start Jubilee was approved in early 2003. It offers a range of services including family support through home visiting, parenting support, baby massage, home safety promotion and reading and early language development and support. It has had some success in reducing smoking during pregnancy and just under 19 per cent. of the mothers in the area gave up smoking prior to or during pregnancy. It is using its &pound;1 million capital allocation towards two children's centres. One of these, Woodside children's centre will create a 64 place day nursery and family room in a building to which the PCT's health visiting team will relocate alongside the Sure Start team. The other, Sutton Hill children's centre will create 42 full day care places, training facilities and a health room. Although it was a very new programme at the time and had no dedicated building from which to deliver services, it had already had meaningful contact with some 17 per cent. of the children in its catchment area in the three months between its establishment and <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.541W.5/4">In addition to these services, between April 2003 and March 2004, both programmes contacted all pregnant women in their areas to give ante-natal advice and support. They also both visited 100 per cent. of these families within two months of the baby being born. In the last annual satisfaction survey, some 92 per cent. of families who responded said they were satisfied or very satisfied with the local services for young children.</p>

	<p pid="a.542W.2/1">One Sure Start programme serves both the Whitmore Reans and Dunstall areas. It was approved in 2001 and supports around 870 young local children and their families. It delivers a wide range of services to support local families including family support in partnership with the Primary Care Trust (PCT); a support group for single parents; the provision of healthy eating advice to families, provision of safety equipment on a loan basis to families at a subsidised rate; a toy library; a cr&egrave;che; play and stay as well as play groups; additional home visits by qualified midwife and health visitors and early assessment and referral for children with development delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.2/2">Since opening, this programme has helped to improve the quality of life for local families. For example it works closely with the smoking cessation programme run by the PCT and all staff have received training in ways to support parents and families who may want to give up smoking. All staff have been trained to be able to identify children with delayed language development and either apply strategies recommended by therapists or refer the families for specialist help.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.2/3">Local health visitors report back to the local programme on all women identified with post natal depression&mdash;so that support can be offered.</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.2/4">Programme Monitoring shows that the programme has seen 700 of the 870 children in their catchment area since the programme opened (81 per cent.).</p>
	<p pid="a.542W.2/5">The programme has strong parental participation both on the management board, which has six parent representatives with a parent vice chair and in activities where parents act as volunteers. It has a volunteer policy which aims to match skills gaps within the programme to the skills of the parents within the catchment area. This is used as a stepping stone to further training and ultimately employment. Volunteer parents can access all the training available to the programme staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.543W.6/2">Students wishing to follow a vocational pathway are currently able to gain access through a number of routes. These are available to all students. The Department's increased flexibility for 14 to 16-year-olds' programme creates and promotes enhanced vocational and work related learning opportunities. Our young apprenticeships programme also offers well motivated 14 to 16-year-olds the opportunity to pursue industry specific vocational programmes outside of school in partnership with employers. In September 2004 work related learning at Key Stage 4 became a statutory requirement. 8 GCSEs in vocational subjects were introduced in September 2002. Apprenticeships and advanced apprenticeships offer structured programmes of training in a wide range of occupations leading to a recognised qualification for learners of foundation degrees). We will shortly be publishing a White Paper which will set out our future plans for 14to19-year-olds.</p>

An estimate of the confidence interval is provided, to aid with interpretation. Where fewer than 10 people who took part in the survey in a given LEA were NEET, the information has been suppressed as it would be potentially disclosive or particularly unreliable.</p>

In respect of overseas travel by Ministers, since 1999 the Government has published an annual list of all visits overseas undertaken by Cabinet Ministers costing &pound;500 or more during each financial year. Where RAF/private charter aircraft are used this is shown in the list. The Government has also published on an annual basis the cost of all Ministers' visits overseas.

The full statement is available in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.549W.2/2">The provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the European Union with due regard to the principle of subsidiarity and to the member states only when they are implementing Union Law. The Charter does not extend the scope of application of Union Law beyond the existing powers of the Union or establish any new power or task for the Union. Nor does it modify powers and tasks defined in the other parts of the constitutional treaty, which specifically excludes EU action on legislative areas such as pay, the right of association, the right to strike and the right to impose lock-outs.</p>
	<p pid="a.549W.2/3">UK legislation on industrial relations maintains a balance between workers' rights to pursue legitimate disputes and employers' rights to conduct business without disruption from illegitimate industrial action. The Charter will not alter that balance.</p>

	<p pid="a.551W.2/2">We have also been considering the position of homeworkers as part of the Employment Status Review and aim to issue a response this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.557W.6/1">In recent months the Planning Service has been reviewing the rapidly increasing and unprecedented workload pressures being faced by the agency. After careful consideration of the available options, it was decided to concentrate as much of the agency's resources as possible for a period of time on the operational side of the business.</p>
	<p pid="a.557W.6/2">The reallocation of staff has had a knock-on effect on emerging area plans. Work is continuing on those plans that are at an advanced stage in the preparation process. However, progress on the remaining area plans, including Antrim, Ballymena and Larne, will be slower then previously programmed.</p>
	<p pid="a.557W.6/3">The importance of delivering full area plan coverage is recognised and the Planning Service will move forward with the area plan programme as quickly as is feasible. At this point in time it is not possible to say precisely when this will be. Much will depend on how quickly the pressure on the operational side can be reduced. An announcement on revised timescales for the area plan programme, including the Antrim, Ballymena and Larne area plan, will be made in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.561W.8/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Malcolm McKibbin to Mr. Nigel Dodds, dated February 2005</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.8/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding the number of party election posters that were removed in each constituency by the Roads Service in each year since 1997 because they were not removed by the party responsible within the stipulated period; what the cost was in each year; and in what cases recompense was sought from the responsible party. (216411). I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive or Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.8/4" class="indent">I should explain that the erection of election posters is governed by planning legislation and I understand that the Department of the Environment's Planning Service practice is to write to all political parties prior to elections, advising of the statutory regulations for the display of election posters. Under current legislation, all election posters are required to be removed within 14 days after the close of the relevant poll to which they relate.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.8/5" class="indent">Although permission is not required from Roads Service for parties to erect election posters on our property, we have powers under Article 87 of the Roads (NI) Order 1993 to remove advertising signs, including election posters, from our property, to seek the recovery of costs and to prosecute those responsible for the signs. In practice, we prefer to persuade offenders to remove such signs themselves and only take stronger action if this proves necessary. Our approach normally begins with a courtesy call to the individual or organisation concerned and this action usually results in the vast majority of posters being removed.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.8/6" class="indent">With regard to the recovery of costs involved, Roads Service policy prior to 2001 was to remove election posters without seeking reimbursement from the political parties. Consequently, there is no record of the number of posters removed, or the cost incurred by Roads Service, before 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.561W.8/7" class="indent">Roads Service does not maintain details of the removal of election posters on a parliamentary constituency basis, however, the table below shows the posters removed by Roads Service Eastern Divisional area since 2001. Other Divisions have confirmed that requests to constituency offices for posters to be removed from specific locations have usually resulted in their removal and, that on the few occasions where posters have had to be removed by Roads Service staff, no records were kept.</p>

	<p pid="a.568W.0/1">Hillsborough Castle is the official residence of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The facilities at the castle are also used to provide official hospitality, overnight accommodation and to carry out other official business. The range of activities can include political meetings, hospitality for visiting dignitaries, the Secretary of State's garden party, and citizenship ceremonies. In addition to its use by the Northern Ireland Office and other Government Departments, charities and local community groups can request to use the facilities, generally for fund raising purposes, and the castle and grounds are open at certain times of the year for guided tours.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.0/2">The total cost of running Hillsborough Castle in the 2003&ndash;04 financial year was &pound;1,285,224.08. This includes the maintenance of the listed building and grounds; the security of the castle and its grounds and that of Ministers, officials and visitors while present at the castle. It also includes the cost hosting of the events listed above, as well as catering, hospitality and administration.</p>
	<p pid="a.568W.0/3">The Secretary of State is on duty while at Hillsborough Castle and therefore his costs count as official expense.</p>

	<p pid="a.571W.5/1">There are currently no development proposals for any post-primary schools in Antrim.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.5/2">I am aware that following concern about the significant decline in the enrolment at Massereene Community College the North Eastern Education andLibrary Board (NEELB), which has responsibility forthe school, decided to explore options for the future of controlled secondary education in Antrim town. These options formed the basis of a consultation process carried out by the NEELB between September-November 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.5/3">The consultation took the form of meetings and a questionnaire. The questionnaire sought views on the proposed closure of Massereene Community College and interim arrangements to transfer all pupils to Parkhall College. It also asked parents of children of compulsory school age their views on the current choice of secondary school provision in the Antrim borough council area and on integrated education.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.5/4">The NEELB has advised that the consultation identified opposition to the proposed closure of Massereene College and to the prospect of mobile accommodation on the Parkhall College site in order to accommodate the combined enrolments.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.5/5">The majority of parents who responded to the questionnaire said they were satisfied with the current choice of post-primary school in Antrim and a majority also indicated that they were supportive of integrated education, and would consider sending their children to an integrated post-primary school in the town.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.5/6">The results of the consultation are due to be considered shortly by the North Eastern Education and Library Board.</p>

	<p pid="a.575W.0/1">Tackling disadvantage is one of the five key aims for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Achieving government child poverty targets is an important part of this work.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has made a significant input into the Child Poverty Review, which includes measures to contribute towards the long-term goal of halving and eradicating child poverty, including:</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/3" class="indent">a 50 per cent. increase in the rate of social house building by 2008 providing 10 000 extra dwellings per year as outlined in Sustainable Communities: Homes For All&quot; to help achieve the target to halve the number of households living in Temporary accommodation by 2010;</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/4" class="indent">increasing investment in homelessness prevention;</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/5" class="indent">Providing &pound;1.7 billion per year through the Supporting People (SP) programme to help vulnerable people sustain independent living including teenage parents or women fleeing from domestic violence, with benefit to their children;</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/6" class="indent">a &pound;1.2 billion market renewal programme up to 2008;</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/7" class="indent">a new PS A target: by 2010, to bring all social housing into a decent condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/8" class="italic">Progress</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/9">The proportion of vulnerable households&mdash;including families with children&mdash;living in decent homes in the private sector, increased from 57 per cent. in 2001 to 63 per cent. in 2003. New data from English Housing Condition Survey confirms the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is ahead of expected progress towards its PSA target for the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/10">We have succeeded in ending the scandal of homeless families having to raise their children for long periods in cramped B&amp;B hotels. There were 96 per cent. fewer families with children living long-term in B&amp;B hotels in September 2004 than in March 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/11">The Housing Act 2004 contains measures aimed at helping the most at risk from poor conditions and irresponsible landlords. Part 1 of the Act contains provisions to replace the housing fitness standard (also one of the criteria of the decent home standard) by an evidence based risk assessment procedure, the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS). HHSRS will help focus decisions about housing conditions on the hazards which impact on the health and safety of vulnerable occupants, including children. The measures are likely to be implemented this autumn.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/12">The Housing Act also enables us to amend the statutory overcrowding standards through secondary legislation. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister intends to consult on this.</p>

	<p pid="a.580W.3/1">The UK, as lead nation, is committed to supporting the Afghan Government in the implementation of their comprehensive National Drug Control Strategy and, in particular, the 1384 (2005) Counter Narcotics Implementation Plan. President Karzai launched the plan during the visit of my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary to Kabul on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-16">16 February</phrase>. The eight pillars of the plan include the development of the criminal justice system, the creation of alternative livelihoods for farmers and strengthening interdiction and law enforcement measures. The UK and its international partners are supporting many projects across all of these strands. It is too early to make an assessment of cultivation in 2005 but due to a number of factors there may be reduced planting this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.580W.3/2">I also refer the hon. Member to the written statement I made on Afghanistan: Counter Narcotics on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-29">29 November 2004</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2004-11-29.17WS"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 17&ndash;18WS</phrase>; I hope to make a further statement shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.580W.3/3">Since then, we have increased our efforts on alternative livelihoods for poppy growers to $50 million this year, bringing to $100 million the amount the UK is spending this year on counter narcotics activity in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.580W.3/4">The creation of alternative livelihood opportunities and an effective agricultural sector is crucial both forcounter narcotics efforts and for Afghanistan's longer-term development. An estimated 80 per cent. of the country's labour force are employed in the agricultural sector, though individuals' livelihoods strategies are often complex and may involve a number of different types of income generating activity. Action to develop licit alternative rural livelihoods must take place on many levels and include both long-term development and short-term measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.580W.3/5">However, rural development assistance is provided to all provinces across Afghanistan through national programmes managed by the Ministry for Reconstruction and Rural Development (MRRD), funded from the national development budget (and, soon, the new Counter Narcotics Trust Fund) and supported by the international community. Each programme focuses on redeveloping the infrastructure and underlying conditions necessary for growth, the development of an effective agricultural sector and viable licit alternatives to poppy cultivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.580W.3/6">Short-term seed delivery programmes are being implemented by donors, such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation. The World Bank recently committed US$75 million for quick disbursing activities on alternative livelihoods and is currently developing an accelerated integrated rural development programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.587W.0/1">The promotion of democracy, alongside human rights, the rule of law and good governance is a thread which runs through all of the Government's foreign policy. These issues are mainstreamed throughout everything the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) does. At the strategic level, this is highlighted by two of the FCO's eight strategic priorities aiming to support the development of democracy and the rule of law (Strategic Priority 3: An international system based on the rule of law, which is better able to resolve disputes and prevent conflicts; and Strategic Priority 6: Sustainable Development, underpinned by democracy, good governance and human rights).</p>
	<p pid="a.587W.0/2">At an operational level we adapt our approach onthese issues to reflect the situation in the countries inwhich we work. This might range from; what might be considered traditional diplomatic measures (e.g.advocacy; resolutions in international fora; or sanctions); it may mean technical capacity building to support an emerging democratic culture in a country with no history of participatory government; or it may mean working in partnership with more established democracies to reinforce democracy in third countries, or to improve transparency and accountability throughout the international system. We also promote democracy, human rights, the rule of law and good governance in international fora, and press countries to adhere to the commitments they've signed up to in these bodies.</p>

	<p pid="a.596W.6/1">The Ministry of Defence is continually restructuring. Currently this is being taken forward in the context of the Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities White Paper, published in July 2004. This set out our requirement for flexible and adaptable Armed Forces supported to carry out the most likely expeditionary operations. In order to better meet these operational requirements we are reducing force levels in certain capabilities in order to invest more in higher priority capabilities. The overall financial effect of the restructuring process will be that we are able to spend more on those capabilities able to deliver the effects we require. That will mean we are able to deploy our resources to optimum effect. Overall, the Spending Review 2004 settlement provided a 3.7 billion increase to the Defence budget. This represents the longest period of sustained real growth in defence spending for over 20 years.</p>

Exchanges take place at Chief of Staff level across all the services. Pol-mil Defence Staff talks are established on a regular cycle, as are single service staff talks. Given the constraints in the Japanese constitution there have been no joint military exercises. However, we have given advice and assistance to Japan in the context of her peace support mission in southern Iraq, where the Japanese contingent works within the framework of MND(SE).</p>

	<p pid="a.599W.9/1">A key feature of the original Defence Evaluation and Research Agency Public Private Partnership was to bring in a strategic partner to improve the management of QinetiQ and help grow the business in preparation for its transfer to the private sector. Although the Ministry of Defence continues to hold a majority equity stake in QinetiQ, operational control of the company is exercised by The Carlyle Group as the Government's strategic partner. This injection of private sector resource and expertise is contributing to the growth of the company and hence to the value of the Government's shareholding.</p>

	<p pid="a.600W.3/1">At the time of the suspension of Remote Ammunitioning Facility Tamar in 2002, &pound;15 million had been spent on works (covering design, ammunition clearance, dredging and site preparation). Subsequent cancellation and project management costs have increased expenditure to a total of &pound;25 million and this has been highlighted as a potential constructive loss in the departmental annual accounts for financial year 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid="a.600W.3/2">A number of environmental assessments were carried out prior to the commencement of the RAFT project. The first in 1996, was carried out by Babtie, the Ministry of Defence's Project Manager. In 1998, the Babtie Group carried out a desktop archaeological study to review the potential effect of RAFT on existing scheduled monuments at Bullpoint. This was followed by a supplementary report on the effects of RAFT dredging on potential buried archaeological artefacts in peat deposits in the riverbed. An Ecological Study, also in 1998 and carried out by Panscape Consultancy, considered the potential impact of RAFT on the key habitats and species in Plymouth Sound and its estuaries. In addition, a Baseline Environmental Survey of Estuarine Sediment and Benthic Macrofauna, carried out by Zeneca and which supplemented the Ecological Study, assessed the potential environmental impact of dredging on surface sediments and resident worms. In 1999, an extensive hydraulic modelling study was undertaken by Hydraulics Research Wallingford, which covered the potential effects of dredging on the River Tamar (in particular on the salmon), the inter-tidal habitats of the Tamar and the salt marshes in the Upper Tamar estuary. A detailed sedimentation study was carried out of the whole tidal extent of the Tamar rather than just the local area of RAFT. The conclusions and results were overseen by an independent expert appointed by English Nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.600W.3/3">In 2000, during the lifetime of the RAFT project and following award of the construction contract, a Conservation Management Plan was jointly produced with English Nature and the Environment Agency. In support of this plan, extensive mitigation measures were applied, including noise pollution monitoring of the surrounding areas and water quality monitoring in the River Tamar, during the dredging. The Environment Agency has recently confirmed that, as a result of this mitigation, there have been no permanent effects on fish stocks in the river.</p>

	<p pid="a.601W.2/1">Preventing conflict is a key objective for the Ministry of Defence (MOD). It underpins the successful delivery of the defence aim, to deliver security for the people of the United Kingdom and the Overseas Territories, and to act as a force for good by strengthening international peace and stability. Consequently, much of MOD and the armed forces' operational and non-operational activity, together with the associated research work and military equipment development and procurement programmes that support these activities, contribute in some way to HMG's wider conflict prevention efforts around the world. This is particularly true of the work that MOD carries out in conjunction with FCO and DFID through the separately funded Conflict Prevention Pools. More information on this activity can be found on the FCO website.</p>

	<p pid="a.601W.8/1">The Ministry of Defence has no requirement to retain spend information against individual shipping lines. Also, while some bookings may be made direct with shipping lines, others are placed through agents/freight-forwarders and spend will be recorded against them and not the shipping lines used. As the MOD operates a financial regime of disaggregated budgets, bookings can be made by units throughout the United Kingdom and overseas. For these reasons the spend requested is not held centrally or in a form which could be easily extracted and without disproportionate cost. The only spend information readily available is that against P&amp;O shipping companies for invoices submitted through the Defence Bills Agency which is shown in the table.</p>

In respect of overseas travel by Ministers, since 1999 the Government have published an annual list of all visits overseas undertaken by Cabinet Ministers costing &pound;500 or more during each financial year.

Where RAF/private charter aircraft are used this is shown in the list. The Government have also published on an annual basis the cost of all Ministers' visits overseas.

	<p pid="a.603W.8/1">The information is not available in the format requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.8/2">Estimates of the total amount council tax benefit that went unclaimed in 2002&ndash;03, the latest year for which information is available, can be found in the Department's report entitled: Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-Up in 2002&ndash;03&quot;; copies of which are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.8/3">Council tax benefit already makes a valuable contribution in providing financial security for nearly 5 million households responsible for paying council tax. But encouraging those who are still to claim is very much at the heart of our agenda. This is why we launched a campaign in the lead-up to last year's council tax billing round. And why we are continuing to support local authorities in the lead up to, and during, this year's billing round, to make sure they have procedures in place locally to encourage people to apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.8/4">We have already issued new versions of the posters and flyer with the headline Cut your Council Tax&mdash;Find out if you should be paying less&quot; and have arranged for the flyer to go out with the winter fuel payment letters to around 12 million pensioners in around eight million households.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.8/5">We have contacted over 20,000 organisations that deal with older people, to update them on the continuing campaign to raise awareness of council tax benefit, and have arranged for the flyer to be available via displays in doctors' surgeries. Electronic versions of the flyer are also available for local authorities to download and customise to include in with this year's council tax bills if they do not already have their own local products.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.8/6">A further round of press advertising, some national but mainly regional, started in January, with a second round of regional advertising due to start in early March, again to coincide with the issue of the council tax bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.8/7">The Pension Service are already doing much to promote council tax benefit take-up, from issuing a housing benefit/council tax benefit claim form to everyone who calls the pension credit application line and wishes to claim, to helping people fill in this form when visiting pensioners to take a claim for pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.8/8">The Link-Age Programme (which is building an integrated network of services for older people) is joining up existing service providers to offer a more holistic service to pensioners. Partnerships are being developed between The Pension Service and local authorities and joint teams of staff from both organisations are already operational in over 30 local authority areas, and are being rolled out nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.8/9">A new &pound;13 million fund&mdash;The Partnership Fund&mdash;was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-25">25 January 2005</phrase>, providing up to two years' funding to around 170 organisations across Great Britain to finance local initiatives to improve take-up of older people's benefits, particularly those in hard to reach groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.8/10">The Pension Service have also recently provided local authorities with details of those people in their area claiming pension credit but not claiming housing benefit or council tax benefit, for authorities to use to complement their own take-up activities.</p>

We recognise that a person's health condition can affect their ability to work in varying degrees, sometimes making work very unlikely, but sometimes leaving a good prospect of a return to work.</p>

	<p pid="a.611W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from David Anderson to Simon Hughes, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.611W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning our plans for closing and retaining Jobcentres, and the timescale for completing the transformation of Jobcentre Plus. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.611W.2/4" class="indent">I have placed in the Library a list of sites planned for closure as part of the Jobcentre Plus rollout programme and activity to centralise benefit processing. This list includes a number of sites which are closing through merging with co-located offices. While the majority of these sites will be disposed of in due course, a number will be retained by Jobcentre Plus to accommodate non-customer facing activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.611W.2/5" class="indent">I have also placed in the Library a list of our planned Local Service Outlets&mdash;those customer-facing offices providing access to our services. This listing includes what we refer to as Flexible Service Delivery sites, where we are working with local partners to provide access to services through third party premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.611W.2/6" class="indent">I should stress that this is a snapshot of our plans based on the best information available. The lists of offices will inevitably change as we progress through rollout of the new, integrated service and continue to refine our plans for centralising benefit processing in Jobcentre Plus. For example, a significant number of the site closures are dependent on construction of new buildings or acquisition of new premises and these are often subject to delays and other issues. I would also expect the number of Flexible Service Delivery sites to increase significantly as we conclude local discussions with partners on arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.611W.2/7" class="indent">We continue to review the plans for our network as the reducing headcount is impacted on all parts of the business, and we may have to reconsider the future viability of a number of sites in this context. Completing the rollout of the new service and centralising benefit processing at the same time is a challenging programme of work and I can assure you that providing customer service is at the centre of decisions we make. We will also ensure that local stakeholders are kept informed of progress and any changes to our plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.611W.2/8" class="indent">We are shaping the future Jobcentre Plus network in response to the changing business need. The need for face-to-face facilities for jobsearch and other aspects of our business has been superseded in many instances by new business processes and the use of information technology. For example, over the last 12months we have seen an increase of over 40 per cent. in the number of hits on our jobsearch website. Encouraging our customers to use these new channels enables us to focus on those customers who need greatest help, through the intervention of personal advisers, for example.</p>
	<p pid="a.611W.2/9" class="indent">You will see from the lists that we will retain a significant network of offices through which customers can access our services. Our current forecast is that when rollout is complete the total number of outlets from which our services can be accessed is likely to be around 1,000. On present plans, our network will be substantially complete by the Summer of next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.611W.2/10" class="indent">I hope this summary of both the current position and our future plans is helpful.</p>
