The cost benefit analysis which supports our consultation shows that state operated culling could lead to higher costs and slower delivery compared with other options. So our intention is to redeploy or release workers who have carried out cage trapping at the end of the RBCT.

Failure to comply with the terms of an abatement notice will, upon summary conviction, result in a fine of up to &pound;5,000 for domestic premises and &pound;20,000 for business premises. In addition, Section 2 of the Clean Air Act 1993 prohibits emissions of dark smoke from industrial and trade premises, which can include agricultural and horticultural premises.</p>
	<p pid="b.895W.11/2">The Government are taking further steps to regulate bonfires. The proposed Waste Management (England and Wales) Regulations 2006 would stop the unregulated burning of waste from any mine, quarry or agricultural premises.</p>

	<p pid="b.897W.2/1">Sections 3 to 9 deal with the nuisance to local residents caused by the sale and repair of vehicles on the road.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/2">These sections:</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/3" class="indent">Make it an offence to leave or cause to leave two or more vehicles on a road within 500 metres of each other where they are exposed for sale. The offence will not be committed if the sale is not for the purpose of a business of selling motor vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/4" class="indent">Make it an offence to carry out restricted works on a motor vehicle on a road. The offence is not committed if the works are legitimately needed due to a breakdown or are not for the purposes of a business. However, the business defence does not apply if the works give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/5" class="indent">Allow for the issue of a &pound;100 fixed penalty for the above offences.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/6" class="indent">Create an offence to give false information to a local authority officer.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/7" class="indent">Are enforceable by the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/8">Interim guidance on these sections was issued to local authorities on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-03">3 June 2005</phrase> and will be updated as part of the Act's full guidance issued in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/9">Sections 10&ndash;14 deal with the enforcement, removal, and disposal of abandoned vehicles and amend the Refuse Disposal Amenity Act 1978. These sections:</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/10" class="indent">Allow for the issue of a &pound;200 fixed penalty notice for the offence of abandonment.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/11" class="indent">Create an offence to give false information to a local authority officer.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/12" class="indent">Removes the requirement to give notice before removing a vehicle from occupied land where the land is on a 'road'. This will include roads running through housing estates.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/13" class="indent">Removes the requirement to give 24 hours notice before the removal of a vehicle that ought to be destroyed.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/14" class="indent">Allow for the immediate disposal of abandoned vehicles that do not display a valid tax disc and a registration plate.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/15" class="indent">Remove the requirement to wait for the expiration of a valid tax disc before disposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/16" class="indent">Gives the Government the power to issue statutory guidance that local authorities must have regard to when exercising their abandoned vehicle functions.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/17" class="indent">Are enforceable by the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/18">Interim guidance on these sections was issued to local authorities on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-18">18 October 2005</phrase> and will be updated as part of the Act's full guidance issued in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/19">Sections 28&ndash;30 make changes to fixed penalty notices for graffiti and flyposting, by amending section 43 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003. This will allow local authorities to specify the level of penalty themselves within a range that will be set out by the Secretary of State in regulations. If they do not choose to specify their own level, a default amount of &pound;75 will apply. It also widens the range of officers that will be able to issue fixed penalties for graffiti and fly-posting offences by enabling local authorities to authorise officers other than their own employees to issue them, as well as giving the power of issue to parish councils. A new section 43B will also be inserted into the 2003 Act, making it an offence for someone to fail to provide their name and address details when requested to do so by an authorised officer.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/20">These sections will help encourage more effective enforcement by increasing the number of officers with the power to address minor acts of graffiti and fly-posting, and by giving local authorities flexibility in setting the penalties that will apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/21">Section 31 of the Act will enable local authorities to require the removal of both graffiti and fly-posting where this is defacing street furniture and other relevant surfaces belonging to statutory undertakers. Currently this power is available for graffiti in 12 pilot authority areas under section 48 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003. The 2005 Act extends these provisions so that 'defacement removal notices' will be available for dealing with fly-posting as well as graffiti, thus allowing more co-ordinated removal from affected surfaces.</p>
	<p pid="b.897W.2/22">Under the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 it is an offence for anyone to sell aerosol paint to anyone under the age of 16. From <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July 2005</phrase>, this provision has been supplemented by a requirement under section 32 which places a duty on local trading standards to carry out a review of underage sales once every 12 months and take enforcement action where necessary. Guidance for the operation of section 32 and for test purchasing aerosol paints can be found on the TOGETHER website (<a href="http://www.together.gov.uk/article.asp?aid=3435">http://www.together.gov.uk/article.asp?aid=3435</a>).</p>

	<p pid="b.899W.2/1">Defra has policy responsibility for flood risk management in England. The Met Office is a Trading Fund within the Ministry of Defence and one of the world's leading providers of environmental and weather-related services. The Environment Agency is a Non-Departmental Public Body of Defra and is the principal operating authority with responsibility for flood risk management in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.899W.2/2">I understand the Met Office has analysed data relating to changes in the intensity of rain in the UK and also data relating to changes in the intensity of rain in North West Europe and countries elsewhere in the world but has not specifically compared the changes in the UK with the changes in these other regions.</p>
	<p pid="b.899W.2/3">The Met Office has looked at trends in annual average precipitation intensity in the UK over the period 1961&ndash;2004. Their assessment is that precipitation intensity has increased since 1961 by 5&ndash;10 per cent. in most parts of the UK apart from north-west England. This increase is statistically significant for East Anglia, the Midlands, south-west England, and most of Scotland. Trends in snowfall intensity have not been specifically studied but there has been a decreasing trend in days of snow cover for all parts of the UK since 1981.</p>
	<p pid="b.899W.2/4">I understand from the Environment Agency that measurement of change in peak flows and flood risk over time is difficult and not helped by the brevity of historical records and large year-on-year variations in precipitation and peak river flows.</p>
	<p pid="b.899W.2/5">The Agency is collecting high-flow data to undertake the necessary analysis in future. Recent reviews of seasonal mean river flows do show some evidence of autumn and winter increases since the 1970s.</p>

	<p pid="b.901W.5/1">Defra has overall policy responsibility for coastal erosion risk in England and grant aids local authority improvement projects to reduce this risk but does not build defences, nor direct the authorities on which specific projects to undertake. Management of coastal erosion risk and associated monitoring is the responsibility of the relevant local authority in each area.</p>
	<p pid="b.901W.5/2">Erosion risk will vary around the coastline depending on local conditions and defences in place. Defra has encouraged the relevant authorities to produce Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) which provide large-scale assessments of the risks associated with coastal processes and present long term policy frameworks to manage these risks in a sustainable manner. In 2001 Defra funded a national study of information on long term coastal processes and evolution over the next century (Futurecoast). This is designed to be used by coastal authorities to inform their current revisions of SMPs.</p>
	<p pid="b.901W.5/3">The Office of Science and Technology's Foresight Future Flooding report, published in 2004, also considered possible rates of coastal erosion under different scenarios over the next 80 years.</p>

	<p pid="b.904W.5/1">Local authorities have a duty to collect any household waste and to meet individual Statutory Performance Standards for recycling and composting of household waste. Each authority is free to choose the range of materials it collects to meet its target.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.5/2">In addition, the Household Waste Recycling Act 2003 requires waste collection authorities-subject to certain exemptions-to provide a kerbside collection service of at least two recyclable materials by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.904W.5/3">However, the Department has also put in place the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2005, &quot;the Packaging Regulations&quot; which place obligations on businesses to recover and recycle packaging waste. As the packaging waste recycling targets, set in the regulations, increase between now and 2008 it is expected that producers will have to ensure that more packaging waste is extracted from the household waste stream for recycling. Producers will therefore need to work with local authorities e.g. through their packaging compliance schemes and/or accredited reprocessors/exporters, to ensure that packaging materials can be collected by local authorities for recycling, e.g. by co-financing such collections. This is particularly so where producers' needs extend beyond the local authorities' own recycling obligations.</p>

	<p pid="b.906W.2/2">The United Kingdom (UK) Government has proposed to help developing countries to reduce emissions through a number of different activities. Highlights so far include:</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.2/3" class="indent">Consolidated support for the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP). Defra will be providing a further &pound;2.5 million pounds per year in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. In addition, the FCO will be providing funding of &pound;1 million in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 giving a total of &pound;6 million from the UK over the coming two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.2/4" class="indent">Dialogues with Latin America and China on low carbon investment strategies are under way.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.2/5">The UK is at the fore of the EU-China Partnership on Climate Change and is leading the near-Zero Emissions Coal (nZEC) project with China. The nZEC proposal was announced at the EU-China Summit on <phrase class="date" code="">5 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.2/6" class="indent">The nZEC project aims to demonstrate coal-fired power generation with carbon capture and storage technology in China by 2020. The technology has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by some 90 per cent. This is in recognition that carbon dioxide emissions from China's increasing coal use are set to double by 2030.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.2/7" class="indent">We have just signed an agreement with the Chinese Government to take this work forward (<phrase class="date" code="2005-12-21">21 December 2005</phrase>). The signing of the UK-China MoU is a significant milestone under the EU-China Partnership on Climate Change and a high profile achievement for the UK's Presidency of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.2/8">The UK actively promotes use of the Clean Development Mechanisms (COM) and COM related investments:</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.2/9" class="indent">The UK in its capacity of Presidency of the EU negotiated a package of measures for strengthened COM in Montreal; these include significant institutional and financial measures to improve the transparency and efficiency of the approval process. In particular following COP11 and COP/MOP1 some $8.8 million in additional funding has been agreed for administrative expenses of the Clean Development Mechanism (COM) in 2006&mdash;more this year than in the previous four years of operation. The UK is a major contributor, and will contribute $740,000 this coming year.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.2/10">The United Kingdom is also at the fore of the EU-lndia Initiative on Clean Development and Climate Change, with the aim of promoting cleaner technologies and their use.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.2/11" class="indent">During the early part of 2006 we are aiming to agree the Terms of Reference for the Technology Development and Transfer Study and we are hopeful that my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, may be able to formally launch the project on her visit in March.</p>
	<p pid="b.906W.2/12">Elsewhere, the UK supports research, which will help developing countries deal with climate change. Current research includes an assessment of how to improve climate modelling and monitoring for Africa, and two separate investigations into the impacts of climate change on Chinese and Indian agriculture.</p>

	<p pid="b.907W.8/1">The Environment Agency's recently published 'Life Cycle Assessment' has helped to provide an understanding of the environmental impact of disposables and the traditional type of re-usable nappy.

	<p pid="b.909W.5/1">The central part of the Ragwort Control Act is the publication of a code of practice on how to prevent the spread of ragwort. The code was published in July 2004 and provides comprehensive guidance on how to develop a cost-effective and strategic approach to weed control. It includes advice on the identification of Common Ragwort, risk assessment and priorities for control, the suitability and efficacy of control methods, environmental considerations and health and safety issues. The code of practice aims to reduce the risk of ragwort poisoning in horses and other livestock. It has been made widely available to individual land managers and also land owning institutions, such as local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.909W.5/2">The code of practice provides a yardstick against which compliance with an enforcement notice served under the Weeds Act 1959 can be measured. Together with Defra's revised procedures for investigating complaints about injurious weeds, the code of practice has enable Defra to make better use of the statutory measures available under the Weeds Act. In 2005, 69 enforcement notices were issued. Prior to the introduction of the code and the revised procedures, enforcement notices were rarely issued, if ever.</p>

	<p pid="b.914W.3/1">Within the Palace of Westminster itself, a practice nurse is available from 9 am to 5 pm at the medical suite located in the lower waiting hall, offering health advice and a minor treatment service. These services are available to all passholders. The practice nurse also assists with medical emergencies and cases of ill health whether they involve passholders or visitors to the Palace.</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.3/2">There are approximately 180 qualified first aiders across the parliamentary estate (including security personnel and staff from both Houses), of whom around 80 are trained defibrillator operators. Appropriately trained staff have access to an Epipen for emergency use in cases of anaphylactic shock.</p>
	<p pid="b.914W.3/3">The parliamentary Occupational Health, Safety and Welfare Service (OHSWS) offers a range of services, including medical screening for Members. Further details can be found on the parliamentary intranet at <a href="http://dfaweb.parliament.uk/members/medservs/medical.htm">http://dfaweb.parliament.uk/members/medservs/medical. htm</a>.Information, brochures and leaflets are available from OHSWS and information packs were distributed to all Members and Peers following the 2005 summer recess.</p>

	<p pid="b.915W.2/1">The PIMS project's aims were to provide easy access to parliamentary information for all users of the parliamentary intranet, by creating a new infrastructure for the storage, search, retrieval and management of parliamentary information held in the two Libraries. This would replace and extend the POLIS databases that had been used by the two Libraries for over 20 years, and provide a platform on which the services available to Members of both Houses of Parliament and the public might be developed further.</p>
	<p pid="b.915W.2/2">The first services went live in December 2004 supporting Commons Library inquiry handling. The main services came on stream in April 2005 with facilities for search and retrieval of material and content management. There were some initial difficulties with maintaining the currency of information in the system, and a programme of technical changes designed to improve performance was put in place and completed in November 2005. Further enhancements are to be made over the next few months before the project concludes in the spring of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.915W.2/3">A separate project is also under way to develop the parliamentary intranet building on the PIMS technology infrastructure. In addition, a business case is being prepared for a radical redesign of the Parliament website.</p>

	<p pid="b.916W.0/1">A new outline Strategic Plan, covering the period 2006 to 2011 was agreed by the Commission in July 2005. The text is available via the Commission's intranet and internet pages. This new plan confirms that the primary purpose of the House Service is to enable the House and its Members to perform their parliamentary duties effectively. Beyond this it has a duty to promote public understanding of Parliament's work and role through the provision of information and access. The plan also sets out six priority areas for the period 2006 to 2011: accommodation and works, human resources, information for the public, information management and ICT, planning and management and security. For each of these areas the board of management has developed a detailed statement of its aims for the planning period. These have been incorporated in the 2006 Corporate Business Plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.0/2">The previous strategic plan identified four on-going core tasks and eight developmental objectives for the period covered by the plan: 2001&ndash;02 to 2005&ndash;06. Pages 15&ndash;48 of the 2004&ndash;05 Commission Annual Report [HC65 2005&ndash;06] provide a description of performance against each of the core tasks. A further statement on performance will be provided in the 2005&ndash;06 Annual Report. The views of Members and other stakeholders on the implementation of elements of both the core tasks and the development objectives have been expressed in a number of ways, including reports and advice from the Administration Committee and its predecessors in the last Parliament and the Modernisation Committee, and the 2003 Survey of Services. It is anticipated that a further survey of services will be conducted during the current Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.916W.0/3">Furthermore, there have been three hour debates in Westminster Hall on each of the two most recent annual reports, in December 2004 and November 2005, and the Commission hopes that this pattern of annual debate will continue.</p>

	<p pid="b.923W.2/1">The three countries most seriously affected by Hurricane Ivan in 2004, were Grenada, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. In Grenada, we funded the provision of disaster management experts from Christian Aid UK and Oxfam UK, who worked closely on emergency projects with regional and local partners. For Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, the UK Government sent two humanitarian advisers to the region who provided initial emergency support to the relief efforts. The UK also funded Oxfam UK and Save the Children UK to send disaster management experts to Jamaica. Using this close network of partnerships helped in the exchange of disaster management expertise between the countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.923W.2/2">For the duration of the 2005 Hurricane season, DFID placed a Humanitarian and Disaster Risk Reduction Adviser in the region based in Barbados. The Adviser liaised with and provided advice to regional agencies and other development partners dealing with Disaster Risk Reduction and the continuing response to Hurricane Ivan. He also provided input to the two Caribbean Regional Donor groups for disaster coordination and response.</p>
	<p pid="b.923W.2/3">Following Hurricane Emily in July 2005, the Adviser visited Grenada and the island of Carriacou, to assess the damage and provide advice on the appropriate international response. This arrangement for the placing of UK expertise in the region will continue during the 2006 hurricane season.</p>
	<p pid="b.923W.2/4">The UK also funds a full-time Disaster Risk Reduction adviser to the Caribbean Overseas Territories. This Adviser provides ongoing expertise to these countries to strengthen and improve their disaster preparedness. He visited the Cayman Islands in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Ivan to advise on recovery planning.</p>
	<p pid="b.923W.2/5">At the regional level, after Hurricane Ivan the UK funded a technical review of hazard impacts and their effects on the built environment. DFID also contributed to the studies of the 2004 Hurricane season that underpinned the regional lesson learning conference held in Jamaica in April 2005.</p>

	<p pid="b.925W.0/1">Poor rains in much of the Horn of Africa at the end of 2005 have left many communities who are dependent on farming and raising livestock in serious difficulties. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has issued a report saying that as many as 11 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti may require assistance in 2006. The severe food shortages in parts of these countries is sadly not a new phenomenon, and DFID has been responding with humanitarian assistance for many years. We are aware of the particular threat this year, the possibility that the current crisis may deepen, and that other areas may come to be affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.925W.0/2">DFID humanitarian advisers visited the worst affected areas in Kenya in November 2005, and visits to Somalia and Ethiopia are planned for early 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.925W.0/3">This month DFID contributed &pound;1 million to the World Food Programme for Somalia on top of the over &pound;5 million we spent there on humanitarian interventions in 2005. This includes a number of health and nutrition operations in the worst affected parts of Southern Somalia.</p>
	<p pid="b.925W.0/4">In Ethiopia DFID made a commitment of &pound;43 million in March 2005 to the cash and food aid based Productive Safety Net programme. This programme provides assistance to some of the poorest communities in Ethiopia. In December 2005 we announced a further &pound;2.7 million for Kenya in response to the situation there.</p>
	<p pid="b.925W.0/5">DFID will continue to monitor the situation closely and we stand ready to provide additional support if necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.925W.3/1">Since Hurricane Ivan, DFID has remained closely engaged with the Government of Grenada. By December 2004, DFID had committed and fully disbursed &pound;6.5 million of emergency assistance: &pound;1 million was provided as emergency humanitarian support through partner agencies; &pound;5.5 million was provided as emergency financial aid to help the Government meet their public sector salary obligations. In 2005, DFID committed a total of &pound;325,000 to provide consultancy support in the forestry sector, a chartered surveyor to assess the damage done to the Governor-General's compound and the Parliament Buildings. With the US Agency for International Development, DFID co-financed debt advisers to develop proposals for the restructuring of Grenada's debt. In addition, our share of the European Commission humanitarian support and additional reconstruction funds was &pound;1.18 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.925W.3/2">Most recently, both my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for International Development and the Prime Minister, met with Prime Minister Keith Mitchell in the lead up to and during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta in November. During a meeting with Prime Minister Mitchell in May 2005, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State made clear that DFID recognised the continuing reconstruction challenges facing Grenada, and he made a commitment that DFID would review the case for additional budget support to Grenada.</p>
	<p pid="b.925W.3/3">In November 2005, following the Government of Grenada's successful debt exchange offer to creditors and their work on a home-grown economic reform programme, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) judged the financing gap for 2005 to have been reduced to a limited and manageable level of about 1 per cent. of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Given this relative success we have decided not to offer further emergency financial aid to the Government of Grenada before March 2006. However, we remain open to the IMF's projections that the financial gap may widen dramatically in the next financial year and for a number of years after that, as the current construction industry boom subsides. We will continue to keep the situation under close review.</p>
	<p pid="b.925W.3/4">DFID provided some &pound;250,000 to Cayman Islands for emergency supplies and services in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Ivan. We have not provided specific assistance for reconstruction. We understand, however, that the European Union is considering a request from the Cayman Islands Government for support to rebuild homes. DFID's focus has been aimed at improving and strengthening disaster preparedness in all UK Overseas Territories in the region. In the Cayman Islands, we also funded a study of the impact of Hurricane Ivan to help learn from the Cayman Islands' experience of handling the emergency.</p>

	<p pid="b.933W.3/2">The Highways Agency resurfaces sections of carriageway for the purpose of reducing tyre noise where there is a maintenance requirement, where it is required on safety grounds (due to loss of surface texture required for skid resistance in the wet), or as a result of general wear and tear caused by traffic.</p>

When resurfacing a carriageway, it is standard Highways Agency practice to use quieter surfacing materials. There is no additional cost for these materials compared with conventional surfacing materials as they can be laid quickly; therefore, the overall laying costs are a lot less.</p>

	<p pid="b.937W.5/1">The policy of transferring non-core trunk roads (detrunking) to local highway authorities was first set out in the White Paper &quot;A New Deal for Transport&quot; published in July 1998. Detrunking allows the Highways Agency to concentrate on the operation of the strategic trunk road network, whilst enabling local authorities to consider their own priorities for the improvement of non-core routes. The aim has been to transfer some 3,200 km (30 per cent.) of the trunk road network (as it was in April 1999) to local authorities in a phased programme. To date more than 80 per cent. (around 2,628 km) of the programme has been completed since April 2001. Prior to detrunking, the Highways Agency and local authorities agree the transfer of an appropriate level of funding for annual maintenance and in some cases for outstanding capital projects.</p>
	<p pid="b.937W.5/2">During the financial year 2005&ndash;06, six routes have been detrunked. They are:</p>

	<p pid="b.943W.5/1">The New Approach To Appraisal (NATA) was announced in the Government's 1998 White Paper &quot;A new deal for transport: better for everyone&quot;. The NATA provides a comprehensive assessment of the main impacts of a scheme on the environment, safety, the economic performance, accessibility and integration so that all the key criteria are considered in decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.5/2">NATA was first used to inform decisions taken during the 1998 Roads Review and results for 67 schemes which were candidates for the targeted programme of improvements were published in &quot;A new deal for trunk roads in England: Understanding the New Approach To Appraisal&quot;. The Highways Agency has continued to use the NATA for all major (that is, those costing more than &pound;5 million) highway schemes since then. It also introduced a simplified version of NATA for use on small schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.5/3">Subsequently, the NATA was revised to be applicable to other transport modes, including rail, light rail and bus schemes. NATA has been used for appraisal of Community Infrastructure Funding. The Department has required the use of the NATA for the appraisal of all Local Transport Plan major schemes (road and public transport) since 2000. The NATA was the basis for OPRAF's 1999 &quot;Planning Criteria&mdash;a guide to the appraisal of support for passenger rail services&quot;, revised in 2003 by the Strategic Rail Authority and published as &quot;Appraisal Criteria&mdash;a guide to the appraisal of support for passenger and freight rail services&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.5/4">The NATA has been applied to a wide range of transport projects proposed by a number of different agencies. The Department does not hold a comprehensive record of all of these projects and to compile one would be prohibitively expensive. However, the projects have been subject to the NATA before submission to Ministers in the period February 2004 to June 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.943W.5/5">NATA is used to appraise and inform the prioritisation of schemes. A range of appraisal requirements including assessments using the NATA system apply to all schemes submitted to the Department for funding, with the level of detail required in the appraisal being proportional to the scale and complexity of the scheme. For each scheme, the Appraisal Summary Table provides an indication of the impact of the scheme on each of five criteria.</p>

	<p pid="b.953W.3/21">The GAC plays a unique role in the UK in displaying works of art from its holdings in major Government buildings in the UK and abroad, in order to promote British art, culture and history. Due to the nature of Government buildings and current security issues, it is not possible for the general public to gain open access to most of the works on a daily basis. However, the buildings in which the works of art are displayed&mdash;in reception rooms, entrance halls, Minister's and ambassador's offices&mdash;all receive many thousands of visitors per year, all over the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.953W.3/22">Members of the public may consult the GAC to see individual works of art. Additionally, many Government buildings in the UK (including the GAC's own premises) are accessible during the annual Open House Weekend. The GAC also gives regular tours throughout the year round its premises, lends works of art to public exhibitions, and operates a website (<a href="http://www.gac.culture.gov.uk">www.gac.culture.gov.uk</a>) listing and illustrating all its original works of art. A growing number of historical and modern prints are being added to this.</p>

	<p pid="b.954W.2/2">Digital switchover itself does not require any equipment to be thrown away, but its timing may affect the timing of disposal of some equipment such as rarely used televisions that people choose not to adapt. This may accelerate the process by which all electrical equipment would be disposed of in the natural course of events.</p>

Details of this assessment also appear in the Government's Regulatory and Environmental Impact Assessment on the timing of digital switchover which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-16">16 September 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.954W.2/5">Any additional waste electrical equipment produced as a result of the switchover will be disposed of subject to the requirement of the EU waste electrical and electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive. The planned WEEE regulations, which implement the directive, will make producers of electrical goods financially responsible for the collection, treatment and recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment. The planned implementation of the WEEE regulations are currently under review and a new timetable for implementation will be announced shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.964W.2/1">As part of its response to Kate Barker's Review of Housing Supply, the Government are currently consulting on the introduction of planning gain supplement (PGS), which would apply to residential and non-residential land. PGS would capture a modest portion of the land value uplift created by the planning process, in order to help finance additional infrastructure, while preserving incentives to bring forward land for development.</p>
	<p pid="b.964W.2/2">PGS would not be implemented before 2008. The level of PGS has not yet been set. It is premature to attempt to estimate the amount of PGS that might be raised in Milton Keynes unitary authority in 2008 and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="b.964W.2/3">PGS would be an essentially local measure. A significant majority of PGS revenues would be recycled directly to the local level for local priorities. This would help local communities to share better the benefits of growth and manage its impacts. As part of its consultation, the Government are consulting on how PGS revenues should be recycled to the local level for local priorities and how they should be used to fund strategic infrastructure at the regional level.</p>
	<p pid="b.964W.2/4">Separate from PGS there is currently a mechanism under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 as substituted by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991 whereby parties with an interest in land may enter into a planning obligation enforceable by the local planning authority. Such planning obligations are used to make acceptable development which would otherwise be unacceptable in planning terms, for example to compensate for loss or damage created by a development or mitigate a developments' impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.964W.2/5">An approach to standardising planning obligations has been developed in Milton Keynes. Milton Keynes Partnership Committee (MKPC, which has development control powers in the Milton Keynes expansion areas) has developed a &quot;prospectus&quot; identifying and prioritising the local and strategic infrastructure needed to deliver 15,000 homes in the expansion flanks over the period to 2016. The prospectus identifies the contributions to infrastructure that will be made by developers, through planning obligations, broken down on a per dwelling basis. The s106 contribution that developers are expected to make amounts to around &pound;18,500 per dwelling, plus land for social infrastructure and affordable housing. This represents approximately one quarter of the total &pound;1.2 billion infrastructure cost of the infrastructure development identified by MKP, with the remainder to be sought from mainstream and growth area public sector funding. Further details of the expected uses of such contributions over the next five years can be found in recent MKPC papers (in particular September and December 2005) available online at: <a href="http://www.mkweb.co.uk/mkpartnership/home.asp">http://www.mkweb.co.uk/mkpartnership/home.asp</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.971W.11/1">The United Nations search for missing persons in Cyprus is both a humanitarian priority and a rare prospect for reconciliation between the two communities on the island. In 2004, we donated US$50,000 towards what we hope will become a truly successful confidence building measure. More recently, we have informed the Committee on Missing Persons and the British charity INFORCE, which is assisting in the new phase of the Committee's work, that we are happy to provide further funding of up to &pound;45,000. We expect that this contribution will go towards training forensic archaeologists from both communities in the necessary skills for continuing this important work.</p>

	<p pid="b.978W.5/1">The contractual arrangements for future oil exploration and production are a decision for the incoming Iraqi Government and the Government have not sought to influence this decision. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office did support a 2003 independent study which set out the full range of possible contractual financing arrangements to allow the rehabilitation and development of the Iraqi oil industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.5/2">Under the outgoing Iraqi Transitional Government, the Ministry of Oil was clear that the option of concluding Production Sharing Agreements would be one of a range of contracts that might be needed to help redevelop the oil industry. This is because after decades of isolation, Iraq has weak technical and managerial capacity combined with an ageing infrastructure with severely outdated production facilities. Furthermore, there has been no explorations for new fields since the 1980s and limited post-2003 investment and poor maintenance. Given the state of the infrastructure, and the US$20 billion needed for reconstruction of the oil industry, it is highly unlikely that the Iraqi Government will be able to fund investment in the oil industry itself. Without the needed investment the oil industry will not be able to fuel the required sustainable economic growth in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="b.978W.5/3">The Government reiterates, however, that the decision as to whether to conclude a Production Sharing Agreement will be for the Iraqi Government to decide.</p>

We gave careful consideration to this request, but concluded that the most effective way to achieve real improvements to the situation of the detainees was through continuing discussions about Guantanamo and detainee policy with the US authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.983W.2/2">We continue to receive correspondence from members of the public and others who have concerns about Guantanamo Bay, including about detainees who were resident in the UK. We have always made clear that we regard the circumstances under which detainees are continuing to be held in Guantanamo Bay as unacceptable. The US Government knows our views. We will continue to raise our concerns at official and ministerial level, and to work with the US authorities to resolve the issues of concern to us.</p>

	<p pid="b.985W.8/1">Release of political reporting would cause harm to the effective conduct of international relations as it depends upon maintaining trust and confidence between Governments and international organisations. This relationship allows for the free and frank exchange of information on the understanding that it will be treated in confidence. By releasing information that they have provided strictly in confidence, there is a possibility that they would refuse to share similar information in the future. This would harm the UK's ability to protect and promote its interests through international relations, which there is a strong public interest in maintaining.

However, if such an occurrence were to be drawn to the Department's attention, the Housing Executive would be asked to take remedial action as quickly as possible. I understand that a problem has been identified in the Coleraine area where residents have complained about the condition of mobile homes which are being used for decanting purposes. I am advised that with the exception of one of these mobile homes where dampness was discovered they are fit for habitation. They are, however, hard to heat in the winter and I have asked the Housing Executive, therefore, to address this issue.</p>

As part of the changes in the financial reporting procedures, occasioned by Water Service's reorganisation into a functionalised structure in 2004&ndash;05, the wage costs for all of the telemetry centres were grouped together under a single cost centre. It would therefore be difficult to extract a breakdown of the costs for 2004&ndash;05 across the 4 telemetry centres without a lengthy and costly manual exercise.</p>

	<p pid="b.1006W.5/1">Foster carers play a vital role and we are committed to ensuring that they are not discouraged from caring for children by financial issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1006W.5/2">All payments to foster carers in respect of children placed with them are disregarded in the calculation of entitlements for income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance and housing benefit. For the purposes of jobseeker's allowance, foster carers are treated as not being in remunerative work and so no account is taken of the hours spent in 'caring' for the children whom they are fostering. In cases where single foster parents are caring for a child, they are treated in the same way as lone parents in terms of their entitlement to income support (provided they meet the criteria). This means that their potential entitlement is not dependent on their availability for employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1006W.5/3">Moreover, in March 2003 Home Responsibilities Protection was extended to include foster carers. The number of years they need to work to qualify for the state pension will therefore be reduced to take into account their years of caring (including periods when they are awaiting a placement), thereby increasing their long-term financial security.</p>
	<p pid="b.1006W.5/4">Fosterline, a new advice line funded by the DfES, offers information for prospective and existing foster carers on a range of issues, including benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.1006W.5/5">More widely, we are seeking to improve the financial support that foster carers receive through the introduction of a national minimum allowance. We shall be consulting on our proposals later this month.</p>

Overall funding for further education (FE) which includes adult skills increased by 4.4 per cent. in 2005&ndash;06. Funding for non-vocational learning opportunities for adults, delivered mainly through local authority adult education services, has also increased. In 2004&ndash;05 we provided over &pound;207 million to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) in support of this learning. This has risen to &pound;210 million in 2005&ndash;06. After piloting from 2002 we have also announced the national roll-out of the National Employer Training Programme in 2006&ndash;07 with a budget rising to &pound;399 million in 2007&ndash;08. Through their dialogue with providers and their assessment of the needs of local communities, LSCs agree plans which enable colleges and other providers to deliver a wide range of learning opportunities to meet the needs of learners and employers. Literacy, numeracy and English language learning is a key priority.</p>

	<p pid="b.1008W.3/18">&quot;Performance Indicators in Higher Education&quot;, published by HESA. For 2002/03, the projected outcomes summarise the pattern of movements of students at institutions between 2002/03 and 2003/04 and give the outcomes that would have been expected from starters in 2002/03 if progression patterns were to remain unchanged over the next few years. The HESA data show the proportion of entrants who are projected to: obtain a qualification (either a first degree or another undergraduate award); transfer to another HEI; neither obtain a qualification nor transfer (i.e. fail to complete the course).</p>
	<p pid="b.1008W.3/19">One of the measures used by the Government to monitor performance in further education is the learner retention rate. The learner retention rate is the proportion of qualification aims for which all learning activities were completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1008W.3/20">Learner retention rates are published annually in a Statistical First Release (<a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000583/index.shtml">http://www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000583/index.shtml</a>). The overall learner retention rate for FE colleges was 85 per cent. in 2003/04, the latest year for which final data are available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1008W.3/21">Retention rates for individual colleges can be downloaded from the LSC website (<a href="http://benchmarkingdata.lsc.gov.uk/year8/index.cfm">http://benchmarking data.lsc.gov.uk/year8/index.cfm</a>). For the middle 80 per cent. of colleges the retention rate in 2003/04 lay in the range 78 per cent. to 91 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1008W.3/22">Retention rates are highly dependent on the mix of qualifications done at a college. A college that does few short courses and many full courses is likely to get a relatively low retention rate, simply because the national retention rate for short courses is relatively high and the national retention rate for full courses is relatively low.</p>
	<p pid="b.1008W.3/23">FE college retention rates and HE institution non-completion rates are collected in different ways and are not comparable.</p>

While the White Paper proposes a new statutory duty on local authorities to identify children missing education, it will not have any impact on local authority powers to regulate home schooling and there are no current plans to introduce compulsory registration of parents choosing to educate their children at home.</p>

	<p pid="b.1010W.5/1">London faces a range of opportunities and challenges which need distinctive and tailored solutions. One of the biggest challenges over the next few years will be the Olympics and Paralympics. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC), the body responsible for planning and funding skills in London, has made good progress in meeting the skill needs of the capital, and is committed to working with all private and public sector partners to ensure that these opportunities are realised and the challenges met.</p>
	<p pid="b.1010W.5/2">The appointment of an LSC Regional Director for London has helped to strengthen the way that the LSC is working with partners to tackle education and skills issues in the capital. The recent appointment of a new Director for Regeneration, whose responsibilities include links to the Olympics, will further strengthen its ability to deliver training and skills in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.1010W.5/3">The LSC is also undergoing a radical restructuring exercise, which will ensure that the LSC is able to identify and respond to London's learning and skill needs even more effectively. These proposals will create a number of specialist economic development teams that will focus on skills for employers and regeneration. They will be supported by a new regional centre that will co-ordinate work with the RDAs, Sector Skills Councils and Regional Skills Partnership. The proposals are currently out to consultation with staff and unions until the end of January, and the final agreed changes will take effect from summer 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1010W.5/4">We will also want to consider in due course the outcomes of the current consultation on the powers and responsibilities of the Greater London Authority.</p>

	<p pid="b.1011W.2/1">The Level 2 entitlement is targeted at all adults aged 19 or over without a first full level 2 qualification. It provides access to free tuition for their first full Level 2 qualification and eligibility is determined using a process of self-declaration. This process requires the learner to complete and sign a declaration of eligibility stating their highest level of qualification held.</p>
	<p pid="b.1011W.2/2">All individuals must meet the Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) residency and nationality criteria.

	<p pid="b.1011W.2/3">Learner eligibility in relation to the Level 2 entitlement, and wider LSC funding eligibility, is widely drawn.

	<p pid="b.1011W.5/1">During 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 the entitlement to a first full level 2 qualification has been available to individuals through further education (FE) colleges and to employers and their employees through Employer Training Pilots (ETP).</p>
	<p pid="b.1011W.5/2">In 2004&ndash;05 the approach to individuals was piloted through FE colleges in the North East and South East Learning and Skills Council (LSC) regions. From 2005&ndash;06, in a transition year toward national roll-out in 2006/07, all FE colleges in all LSC regions began to implement the entitlement. Individual learners exercising their entitlement are not asked to pay their contribution to the tuition fee; these fees are received by FE colleges from the LSC.</p>
	<p pid="b.1011W.5/3">ETPs were introduced in September 2002. At the end of March 2004, 8,427 employers were involved and by the end of March 2005, 19,440 had signed up. By the end of December 2005, a total of 26,974 employers and 226,426 learners had participated in ETP. Nearly 80 per cent. of ETP learners are, or were working towards an NVQ level 2 qualification.</p>
	<p pid="b.1011W.5/4">Details of contracts between ETP managers and employers taking part are confidential, including information on learning given and funding received. Release of any information, including the names of participating employers, would be subject to getting formal agreement from each employer Given the numbers of employers in ETP we believe that the costs of disaggregating the data and then obtaining permission to use it from employers would be disproportionate.</p>

Guidance is aimed at helping schools to implement workforce remodelling and to take a fresh look at the roles of support staff and external specialists in PE. We have always been clear that anyone working in this area needs to have relevant skills, experience and competence, with the safety of pupils always the first consideration. Full details of the guidance developed can be found at: <a href="http://www.baalpe.org">www.baalpe.org</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1013W.8/2">The Training and Development Agency for Schools does not prescribe a number of hours to be spent on any individual area of the curriculum for trainee teachers. Instead, the Agency requires trainees to meet a demanding set of outcomes by the end of their training programmes. All primary trainee teachers are required to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of PE as well as demonstrating teaching ability in PE before they can become newly qualified teachers. This should enable newly qualified teachers to meet the PSA target. All trainee teachers are required to be able to manage lessons safely.</p>

	<p pid="b.1014W.5/1">EMA was subject to one of the most comprehensive evaluations of any educational initiative. It was piloted in 10 areas (plus five others in London/Leeds) and the evaluation followed two cohorts of 16-year-olds for four years from 1999/2000 and 2000/01. Their outcomes were compared to those of matched individuals in 11 control areas. It was rolled out to a further 41 area in 2000/01 so that it was operating in around one third of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014W.5/2">The results indicated that EMA increased participation of eligible young people in the pilot areas by 5.9 percentage points. This is equivalent to an increase in participation of all 16-year-olds across the whole country of 3.8 percentage points. There was a particularly strong impact for key target groups:</p>
	<p pid="b.1014W.5/3" class="indent">young males (1.2 times impact),</p>
	<p pid="b.1014W.5/4" class="indent">none/low/middle achievers (1.3 to 1.7 times impact)</p>
	<p pid="b.1014W.5/5" class="indent">lower SEG groups (1.3 to 1.6 times impact)</p>
	<p pid="b.1014W.5/6">The results also showed positive impacts on retention from Y13 to Y14, and also on an individual's attachment to education, as measured by number of terms which they stay in education to age 19.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014W.5/7">EMA was rolled out to 16-year-olds in the remaining two thirds of the country in September 2004. There was a 1.9 percentage point increase in participation of 16-year-olds in full-time education between 2003/04 and 2004/05. This is in line with the increase in participation which was expected from the roll out of EMA and is the largest increase in participation for over 10 years. While it is not possible to say that all of the increase was due to EMA, this was one of the most important initiatives aimed at increasing participation. The Department and LSC will be doing further analyses of local participation when these become available to try to get a better estimate of the change which might be due to EMA. EMA was rolled out to 17-year-olds in September 2005 and will be fully rolled out to 18-year-olds from September 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1014W.5/8">This year the LSC has adopted the strategy of measuring EMA take-up to show early impact of the scheme locally. Volumes are on target, and take-up among poorer students is higher than originally projected, which is the group upon whom EMA is likely to have the greatest beneficial effect. Take-up among 16-year-olds largely met or exceeded estimated figures in 2004/05. Where take-up is lower than anticipated, the local LSC targets additional support to raise awareness of EMA and increase the figures.</p>

	<p pid="b.1017W.3/1">A key aim of 'Putting the World into World-Class Education&mdash;An international strategy for education, skills and children's services' is to equip our children, young people and adults for life in a global society and work in a global economy. In addition, our national languages strategy clearly sets out the importance of international partnerships for the enrichment of language learning and to the curriculum more generally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/2">Feeding into these, a tremendous amount of work is taking place to encourage schools and local authorities to promote international development opportunities for teachers and head teachers as well as greater international links and opportunities with regard to curriculum-related activities:</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/3" class="indent">Under citizenship education (which is statutory in secondary schools), pupils are being taught about the world as a global community, the political economic, environmental and social implications of this, including the wider issues and challenges of global interdependence and responsibility;</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/4" class="indent">The DfES has funded and worked with organisations to produce resource materials to support schools, such as the guide on 'Developing a Global Dimension' in the school curriculum';</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/5" class="indent">The Global Gateway website (<a href="http://www.globalgateway.org">www.globalgateway.org</a>) is being continuously developed as our primary resource for all aspects of internationalism in education. It is primarily a global school partner finding facility. It also contains, among other things, guidance and resources for curriculum-related activities and information on professional development opportunities for teachers;</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/6" class="indent">With the British Council, we have developed a promotion pack containing relevant information and ready-made presentations for use by local authorities and other regional and local networks (e.g. the British Council Regional Professional Development network, development education centres) and, through them, to schools;</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/7" class="indent">We are working to further increase the impact of the DfES Teachers' International Professional Development (TIPD) programme, including greater synergy with the NCSL International Programme for Head teachers so that they can both potentially impact more on whole system change and policy development;</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/8" class="indent">The Comenius EU Programme provides opportunities for schools to work in multinational partnerships in projects to support and develop all areas of the curriculum, as well as opportunities for teachers to undertake training periods within one of the participating countries. Since 2004/05 the British Council has undertaken a focused promotion of the opportunities to schools and local authorities, and in 2005 there was a record number of 1,044 UK schools taking part in school projects. 605 teachers also took training courses in the programme, the majority being intensive courses for language teachers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1017W.3/9">We have had a very enthusiastic and positive response to the international strategy and have been working across a wide range of partners on raising the profile of the global dimension. Partners include: DFID and other Government Departments; British Council; Association of Colleges; Development Education Association; Institute of Education, University of London; Learning and Skills Council; QCA; NCSL; Universities UK; and UK Forum for International Education and Training.</p>

	<p pid="b.1022W.2/1">The Department for Education and Skills will set the overall legislative and policy framework for all schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1022W.2/2">Admission Forums provide a vehicle for representatives of admission authorities and other key parties to discuss admission issues and consider the effectiveness of local admission arrangements. The function of the Forum is to provide advice on difficult admission issues, information for parents and to broker agreement on arrangements for admitting vulnerable pupils to schools quickly. All maintained schools, including Trust schools, and Academies must have regard to the Forum's advice. Admission Forums will have no functions in relation to special schools or Pupil Referral Units.</p>
	<p pid="b.1022W.2/3">Ofsted contribute to improvement and provide accountability through independent inspection and reporting. New shorter, sharper inspections were introduced in September 2005 as part of the New Relationship with Schools. The White Paper proposes that Ofsted should explore the introduction of even lighter touch inspections for high-performing schools. It also proposes that Ofsted should be given powers to investigate complaints from parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1022W.2/4">The Schools Commissioner will be a senior Civil Servant within DfES and as such he/she will be carrying out functions on behalf of the Secretary of State. The Schools Commissioner will have a general role in promoting trust schools, including encouraging the spread of good practice between schools. In particular, the Commissioner will support schools wishing to adopt trusts, for example by brokering relationships with suitable partners and providing model documentation to facilitate the formation of trusts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1022W.2/5">The Schools Adjudicator rules on any objections to the proposed admission arrangements of all maintained schools, including Trust schools, and makes decisions on school organisation matters referred to him. Under the proposals in the White Paper, local authorities will be able to propose new foundation schools, propose the closure of all schools and propose expansion or the addition of SEN facilities to all categories of school. Where there is a conflict of interest, proposals will be decided by the Adjudicator. The Schools Adjudicator will have no functions in relation to Academies, special schools and Pupil Referral Units.</p>
	<p pid="b.1022W.2/6">The Audit Commission is an independent public body responsible for ensuring that public money is spent economically, efficiently, and effectively in the areas of local government. It will continue to have a role in monitoring the effectiveness of the delivery of school improvement policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1022W.2/7">The White Paper sets out a role for local authorities as the champions of the young people and parents in their area. Local authorities are currently responsible for ensuring that there is sufficiency of supply (as laid out in Sections 13 and 14 of the Education Act 1996). Under proposals set out in the White Paper, the local authority will also be responsible for promoting choice, diversity and fair access. Local authorities also provide challenge and support to schools through the School Improvement Partner. They will have new powers to intervene early in underperforming schools. They will also be expected to consider radical action when a school is judged to be inadequate by Ofsted.</p>

	<p pid="b.1026W.2/1">The Secretary of State's speech to IPPR on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-26">26 July 2005</phrase> set out the Government's commitment to help develop a society which can foster greater social mobility. Her speech underlined the important role that education can play in improving life chances for all individuals, and it set out the forward looking context for our programme of reform across the system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1026W.2/2">An assessment of changes in inter-generational academic achievement is constrained by data limitations. However in a paper accompanying the speech, &quot;Has the Social Class Gap Narrowed in Primary Schools&quot;, analysis was presented to show how gaps in attainment between pupils from high and low income brackets (proxied by free school meal (FSM) status) have changed. The paper focused on key stage 2 between 1998 and 2004, the period in which the data allows such comparisons to be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1026W.2/3">The analysis showed that performance has improved on average for both FSM and non-FSM pupils, but there was little significant change in the gap between the two groups. However it was found that schools with the highest proportions of pupils eligible for FSM did narrow the gap compared to schools with low proportions of FSM. For example in key stage 2 English, the gap in attainment at level 4 narrowed by eight percentage points in the period 1998&ndash;2004 between schools with high and low proportions of FSM pupils. The full paper is available on the Department's website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1026W.2/4">Further analysis will be carried out over the coming months. In particular, we will look at key stages 1, 3 and 4, to the extent that data for these phases can be tracked over time on a comparable basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.1027W.2/1">The Government are committed to improving services for all children and their families, including those with learning disabilities. The Every Child Matters programme, alongside the implementation of the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services and the Government's SEN strategy &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;, supports and promotes early intervention to help families of very young disabled children. In particular, the Government's Early Support Programme has been funded to improve support to parents of disabled children aged 0&ndash;3 and to provide timely interventions at the very earliest stages of impairment being identified. The development of Sure Start Children's Centres will also improve the integrated support provided to families with children under 5. Disabled children and special educational needs are a priority for this programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1027W.2/2">In the West Yorkshire area there are currently 24 Children's Centres (expected to rise to 76 by September 2006) and 1 Early Support Programme (with one currently being developed in Wakefield). All local authorities have now been asked to begin using the Early Support approaches and materials to review and improve services for families with young disabled children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1027W.2/3">Families of children with learning disabilities are, of course, entitled to access an additional range of local authority and health support. Details about these local services are not collected centrally and to do so would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1031W.2/17">Figures exclude those qualifying through employment based routes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/18">The main reason for the higher figures in the most recent years is that some qualified teachers delay the start of their teaching careers. The proportion of qualifiers without teaching service usually falls substantially over the first year or two after qualification, and in the long-term has been around 9&ndash;10 per cent. since 1990; the figures for the 2003 qualifiers are expected to fall to a similar level. For example, the proportion of all qualifiers without recorded teaching service by March of the year after they qualified has remained at 20 per cent. for 2001, 2002 and 2003, but for 2002 qualifiers it fell to 11 per cent. after another year and for 2001 qualifiers it fell to 8 per cent. after two.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/19">The Teachers Pension Scheme has only partial coverage for those teaching outside maintained schools, for example in independent schools or in further or higher education, so the true proportion is expected to be lower.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/20">The cost of teacher training varies according to different routes to achieving qualified teacher status (QTS) to work in maintained schools in England. The three main types are:</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/21" class="indent">a. Undergraduate courses leading to a degree plus QTS;</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/22" class="indent">b. Postgraduate courses leading to QTS; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/23" class="indent">c. Employment-based teacher training routes leading to QTS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/24">The funding which each of these routes attracts from the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) is in 2005/06:</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/25" class="indent">a. Undergraduate courses: &pound;16,000 per trainee (@ &pound;4,000 per year), excluding fee/maintenance support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/26" class="indent">b. Postgraduate courses: &pound;5,200 per trainee, plus at least &pound;1,200 fee/maintenance support, plus &pound;6,000 bursary (in total &pound;12,400 per trainee).</p>
	<p pid="b.1031W.2/27" class="indent">c. Employment-based teacher training routes: &pound;17,620 per trainee, including a &pound;13,000 grant towards the employment costs of each trainee.</p>

	<p pid="b.1033W.2/1">Separate arrangements apply in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. In England, there should be no impact on the take-up of postgraduate places as variable tuition fees apply only to undergraduate courses and designated initial teacher training courses, for which the Government will continue to provide non-means tested support in 2006/07.</p>
	<p pid="b.1033W.2/2">Postgraduate tuition fees are unregulated. However eligible students may receive specific support for postgraduate study through the disabled students' allowance and awards funded by the Office of Science and Technology through the Research Councils and HE institutions.</p>

When The Pension Service was introduced the agency was organised into Government Office Regions.

It is recorded on the Departmental Central Index (DCI) and forwarded automatically to all benefit systems including the jobseeker's allowance payment system and the pension strategy computer system. Once the notification is received, payment of benefit will automatically be suspended on systems such as the pension strategy computer system and the disability living allowance/attendance allowance computer system. On other systems, such as the income support computer system and the jobseeker's allowance payment system staff will be notified of the need to take action on the cases affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1036W.5/3">When the Department is notified that someone has moved house, the data is automatically sent to the relevant benefit systems. This alerts staff to take the necessary action to update addresses and, where appropriate, notify the relevant local authority for housing benefit and council tax benefit purposes. A process is also in place where local authorities can notify DWP when a person in receipt of benefit has moved house and when this is received at a central point, automatic indicators are broadcast to other benefit systems.</p>

	<p pid="b.1040W.5/1">The Department for Work and Pensions makes every effort to ensure that its data is accurate, up-to-date and relevant. It employs different methods according to the type of data it holds in relation to change of address and death details.</p>
	<p pid="b.1040W.5/2">Where people move house there is no obligation on them as individuals to notify my Department of such a change unless they are in receipt of benefit, where checks are made at the start of the claim and in certain benefits at specified points during the course of the claim. However, through closer working with other Government Departments, particularly Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC), my Department receives on a daily basis, changes of address notified to HMRC for their customers who are in employment, claiming tax credits or liable for income tax or national insurance contributions. In addition to this, my Department fully supports cross-government data sharing initiatives such as the setting up of a National Identity Register for ID Cards in order to maintain the integrity of its data. If the person moving home is in receipt of housing benefit or council tax benefit processes are in place for local authorities to notify my Department of the change.</p>
	<p pid="b.1040W.5/3">When a person dies, my Department is notified of the death by the Office of National Statistics (for England and Wales), the General Registrar's Office (Scotland) and the General Registrar's Office (Northern Ireland). These data are recorded centrally and, where appropriate, forwarded to the relevant benefit system to suspend payment of benefit and alert staff to the need to take action on specific cases. In addition to this, many relatives, friends and next of kin of the deceased person notify the death direct to the Department when benefit is in payment or bereavement benefit claimed, providing copies of the death certificate. Between these processes my Department captures the death data within a matter of weeks. As modernisation programmes progress in registrations of death, plans are in place to automate the notifications from ONS (England and Wales) and GRO (Scotland), making the process quicker and more efficient.</p>

There is already provision in regulations which allows EEA nationals who have been working in the UK to be treated as habitually resident if they claim an income-related benefit. In line with EC case law, a returning UK national who has previously worked in the UK is likely to pass the Habitual Residence Test immediately. Non-EEA nationals who work in the UK are usually subject to immigration control and have no recourse to public funds. As such they have no access to income-related benefits and therefore would not be subject to the Habitual Residence Test.</p>

	<p pid="b.1047W.5/1">Stakeholder pensions were introduced to provide a good value pension option for moderate earners who do not have access to an occupational pension scheme or to a cost effective personal pension plan. Figures from HM Revenue and Customs for the 2003&ndash;04 tax year, the latest available, show that around two-thirds of stakeholder pensions sales have been to people in work earning less than &pound;20,000 a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1047W.5/2">Figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) show that at <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase> 2,622,160 stakeholder pensions had been sold since their introduction in April 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.1047W.5/3">The impact of stakeholder pensions on saving for retirement may extend beyond their sales alone. There is evidence that annual management charges for other personal pensions fell by around a third between 1999 and 2001, to around the 1 per cent. level of stakeholder pension charges, suggesting that the stakeholder pension initiative has benefited the personal pension market as a whole.</p>

The number of possible illegal abortions, and abortions granted under risk to life clause of the Bill, shown in the PRIA was a best estimate based on the information provided by those stakeholders responding to the consultation and from examining what happened in other countries where access to abortion is restricted or illegal.

	<p pid="b.1055W.5/1">The Department for Education and Skills have lead responsibility for ensuring that school pupils are educated about the effects of drinking. Alcohol education must be addressed at key stages two, three and four within the science curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="b.1055W.5/2">Alcohol education is a statutory part of the national curriculum, which requires all children to learn about the risks of alcohol. This sits within a broader programme of drug education since many of the attitudes and skills to enable young people to make informed choices will be the same.</p>
	<p pid="b.1055W.5/3">The guidance requires schools to emphasise alcohol education within their drug education programmes. It makes clear that the message should be about promoting sensible drinking and reducing the harm related to alcohol misuse. The guidance encourages schools to look at the influence of the media on attitudes towards alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="b.1055W.5/4">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has developed drug, alcohol and tobacco education schemes of work as part of the education training package for teachers. We are now working with QCA on end of key stage assessment materials that would help teachers assess progress in personal social and health education including alcohol education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1055W.5/5">Blueprint is the largest research programme ever run in this country to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-component approach to school-based drug education. The programme covered illegal drugs, legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco, and medicines.</p>
	<p pid="b.1055W.5/6">The programme was delivered in spring term 2004 and 2005 to 4,500 young people in 23 schools. Full results of the research will be available in 2008 although the intention is to use the experience of the programme to inform practice in the interim.</p>
	<p pid="b.1055W.5/7">The Department plans to commission a programme of trailblazer pilots for alcohol screening and brief interventions mainly aimed at adults but including young adults. Although the contract has still to be finalised, we have selected a consortium led by St. George's Medical School (University of London) and Newcastle University to operate these pilots and extract the learning from them to apply to a larger roll-out programme planned for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1055W.5/8">These trailblazer pilots will operate in three settings; primary care, accident and emergency (A&amp;E) and criminal justice settings. This gives the best spread of settings to offer screening and brief interventions across the whole adult population. Young adults, particularly young men, are less likely to attend their general practice than their older counterparts but their drinking behaviour is more likely to bring a number of them into contact with A&amp;E and the criminal justice system.</p>

	<p pid="b.1060W.2/1">The Government believe that care homes are only one of a range of options that should be available for supporting people with long-term care needs. The Green Paper, 'Independence, Well-being and Choice', published in March 2005, set out the vision for adult social care. To make that vision a reality, domiciliary care must become an increasingly important element of social care provision. Domiciliary care services can help people to remain in control of their own lives. There has been substantial investment in other care settings for older people, such as domiciliary care and extra care housing. The Government recognise that most people want to live in their own homes for as long as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.2/2">The Government are promoting better planning and commissioning of care services at a local level to stabilise the long-term care sector in a way that will allow it to meet future demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.1060W.2/3">It is for local councils to ensure that effective arrangements are in place to meet the needs of local people.</p>

In both Portsmouth and other PCT areas, the recent budget allocations for local commissioning of dentistry in 2006&ndash;07 onwards reflect the current provision of services in each PCT area. These budgets are ring fenced for three years and can only be used by the PCT for the provision of primary care dental services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1063W.2/2">In the future, the distribution of these resources within a PCT area will be a matter of local discretion.

PCTs may also commit additional funds from their overall allocation to augment the ring fenced dental budget and address local dental needs.

Health equity audit is a mandatory part of primary care trust planning and the topic for each health equity audit is down to local determination by the NHS trust and their partners. The Choosing Health White Paper &quot;Delivering Choosing Health (2005)&quot; set out the intention to extend health and wellbeing equity audits to other NHS trusts and local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1067W.8/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what percentage of children were born with a low birthweight in each year from 1975&ndash;1976 to 2005&ndash;2006. (41309)</p>
	<p pid="b.1067W.8/5" class="indent">The attached table shows the information requested. The latest available figures are for 2004. Birthweight information for liveborn babies is currently provided by primary care organisations to Registrars of births, deaths and marriages in their area for recording on the draft birth entry. This is then made available to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for statistical purposes. Prior to 1982 this birthweight information was not made available to Registrars for a large proportion of liveborn babies. For this reason figures for the period 1975 to 1981 are taken from the DHSS annual summaries of LHS 27/1 low birthweight returns. On the returns for these years, low birthweight was defined as 2,500 grams and under.</p>
	<p pid="b.1067W.8/6" class="indent">Figures from 1982 are based on the information available to ONS and is based on the World Health Organisation's definition of low birthweight (under 2,500 grams).</p>

	<p pid="b.1071W.5/1">Trends in overweight and obesity and their relationship to other risk factors are monitored each year through the Health Survey for England. Body fatness is most commonly assessed by body mass index (BMI). A BMI of 25 to 30 is considered overweight and greater than 30, obese. There is a graded increase in the risk of total mortality and cardiovascular mortality with increasing BMI above 25. BMI combined with waist measurement is a good indicator of obesity and associated health risks. Waist circumference levels of greater than 102 centimetres in men and greater than 80 centimetres in women are associated with increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p>

The 100 is made up of 10 to extrapolate from the animals to humans (humans are considered more sensitive) and 10 to account for variation in response within the human population (individuals that are more sensitive than the norm).</p>

	<p pid="b.1074W.2/1">Though the detail of developing school nursing and health visiting services rests with primary care trusts (PCTs), we recognise the important role these nurses play in addressing health priorities. This was reinforced in the children's national service framework and the chief nursing officer's review of the nursing, midwifery and health visiting contribution to vulnerable children and young people, as well as in the White Paper, Choosing Health.</p>
	<p pid="b.1074W.2/2">Additionally, we are providing new funding so that by 2010 every PCT, working with children's trusts and local authorities, will have at least one full-time, year-round, qualified school nurse working with each cluster or group of primary schools and the related secondary school. Revenue allocations to PCTs covering the period 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 were announced in February. For the two years covered by this allocation, a total of &pound;62 million has been identified nationally to invest in the school nurses, &pound;20 million in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;42 million in 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1074W.2/3">Choosing Health also commits the chief nursing officer to work with nurse leaders and the Department for Education and Skills to modernise and promote school nursing and to develop a national programme for best practice that includes reviewing children's and young people's health and supporting the use of children's personal health guide.</p>

	<p pid="b.1076W.5/1">A press statement issued by the applicant pharmaceutical company indicates that an application for a marketing authorisation for Sorafenib has been submitted to the European medicines agency (EMEA) in September 2005 for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell cancer. As with all medicinal products, before Sorafenib is granted a marketing authorisation and becomes available in the United Kingdom it must be fully evaluated in relation to the appropriate standards required in the relevant European rules and regulations on medicinal products. Data submitted in support of the application will need to demonstrate that the safety, quality and efficacy of the product are satisfactory for its intended use. Under European procedures, it takes up to 210 days for an opinion on licensing to be given by the scientific committee of the EMEA, the Committee for human medicinal products, excluding time taken by the company to provide further information or data to support any questions which may arise during the assessment process. Should the assessment consider that the quality, safety and efficacy are satisfactory and a positive opinion be given, the European Commission will consider the opinion and decide upon granting a marketing authorisation, valid across the community.</p>

	<p pid="b.1095W.9/1">The preface to the public version of the &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; report addressed this issue and in particular stated that the redacted material in no way impacted either the substance, or the spirit of the original report and its conclusions. Furthermore please be assured that Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) made every effort to keep the redactions to an absolute minimum.</p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.9/2">The only chapter that was affected by the decision to redact material was chapter five, the national assessment of police organisational fitness. 10 paragraphs were redacted from the section that presented HMIC's findings in relation to Counter-Terrorism and Domestic Extremism. These dealt with operational issues in relation to the command, control, deployment and resilience of existing resources in this critical, yet often covert area of policing. One sentence was redacted from the paragraphs that addressed Serious and Organised Crime, together with a composite map and the supporting narrative from the concluding section of the chapter, that identified risk in relation to specific operational issues, the release of which would be of interest to organised crime. It was HMIC's professional judgment that the publication of this material was not in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.1095W.9/3">I have raised the issue of producing the requested summary with HMIC and it is their view that, given the relative brevity and sensitivity of the material in question, it would not be possible to do so without exposing the issues at hand. I am, of course, sighted on this material and I agree with this assessment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1099W.5/1">We have received representations from the public and from Members of both Houses regarding the situation of Zimbabweans who have been refused asylum. Most have been concerned primarily with the issue of enforced return of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe, with a number of these proposing that failed Zimbabwean asylum seekers be allowed to work in the UK &quot;until it is safe for them to return to Zimbabwe&quot;. We have also received representations from UK voluntary sector organisations about support for failed Zimbabwean asylum seekers under section four of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.</p>
	<p pid="b.1099W.5/2">As I explained in my statement on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-14">14 December 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2005-12-14.134WS"><i>Official Report</i>, column 134WS</phrase>, the recent Asylum and Immigration Tribunal determination did not find that Zimbabwe generally was unsafe for failed asylum seekers to return to or that voluntary returnees are at risk, only that the method by which we were at that time enforcing returns put enforced returnees at risk. As a consequence, we will not enforce the return of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe until we have addressed the concerns of the tribunal. In the meantime, voluntary returns to Zimbabwe are possible and are continuing. We therefore expect failed asylum seekers to return voluntarily to Zimbabwe and will assist them in doing so through the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).</p>
	<p pid="b.1099W.5/3">Asylum seekers from Zimbabwe who have been refused asylum can apply for support under section four of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. Support is available under this provision to unsuccessful asylum seekers who are destitute and who satisfy one or more of a number of conditions, for example that the person is taking all reasonable steps to leave the UK, or to place himself in a position in which they are able to leave the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.1100W.5/2">This has been in place since December 2004 and is part of the new asylum model (NAM) which is designed to introduce:</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.5/3" class="indent">faster tightly-managed processes for all new asylum claimants, including those not detained;</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.5/4" class="indent">close contact management for all non-detained claimants with access to support dependent on compliance; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.5/5" class="indent">a specialist case owner responsible for managing each claimant from the start to either integration or removal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.5/6">Two segments of the new asylum model, dealing with potentially non- suspensive appeals cases and with late and opportunistic claims having low barriers to removal, became operational in June 2005 via complete case management teams based at Liverpool and Croydon.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.5/7">Under this system, claimants presenting at the asylum screening units at Liverpool and Croydon who do not go into the detained fast track are judged against objective criteria (which have been shared with external stakeholders) as to whether their claims are &quot;late and opportunistic&quot;. If they are, or, based on their country of origin, their claims are potentially &quot;non-suspensive appeal&quot; cases and they require national asylum seeker support (NASS) accommodation, they are moved to Liverpool. Non- detained, non-NASS accommodated claimants in either segment are managed by a Croydon-based team using reporting centres as close as possible to where they are living.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.5/8">This is the first phase of the proposed implementation which we expect to see all new asylum cases from the end of this year dealt with as part of the new asylum model.</p>
	<p pid="b.1100W.5/9">For the next phase we are planning to introduce case management teams in West Midlands and Leeds to manage the asylum applicants in those regions. These are expected to be in operational form in May of this year. Decisions will be made later about locations of other teams.</p>

	<p pid="b.1105W.8/1">Since 2000, the British Crime Survey (BCS) shows that cocaine use has remained broadly stable both for those aged 16&ndash;59 and for young people aged 16&ndash;24. There is also some evidence of a more recent reduction in use. Data from the BCS show that, between 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05, there was a fall from 2.4 per cent. to 2.0 per cent. in the proportion of respondents aged 16&ndash;59 reporting the use of cocaine on at least one occasion during the year preceding the survey. This equates to a 17 per cent. drop. However, the Government are not complacent about any of these figures and, through the Drug Strategy, are working to reduce the harms caused by all illicit drugs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1105W.8/2">The Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) operates in the 97 areas with the highest levels of drug-related acquisitive crime. Individuals charged with certain offences are tested for class A drugs under the programme: one of several interventions to identify drug-misusing offenders and divert them into treatment and support services. From <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>, three selected police forces have had powers to test for class A drugs on arrest. Those testing positive are required to attend an assessment with a drug worker. These new powers will be expanded further from <phrase class="date" code="">31 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1105W.8/3">Heroin misuse has historically been the main the focus of treatment provision. However, the number of stimulant users presenting for treatment is increasing. Flexible treatment packages are being adopted in line with the National Treatment Agency's Effectiveness Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1105W.8/4">For young people, the Government provide universal drugs education and targeted interventions for the vulnerable young people most likely to develop drug misuse problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1105W.8/5">Internationally, UK law enforcement agencies work with overseas partners and between April 2001 and December 2004, 52 tonnes of cocaine bound for the UK market were seized.</p>

	<p pid="b.1114W.2/2">The EU Border Agency (FRONTEX) became fully operational in October 2005 and identified the Mediterranean as a priority area for action. EU member states conducted various joint exercises to detect and intercept irregular migrants, and to reinforce controls in sea ports.</p>
	<p pid="b.1114W.2/3">Important progress was made on strengthening co-operation with transit countries in North Africa. The 10th anniversary Euromed Summit in November 2005 adopted a five year work programme covering enhanced co-operation on all aspects of migration, including reducing illegal migration and trafficking in human beings. A ministerial meeting on migration will be held in 2006 to drive forward this agenda.</p>

A European Commission mission made recommendations for practical co-operation with Morocco and Algeria following the tragic events in Ceuta and Melilla. Key Mediterranean transit countries were involved in ED sea operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1114W.2/5">On source countries in Africa, agreement was reached at the EU Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Troika in November and the EU Africa Troika in December to enhance and strengthen dialogue and practical cooperation on migration between ECOWAS, African countries, Pan-African institutions and the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.1114W.2/6">At the end of the presidency, the December European Council adopted a paper &quot;Global approach to migration: Priority actions focusing on Africa and the Mediterranean&quot;, drawing together all strands of EU migration work in the Mediterranean and Africa and setting priority actions for 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1114W.2/7">Building on our presidency achievements, we will continue to encourage the EU to work in closer partnership with transit and source countries to tackle illegal migration across the Mediterranean and for improved migration management globally.</p>

However, it has a commercial collaboration arrangement in place with Cozart, which is managed by a distinct unit within the FSS that is completely separate and has no connection with any activities relating to the FSS' role in the provision of impartial expert and technical advice, performance testing, quality assurance and independent evaluation of test kits and equipment to the Home Office. The Department is satisfied that ethical walls have been established within the FSS to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent the disclosure of any information relating to the DIP, and commercial or otherwise technical data between the different areas of the organisation concerned.</p>

We have made good progress in reducing the bureaucratic burdens on police officers by cutting nearly 9,000 unnecessary forms; civilianising posts; rolling out the penalty notice for disorder scheme; and ensuring that forces have the best scientific and technological support like video identity parades and electronic fingerprinting so that officers spend more time in communities tackling crime and antisocial behaviour and reassuring the public.</p>

The relevant passage, at page 19, reads:</p>
	<p pid="b.1117W.8/2" class="indent">&quot;We recognise that changes to the scheme mean that some cases would be dealt with differently in future and that some applicants who have already received their compensation would have received more under a new scheme. However, we do not believe that it would be fair or workable to apply changes retrospectively. Changes also need to be approved by Parliament, which could mean that it could be at least a year before any changes could come into effect. We would welcome views on whether changes to the scheme should apply from the date of the incident or the date of the application.</p>
	<p pid="b.1117W.8/3" class="indent">Potential applicants to the scheme should not alter their decision on whether or when to apply to the scheme as a result of anything in this paper.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.1135W.0/1">The Preventing Extremism Together working groups were created as part of an exercise which was carried out informally as part of our immediate response to the July bombings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1135W.0/2">Suggestions as to possible members came both orally and in writing from Ministerial visits which took place over the summer, through a designated email account, from the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, and following the Prime Minister's and my own meetings with key faith leaders and others.</p>
	<p pid="b.1135W.0/3">Members of the working groups were invited to participate because of their expertise and experience. A key factor was to ensure that the groups had credibility with the Muslim communities. In selecting these individuals consideration was given to those who were both challenging voices and well established figures who have the support of their community. To ensure a broad spectrum of representation, high profile and internationally known individuals were invited alongside individuals who hold a variety of different views. They were invited in a personal, unpaid capacity, rather than as representatives of their organisations and held no official status. The result of this was seven working groups with a membership total of 104.</p>

	<p pid="b.1143W.0/2">Its main priorities will be those serious organised crime threats identified by the UK threat assessment, which are trafficking in Class A drugs, organised illegal immigration, fraud, money laundering, criminal use of firearms and e-crime. SOCA will not have a direct role in countering terrorism and domestic extremism, although it may provide support to those agencies which do have responsibility for these areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1150W.9/1">Work Permits (UK) caseworkers carry out a risk assessment when the application is submitted. They can request further checks of an employer before a work permit is issued. Further checks, either random or intelligence-driven, can follow the issue of the work permit. These checks can result in revocation of permits, refusal of existing permit applications by the employers in question and the curtailment of leave of those who have permits with the company. Where they believe that a work permit is forged or has been obtained using deception, Immigration Officers and Entry Clearance Officers can refuse entry.</p>

Registration on the WRS is not a condition for entry, but a requirement for nationals from Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia to be lawfully employed in a job if it continues for more than 30 days.

In addition, all youth offending teams have a target to ensure that 90 per cent. of young persons under their supervision are in full-time appropriate education training or employment by the end of their sentence, recognising the key role that this can play in reducing the risk of re-offending.</p>

	<p pid="b.1160W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question to ask what proportion of the UK workforce earned the <i>(a)</i> minimum wage, <i>(b)</i> less than &pound;5.50 per hour <i>(c)</i> less than &pound;5.75 per hour, <i>(d)</i> less than &pound;6.00 per hour, <i>(e)</i> less than &pound;6.50 per hour, <i>(f)</i> less than &pound;7.00 per hour and <i>(g)</i> less than &pound;10 per hour in each year since 1997&ndash;1998, broken down by region. (41290)</p>
	<p pid="b.1160W.2/4" class="indent">Currently average earnings are estimated from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), and are provided for employees on adult rates whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence. This is the standard definition used for ASHE. The ASHE does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1160W.2/5" class="indent">I am placing a table in the House of Commons Library showing the proportion of the UK workforce with Average Gross Hourly Earnings by place of work from 1998 to 2005 below the stated hourly rates. Estimates of the proportion of the UK workforce earning at the Minimum Wage are not calculated, however proportions earning below this level have been given. The Minimum Wage was introduced from October 1998 so figures prior to April 1999 are not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1160W.2/6" class="indent">The ASHE, carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1161W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-16">16 January 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question concerning the population registered to vote in each ward of each constituency in <i>(a)</i> Essex, <i>(b)</i> Hertfordshire and <i>(c)</i> Greater London in descending order of numbers registered for each constituency. (42330)</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.2/4" class="indent">The attached Table 1 gives a comparison between the number of registered electors and the estimated population for wards in each parliamentary constituency in Essex, Hertfordshire and Greater London. Ward figures for the Unitary Authority areas formerly in Essex (Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock) and Hertfordshire (Luton) are included. Because of the length of the table it has been provided in electronic format and will be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.2/5" class="indent">It should be borne in mind that the percentage of the <i>resident population</i> who are registered to vote does not provide a reliable estimate of the registration rate of the eligible population. This is mainly because there are definitional differences between &quot;usually resident&quot; and eligibility to vote and therefore the estimated resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote. For example, the resident population includes all those who usually live in an area irrespective of nationality whereas the parliamentary electorate excludes foreign nationals (but Commonwealth and Irish citizens are included) and may include some overseas electors who do not currently live in the area. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate and this can occur for a number of reasons. People who have more than one address, including students, may register in more than one place. Electoral registration officers may vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.2/6" class="indent">The closest available geography to current electoral wards, for which population estimates are available, is Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards. This geography was created for outputs from the 2001 Census and is based mainly on 2003 electoral wards. The electorate counts are on current ward boundaries and it has been necessary to convert these to the CAS ward geography.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.2/7" class="indent">The latest population data available at ward level are for mid-2002, published in April 2005. The ward electorate counts are for December 2002 parliamentary electors, including attainers. The parliamentary electorate has been used rather than the local government electorate even though the latter is definitionally closer to the resident population because the local government electorate is not available at ward level. No adjustment has been made to reflect the difference between these two time points. There are a number of wards that are split by parliamentary constituency i.e. they fall within two or more parliamentary constituencies. These are shown by an asterisk * alongside their ward name, and appear under both constituencies. Electorate and population figures for the whole ward are shown. Some wards will therefore be double counted. It is not possible to split the data for these wards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.2/8" class="indent">The population data are <i>estimates</i> and as such are subject to a margin of confidence. This margin of confidence is proportionately larger for ward level estimates than for local authority level estimates. The CAS ward level population estimates have been published with the status of &quot;experimental statistics&quot;. Therefore, the estimates, and figures derived from them, should be treated with some care.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161W.2/9" class="indent">There are a relatively small number of wards (28) where the electorate counts are more than 5 per cent. greater than the population estimate. These cases are attributable to definitional differences between the estimates and electoral counts, the margin of confidence in the ward estimates, the accuracy of the electoral registers and limitations in the methodology used to convert electoral counts to the CAS ward geography.</p>

	<p pid="b.1164W.2/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles statistics for the United Kingdom of public sector employment from a quarterly survey of public sector organisations. However, estimates at local area level are not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.2/5" class="indent">Information at local area level is available from the annual local area Labour Force Survey (LFS) of individual people in households. However, in this source, the categorization of employment in the public or private sector depends upon the responses from the individuals interviewed. As reported by ONS in October 2005 in the publication &quot;Public Sector Employment Trends&quot;, some individuals tend to misreport private sector employment as being in the public sector hence leading to overestimates of the share of public sector employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.2/6" class="indent">With this reservation about the data quality, the attached table shows the proportions of public and private sector employment in the Beverley and Holderness constituency shown by the annual local area LFS for the 12 month periods ending February 1997 to February 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1164W.2/7" class="indent">These estimates, as with any from sample surveys, are subject to a margin of uncertainty. Changes in the estimates from year to year should be treated with particular caution.</p>

	<p pid="b.1170W.3/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question concerning the number of pensioners in whose deaths cold or malnutrition have been cited as the primary cause in each of the last 10 years, broken down by county and London borough. (41694)</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.3/4" class="indent">The latest year for which figures are available is 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.3/5" class="indent">Most routine mortality statistics are based on a single cause for each death, the underlying cause of death which is defined by the World Health Organisation as:</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.3/6" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> the disease which initiated the train of events directly leading to death; or</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.3/7" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.3/8" class="indent">Using this definition &quot;cold&quot; can never be an underlying cause of death. However subnormal body temperature, hypothermia, may be mentioned on the death certificate. Tables of deaths with any mention of hypothermia by county and London borough were placed in the library of the House of Commons, (Official Report Number 91, column 547).</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.3/9" class="indent">In response to this parliamentary question ONS also placed in the library of the House of Commons tables of deaths from malnutrition, where this was defined as deaths with any mention of malnutrition or deprivation of food.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.3/10" class="indent">Deprivation of food can never be the underlying cause of death using the WHO definition. Numbers of deaths where malnutrition was the underlying cause of death have been extracted for deaths registered in each year from 1995 to 2004. As retirement age differs for males and females, tables are provided separately for deaths of women aged 60 and over and men aged 65 and over.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.3/11" class="indent">Counties in England and Wales have been subject to administrative changes which affected the structure of many of these areas in the mid-1990s. Figures are therefore provided using current county boundaries which exclude unitary authority areas created from 1995 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170W.3/12" class="indent">These tables have been placed in the library of the House of Commons.</p>

	<p pid="b.1174W.3/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking for the lastest estimate of the share of gross income paid in tax by <i>(a)</i> each income decile and <i>(b)</i> each major household type, in each year from 1996&ndash;97 to 2005&ndash;06, broken down by each major tax. (41398)</p>
	<p pid="b.1174W.3/4" class="indent">Estimates of the share of gross household income which is paid in tax are based on the Office for National Statistics analyses '<i>The effects of taxes and benefits on household income'</i> which is published annually. The latest analysis for 2003&ndash;04 was published on the National Statistics website on 7th July 2005 at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. These analyses include measures of income inequality for households in the United Kingdom based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey (the Family Expenditure Survey before 2001&ndash;02). This is a sample survey covering approximately 6,000 to 7,000 households in the UK. Estimates are currently available only up to 2003&ndash;04. The analysis for 2004&ndash;05 is due to be published on the National Statistics website in April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1174W.3/5" class="indent">The samples on which the estimates are based are only sufficient to allow a breakdown to be given by quintile for the ratio of taxes to gross income, and not by decile. In addition it should be remembered that the annual analyses from which the figures are drawn are not designed primarily for direct comparison over time, and there have been some changes in methodology and definitions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1174W.3/6" class="indent">I am placing in the House of Commons Library, tables showing taxes as a proportion of gross income for each income quintile where households an non-retired households in the UK. The disposable income quintile point boundaries have been calculated separately for the retired and non retired households. For example, the 1st quintile point for the retired households is the income below which one fifth of all retired households are estimated to lie and similarly for all households and non-retired households.</p>
	<p pid="b.1174W.3/7" class="indent">A retired household in the analyses is defined as one where the combined income of 'retired' members amounts to at least half the total gross income of the household. A 'retired' person is defined as some one over minimum NI pension age who is 'unoccupied' or 'sick or injured but not intending to seek work,' or who describes themselves as 'retired.'</p>
	<p pid="b.1174W.3/8" class="indent">Estimates of indirect taxes are imputed based on household expenditure. When comparing the incidence of indirect taxes on households at different levels of income, it should be remembered that measured expenditure will not necessarily balance with measured income for the year. On average measured expenditure exceeds measured income for households in the lower half of the distribution. There are a number of possible explanations for this. Some households with low incomes may draw on their savings or borrow in order to finance their expenditure. In addition, the lower decile in particular includes some groups, who have, or report, very little income (for example, self-employed people starting a business or someone who has just been made redundant). In these cases, expenditure is not being met from current income. Some types of receipts are not included as income in the EFS e.g. inheritance and severance payments. In some cases, the information given on expenditure is not consistent with that on income received because of timing differences.</p>
