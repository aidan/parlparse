	<p pid="d.82W.2/1">There are a range of legislative and enforcement measures in place that are aimed at protecting children from sexual abuse. Through the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the law was overhauled to provide greater protection for children from sexual abuse, and a new offence of 'meeting a child following sexual grooming' was introduced. Those who seek to harm children, whether through the online or offline environment, and whether acting alone or in groups, can expect to face the full force of the law. Of course, enforcement measures are kept under constant review in order to deal with the challenges presented by the constantly developing IT environment.</p>

	<p pid="d.82W.5/1">With regard to the pension age for prison officers, the Principal Civil Service Pension scheme is in two sections. Section 1, the &quot;2002 section&quot;, is referred to as the premium scheme and has a pension accrual rate of one sixtieth. Section 2, the &quot;1972 section&quot;, is referred to as the classic scheme. Classic has a pension accrual rate of one eightieth plus a lump sum accrual rate of three eightieths.</p>
	<p pid="d.82W.5/2">The current normal pension age for members of both schemes is 60. However, some prison officers who are members of the classic scheme have a normal pension age of 55.</p>
	<p pid="d.82W.5/3">In line with the principles agreed with the trade unions at the Public Services Forum in 2005, a new pension scheme will be introduced for new entrants to the civil service who will have a pension age of 65.</p>
	<p pid="d.82W.5/4">With regard to police officers, under the Police Pension Scheme 1987, to which most officers belong, there is no fixed retirement age for the police. Officers with at least 25 years' service may retire with an immediate pension from the age of 50. Officers may also retire with an immediate pension, irrespective of age, after 30 years' service, when they will have accrued maximum benefits. This means that an officer who joined at 18 and a half&mdash;the earliest age at which it is possible to start as a police officer&mdash;is entitled to retire at 48 and a half with a full pension. Otherwise officers become eligible to retire with an immediate pension from the age of 55, 57 or 60, depending on what their compulsory retirement age would have been for their rank and force before such ages were revised with effect from <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-01">1 October</phrase> this year. Officers with less than 25 years' service who leave the police with deferred benefits will receive their pensions at 60.</p>
	<p pid="d.82W.5/5">The accrual rate under the Police Pension Scheme 1987 is one sixtieth of final salary for each year during the first 20 years and two sixtieths for each of the next 10 years, providing a target pension of two thirds of final salary, if no lump sum is taken, after 30 years.</p>
	<p pid="d.82W.5/6">Members of the Police Pension Scheme 2006, those who joined the police service on or after <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase> this year, have a set pension age of 55 at or after which a serving officer can leave with an immediate pension irrespective of his or her length of service. Officers who leave the police service below the age of 55 with deferred benefits will receive their pension at 65.</p>
	<p pid="d.82W.5/7">The accrual rate under the Police Pension Scheme 2006 is one seventieth of final salary for each year providing a target pension of one half of final salary, plus a fixed lump sum of twice final salary, after 35 years.</p>

	<p pid="d.84W.6/1">In 2006, the G24 formally set up six sub-groups on thematic areas where representatives of civil society, the Colombian Government and the G24 could meet regularly to discuss specific issues of concern. This has provided a welcome forum for dialogue between non-governmental organisations and the Government on a range of human rights, conflict and development issues. We expect the thematic groups to continue in some form in 2007. The G24 is drawn from participants at the 2003 London Meeting on International Support for Columbia, which has a presence in Bogota.</p>
	<p pid="d.84W.6/2">Each of the six sub-groups meets every month. Our embassy in Bogota has participated in a number of the groups' meetings, including those focusing on the rule of law and human rights and reintegration into civil life. The embassy also attends the quarterly meetings of the Follow-up Commission involving civil society, Colombian Government and G24 representatives, and in regular G24 steering meetings.</p>

	<p pid="d.93W.5/3" class="italic"> Vehicle excise duty (VED)</p>
	<p pid="d.93W.5/4">We are making it as easy as possible to comply. Electronic vehicle licensing allows vehicle keepers to tax their vehicles electronically when it is convenient for them and checks the insurance and MOT databases automatically on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid="d.93W.5/5">We are also continuing to enforce from the record. Continuous registration requires vehicles to be either taxed or subject to a statutory off-road notice at any time. As a result, it is no longer necessary to 'catch' an untaxed vehicle being used on the road in order to prosecute the keeper for VED evasion.</p>
	<p pid="d.93W.5/6">We are using improved methods of detection (such as automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) equipment), data and intelligence to target non-compliant vehicles on the road. In 2005-06 DVLA and its local authority partners clamped over 79,000 vehicles, more than half of which were crushed. A new contract was let in May 2006 which will allow this national scheme to be expanded. We expect DVLA and its partners to clamp around 150,000 untaxed vehicles this year.</p>

	<p pid="d.93W.5/8">In order to strengthen enforcement activity to tackle insurance evasion we introduced two new measures last year. The first will give the police improved access to the Motor Insurance Database to enhance their ability to detect uninsured driving by using ANPR equipment. The second will empower the police to seize vehicles being driven uninsured. Both measures are proving effective, with the police seizing nearly 600 uninsured vehicles each week.</p>
	<p pid="d.93W.5/9">In addition, the Road Safety Act 2006, which recently received Royal Assent, has powers for a new scheme of continuous insurance enforcement. This scheme will mean that rather than having to rely on detecting uninsured vehicles on the road we can now identify, from the database, vehicles where insurance polices have lapsed and not been renewed.</p>
	<p pid="d.93W.5/10">This will enable us to target all insurance evaders, rather than just the necessarily smaller numbers that it is possible to identify on-road.</p>

	<p pid="d.105W.2/1">DFID will establish strategic 10-year Development Partnership Arrangements with countries that show a commitment to good governance and reducing poverty. These long-term arrangements are based on the UK's conditionality policy which sets out the circumstances under which DFID will interrupt or suspend aid. We will consider interrupting aid if there is a breach of the partnership commitments that form the basis of our relationship with national governments; i.e. if:</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.2/2" class="indent">(i) countries veer significantly away from their agreed poverty reduction objectives or from the agreed objectives of a particular aid commitment</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.2/3" class="indent">(ii) countries are in significant violation of human rights or other international obligations; or</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.2/4" class="indent">(iii) there is a significant breakdown in the performance of partner Government financial management and accountability systems leading to the risk of funds being misused through weak administration or corruption.</p>
	<p pid="d.105W.2/5">10-year arrangements will set out long-term and predictable support that will be delivered in ways that ensure that DFID funds are used to reduce poverty. Such arrangements will contain benchmarks to assess the partner Government's performance. A failure to meet benchmarks would not lead automatically to interruption of aid flows. Initially it would trigger discussion with the partner Government about progress with reforms and how constraints to implementation might be resolved. However, a persistent failure to achieve results would lead us to review the Government's commitment to poverty reduction. The strategic partnership arrangements are supported by individual funding instruments for each development intervention. Individual funding instruments contain a provision to modify or terminate our support in poorly performing programmes.</p>

	<p pid="d.107W.5/1">The Government of Iraq, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and its partners estimate there are now more than 1.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) within Iraq. Up to 1.1 million of these people are believed to have left their homes under the previous regime. The UNHCR report that there are 424,000 newly displaced who have left their homes and communities since the bombing of the Samarra shrine in February 2006. Reasons for this recent displacement are mainly due to the rise in sectarian violence around Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="d.107W.5/2">The majority of internally displaced persons in Iraq are either living with relatives, friends or extended family, or renting accommodation in other neighbourhoods. However, thousands of displaced persons without family links or money are living in public buildings and schools, improvised shelters and government camps run by the International Federation of the Red Crescent.</p>
	<p pid="d.107W.5/3">UN agencies are delivering food and emergency assistance in central and southern Iraq together with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Organisation of Migration (IOM). Since February, the ICRC has distributed food and emergency relief to 150,000 people. EC member states have recently agreed to give &euro;10 million to the UN for the provision of additional shelter and other basic needs for IDPs.</p>
	<p pid="d.107W.5/4">The UNHCR also estimates that there are up to 1.6 million Iraqis living outside their country, most of them in Jordan (500,000) and Syria (450,000). Some have been outside for a decade or more, but many have moved since 2003. The UN Assistance Mission Iraq is currently conducting an assessment of these people's needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.107W.5/5">Since 2003, DFID has contributed over &pound;100 million to humanitarian agencies working in Iraq, including &pound;85 million for the UN Humanitarian Appeal and &pound;32 million to the ICRC for emergency humanitarian assistance. This includes &pound;4 million for its 2006 Appeal. In 2004, DFID also provided &pound;70 million to the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI). IRFFI has already spent over $18 million on supporting the return and reintegration of IDPs in Iraq. We are in close touch with UN humanitarian agencies so that we are able to respond quickly where unmet needs are identified.</p>

	<p pid="d.110W.8/1">It is not possible to quantify the number of hours that any one trainee might spend focusing upon special education needs (SEN), nor indeed any other aspect of their initial teacher training (ITT).</p>
	<p pid="d.110W.8/2">All accredited providers of ITT have to design their programmes leading to the award of qualified teacher status to meet the standards and the requirements for ITT as set out currently by the Secretary of State. Specific standards relating to SEN state that trainees will:</p>
	<p pid="d.110W.8/3" class="indent">understand their responsibilities under the SEN code of practice, and know how to seek advice from specialists on less common types of special educational needs;</p>

	<p pid="d.110W.8/6" class="indent">differentiate their teaching to meet the needs of pupils, including the more able and those with special educational needs&mdash;again with guidance from an experienced teacher where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="d.110W.8/7">Most ITT programmes include substantial time spent training in schools, where trainees will become aware and learn about SEN issues along with other aspects of teaching. Providers must ensure that training takes account of individual trainees' needs, meaning that training will be personalised, and not be based on a one-size-fits-all model.</p>

	<p pid="d.131W.2/1">The Department for Social Development supports volunteering policy and practice in a number of ways. It provides core funding to the Volunteer Development Agency as a regional infrastructure organisation to promote and support volunteering practice. It also invests over &pound;1.1 million per year under the Volunteer Bureau Initiative to improve the local organisation and infrastructure of volunteering by providing core funding to a network of 15 volunteer centres across Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="d.131W.2/2">The key activities of the volunteer centres are to promote volunteering and good practice, to recruit volunteers, to identify volunteering opportunities with local organisations and place volunteers with these organisations.</p>
	<p pid="d.131W.2/3">The Department also encourages volunteering through the Community Volunteering Scheme (CVS). CVS provides &pound;3 million over three years (2006-2009) through a grants programme with the following objectives:</p>
	<p pid="d.131W.2/4" class="indent">to encourage and support volunteering;</p>
	<p pid="d.131W.2/5" class="indent">create and enhance opportunities for volunteers that will encourage learning and good practice; and</p>
	<p pid="d.131W.2/6" class="indent">promote diversity and a positive image of volunteering and community participation.</p>
	<p pid="d.131W.2/7">The CVS programme is administered by the Volunteer Development Agency on behalf of the Department. Earlier this year CVS main grants totalling &pound;2.2 million over three years were awarded to 27 organisations. The projects funded cover a range of issues including young people, the elderly, health and the environment, across Northern Ireland. A further &pound;0.7 million is also available from the CVS small grants. Grants of up to &pound;1,000 are available to locally based organisations to help promote volunteering and voluntary involvement.</p>
	<p pid="d.131W.2/8">In partnership with a number of volunteer involving organisations and agencies, the Department for Social Development has commenced work on the development of a new volunteering strategy for Northern Ireland. The aims of the strategy are to create an inclusive volunteering environment, to improve the volunteering experience and nurture positive attitudes to volunteering, to promote the value and benefits of volunteering to society and to strengthen volunteer involving organisations and the volunteering infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="d.131W.2/9">The Department for Social Development has also taken a positive approach to encouraging volunteering across Government Departments, through employer supported volunteering, and by its own staff. It promotes the voluntary and charitable work of staff in its staff communications and it has an employer supported volunteering scheme which facilitates the involvement of its staff in voluntary work.</p>

	<p pid="d.132W.2/2">In 2001 DSD commissioned the Volunteer Development Agency to produce an omnibus survey about the nature and extent of volunteering in Northern Ireland.

	<p pid="d.132W.6/2">An initial assessment of departmental aviation emissions was carried out using air travel data from 2005-06 and the conversion factors published in DEFRA's 'Guidelines for Company Reporting on Greenhouse Gas Emissions'. These factors are currently 0.11 kg CO2 per passenger kilometre for long-haul travel, and 0.15 kg CO2 per passenger kilometre for short-haul. For the purposes of the Government Carbon Offsetting Fund, a multiplier of x2 has been applied to the estimated totals to take into account the additional climate impact of non-CO2 emissions at altitude. The calculations do not differentiate between economy and business class travel due to the minimal difference in emissions involved and the difficulty of accurately accounting for total passenger numbers on individual flights.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.6/3">To apply an offsetting cost figure to Departments, these initial assessment emissions totals were multiplied by &pound;10. This is based upon the agreed price per tonne of CO2 in relation to offsetting the UK's G8 presidency.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.6/4">The actual cost per tonne to be paid will depend on the offsetting fund procurement process, which is due to conclude at the start of December. Initial assessment emissions figures will be updated using actual departmental air travel data for 2006-07. Final calculations of CO2 tonnage and associated offsetting costs will be carried out in April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.6/5">Each Department, except for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which operate their own schemes, will pay the amount owed for its emissions into the central Government Carbon Offsetting Fund.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.6/6">Proceeds from the fund will be used to purchase Certified Emission Reduction credits from energy efficiency and renewable energy projects that are based in developing countries and accredited under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Clean Development Mechanism.</p>
	<p pid="d.132W.6/7">The fund will seek to offset around 300,000 tonnes of CO2 by mid-2009.</p>

	<p pid="d.133W.5/1">A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) published in July 2004 concluded that, taken as a whole, the measures introduced in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 do not involve significant additional costs for local authorities. Indeed, the RIA concluded they could well lead to overall savings in local authority costs through increased efficiency and effective, well publicised enforcement.</p>

In most cases, local authorities have the flexibility to set their own fixed penalty rates and, since November 2003, they have been able to retain receipts from FPNs issued for local environmental crimes. Most local authorities must re-direct this money into their street cleansing service, although those awarded an 'excellent' or 'good' rating are free to use the penalty receipts as they wish.</p>

	<p pid="d.134W.5/1">The responsibility for assessing the effectiveness of the work of the Dart Estuary Environment Management (DEEM) Partnership lies with the partnership's steering group. The good work the partnership has achieved for the local environment, through its participation in the Cycleau Project, has recently been recognised by its partners and supporters, who wish to see that work continue in the future.</p>
	<p pid="d.134W.5/2">In June 2006, DEFRA conducted a consultation on how we might promote a more integrated approach to coastal management in England. This consultation questioned how coastal and estuary partnerships are functioning and how they might be supported. The responses to the consultation are currently being reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="d.134W.5/3">Government policy is that ports are not eligible for public funding, on the grounds that subsidy is likely to cause market distortion in an otherwise free sector. The Dart Harbour Navigation Authority is a trust port and obtains its funding by way of charges levied on its users. It has a duty to use funds for the benefit of the management of the harbour, which can include participating in a voluntary partnership to help manage the estuary.</p>
	<p pid="d.134W.5/4">The DEEM Partnership was formed to implement the DEEM Plan, which is non-statutory. It is for the local partners to decide whether to continue voluntary financial contributions after December 2006 when Cycleau comes to an end. The South West Region of the Environment Agency has decided to continue to fund estuary partnerships where affordable, and it has recently agreed to provide funding for the River Dart for another year while it reviews the future of DEEM with the other local partners.</p>

As an alternative, the contractor proposed to study members of the police as a substitute control group.

All veterinary medicines must satisfy the required criteria of quality, safety and efficacy before they are granted a marketing authorisation. While the directive provides the framework by which veterinary medicines are authorised detailed guidelines have been issued by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) to cover in more detail the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy. Guidelines on how to carry out a risk assessment for the user of the product, the consumer and the environment have all been issued by the CVMP and are followed by the UK licensing authority.
