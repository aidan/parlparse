	<p pid="b.1219W.3/1">We are pressing for the development of an open emissions trading system for international aviation through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly. However, we want to take advantage of the groundbreaking EU Emissions Trading Scheme and are therefore pressing for the inclusion of aviation into the EU ETS as a priority for our presidency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.3/2">The European Commission has adopted a Communication on reducing the climate change impact of aviation, favouring the inclusion of the climate impact of aviation into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). They aim to bring forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2006. Our aim is to reach a consensus on the way forward at the December Environment Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.3/3">The Commission have set up an Aviation Working Group under the European Climate Change Programme to discuss the design criteria involved in such a scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.3/4">Emissions trading would give added weight to other emissions-reducing actions for which the Government will press, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.3/5" class="indent">improved working practices by airports, airlines and air traffic controllers;</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.3/6" class="indent">research and development by aerospace manufacturers of new technologies; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.3/7" class="indent">voluntary action by airlines, airports and aerospace companies to control greenhouse gas emissions and develop sustainability strategies. Such action should include emissions reporting and targets at a company level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.3/8">We recognise that these measures may not provide a total solution, therefore we continue to explore and discuss options for the use of other economic instruments.</p>

During the process of adoption of the regulation in the European institutions, the Department for Transport submitted a partial regulatory impact assessment to the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, informing it that the regulation would impose a regulatory burden on aircraft operators. No further assessment of the effect of the regulation on the cost of insurance for aircraft operators has been made, but some heavy historic aircraft have had to increase their insurance levels in relation to third party liability. The insurance industry has recognised the problem and sought to make premia affordable.</p>

	<p pid="b.1222W.5/1">UK airlines are required to have a flight and duty time limitation scheme approved by the Civil Aviation Authority and to take all reasonable steps to ensure that all members of their flight crew comply with the scheme. Such schemes have to include the statutory annual flight duty time limit imposed on individual members of flight crew. Flight time limitation schemes are designed to ensure that flight crew do not exceed annual duty time limits and breaches of the limits are few. The CAA does not keep a central record of breaches of duty time limits, but does audit operators records on a regular basis and, if required, ensures that changes to working patterns are instituted.</p>

	<p pid="b.1224W.2/1">European Directive 1999/94/EC requires car fuel consumption and carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2</sub> ) emissions information to be provided to consumers by means of labels and other media. The figures used are obtained by testing new vehicles to the ED fuel consumption/CO <sub>2</sub> driving procedure on a chassis-dynamometer (rolling-road). This standardised procedure is aimed at providing prospective new car buyers with a simple comparison of the relative efficiency of new vehicles. By its very nature it cannot anticipate the fuel consumption and C0 <sub>2</sub> emissions that will be achieved by any particular motorist under any conditions of use. Fuel consumption on the road is significantly affected by many factors, especially driving style, traffic and road conditions, load carried, terrain, and the use of heaters, air conditioning and lights. It is therefore impossible to provide a single fuel consumption and, hence, CO <sub>2</sub> figure that is representative for all road users.</p>

	<p pid="b.1228W.2/1">A scheme to widen the M1 between junctions 21 and 30 was added to the Government's Targeted Programme of Improvements (TPI) in April 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1228W.2/2">This scheme includes proposals to provide a free flow link between the M1 Southbound and M69 and the M69 to M1 northbound.

	<p pid="b.1232W.5/1">Revenue protection is the responsibility of each train operator. The increase in penalty fare has restored and slightly increased the real value of the penalty, which had remained unchanged at &pound;10 since 1989. We expect this increase to help train operators reduce the amount of ticketless travel on their networks.</p>

Amounts shown include general PRBS (i.e. a general contribution to the overall budget) and sector PRBS (i.e. support with a more restricted focus). We do not have centrally collated figures for PRBS payments made prior to this period; to obtain this information for 1999&ndash;2000 would incur a disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1246W.5/1">DFID is providing &pound;2 million to the United Nations children's fund, UNICEF, for immediate relief purposes and for the restoration of public services, following flooding due to excess monsoon rains that occurred in many parts of India in July 2005. Approximately 37 per cent. (&pound;740,000) is directed to the State of Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital. A substantial proportion of this is directed to Mumbai municipality and the remainder to districts of the state which were severely flood affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246W.5/2">DFID funding has been used to provide immediate relief for flood victims, including blankets, oral re-hydration salts and appropriate medicines to combat diarrhoeal diseases resulting from contamination of water supplies, and provision of safe water and sanitary facilities and surveillance systems to reduce disease outbreaks. Provision has also been made for post disaster recovery in the slightly longer term (up to six months), including restoration of mother and child health centres, development of water supply and sanitation facilities, including in schools, and strengthening of health services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246W.5/3">It is worth noting that the Government of India has a well developed capacity for responding to natural disasters and rarely requests outside assistance. The request to assist with flood relief in Maharashtra and elsewhere came from UNICEF and we received timely approval from the Indian Government to proceed.</p>

From this allocation, &pound;31 million has been committed to the Multi Donor Trust Fund in Indonesia, of which &pound;6 million has so far been paid out. A further &pound;5 million has been committed for technical assistance in Indonesia to help ensure timely, accountable and equitable provision of reconstruction assistance and rebuilding of livelihoods. A total of &pound;2 million has been committed to Sri Lanka to help speed up implementation of reconstruction programmes and to ensure equitable distribution of assistance, and &pound;1.5 million of this has been allocated to the North East Provincial Council to increase their capacity to deliver services to affected communities. A total of &pound;3 million has been committed to India to provide technical assistance aimed at ensuring effective, transparent and equitable programming of tsunami reconstruction efforts. The use of the balance will depend on evidence of where this funding can be most appropriately used.</p>

	<p pid="b.1247W.5/4">For the next 10 years, we will also be providing &pound;41 million of Debt Relief, which will meet 10 per cent. of the cost of Sri Lanka's loan repayments to the International Development Association, the concessional lending arm of the World Bank. This will release Sri Lanka's own funds for tsunami recovery and poverty alleviation programmes. We expect to make the first payment of approximately &pound;3.2 million in December.</p>

	<p pid="b.1248W.5/1">The UK Government are committed to the development of an open and rules-based international trading system that fulfils its potential to contribute to the reduction of poverty in poorer countries. Our key policy commitments on trade and development, as well as our objectives for the current Round of multilateral trade talks, are set out in the Government's White Papers, &quot;Making Globalisation a Force for Good&quot; (July 2004) and &quot;Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work for the Poor&quot; (December 2000). The UK Government are working hard to support the poorest and most vulnerable producers, be it through multilateral negotiations in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) or regional trade agreements such as the Economic Partnership Agreements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248W.5/2">The UK Government do not support forced liberalisation or unfettered free trade. The UK Government fully supports the view that developing countries should be allowed to develop their own trade policies. At the G8 summit this principle was endorsed by others who agreed that within the WTO negotiations</p>
	<p pid="b.1248W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;flexibility will help least developed countries to decide, plan and sequence their overall economic reforms in line with their country led development programmes and international obligations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1248W.5/4">In the long-term the removal of trade barriers, if managed properly, can help developing countries can gain better access to developed country markets and more competitively priced inputs. However, the agenda is broad. We must not only reduce barriers to trade such as subsidies and import tariffs but also invest in developing countries capacities to trade. To do this we are providing additional development assistance to poor countries to help them undertake this investment and give them the time and space to adjust to trade reforms.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248W.5/5">The G8 also agreed to provide increased funds for trade related capacity building to assist developing countries take advantage of the new opportunities from a positive conclusion to the Round. There is increased international support for increased 'Aid for Trade' as reflected at the recent World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) meetings and the G8 summit in Gleneagles. It is important that we build rapidly on the outcome of these meetings.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248W.5/6">We now have less than five weeks to go before Hong Kong and are working with international partners to deliver on the ambition of Doha and build on G8 commitments. The UK Government are working to achieve an outcome that delivers real gains for developing countries, including the poorest. These gains should include improved participation by developing countries in the world trading system, through substantially increased market access for developing countries and the dismantling of trade-distorting agricultural subsidies by industrialised countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.1249W.2/2">As one response to these commitments, we have played a leading role in establishing the infrastructure consortium, which aims to accelerate progress towards meeting urgent infrastructure needs in Africa. It will address both national and regional constraints to infrastructure development and encourage better co-ordination and collaboration in key infrastructure sectors. The consortium is not a financing agency, but will act as a platform to broker more donor financing of infrastructure projects and programmes in Africa.</p>

	<p pid="b.1255W.0/1">It is a fundamental principle of the social security system that only one benefit at a time can be paid for income maintenance. Carer's allowance provides a measure of financial support to those who give up the opportunity of full-time paid employment to care for a severely disabled person. As such it is not an &quot;extra-costs&quot; benefit. To pay both benefits in full therefore would duplicate provision for the same need.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255W.0/2">Where carer's allowance is overlapped in full, the person maintains an underlying entitlement to the benefit which, in turn, gives them access to the carer premium in the income-related benefits such as income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255W.0/3">There are no plans to change this policy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1259W.8/2">In 2004 the Italian constitutional court ruled that domestic time limits on pre-trial custody applied to people in custody outside Italy for whom a request for extradition had been made. This time limit would not however have applied in Faraj's case had he been notified by the relevant UK authorities of the completion of a pre-trial investigation on him in Italy. The Italian authorities requested on eight April 2003 that such notification be given urgently.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.8/3">They did not specify a deadline. Unfortunately, although an earlier request for the transmission of evidence was acted on immediately, the notification was, by oversight, not made to Faraj. The fact, and significance, of this omission were not appreciated at the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259W.8/4">The UK authorities were first alerted by the Italian authorities to the implications of the constitutional court's ruling on custody time limits for the Faraj case in October 2005, and notification was then immediately given. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-10">10 October</phrase> the Italian authorities withdrew their extradition request, stating that the order for pre-trial custody in prison had been revoked following the dismissal of proceedings. Faraj remains in immigration detention in the UK, pending further consideration of his immigration position.</p>

	<p pid="b.1260W.5/1">The Forensic Science Service (FSS) piloted the principles of work structuring in 2002 and subsequently adopted a more comprehensive programme of work early in 2005. Work structuring focuses on the key importance of staff and their positioning in terms of work organisation. Strategies, structures and systems are assessed and redesigned to support staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.1260W.5/2">The effects of the work structuring project are measured in terms of business performance, staff motivation and morale. The work is currently in progress and it is expected that the realisation of the benefits identified will be spread within a two to three-year time period.</p>

	<p pid="b.1261W.6/1">In response to the themes identified by the Bichard inquiry, the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) embarked on a pilot exercise to explore and investigate the benefits and costs of facilitating the provision of an on-line identity authentication service to authenticate the identity of disclosure applicants.</p>
	<p pid="b.1261W.6/2">To that end, in July 2004 the CRB posted a Government Opportunities Notice seeking expressions of interest from suppliers of on-line identity authentication services to take part in a three-month pilot to trial products, at the supplier's own cost, with CRB registered bodies. Following the application of a basic sift criteria the following suppliers were invited to take part in the pilot: BT, Call-credit, Equifax and Experian. The pilot involved each supplier providing his or her product directly to a registered body. No charge was made to CRB or the participating registered bodies for the use of the products deployed at the registered bodies. Importantly, the on-line authentication check did not replace the current CRB authentication rules&mdash;the check was conducted alongside the normal paper-based checks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1261W.6/3">Each pilot ran for a period of 12 weeks, the start date largely dependent on the sector in which the body operated. Registered bodies held the responsibility for obtaining the applicants consent for the pilot, obtained through a 'Consent Statement' specifically developed by the CRB for the pilot exercise. The general view of registered bodies participating in the pilot was that, while they could see the benefits of deploying similar systems in support of the identity authentication process for disclosure applicants, the type of system trialled whereby electronic authentication is required did not in its present form add any significant benefit to the current authentication process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1261W.6/4">It is important to note that the products deployed by the four pilot suppliers were 'off the shelf' for the purposes of the pilot although each supplier was keen to stress that bespoke solutions are available. Following the successful conclusion of the pilot exercise, the pilot report conclusions and the wider identity-related developments in government and commerce are currently under consideration by the CRB Management Board.</p>

We do not hold any statistics on the number of women who are working illegally in the sex industry and the nature of both on and off-street prostitution makes the collecting of reliable information difficult and any data must be viewed with a degree of caution.</p>

I also receive correspondence from Members of Parliament and the public regarding the sentencing of sexual offenders in relation to specific cases.</p>

	<p pid="b.1267W.5/1">European Court of Justice (ECJ) case C0229/05 involves a freeze on assets imposed by the European Community pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1373 (2001). Effective implementation of UNSCR 1373 (2001) is apriority for the UK as a central component of the international community's efforts against terrorism. The UK fully supported the decision by the European Council to impose an asset freeze on certain Kurdish political groups and intervened in support of the European Council before the Court of First Instance. The action against the European Council was dismissed by that court. Although the UK has not intervened again in the appeal of the case to the ECJ, it continues to support fully the case put forward by the European Council.</p>

But it emphasised that both countries need to urgently step up the implementation of reforms in the areas of Justice and Home Affairs, agriculture, the environment and administrative capacity. The Commission will continue to closely monitor their progress and will produce a follow-up report in spring next year.

	<p pid="b.1271W.5/1">We are greatly concerned by attacks on humanitarian workers in Darfur. In recent weeks there have been a number of attacks on World Food Programme convoys in Southern Darfur. These attacks appear to have been carried out by bandits. Humanitarian operations are critical in supporting the civilians in Darfur, and any attacks on United Nations (UN) and non-governmental humanitarian agencies put their work in jeopardy and limits access to those who need assistance. At present, the UN reports that it is confident that all areas of Darfur are accessible by helicopter, and at least intermittently by road. They report that despite these serious incidents, humanitarian services to all areas are continuing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1271W.5/2">We make regular representations to all parties in the Darfur conflict and have made clear that the harassment, abduction and attacks on humanitarian workers in Darfur is unacceptable and the perpetrators must be brought to justice. During his visit to Sudan on 5&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-10-08">8 October</phrase> my noble Friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister for Africa (Lord Triesman of Tottenham), met representatives from non-governmental organisations and UN agencies in Darfur to hear their views on the security situation which is hampering the humanitarian relief effort. He raised these issues strongly with the Sudanese Government, pressing the importance of improving the security situation and allowing aid workers to operate freely. The African Union Mission in Sudan, to which we are providing almost &pound;32 million, is having a positive effect on security where it is deployed.</p>

However, graduate medical students on four year fast track courses, who now comprise the majority of graduate medical students, do not pay tuition fee contributions except in their first year because the Department of Health pays the fees in years two to four. The Department of Health also pays the fees of undergraduate medical students, including those with a previous graduate qualification, in years five and six.

But there is evidence that our strategy of transforming the aspirations of children in order to widen participation in HE is boosting performance. For example, participation in summer schools (and other university and school-based holiday programmes), visits to higher education institutions and discussion about life at university with higher education staff and student have all been found in independent evaluation to be associated with higher attainment at key stage 4.</p>

	<p pid="b.1290W.0/1">Government funding for teaching in higher education is allocated via the Higher Education Funding Council for England on a formula basis. Institutions receive this and their funding for research as block grant. The funding institutions will receive from HEFCE and student fees in the current spending review period to 2007&ndash;08 is sufficient to maintain the unit of student per funding in real terms, after many years of decline. It is for institutions to decide how best to spend this money, and we have no intention of micromanaging their budgets. It is more effective and less bureaucratic to judge institutions by the outcomes they achieve.</p>

	<p pid="b.1290W.3/1">Voluntary and community organisations are important partners in delivering the outcomes we want to see for children and young people. We expect that local authorities will engage with their local voluntary and community sectors in line with guidance relating to the Children Act 2004. Whether or not a local authority chooses to operate a system of registration for voluntary sector organisations they are funding and the nature of any registration system, including how this covers the training and qualification of personnel, is a matter for local decision.</p>

	<p pid="b.1290W.3/4">On inspection, joint area reviews of children's services, by several inspectorates, assess how services contribute to outcomes for children and young people. They include assessing the contribution of local authority funded youth services, whether provided by public or voluntary and community sectors. A joint area review will take place in each local authority area between September 2005 and December 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1297W.2/2">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence published in August 2005 guidance on &quot;Improving Outcomes in Children and Young People with Cancer&quot;. This guidance addresses access to age appropriate facilities and places of care. The National Cancer Director has established an advisory group of major stakeholders to facilitate the implementation of the guidance, but ultimately it will be for local commissioners, via their cancer networks and local service providers, to ensure that the services they provide meet the recommendations in this guidance.</p>

	<p pid="b.1297W.5/1">Officials in the Department are in regular contact with officials in the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). These contacts ensure that there is a shared understanding of the effects of carbon monoxide on health. Strategies for reducing cases of accidental poisoning are discussed regularly. The Chief Medical Officer often draws attention to the dangers of exposure to carbon monoxide in his CMO update letter to doctors. A leaflet, for distribution to all General Practices will be distributed in November. The leaflet has been endorsed by HSE, The Solid Fuel Association, CORGI, CO-Gas Safety and the Heating Equipment Testing and Approval Scheme. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister assisted in the drafting of the leaflet. The leaflet is entitled &quot;Carbon Monoxide: Risks to health and how to avoid them&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1297W.5/2">The combined emphasis on prevention of poisoning and recognition of poisoning reflects the cross-department approach to this important problem. The Department has not discussed the proposal for a levy on the gas industry to fund a watchdog to promote carbon monoxide awareness; this is a matter for the HSE.</p>

	<p pid="b.1302W.5/2">In order to realise the vision and the benefits of 'Taking Healthcare to the Patient: Transforming NHS Ambulance Services', ambulance trusts need to be of a size that enables appropriate investment in people and resources to underpin current and future services and enable the vision set out in the ambulance review to be delivered.

	<p pid="b.1309W.2/1">The Department commissioned a security review at the three high security hospitals (Broadmoor, Ashworth and Rampton) in 2000, which recommended improved security measures to the perimeter and internal security of the hospitals. The Government accepted that all of the review report's recommendations should be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="b.1309W.2/2">These hospitals must also comply with safety and security directions given to the hospitals by the Department, which encompass various security requirements and cover issues such as the searching of patients and their rooms, the circumstances in which patients should be permitted access to computers and the arrangements that should be made for the testing of patients for illicit substances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1309W.2/3">The high security hospitals are also subjected to annual prison service security audits. The prison service security audit team report that the audits show that security standards at the hospitals are essentially satisfactory and continue to improve.</p>

	<p pid="b.1309W.2/5">Security of all units combines physical, operational and relational aspects, which consider building and engineering design, operational policies and staffing levels. Other measures to improve relational security included the joint interim guidance from the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) and the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) in February 2004 to support mental health service providers and enable them to review their current policies and procedures relating to education, training and practice in the safe and therapeutic management of aggression and violence.</p>

Survey data show the number of haemodialysis stations in England increased by more than a third between 1998 and 2002, from 1,890 to 2,582, with a further 378 planned at that point, the most recent for which complete data are available. Many of these are in satellite units, which can be sited to provide access to dialysis closer to home for renal patients with routine conditions: the number of satellite units rose from 73 in 1998 to 101 in 2002, with a further 34 planned.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.0/2">This supports &quot;The National Service Framework for Renal Services, Part One&quot;, which the Department published in 2004, which set standards for dialysis services and identified their continued expansion as an early action for commissioners. The national surveys commissioned by the Department provide data to support the planning and commissioning of dialysis services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310W.0/3">Many patients rely on hospital transport services to access the dialysis unit. The Department has funded two action learning sets to develop and test improvements to non-emergency patient transport services for dialysis patients, in urban and rural areas.

Together this strategy has helped reduce adult smoking rates in England from 28 per cent. in 1998 to 25 per cent. in 2003, around 1.2 million smokers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1315W.0/1">Some of the provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 already directly extend to Northern Ireland. Further extensions were not proposed at that time as a contemporaneous review of the Criminal Justice System in Northern Ireland was planned and it would have been inappropriate to do so in advance of the review's conclusions. A series of other important measures, provided in the Act, have subsequently been introduced, in recent years, through separate Northern Ireland legislation. These have included provisions dealing with hate crime, antisocial behaviour, reparation orders in youth justice and the creation of additional bail powers. There are no plans to extend the remaining provisions to Northern Ireland at the current time but this will be kept under review in response to operational needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1317W.2/1">The PSNI are the sole source of reliable information about domestic violence as they capture recorded crimes with a domestic motivation. The information is therefore only available across PSNI District Command Units and is set out in the table for the year 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317W.2/2">It is however believed these figures do not reflect the true level of domestic violence in Northern Ireland, In the Northern Ireland Crime Survey 2003&ndash;04 19 per cent. of female respondents claimed they had been the victims of domestic violence at some time in their lives, while 11 per cent. of male respondents made a similar claim.</p>

	<p pid="b.1323W.8/2">In 2005&ndash;06, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety provided &pound;550,000 to support nutrition and healthy eating, the Food Standards Agency allocated &pound;75,000 to non-school based nutrition education and the Department of Education has allocated up to &pound;10,000 to inform parents about the new nutritional standards for school meals and also provide them with general healthy eating advice for their children. This advice outlines the new standards and explains why they are needed in schools. It also outlines how parents can be involved by, for example, encouraging their children to eat healthier options at home and elsewhere. In addition, nutrition education forms part of the plans of Investing for Health Partnerships, Health Action Zones and a number of the Healthy Living Centres. The Big Lottery's Coronary Heart Disease, Stroke and Cancer programme has also supported a number of nutrition education initiatives in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1323W.8/3">A range of primary care professionals offer advice on healthy eating as part of their health promotion role. In particular, advising parents on the benefits of a healthy diet for young children is part of the universal core programme for child health screening and surveillance, which is delivered by midwives, health visitors and school nurses, but also includes a wider range of professionals such as community dentists.</p>

Data from the old system was retained for a 5 year period but was then deleted. There is therefore no data available on welfare checks prior to March 1996.</p>

Key buildings in the NIO's office estate have all been converted from either oil fire or electric heating to natural gas and now acquire some 25 per cent. of all electricity from renewable sources. A waste stream audit for key sites is currently under way. Steps have taken to ensure that the maximum volume of waste paper is recycled. Arrangements have also been introduced at significant sites to recycle plastic, tin, cardboard and glass. All paper for printing and photocopying is from a recycled source.</p>

This commended the recommendation of the Clothier Report into the Beverley Allitt murders that, in every case, coroners should send copies of post-mortem reports to any consultant who has been involved in the patient's care prior to death, whether or not demanded, under the coroners rules. Any decision in an individual case is a matter for the coroner concerned. My officials will, however, discuss this matter at the next of their regular meetings with coroners.</p>

	<p pid="b.1337W.0/3">Since then, however, there has been an annual downward drift in numbers registering mainly due to the requirement to hold an annual canvass with individuals having to provide information afresh each year. To combat this, the Government, after consulting the political parties and the Electoral Commission, is introducing legislation that will further reform and modernise the electoral registration arrangements. These measures will lift the burden on electors and refocus resources on more effectively targeting those not registered.</p>

	<p pid="b.1339W.6/1">To accurately gauge expenditure on public inquires prior to 1990 would be likely to incur unreasonable costs. However, since 1990 the highest expenditure for a public inquiry has been approximately &pound;30 million for the inquiry into Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy. This figure includes the cost of the inquiry itself, together with the costs of liaison units and legal support for witnesses from all the main Departments involved. Further detailed work would be needed to separate the legal costs from that figure.</p>

	<p pid="b.1341W.8/2">The Carbon Abatement Technology Strategy which I announced in June this year includes a number of activities to encourage the development and deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) also known as Carbon Sequestration technologies. Copies of the Strategy are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1341W.8/3">These activities include support for R and D with some &pound;4 million announced for R and D as part of the latest call for proposals under the Department's Technology Programme. Additionally I announced some &pound;25 million from 2006&ndash;07 over 4 years for the demonstration of Carbon Abatement Technologies which includes Carbon Capture and Storage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1341W.8/4">In his Budget Statement this year my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that we would look into the possibility of measures to encourage the deployment of CCS as part of the Climate Change Programme Review. We expect to announce the results of this when the Review is Published in the next few weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1341W.8/5">A number of other activities identified in the Strategy are also being taken forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.1344W.8/2">The draft Employment Equality (Age) Regulations introduce a new statutory right for employees to request working beyond their employers' compulsory retirement age, if there is one. Employers will have a duty to consider such requests seriously.

	<p pid="b.1344W.8/3" class="indent">&quot;The statutory request by the employee is to continue working under the same terms and conditions as had applied up to the retirement date. However, there is nothing to prevent the employee proposing, or the employer suggesting, a different working pattern that might suit them both better. Neither side will be obliged to accept proposals for change.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.1345W.5/1">Analysis of data over the last twenty years shows that the output of the manufacturing sector has tended to behave more cyclically than the economy as a whole, and that the distributive sectors have experienced a similar strength of cycle to that in the economy as a whole. One reason for manufacturing having a stronger cycle is that it is very dependent on world demand, and thus affected by external shocks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345W.5/2">These findings should be seen against the substantial improvement in macroeconomic stability in the economy as a whole in recent years. In the period since 1997 UK GDP growth has been more stable than any other G7 country. By contrast, in the period 1979&ndash;1996 growth in the UK was the most volatile in the G7, with the exception of Canada.</p>

	<p pid="b.1346W.3/1">There are no regulatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme requires participants to produce carbon allowances equal to their emissions on an annual basis. Under the rules of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme Directive, the Government allocates a number of allowances to installations free of charge. If an installation emits a high level of carbon at one time, it can either purchase additional allowances to cover that or reduce its carbon emissions at other times so as to remain within its existing free allocation for the year or to sell allowances. The scheme therefore does not place any constraint on fuel switching in the event of temporary tightness in the gas supply market, whether due to a cold winter or other cause. The Government has no intention of waiving the requirements of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1346W.3/3">The Government believe that security of supply is best achieved through a liberalised, competitive market in which market participants have every commercial incentive to ensure that supply meets demand and price signals provide the most effective and efficient means of enabling them to do so. The Government and Ofgem work continually with National Grid and with Ofgem to find ways of improving the operation of the market, for example through the provision of better and more timely information and through tackling potential regulatory barriers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1347W.2/1">The impact of increased energy costs on British manufacturing companies will depend on a variety of factors, including how much gas and/or electricity a particular company uses, the degree of their exposure to spot and/or forward prices, and the duration of the high prices. The impact on their competitiveness will also be affected by the energy prices paid by their competitors, both in the UK and internationally.</p>
	<p pid="b.1347W.2/2">Several representative trade associations, such as the Engineering Employers Federation and the British Plastics Federation have made assessments of the impact of increased energy costs on their members. The Department is working with the Energy Intensive Users Group and Ofgem through the Gas Prices Working Group to develop ideas for improving the operation of the forward market and ways to mitigate the effects of high forward gas prices. The group has agreed an Action List of short to medium term measures, such as maximising UK gas supplies, encouraging demand side response and pursuing energy market liberalisation in the EU.</p>

	<p pid="b.1347W.8/2">The European Commission is currently conducting a consultation on the idea of setting up an European Institute of Technology. I have not had any discussions with the Commission on this issue, but I am clear that any further proposals must result in adding value to European universities&mdash;boosting excellence and ensuring Europe is prepared to respond to the challenge of globalisation. We do not however believe that establishing a bricks and mortar institution would be appropriate, but clearly we will want to ensure that universities throughout the UK are well placed to take advantage of whatever eventually emerges from the Commission. The UK response to the Commission's consultation will be submitted shortly and a copy will be placed in the House Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="b.1349W.5/1">In the event of a shortfall in gas supplies the Government expect gas demand to reduce itself in response to rising prices. Which companies choose to reduce their gas consumption in this way is a matter for themselves and will depend on such matters as the terms of their gas supply contracts and their own individual cost structures. In previous years, the electricity supply industry has routinely responded in this way to seasonally higher gas prices, switching electricity production to coal-fired and other generating stations instead, and this sector would be expected to respond in the same way this year. This is described in detail in National Grid's Winter Outlook Report, published by Ofgem on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-05">5 October</phrase> and available at <a href="http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/temp/ofgem/cache/cmsattach/12493_214_05.pdf">www.ofgem.gov.uk/temp/ofgem/cache/cmsattach/12493_214_05.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1349W.5/2">In addition, the Government commissioned a report from Global Insight earlier this year to consider the likely response from other industrial sectors. This is available at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/publications/policy/industrial_demand_responde.pdf">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/publications/policy/industrial_demand_responde.pdf</a>. Work is currently under way jointly with industry to update the conclusions of that work in the light of developments over the summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1349W.5/3">The Government and Ofgem have worked with large industrial users of gas through a Demand Side Working Group and through a Gas Prices Working Group to consider ways of facilitating the operation of the market, particularly on the demand side, and mitigating the impact of higher gas prices. Outputs of that work include the launch of a new website providing near real-time information about supply and demand in the gas market and the introduction of a Gas Balancing Alert notifying market participants when the supply-demand balance is likely to be tight. The Government are also aware of innovative work by market participants themselves to develop instruments to encourage demand side response on a commercial basis.</p>

The total costs of both inspectors as at the end of September are &pound;1.6 million. The accountant inspector has a team of junior staff working for him, retrieving, copying, logging and analysing documents. The costs are inherently front loaded because of the need to obtain the records and financial information at the outset. Whilst it is always difficult to predict the length of inspections both the Secretary of State and the inspectors are intent on completing this inspection as quickly as possible, with due regard to the fairness procedures, and to the thoroughness of the task.</p>

The costs of the inspection are inherently front loaded because of the need to obtain the records and financial information at the outset. While it is always difficult to predict the length of inspections both the Secretary of State and the inspectors are intent on completing this inspection as quickly as possible, with due regard to the fairness procedures, and to the thoroughness of the task.</p>

	<p pid="b.1351W.8/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1351W.8/2" class="indent">(i) The OFT informs me that it does not have figures that differentiate costs between cases pre-dating the launch of its dedicated time recording systems on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase>. The investigation into independent school fees commenced in June 2003. The figures available show that the hours worked by staff in the OFT's Competition Enforcement Division on the investigation since <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-01">1 April 2004</phrase> are approximately 5354. These figures are the direct costs recorded by staff in the OFT's Competition Enforcement Division and do not include time spent by specialists in the OFT's Legal Division or the OFT's economic advice team in its Markets and Policy Initiatives Division.</p>
	<p pid="b.1351W.8/3" class="indent">(ii) The OFT's investigation concerns the exchange of confidential information amongst fee paying independent schools relating to their intended fee increases and fee levels. The OFT has focused its investigation on those schools involved in the survey known as the &quot;Sevenoaks survey&quot;. Further information is contained in a press notice that was issued by the OFT on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-09">9 November 2005</phrase> which is available on the OFT website:</p>
	<p pid="b.1351W.8/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/News/Press">www.oft.gov.uk/News/Press</a>==releases/2005/214</p>
	<p pid="b.1351W.8/5" class="indent">(iii) Save at the very outset, when the investigation was led by a single Principal Investigation Officer, the investigation has at any one time been led by two Principal Case Officers with support, as required, from other staff within the OFT's Competition Directorate Enforcement Division and from the OFT's Legal Division and the economic advice team in its Markets and Policy Initiatives Division. The case has also had up to three paralegal temporary staff employed at any one time to assist with the organisation of the 13,000 plus documents on the OFT's file, to which the parties have a right of access and from which confidential information must be redacted.</p>
	<p pid="b.1351W.8/6">The level of resources dedicated to the case is in proportion to the staff resources the OFT's Competition Enforcement Division dedicates to dealing with cases of this size under the Competition Act 1998. The Division has 156 dedicated staff, including 66 Principal Case Officers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1354W.6/1">Any concerns regarding the quality of power supplies should be directed in the first instance to the appropriate electricity provider. Further concerns should be directed to Energywatch, the independent body for electricity and gas consumers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1354W.6/2">Nationally, I am aware that statistics from national grid show that transmission (high voltage) network reliability has improved from 99.9989 per cent. between 1995&ndash;2000 to 99.9992 per cent. from 2000&ndash;05. The reliability of the distribution networks in Britain has also improved, with power cuts down by 11 per cent. since privatisation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1354W.9/1">The Department has made no such assessment but I am advised that recent studies by Nexia Solutions on comparison of this nature showed that the radio toxicity of irradiated MOX starts off higher compared to irradiated uranium oxide fuel. This is because MOX incorporates plutonium removed from a store and the residual mass of plutonium at discharge from the reactor is higher. However, for a meaningful comparison, it is prudent to compare the radio toxicity of irradiated MOX fuel against that of irradiated uranium oxide fuel combined with stored plutonium. This more meaningful comparison shows that the radio toxicity of irradiated MOX starts off higher than irradiated uranium oxide/stored plutonium until after 1,000 years when the radio toxicity of the irradiated MOX falls below that of the irradiated uranium oxide/stored plutonium.</p>

These included responses to the UK's public consultation last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1355W.2/2">Engagement with all interested stakeholders has been central to the Government's development of policy on the REACH regulation, and the representations made have been taken into account as far as possible in refining successive drafts of the regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1355W.2/3">There is general support from stakeholders for the regulation's objectives of enhancing protection of human health and the environment, and rationalising the existing fragmented regulatory regime. The detailed scrutiny given to the regulation over the last two years is now close to conclusion, and includes clarification of certain exemptions that have been welcomed by the minerals industry. The Government believe the final outcome will enable the REACH regulation to achieve its objectives in a way that helps maintain industry competitiveness.</p>

	<p pid="b.1358W.5/1">The continued development of the social enterprise sector across the region remains a key priority for Yorkshire Forward, the regional development agency for Yorkshire and the Humber. Yorkshire Forward recognises the unique potential of social enterprises to stimulate economic regeneration and business growth in some of our more deprived areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1358W.5/2">As a result, providing support for the social enterprise sector is a key priority within the consultation draft of the revised regional economic strategy, and via its corporate plan, Yorkshire Forward has committed to working with partners to mainstream social enterprise support within the Business Link brokerage networks&mdash;something that is already well established within West Yorkshire via WYSE Link, a partnership between Business Link West Yorkshire and the Social Enterprise Support Centre to deliver tailored support to social enterprises and grow the sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1358W.5/3">In addition, Yorkshire Forward is one of the key partners in the Social Economy Development Framework for Yorkshire and Humber, and 'Onwards and Outwards&mdash;an investment plan for social enterprise for Yorkshire and Humber 2004 to 2014'.</p>
	<p pid="b.1358W.5/4">As part of this region-wide commitment, Yorkshire Forward has already invested over &pound;1.5 million in WYSE Link, and has recently made an additional investment of some &pound;5.7 million to further expand WYSE Link's provision up to March 2009. This ongoing support will help to ensure that social enterprises across West Yorkshire continue to receive a comprehensive and expert business support service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1358W.5/5">Support is available across West Yorkshire and is not available at constituency or district level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1358W.5/6">In addition the Yorkshire and the Humber European Objective 2 programme has also recently developed a specific measure aimed at social enterprises. The total amount of funding available is &pound;6 million ERDF which, with matched funds, should deliver &pound;15 million worth of assistance by 2008. So far one project has been approved in West Yorkshire, based in Wakefield, which will assist 35 social enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="b.1358W.5/7">In 2005, all local authorities in receipt of neighbourhood renewal funding have been invited to apply for funding under the local growth initiative, LEGI, to promote and remove barriers to enterprise in the most deprived areas in England. Those authorities have been given between &pound;80,000 and &pound;120,000 pump priming funds, to help with the development of their proposals. Entry is through a three year rolling programme of annual competitions. Successful applicants will receive anything from &pound;2 million to &pound;10 million, available from five to 10 years.</p>

To do so would risk distorting the electricity supply market and would be incompatible with the liberalised arrangements for the UK electricity market and the market for renewable electricity provided by the Renewables Obligation. The framework underpinning our competitive energy markets was established to provide market-based solutions to our energy needs. Intervention by the Government to the extent of setting a price for exported electricity would be an unwarranted intervention that could have adverse effects on the confidence and certainty our liberal framework provides for investors.</p>

	<p pid="b.1361W.5/1">Statistics on replacement tyre sales are provided by the British Rubber Manufacturers' Association and the Imported Tyre Manufacturers' Association. These sources represent the majority of activity in this sector, but there are other routes to market and the figures should therefore be viewed as indicative. A similar caution applies to the information relating to used tyre disposal and recovery, which DTI compiles on behalf of the used tyre working group.</p>

	<p pid="b.1361W.5/29">Information covering 2004 and the first six months of 2005 is expected to be available in early December. Figures already received covering 2004 show that the overall used tyre recovery performance has continued to improve.</p>
	<p pid="b.1361W.5/30">Tyres disposed of to landfill arise from two principal channels, retail outlets and end of life vehicles (ELVs). In the former case, figures show a sharp drop from over 87,000 tonnes in 2001 to under 30,000 tonnes in 2003. In the latter ELV a figure of 57,000 tonnes has remained constant for a number of years on the basis that all ELV tyres not reused as part-worns or retreads are disposed to landfill. DTI, together with the Environment Agency, has commissioned a survey of landfill operators to cover 2004 and the first six months of 2005 to establish more accurately the volume of tyres disposed to landfill.</p>
	<p pid="b.1361W.5/31">Tyre fly-tipping takes a number of forms, including those dealt with by landowners and local authorities, and those tyres dumped on the forecourts of tyre retail premises. No national data were collected before Defra and the Environment Agency set up the flycapture database in April 2004. English Waste Collection Authorities reported 23,046 incidents of fly-tipped tyres between April 2004 and March 2005. From April 2005 to September 2005 11,440 incidents were reported. The Environment Agency dealt with 280 incidents in 2004&ndash;05 and 77 so far in this financial year.</p>
