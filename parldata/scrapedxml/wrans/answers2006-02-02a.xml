	<p pid="a.625W.6/1">The Government are fully committed to maintaining the quality of environmental science in the UK and provides funding to the Natural Environment Research Council for this purpose. NERC is currently consulting widely with stakeholders on proposals on how best the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology can contribute on a sustainable basis to this. I am sure that NERC Council will consider all evidence and views on the potential impact of the proposals, including any impact on wildlife research. The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology will continue to deliver its contractual commitments to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs arid other Government Department and agencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.629W.11/1">Defra plays a leading role in taking forward the Government's commitment to tackle fuel poverty. This is reflected in our PSA target, wording of which is shared with DTI, which endorses the commitment to eradicate fuel poverty, as far as reasonably practicable, in vulnerable households in England by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.11/2">Defra is responsible for the Warm Front Scheme, which is the key tool for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England. Since its launch in June 2000 it has assisted more than 1 million households with a range of insulation and heating measures and energy efficiency advice. The new phase of the scheme, launched in June 2005, is better equipped to target and assist those most in need in a sustainable way.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.11/3">Funding for Warm Front was enhanced by the announcement in the pre-Budget report 2005 of an additional &pound;250 million for Warm Front in the period 2005&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.11/4">The Department works closely with colleagues across Government who have an interest in this area including the Departments of Trade and Industry, Work and Pensions and Health, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasury as well as the Devolved Administrations. This ensures that all areas which impact on our ability to tackle fuel poverty&mdash;energy efficiency, income and fuel cost&mdash;can be fully considered and appropriate action taken.</p>

	<p pid="a.631W.11/1">Our statement of policy for England's ancient and native woodlands &quot;Keepers of Time&quot; which we published last year sets out a number of strategic objectives which include the creation of new native woodland to extend, link arid complement existing woodland and other habitats. It also sets the objective of increasing the recognition and use of 'environmental services' which native woodland can provide, for example flood alleviation and pollution mitigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.631W.11/2">The England forestry strategy review and the review of the UK climate change programme are looking at how existing policies are performing and the range of polices that might be put in place in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.638W.2/1">No such guidance has yet been produced in relation to the new casinos permitted by the Gambling Act 2005. The Gambling Commission has published guidance in relation to alcohol on the gaming floor of casinos licensed under the 1968 Act, and the regulation of alcohol provision in the new casinos will be developed from this model.</p>
	<p pid="a.638W.2/2">If it becomes clear that alcohol is becoming a problem in either existing casinos or those new casinos permitted by the 2005 Act, there are powers under the Licensing Act 2003 and the Gambling Act 2005 to stop it being served.</p>

	<p pid="a.641W.2/1">We are monitoring the situation closely and I have written to all leaders of the 149 library authorities in England to remind them of their statutory obligations. Primarily, the operation of library services are a matter for determination by the elected representatives of the parent authorities. However, public libraries are valuable community assets and local decision makers should think carefully about what might be lost through closures.</p>

	<p pid="a.641W.9/1">There is no humanitarian emergency in China. The country has made dramatic progress in reducing absolute poverty over the last 25 years, with over 450 million people lifted out of poverty. There are, however, still 135 million people below the poverty line and progress towards some of the Millennium Development Goals is slower than expected. The DFID programme focuses on increasing access to basic education, water and sanitation and basic health services, and on tackling HIV and AIDS and Tuberculosis.</p>
	<p pid="a.641W.9/2">In Ethiopia, 2.6 million people in, especially in the Somali, Afar and Oromia regions, have been badly affected by the drought and will need humanitarian assistance in 2006. The Government of Ethiopia and UN agencies issued an appeal on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January 2006</phrase>, with particular emphasis on non-food needs such as health, nutrition, water, sanitation and livestock. We are considering our response. We will also continue to support the Government of Ethiopia's Productive Safety Nets Programme which provides assistance to those communities and households most vulnerable to crop failure by enabling them to invest in assets like clothes and livestock, or to build roads or protect water supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.641W.9/3">Burma is one of the poorest countries in Asia. It is not on track to achieve any of the Millennium Development Goals. There is little reliable data but we know that many of Burma's 50 million people face poverty and vulnerability. We provide &pound;500,000 a year humanitarian assistance through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to support displaced people in Eastern Burma.</p>

	<p pid="a.642W.5/1">Vulnerability is a factor which DFID takes into account in allocating aid to particular countries. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), approximately half of the world's least developed countries face high levels of natural disaster risk and the impact on poor people is increasing. It is important that developing countries ensure that their planning includes efforts to minimise the impact of risk and respond more effectively when disasters occur. DFID has produced a new policy outlining our approach to disaster risk reduction which will be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.5/2">DFID is funding significant disaster risk reduction programmes in countries susceptible to disasters. For example, we are providing over &pound;60 million to support disaster preparedness in Orissa, India. In Bangladesh, with the UNDP, we are supporting the development of the government's Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme which is helping to improve legislation, programming and co-ordination across government ministries on disaster risk reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.5/3">DFID is also providing support for the international disaster risk reduction system. We are one of the leading donors to the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, contributing around &pound;1 million per year and we are providing &pound;3.75 million to support the Pan American Health Organisations' work in the Caribbean to reduce the vulnerability of the health sector to disasters. Our support to the disaster risk reduction work of the Red Cross and international non-governmental organisations totals over &pound;16 million.</p>
