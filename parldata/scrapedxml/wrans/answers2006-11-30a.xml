Through these events the CPS reached over 350 groups and individuals working with Muslim communities. The events will now be evaluated with a view to informing a further series in 2007-08. The further events, in areas yet to be determined, are expected to run on a quarterly basis throughout 2007-08. The events will be kept under active review in terms of the need for an ongoing programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.808W.2/12">The volume of cases handled by the CPS has fallen in recent years. This is believed to be a direct and positive reflection of lower levels of crime and the introduction of penalty notices for disorder. Furthermore, the same period has seen an appreciable increase in the proportion of cases resulting in conviction. This is partly because of an initiative which means that, in most cases, the CPS has responsibility for deciding whether a person should be charged with a criminal offence and, if so, what that offence should be. The CPS has set performance targets providing for farther improvement in case outcomes in the future and it continues to work with its criminal justice system partners to ensure that these are delivered.</p>

A thorough investigation took place and concluded that there was no evidence of criminal activity. Those identified from the video independently confirmed that the video shows high jinks during an off-duty period with no malice intended. No complaints were lodged.</p>

	<p pid="a.815W.2/1">The recent signing of the Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement presents an opportunity for all donors to take a fresh look at their support to the east. To this end, DFID recently participated in a multi-donor mission to Kassala and Red Sea State, meeting representatives of civil society and state Government. Donors are now in the process of considering options for future support.</p>
	<p pid="a.815W.2/2">This year DFID will provide around &pound;3 million in direct development and humanitarian assistance to Eastern Sudan. The funds are being spent principally on child nutrition, food security and social protection. Indirectly DFID channels funding to the east though the World Bank-managed Multi-Donor Trust Fund (health and community development projects) and the UN (livelihoods and food security). A significant element of EC funding in the east (livelihoods, water, and food security) is also attributable to UK contributions.</p>

In December 2004, the banks and the Government agreed to work together towards a goal of halving the number of adults in households without a bank account and of making significant progress within two years. In its first annual report, published in March, the Taskforce concluded that steady progress had been made, but encouraged the banks to continue to address the difficulties faced in opening a bank account.</p>

	<p pid="a.820W.11/1">The target for England is, as far as reasonably practicable, to eradicate fuel poverty in vulnerable households (those containing the elderly, children, the disabled or someone with a long-term illness) by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.820W.11/2">In 2004, the latest year for which figures are available, the number of households in fuel poverty was 1.2 million, 1 million of which were vulnerable. This was the same as 2003, and compares with 5.1 million English households in fuel poverty in 1996. However, our analysis suggests that increases in energy bills since 2004 are likely to lead to a rise of around 1 million English vulnerable households between 2004 and 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.820W.11/3">The Government's main programme for tackling fuel poverty in the private sector in England is the Warm Front Scheme, which is the responsibility of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Warm Front provides heating and energy efficiency measures for those on a range of qualifying benefits. It has helped over 1 million vulnerable households since 2000. The Government issues winter fuel payments, which provide pensioner households with significant help with fuel costs in the coldest months. It has committed itself to maintaining the payments for the duration of this Parliament. The Government are also engaged in a series of initiatives with energy suppliers and others to mitigate the effects of price rises on the fuel poor. This includes a joint initiative with suppliers to target assistance to vulnerable pensioner households.</p>

	<p pid="a.823W.0/2">In December 2004, the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry wrote to the chief executives/chairs of all FTSE 100 companies drawing their attention to the guidelines and in October this year officials gave a presentation to the Anti-Corruption Committee of the UK Branch of International Chambers of Commerce. In addition, Departments take available opportunities to draw attention to the guidelines, for example in FCO presentations on corporate social responsibility to the UK business community at home and overseas. We have also revamped the National Contact Point (NCP) which promotes the guidelines to all stakeholders in the United Kingdom. The NCP will, in consultation with stakeholders, evaluate past promotional activities and draw up an awareness-raising strategy both here in the UK and overseas to coincide with both new literature and a new updated website and will maintain an ongoing dialogue with stake holders over its implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.823W.0/3">The Government want the revamped NCP to work with businesses, employees and other parties to deal with issues raised under the guidelines. We believe this approach will deliver a more open and transparent system in which all organisations can put their faith in encouraging responsible business practices.</p>

	<p pid="a.827W.0/1">An application for an order under the Transport and Works Act 1992 (TWA) to permit the construction and operation of the proposed Shell Flat offshore wind farm was submitted by Cirrus Energy Ltd. on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-31">31 January 2003</phrase>. The application proposed that the wind farm would have up to 90 turbines and cover an overall area of 44 square kilometres.</p>
	<p pid="a.827W.0/2">The application was subject to consultation in accordance with the requirements of the TWA. While the public notices that advertised the TWA application specified a period of approximately six weeks for any representations or objections to be made to the Secretary of State, the process allows the Secretary of State to consider relevant submissions received after the specified date. As a result of the consultation, 15 objections are in place from: the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (holding objection), Blackpool Airport, the Ministry of Defence, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, the Countryside Council for Wales, the Royal Yachting Association, the RSPB, Lancashire Wildlife Trust, Fylde Bird Club, English Nature/Natural England, the Wildlife Trusts, Wyre borough council and three individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.827W.0/3">All the consultation responses were sent to Cirrus Energy for consideration and the company then replied directly to respondents and, where appropriate, followed these up with discussions.</p>
	<p pid="a.827W.0/4">There are no specific time scales in the TWA process for negotiations with objectors to be undertaken. Where objections to a proposal are received, the Secretary of State is required to take a decision on how to deal with them within 28 days of the final date for submission set out in the public notice. However, the TWA process enables the Secretary of State to extend that decision-making timetable in response to a request from the developer, or at his own discretion, if he feels that objections may be removed as a result of further discussions between the developer and an objector. In the case of Shell Flat, the timetable has been extended on a number of occasions from the original date of <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-08">8 April 2003</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">16 December 2006</phrase>. The decision to extend the timetable has been drawn to the attention of objectors as the extensions have been granted.</p>
	<p pid="a.827W.0/5">There is no specific timetable for a decision to be taken about the application for the TWA order. However, Cirrus Energy has indicated that it proposes to submit consent applications for an alternative wind farm on a new site close to the existing Shell Flat location. Should any application come forward, then it will be subject to public consultation.</p>

The questions in the 2007 Census Test are not necessarily those which will be included in the Census in 2011. The Census Test is voluntary, and one of the objectives is to examine a number of issues regarding acceptability and burden on the public, the accuracy of the information collected and, most importantly, the effect that a question relating to personal income might have on response rates. The question asks respondents to indicate which band their income falls into, rather than giving details of the exact amount. The evaluation of the Test, along with testing on the accuracy of the data that could be obtained, will inform the recommendation on whether or not to include a question in the 2011 Census. The questionnaire can be found on the National Statistics website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.830W.9/8" class="indent">A White Paper setting out the Government's proposals for the 2011 Census is scheduled to be published in autumn 2008. It is not possible to confirm what questions are to be included in the 2011 Census until ONS complete a programme of consultation and testing and approval is given by Parliament in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.830W.9/9" class="indent">The minimum Output Area (OA) size adopted in the 2001 Census in England is 40 resident households and 100 resident persons, but the average size was rather larger at 123 resident households and 297 resident persons. In total there were 165,665 OAs in England. More information on OAs can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.831W.2/2">Since the introduction of the income tax and national insurance contributions exemptions on employer-supported childcare in April 2005, employers and employees have not been required to report tax-free employer-supported child care vouchers provided to employees. Therefore information on the marginal tax rate of participants, overall numbers participating, or cost to the Exchequer is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.831W.2/3">HMRC have recently commissioned the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen), an independent social research organisation, to monitor the initial impact of reforms to employer-supported child care. They conducted a survey of employer perception of employer-supported child care as a whole, and not just child care vouchers.</p>

No approval is required from central Government. Approval for a project is needed from both the relevant sponsoring Department and from the PFI Project Review Group if a local authority wishes to apply to central Government for additional support in the form of PFI credits. Current PFI credit programmes (other than housing) cover schools, waste management, transport (including street lighting, roads and light rail), social services, libraries and leisure services, joint service centres (one-stop shop access to cross-agency services), and police and fire and rescue services.</p>

	<p pid="a.853W.3/1">Value for money exercises are an integral part of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) contracting process for all management consultants and professional advisors. The FCOs use of external consultants helps to contribute to the success of projects by providing relevant new knowledge, specialist skills, experience and an independent view of key issues not available in-house. This wider experience and broader perspective, drawn from their work with other organisations, can add value to the FCO's business.</p>
	<p pid="a.853W.3/2">The FCO's policy on the procurement of services is based on value for money, having due regard to propriety and regularity and ensuring full compliance with the EU consolidated Public Procurement Directive, implemented in the UK by The Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (SI 2006 No 5). These promote equal treatment, transparency and competitive procurement. Value for money is therefore assessed in the tendering and award of contract process and through active contract management throughout the period of engagement. Project deliverables and the quality of advice received from the consultants are matched against expectations and consultants carry out assigned tasks to a properly managed plan of milestone objectives and timescales. Project managers must ensure that the deliverables produced by consultants are as specified and that the outputs are used effectively to improve performance or meet key objectives. At the end of the contract the assignment is reviewed to assess the value for money achieved.</p>

	<p pid="a.861W.8/1">The Zimbabwe presidential election of 2002 was widely and internationally condemned as deeply flawed. It was characterised by malpractice, with widespread violence and intimation by the ruling elite. My right hon. Friend the former Foreign Secretary (Mr. Straw) said,</p>
	<p pid="a.861W.8/2" class="indent">&quot;the failure of the electoral process in Zimbabwe (was) a tragedy not just for Zimbabwe, but for the people of southern Africa as a whole&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.861W.8/3">In July 2006, the EU election observer mission released its final report on the February 2006 elections in Uganda. The report concluded that the elections fell short of full compliance with international principles for genuine democratic elections. However, the report also said that despite some shortcomings on election day, voting was generally well administered, transparent and competitive.</p>
	<p pid="a.861W.8/4">Foreign and Commonwealth Office Ministers and officials continue to stress the importance of maintaining a pluralist democracy and developing civil society in their contacts with Ugandan Ministers and officials, including in a meeting with President Museveni on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-20">20 November</phrase>. And we with partners will continue to maintain pressure on Mugabe to adhere to international electoral standards and create a level playing field for all those involved in Zimbabwean society.</p>

	<p pid="a.874W.5/58">The financial year 2005-06 is the last full year for which figures are available. Precise figures are not readily available for previous years but the figures are estimated to be similar in the last five years. For Secure Training Centres (STC) and Secure Children's Homes (SCH), the costs have increased by approximately 3 per cent. (just above inflation) per year.</p>
	<p pid="a.874W.5/59">Custody data comes from the YJB Service Delivery team who manage the contracts and service level agreements with custody providers in the STC, SCH and YOI sectors. They use information on total contract price and number of beds provided to calculate per capita costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.874W.5/64">Education figures in STCs and SCHs are YJB estimates because it is not possible to disaggregate the cost of education from the total contract price. Education in YOIs over the last five years data also comes from YJB Service Delivery team. Education was an identified part of contracts first with the Prison Service, then in some regions with the Learning and Skills Council, and next year will be wholly paid to and delivered by LSC.</p>

Assessments have already been carried out that consider the impact of placing the Sure Start children's centre delivery model on a sustainable and long term footing. A partial RIA was conducted for the Green Paper that considered the level of regulation required to achieve a robust integrated framework of services and clear lines of accountability, inspection and intervention. A full RIA was then completed for the Childcare Act that included consideration of the statutory requirement to secure proactive, accessible and integrated services focused on the under fives&mdash;the duty underpinning the delivery of high quality services through children's centres. This assessment concluded that the statutory duties introduced by the Act are supported through the additional resources made available for child care, nursery education, and Sure Start.

	<p pid="a.878W.8/1">The Government offer a range of support to employers wishing to train their staff. The financial support from this Department is usually attached to the learner not the employer and is offered in the form of a subsidy rather than a grant. Our new Train to Gain programme offers a skills brokerage service to help employers source the training they need and any subsidies that might be available to them and free training for employees undertaking their first full NVQ level 2 qualification. While public funding to take driving tests is not generally available, there are a wide range of qualification-bearing courses for those wishing to engage in driving-related employment&mdash;for example the NVQ2 in Road Passenger Transport.</p>

This temperature is above comfort temperatures but healthy children should be able to cope with this if they are given generous supplies of cool water to drink. More sensitive children may experience problems at much lower temperatures and staff need to watch for signs of heat stress at temperatures above 28 degrees centigrade. Schools with inadequate supplies of drinking water need to make arrangements for children to drink enough water. It should be remembered that the amount of water that can be delivered through drinking water fountains is small.</p>

In each of the last two years we have published, some 10 months before the start of the funding year, a clear outline of our priorities giving providers the opportunity to prepare for forthcoming changes. This is significantly earlier than in previous years. The Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) Annual Statement of Priorities for 2007/08, published last month, builds on what we said last year in Priorities for Success, and outlines our funding priorities to meet the challenges of raising the skills and qualifications of young people and adults to world standards. The LSC will be consulting before the end of the year on proposals to develop funding and planning arrangements that better respond to the demand of learners and employers for high quality learning.</p>

The current food-based standards for lunch and, from September 2007, for food provided outside of lunch, will reduce the provision of many foods which typically contain higher levels of hydrogenated fats and oils. And nutrient-based standards, from September 2008 in primary schools and September 2009 in secondary schools, will specify an upper limit for the proportion of energy to be derived from fat and saturated fat in an average school lunch.</p>

The Higher Education Funding Council for England recently announced that an additional &pound;75 million would be made available over three years from 2007-08 to support very high cost and vulnerable science subjects, including physics and chemistry. Figures from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) show that entrants to physics and chemistry courses in 2005-06 were up by 10 per cent., and that overall entrants to engineering also rose. Provisional figures for 2006-07 show that despite the small decrease in total entrants, those studying chemistry have increased and those studying physics have held steady.</p>

	<p pid="a.892W.9/2">Section 30 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 allows a police officer of or above the rank of superintendent to give an authorisation, provided certain conditions are met, for dispersal powers to be used. This authorisation is sometimes known as a dispersal order. There is no appeal against an authorisation. If someone is prosecuted for failure to comply with a direction they will have the opportunity to challenge whether an authorisation was properly made in the course of their defence.</p>

	<p pid="a.898W.6/2">The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 provides the legislative framework for the introduction of a new vetting and barring scheme for those working with children and vulnerable adults.</p>
	<p pid="a.898W.6/3">This scheme will bar individuals from working in situations where evidence suggests that they present a risk of harm to children or vulnerable adults. It replaces the current barring schemes, List 99 and the Protection of Children Act list, and the Disqualification Order regime, with a single list of people barred from working with children. The new scheme will ensure that all those who wish to work closely with children will be centrally vetted first. The scheme is due to be implemented from autumn 2008 onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.898W.6/4">There is also a proposal to establish national protocols, following consultation, programmed for early 2007, for the way the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) works with church organisations. This revised policy will be reflected in the revised National MAPPA Guidance issued in April 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.904W.2/1">The Youth Justice Board (YJB) has, since 2000 collected the number of parenting orders reported to it by youth offending teams (YOTs) relating to youth offending, civil orders and non-attendance of children at school where the YOT has been involved and since April 2004, parenting orders applied for by the YOT. These figures cover the YOT area. Barnet YOT covers the London borough of Barnet which includes Hendon.</p>
	<p pid="a.904W.2/2">Parenting orders require the parent to attend a counselling or guidance programme specified by the responsible officer but the order need not include such a requirement where a parenting order has been made previously. Parenting orders recorded by Barnet YOT are shown in table A.</p>
	<p pid="a.904W.2/3">Since September 2004, the Department for Education and Skills has collected data on the number of parenting orders in England relating to non-attendance of children at school and exclusion from school at local authority level. The latest available data covers the period to April 2006. The London borough of Barnet has reported no parenting orders in this period.</p>
	<p pid="a.904W.2/4">Since April 2004 the YJB has collected data reported by Barnet YOT on the numbers of young people with a final warning or community disposal that have received a parenting intervention. More than one parent may receive a parenting intervention in respect of a young person but the total number of parents involved is not reported. The parenting intervention may involve a group programme or work with individual parents depending on the assessed need.</p>
	<p pid="a.904W.2/5">Voluntary parenting interventions recorded by Barnet YOT are as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="a.904W.2/8"> <td><i> Voluntary parenting interventions recorded by Barnet YOT</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.904W.2/9"> <td></td> <td><i> Number</i></td> </tr>

		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="a.904W.2/15">The London borough of Barnet has reported no parenting contracts to the DfES. However, parents who live within Barnet and whose children attend schools outside the borough could be subject to an education-related parenting order or contract which would appear on the data return for that local authority. Information on such cases is not collected centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.904W.2/16">Data is not held centrally on the number of parents in Barnet who have attended parenting classes voluntarily.</p>

	<p pid="a.907W.6/1">Information on the numbers of Category D prisoners over the age of 70 serving sentences in England and Wales as recorded on the prison IT system is not available separately by age because the numbers are small and the accuracy at this level of detail cannot be guaranteed. Providing an accurate and comprehensive response in the form requested could only be achieved at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.907W.6/2">All determinate sentence prisoners, regardless of their age and the security classification of the establishment in which they are detained, who are serving a sentence of four years or more and who are entitled to be released under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, are eligible to apply for consideration for early release on parole once they reach the halfway point of their sentence. In deciding whether or not to grant parole, the Parole Board is required to consider the Secretary of State's Directions that the board shall consider primarily the risk to the public of a further offence being committed at a time when the prisoner would otherwise be in prison and whether any such risk is acceptable. This must be balanced against the benefit, both to the public and the offender, of early release back into the community under a degree of supervision and which might help rehabilitation and so lessen the risk of re-offending in the future. The board however must take into account that safeguarding the public may often outweigh the benefits to the offender of early release.</p>

	<p pid="a.910W.3/5">The review of the NMS, which the Commission for Social Care Inspection must take into account when inspecting care homes, is ongoing and will be subject to public consultation in due course. The issue of the availability of drinking water to residents is being considered as part of the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.910W.3/6">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) published nutrient and food based advice for those providing food in care homes on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-19">19 October 2006</phrase>. This advice includes example menus, which include making water available at all eating occasions. Government advice is that we need to drink six to eight glasses of fluid every day. It is therefore implicit that care homes should be making water freely available throughout the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.910W.3/7">The nutrient and food-based guidance for those providing residential care for older people is the first part in a series of guidance documents for United Kingdom institutions. The FSA expects to produce guidance for other institutions, including the NHS and prisons, in early 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.916W.8/1">Internationally recognised criteria for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis are routinely used for diagnosis within the national health service through the Health Protection Agency's Lyme Borreliosis specialist diagnostic service. These are based upon stringent interpretation of serological tests for specific antibodies to the causative organism, <i> Borrelia burgdorferi</i>, and are recommended in the United States of America, Europe and the United Kingdom and are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.8/2">Serum samples for the detection of antibodies to <i> B. burgdorferi</i> should be analysed by a two-test procedure:</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.8/3" class="indent">a sensitive screening test, for example Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) or Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA). All samples judged to be reactive or equivocal in the screening test should then be confirmed by</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.8/4" class="indent">a Western blot for antibodies to specific <i> B. burgdorferi</i> antigens. The Western blot should only be used in succession with an ELISA or IFA test. Detailed interpretive criteria for Western blots differ between Europe and the USA, to take into account differences in the geographic distribution of the infecting genospecies.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.8/5">Treatment is with antibiotics, usually doxycycline or amoxicillin. Early treatment usually clears the rash within several days and helps to prevent the development of complications.</p>
	<p pid="a.916W.8/6">More serious symptoms also respond to antibiotic treatment, but the symptoms may be slower to resolve because damaged tissue takes time to heal. Nervous system symptoms such as meningitis or nerve inflammation usually require treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Detailed studies have shown excellent long-term outcomes for most people who receive appropriate treatment.</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.2/1">The Government are concerned about national health service patients affected by adverse events. It established the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) in July 2001 to develop and maintain a national reporting and learning system (NRLS) for patient safety incidents so that these incidents could be analysed and sources of risk identified and acted upon. This system is now in place across the NHS, all trusts have been connected and are reporting to the system from late 2005. Data collected by the agency are based on incidents reported by NHS staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.2/2">The NPSA is reviewing incidents resulting in death and is in discussion with key stakeholders to identify appropriate strategies to address the underlying risk in areas where there is the opportunity for a national patient safety solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.2/3">The agency has also issued 20 national patient safety solutions, of which seven have been patient safety alerts addressing high risk patient safety issues, these are:</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.2/4" class="indent">improving compliance with oral methotrexate;</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.2/5" class="indent">reducing the harm caused by misplaced naso and orgastric feeding tubes in babies under the care of neonatal units;</p>

	<p pid="a.918W.2/11">The agency is evaluating the impacts of these in terms of reducing harm to patients. Two examples where there is information about the potential benefits are:</p>
	<p pid="a.918W.2/12" class="indent">clean your hands campaign&mdash;99 per cent. of hospitals in England and 100 per cent. of hospitals in Wales have implemented this campaign.

	<p pid="a.919W.11/2">Children with a medical condition like epilepsy would not be considered to have special educational needs (SEN) unless they also had a significant learning difficulty or their medical condition prevented or hindered them from making use of the educational facilities generally available in their areas for children of their age. If either or both of these reasons applied to a child with epilepsy and it was necessary to assess the child with a view to giving him or her an SEN statement then the child would be assessed and statemented in the same way as other children with SEN. This is provided for by the Education Act 1996 and associated Regulations and set out in the SEN Code of Practice. The assessment arrangements require the local authority to seek written advice from the parents, the school, educational psychologists, health and social services and any others the local authority thinks it is desirable to take advice from. The local authority decides whether to draw up a statement and the contents of any statement in light of this advice.</p>
