	<p pid="b.594W.9/1">Aviation fuel supplied to aircraft must be fit for purpose. Ultimately, fuel companies are responsible for supplying fuel to their airline customers which is within specification and they have arrangements in place to deliver this. Procedures for handling aviation fuel at airports and other aviation fuel facilities have been developed by the Joint Inspection Group, a Joint Venture company formed in 2002 by fuel supply companies. Following the Birmingham airport incident last May, fuel suppliers carried out a detailed investigation and took appropriate corrective action. The Joint Inspection Group issued revised handling procedures and recommendations which were endorsed by the International Air Transport Association and circulated internationally.</p>
	<p pid="b.594W.9/2">Government Departments including the Department for Transport, Department of Energy and Climate Change, and the Ministry of Defence, are working closely with stakeholders in the fuel supply industry, aircraft engine and airframe manufacturers, airport operators, airlines, and safety regulators, to track developments towards a higher permissible biodiesel component level, monitor developments with testing methods, and monitor the application of the existing testing regime in the aviation fuel supply chain.</p>

	<p pid="b.607W.4/1">Each criminal offence is made up of a number of elements which constitute the essence of the offence. For example, a person is guilty of theft when he or she dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. Each of these elements, 'dishonestly', 'property', 'belonging to another' and 'with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it', as defined within the Theft Act 1968, and evidence to establish each element must be present and proved beyond reasonable doubt if the court is to record a conviction for an offence of theft is to be proved.</p>
	<p pid="b.607W.4/2">All cases conducted by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) are subject to a process of continuous review under the terms of the Code for Crown Prosecutors (the Code). The review process requires the prosecutor to be satisfied first that the evidential test is met&mdash;that is that there is sufficient reliable admissible evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of securing a conviction for the offence alleged; and, second, that the public interest requires a prosecution. If the prosecutor ascertains at any stage that a legal element of an offence is missing, then the case no longer meets the evidential test required under the Code, and the prosecution cannot continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.607W.4/3">It is the duty of Crown prosecutors to ensure that the right person is prosecuted for the right offence and, in doing so, they must always act in the interests of justice and not solely for the purpose of obtaining a conviction. Five years ago, the Government introduced the Statutory Charging arrangements which ensured that a CPS prosecutor must authorise the charge for a range of more serious offences that were previously charged by the police. This has led to significant reductions in the number of cases discontinued after charge, because prosecutors will not have authorised charges in cases which do not meet the requirements of the Code, including those cases where an essential legal element is missing.</p>
	<p pid="b.607W.4/4">While the CPS seeks to minimise discontinuance, and has made major strides in recent years in reducing the number and the proportion of cases which result in an unsuccessful outcome, there will always be cases in which circumstances may change and either the evidence available or expected, or the public interest no longer supports a prosecution. In these circumstances, the decision not to proceed best serves the cause of justice.</p>

	<p pid="b.608W.3/1">After undertaking a preliminary review of the material referred to her, the Attorney-General took the view that she should seek the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions. All the material provided to her has been made available to him. At this stage, no decision has been reached and it would be premature to speculate as to the outcome of the Attorney-General's consideration, nor is it possible to give a precise time scale. There is a substantial quantity of material to consider. Some of it is very highly classified and must be handled under the most secure of conditions. It is being thoroughly considered by the Director who is progressing this important work with his expert prosecutors within the CPS. The Attorney-General has said that she intends to report to Parliament on her assessment. What can be said at any given stage may depend upon a number of factors, such as the need to avoid prejudicing any police investigation and potential prosecution and the need to protect national security. She will continue to do everything she properly can to bring this matter to an expeditious conclusion.</p>

There was therefore no requirement to inform the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) prior to berthing HMS Vanguard, as this was done in accordance with the safety case for the facility at the Royal Naval Armament Depot Coulport. Subsequently, as a matter of courtesy, the HSE was informed.</p>

We continue to encourage UK companies trading in natural resources from DRC to do so in a way that is socially, economically and environmentally responsible, and to adhere to the voluntary guidelines set out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

	<p pid="b.629W.2/2">According to a survey conducted last year by the Kenyan Government in co-operation with UN High Commission for Refugees, a total of 663,921 persons were displaced by the violence, of which around 300,000 were in camps. Official figures from the Kenyan Government on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-02">2 February 2009</phrase> state that 347,148 internally displaced persons (IDPs) have been resettled since the violence, most of them returning to their homes, whilst 22,200 are living in 53 transit camps. According to official figures, only 2,582 still live in the two remaining official IDP camps.

UN Security Council Resolution 1851 called for the establishment of an International Contact Group for Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS). In turn the CGPCS called for the creation of four working groups on key focus areas. In February 2009 the UK chaired (in partnership with, and located at, the International Maritime Organisation) one of these, an international working group looking to enhance international co-operation and co-ordination of counter-piracy activities.

	<p pid="b.632W.5/1">We are aware, through UN reporting, that numbers of Justice and Equality Movement forces have increased throughout Darfur in recent weeks. Darfur remains sovereign Sudanese territory and a Government of Sudan garrison is present throughout. We do not monitor either the level of Sudanese military deployment, or rebel force movement other than in the context of assessing the security threat to the UN-African Union Mission in Darfur and the general status of the various peace processes ongoing in the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.632W.5/2">Any increase in both Government of Sudan and rebel troop levels would be of concern as it could lead to increased levels of tension, which would hamper ongoing efforts to secure peace and stability in Sudan, particularly with regard to the comprehensive peace agreement.</p>

	<p pid="b.635W.13/1">The Department does not produce annual estimates of drug-related acquisitive crime. Both drug use and offending are often covert activities and the relationship between them can be complex, consequently such estimates are subject to large uncertainties.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.13/2">The Department has published research that shows that drug users account for a large proportion of acquisitive crime, with recent survey data focusing on the extent of acquisitive crime that is class A drug-related. For example:</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.13/3">81 per cent. of arrestees who used heroin and/or crack cocaine (HC) on at least a weekly basis reported committing acquisitive crimes in the 12 months prior to arrest, in comparison to 30 per cent. of those arrestees who did not take HC weekly<sup>(1)</sup>. Additionally, around two-fifths (39 per cent.) of drug treatment seekers reported committing an acquisitive crime in the four weeks prior to interview. This figure rose in the case of heroin and crack cocaine users, with 55 per cent. reporting that they committed an acquisitive crime in the four weeks before interview<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>

	<p pid="b.637W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.6/2">The Risk and Regulation Advisory Council (RRAC) is supported by a team within BERR and I have been advised as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.6/3">The RRAC was asked by Sir Ronnie Flanagan in Recommendation 20 of his Review of Policing to</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.6/4" class="indent">&quot;begin the national debate on risk aversion and culture change at a central government level&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.6/5">As an independent body without vested interests, the RRAC benefited from the ability to convene a group of considerable diversity, without attracting the prejudices of government-badged intervention. The RRAC brought together 47 stakeholders to debate this issue, including: Tony McNulty, Minister for Policing; Ken Jones, President of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO); Bob Jones, Chair of the Association of Police Authorities (APA); and Jim Barker-McCardle, Director of the National Police Improvement Agency (NPIA). A full list of organisations is given as follows. The council's work brings together and adds to various currents of reform being considered across the police service, allowing synergies to emerge from previously unconnected viewpoints.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.6/6">Since responding to Sir Ronnie Flanagan in March 2008 the RRAC:</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.6/7" class="indent">has engaged widely with representatives from inside and outside the police service to understand the complexity of this issue. This culminated in the council's first major risk forum at the end of July;</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.6/8" class="indent">has identified (through the risk forum and subsequent debate within the community of practice) a vision of &quot;risk-based decision-making&quot; in policing: a more flexible policing environment where frontline officers are better equipped to evaluate risks and exercise their professional judgment to respond appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.6/9" class="indent">Four inter-related unifying objectives have been identified for priority action:</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.6/10" class="indent">Creating a more constructive leadership environment</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.6/11" class="indent">Enhancing and embedding the concept of the &quot;learning organisation&quot; in the police</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.6/12" class="indent">Delivering bureaucracy that is flexible, adaptable and appropriate</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.6/13" class="indent">Improving public confidence in policing.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.6/14" class="indent">has used these objectives, and associated options for delivery, to inform the work of the NPIA and ACPO in response to Recommendation 20. The RRAC continues to engage at official level with the Home Office, the NPIA, and ACPO; and at a more senior level with Vernon Coaker MP, Minister for Policing, Dennis O'Connor, HM Acting Chief Inspector of Constabulary, and Jan Berry, Chair of the Practitioners Group on Reducing Bureaucracy in the Police.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.6/15" class="indent">and has created an on-going community of practice to support the leadership of the police service in implementing reforms that will have a positive impact on frontline policing.</p>

	<p pid="b.653W.8/1">We are taking a wide range of steps to encourage more people to take up apprenticeships and for more employers to offer high quality places. In 2007-08 we saw a record high 225,000 people starting an apprenticeship, up from 65,000 in 1996-97. Completion rates are also at a record high with 64 per cent. successfully completing an apprenticeship&mdash;up from 37 per cent. in 2004-05. Last year 420 young people and adults started an apprenticeship in Walsall South, the highest number for five years. We also believe apprenticeships can play a key role in our response to the current economic downturn. The Prime Minister recently announced a &pound;140 million package to provide an extra 35,000 apprenticeship places, of which at least 21,000 will be in the public sector. To continue to raise awareness and encourage more employers to take on or offer more apprenticeships, a national advertising campaign started last month fronted by Sir Alan Sugar.</p>

	<p pid="b.655W.3/1">The impact that skills can have on local economic regeneration is significant.

Bournville college's capital proposals which include the development of a new college at the Longbridge site has been given approval in principal and as part of the approval process, the Learning and Skills Council will have assessed, among other things, the educational case of the scheme, including its skills contribution to the local area.</p>
	<p pid="b.655W.3/3">The Learning and Skills Council has now completed its assessment of colleges seeking approval in principle and in detail which has confirmed there are many more schemes currently in preparation than can be funded in this spending round.</p>

	<p pid="b.658W.2/2">Effective collection of student loans across the EU is underpinned by EC regulation 44/2001, which allows the Student Loans Company (SLC) to obtain judgments in UK courts which can be enforced by courts in other EU countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.658W.2/3">Up to <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-03">3 March 2009</phrase>, the SLC had contacted 54 EU borrowers in order to start this legal process. They were students who had studied in England; are now resident overseas; but have not complied with the overseas repayment rules. Since attempting to enforce payment in this way, the SLC has had correspondence from 45 of the 54. SLC continues to pursue the remaining nine to enforce repayment.</p>
	<p pid="b.658W.2/4">The SLC has not yet used external trace agents nor international debt collection companies but plans to do so later this year.</p>

Although course provision and delivery is a matter for the education institutions themselves, Government expect institutions to take account of the needs of disabled learners as part of an inclusive approach on these matters.

	<p pid="b.660W.2/1">Probation Boards and Trusts meet the cost of delivering Community Sentences through their grant as they see fit to meet their statutory duties. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 established the new Community Order as a single community sentence with a number of elements in respect of offences committed after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase>. This replaced the separate community sentences which existed previously. From 2005 to present, cost exercises have been carried out by .Probation Boards/Trusts annually and have produced the planned cost of a range of activities. Probation Boards and Trusts spent &pound;614 million in 2007-08 supervising around 244,000 offenders. It is not currently possible to separate the cost of supervising offenders on community sentence as probation caseloads also include significant numbers of offenders who have been released from a custodial sentence or released temporarily into the community. Work is in hand in the National Offender Management Service to ensure that all offender services delivered in custody and in the community are properly specified and costed so that commissioners can ensure that resources are targeted effectively to protect the public and reduce re-offending.</p>

Central records are held by the number of sanctions issued rather than by the number of staff (ie a member of staff may have received a sanction at more than one level).

	<p pid="b.663W.5/1">There are no plans. However, the Electoral Administration Act 2006 introduced a new, explicit requirement for Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) to take all steps that are necessary for the purpose of complying with their duty to maintain the electoral registers. These steps, as set out in the legislation, include sending the canvass form more than once, making house to house inquiries in connection with the canvass, making contact by such other means as the ERO thinks appropriate with a person who does not have an entry in the register, and inspecting any record that the ERO is permitted by law to inspect. These records are those held by the local authority and include council tax, land and property, housing benefit and educational where available. It is for each ERO to decide on the best steps to use in conjunction with their local knowledge to ensure that requirements for making contact with persons and maintaining the register are complied with.</p>
	<p pid="b.663W.5/2">The Government remain concerned about the need to address levels of under-registration in Great Britain. To this end, we have recently tabled amendments to the Political Parties and Elections Bill, that will allow the Secretary of State to pilot data matching schemes, under which public authorities will provide registration officers with information to assist them in maintaining an accurate and comprehensive register. In addition, we plan to introduce secondary legislation to enable EROs in areas where there are two-tiers of local government to be able to access data held by the higher tier to help them identify individuals who are not registered to vote. This will mirror arrangements in place for EROs in single tier areas.</p>

Northern Ireland already has a system of individual registration in place and we will want to learn from their experiences to ensure that registration rates are maximised.

	<p pid="b.668W.0/1">Table 1 shows the number of solicitor offices starting legal aid work as part of the Criminal Defence Service (CDS) for criminal matters and the Community Legal Service (CLS) for civil matters in each of the last five financial years.</p>
	<p pid="b.668W.0/2">Table 2 shows the number of solicitor offices leaving the Criminal Defences Service in each of the past five financial years. For the Community Legal Service the table shows the combined total of solicitors offices leaving plus accounts expiring or terminated.</p>
	<p pid="b.668W.0/3">The figures are given in terms of numbers of offices rather than firms. This is because prior to the introduction of the civil unified contract in April 2007 and criminal unified contract in July 2008, legal aid providers delivering services in more than one office would hold separate contracts for each of those offices. In addition, where providers have decided not to continue providing civil legal aid services, they may nevertheless still have an account or accounts with the Legal Services Commission while they continue to deal with their remaining clients.</p>
	<p pid="b.668W.0/4">Over the period there has been a downward trend in the overall number of solicitor offices dealing with legal aid. This is because there has been a continuing process of offices that do only small amounts of legal aid work leaving the market or merging with other offices, so that the work is done in larger volumes at fewer offices. In addition, the Legal Services Commission has over time sought to terminate dormant accounts where no work was being done.</p>
	<p pid="b.668W.0/5">The key issue in delivering access to clients is ensuring there are sufficient providers in the right places to deliver a good level of service. At <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> there were a total of 3,627 civil provider offices and 2,230 crime provider offices. More importantly, the number of acts of assistance delivered to legal aid clients has increased over the last few years. Clients can also access civil legal advice from not-for-profit organisations, plus the Community Legal Advice telephone line and website.</p>

	<p pid="b.669W.8/18">Data was not recorded prior to 1999-2000.</p>
	<p pid="b.669W.8/19">The fall in arrests from 1999-2000 to 2002-03 is most likely linked to the introduction of measures to deal with visitors and prisoners who smuggle drugs through visits through Prison Service Order 3610 (March 1999). The order introduced a consistent and robust approach to visitors smuggling drugs across the prison estate. From 2002-03 the number of arrests has stabilised. The average number of arrests from 2002-03 to 2006-07 is 419, which is similar to the number recorded for 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.669W.8/20">The fall in visitor arrests broadly corresponds to the fall in drug misuse in prisons, as measured by random mandatory drug testing, which has declined by 63 per cent. since 1996-97. This demonstrates the success of the prisons drug strategy which has occurred in the context of an increased prison population and a corresponding increase in the number of visitors.</p>
	<p pid="b.669W.8/21">These figures have been drawn from administrative data systems. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system. The data are not subject to audit.</p>

	<p pid="b.678W.8/13">DEFRA is not able to provide figures for the different waste streams produced. It is not practical or cost effective to separate waste which is destined for landfill or incineration. Also, many of DEFRA's operations, such as laboratory processes, involve the use of hazardous materials which cannot be separated into different waste streams. For this reason, visibility of DEFRA's waste streams is limited to the quantities of the waste recycled.</p>
	<p pid="b.678W.8/14">It should be noted that a large proportion of DEFRA's waste is incinerated with energy recovery&mdash;1,465 tonnes in 2007-08 (30 per cent.), 1,499 tonnes in 2006-07 (28 per cent.) and 1,041 (18 per cent.) in 2005-06. Although waste used for energy recovery cannot be classed as &quot;recycled&quot; the energy produced from its incineration is used in buildings on the DEFRA Estate.</p>

Since September 2007 schools have been allowed to apply for a parenting order for behaviour and our data show that no school has applied for nor been granted a parenting order. In relation to school attendance orders only local authorities can be granted an order by the courts following a successful prosecution of the parent for their child's non attendance. To date our data show that no court has granted Hertfordshire local authority (which covers Hemel Hempstead area) an attendance order.</p>

It is therefore not possible to say precisely how many staff were working on tobacco smuggling in the years specified. However, the following figures are HMRC's best estimate of the full-time equivalents of staff employed on tackling tobacco smuggling in the years between 2005-06 and 2007-08.

	<p pid="b.724W.3/4">Household spending patterns vary widely within deciles and household types, so estimates of savings on such a basis should be treated with caution. This is exacerbated by there being greater sampling variability associated with estimates for deciles and groups of given household types due to the relatively small sample sizes.</p>
	<p pid="b.724W.3/5">Subject to these caveats, the following tables provide estimates of the benefit of the VAT reduction, for all households and for non-retired households without children, by income decile based on figures for average expenditures on VAT published by the ONS in their article 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household incomes, 2006-07'. Figures for average expenditures on VAT by age of the head of the household are not available, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.724W.3/6">The estimates assume the majority of the VAT reduction will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices in line with past experience, and that spending patterns remain unchanged.</p>

	<p pid="b.730W.2/1">The Government decided not to proceed with neighbourhood improvement districts (NIDs) because there was no hard evidence of demand for them, but clear public concern about council tax levels, and NIDs would have increased burdens on council tax payers. In addition, local authorities, including parish councils, already have powers to provide many of the services that a NID could provide, such as local wardens or neighbourhood managers. The Government have simplified the process for setting up parishes, and have also passed legislation enabling parish councils to be set up in areas that previously could not have them (e.g. London).</p>

	<p pid="b.730W.17/1">The last year for which analysis is available is 2008-09. I have placed a table of estimates of the amount raised by reducing the council tax discount on empty properties in each billing authority in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.730W.17/2">Council tax revenues are retained by councils. Any reduction in the discount for empty properties is reflected in the council's tax base, which is taken into account in calculating an authority's formula grant.</p>

	<p pid="b.737W.5/3" class="indent">Your Parliamentary Question on what reasons Arun was chosen by the Audit Commission to ask councillors for their bank account details has been passed to me for reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.737W.5/4" class="indent">The Audit Commission confirms that there was no particular or additional request for data relating to Arun Council or its councillors in relation to the National Fraud Initiative and that they have been treated in exactly the same way as all other participants in the National Fraud Initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.737W.5/5" class="indent">One of the key sets of data matched under the National Fraud Initiative is payroll data. For example, by matching payroll data to Housing Benefit claimants' data we can identify potential fraudulent claims or overpayments. All mandatory participants in the National Fraud Initiative (for example, local councils, police authorities, probation boards, fire and rescue authorities, NHS bodies, etc) are required to provide bank account and sort codes in the payroll file submitted to the Audit Commission. The specific (and relatively limited) fields required for the National Fraud Initiative are set out in the published 'data specification'. This requires the payroll data submitted to include all individuals being paid a salary, wage, members' allowance or other remuneration at a particular point in time. It therefore covers all employees, board members and councillors.</p>

The decision in 1997 to abolish payable dividend tax credits was taken to remove a distortion in the tax system, which had encouraged companies to pay out their profits in dividends, rather than retain them for reinvestment in the business.
