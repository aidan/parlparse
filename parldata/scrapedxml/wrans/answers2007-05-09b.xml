	<p pid="b.193W.9/1">From April 2006, older and disabled people have been guaranteed free off-peak local bus travel within their local authority area. Statutory concessionary fares are one of the services supported through Formula Grant, which comprises Revenue Support Grant, Redistributed Business Rates and Principal Formula Police Grant.</p>
	<p pid="b.193W.9/2">Formula Grant is an unhypothecated block grant i.e. authorities are free to spend the money on any service. Because of this and the method of calculation, particularly floor damping (which guarantees local authorities at least a minimum percentage increase by scaling back increases for other authorities), it is not possible to say how much of the total Formula Grant funding is for any particular service. The Government provided an extra &pound;350 million in 2006-07 and a further &pound;367.5 million in 2007-08, via the Formula Grant system, to fund the extra costs to local authorities. The Government are confident that this should be sufficient to cover the total additional cost to local authorities of the statutory concession.</p>
	<p pid="b.193W.9/3">Local authorities have the discretion to offer (and fund from their own resources) enhancements to the statutory minimum, such as peak bus travel and/or concessions on other modes.</p>

	<p pid="b.194W.2/1">The Department for Transport (Central) and its agencies are very conscious of the need to reduce power, thereby contributing to a common target to reduce carbon emissions by 12.5 per cent. by 2010-11. All therefore have policies of shutting down computers at night, and staff are regularly instructed to do so by means such as induction training, circulars, general guidance, notices and night security checks. In addition, departmental procurement policy states that preference should be given to energy efficient IT equipment.</p>

	<p pid="b.196W.7/1">Ensuring that all children are able to read is essential to tackling inequality and under-attainment. Since 1997, 95,000 more 11-years-olds are able to read as a result of the daily literacy hour. We are also putting in place the recommendations of the review by Jim Rose for systematic phonics teaching for all children.</p>
	<p pid="b.196W.7/2">In addition, the Government are also supporting measures to improve children's behaviour and attitudes from an early age. The evaluation of the primary Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) programme found that it had a positive impact on children's results, behaviour and attitudes to school. Approximately 60 per cent. of primary schools are already implementing SEAL and a programme for secondary schools will start from September 2007.</p>

Since then the proposal has been through a number of re-drafts and we think this risk has been very much reduced. It is not practicable to make any further assessment of the impact of the proposal post-implementation at a time when the text is subject to frequent change.

Poverty, under-development, weak and ineffective government all help to provide fertile conditions for conflict, criminality and, in some circumstances, terrorism, which is why DFID country programmes all promote the security of the poor and in doing so, help to address the root causes of insecurity locally, nationally and internationally.</p>

	<p pid="b.202W.10/1">Nigeria ranks below the average for sub-Saharan Africa in the UN's Human Development Index. In Northern Nigeria, high maternal mortality, low levels of immunisation, and gender inequality mean human development indicators are among the world's worst, outside conflict zones. While Nigeria has not seen a widespread humanitarian crisis in recent years, there are regional instances of severe human suffering. A nutritional crisis in mid-2005 in several Northern states led Medicins Sans Frontieres to treat over 15,000 severely malnourished children. Meanwhile, oil spills in the Niger Delta have affected the environment and local livelihoods in that region.</p>

It is important to note, however, that in all instances the military work closely with other Government Departments and non-governmental organisations to agree key priorities with the Afghan authorities. In many instances, project delivery will require the involvement of a number of agencies. This is in line with our comprehensive approach.</p>

	<p pid="b.219W.8/2">The activation of the cannon on Typhoon, and its fitting to future combat aircraft, would provide an additional means of delivering air-to-surface low collateral damage effect in support of ground forces. This would need to be weighed against the through life costs of such a capability, including the implications for airframe life.</p>

	<p pid="b.220W.5/1">Any mobilised serviceman or woman injured when on operational deployment is treated the same, and will receive exactly the same medical treatment and support, whether they are regular or reserve. If a medical officer in-theatre assesses that a member of the reserve forces requires treatment or rehabilitation back in the UK, they will be treated in exactly the same way as regular personnel. This may include treatment and rehabilitation at a military Regional Rehabilitation Unit or the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court, Surrey, or&mdash;if the problem is related to their mental health&mdash;admission to the Priory Group or treatment at a military Department of Community Mental Health.</p>
	<p pid="b.220W.5/2">When reserve personnel are demobilised, they are given a medical assessment. During this process, if it is identified that they are in need of an operation they may be referred to NHS hospitals housing Ministry of Defence Hospital Units or the Royal College of Defence Medicine at Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham, where they will be treated within military time frames which can in some cases offer faster access to treatment. Reserve personnel will receive treatment for injuries sustained on operation until they are deemed to have reached a steady state of fitness. They are then demobilised, and taken through a transition from military to NHS care, if they have continuing health care needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.220W.5/3">The patient may express a preference for treatment in a hospital nearer to their home, which may be a non-MDHU hospital, and some reservists opt for this route. In accordance with NHS protocols, if they are referred on to a non-MDHU hospital, then access to treatment is according to clinical priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.220W.5/4">Once demobilised it is a long established tradition that reserve forces' medical welfare becomes the responsibility of their local NHS primary care trust and the majority of Veterans' physical and mental health needs are met by these provisions. However, the MOD recognises that it has an expertise to offer in certain specific circumstances, and in November 2006 launched a new initiative&mdash;the Reserves Mental Health Programme. This is open to personnel who have been demobilised since January 2003 following overseas operational deployment as a reservist and who have concerns that their mental health has suffered primarily as a result of their operational service leading up to their demobilisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.220W.5/5">They will be invited to attend the Reserves Training and Mobilisation Centre at Chilwell, Nottinghamshire, where members of the Defence Medical Services will carry out an assessment of their mental health. If it is considered that they are eligible for out-patient treatment by the Defence Medical Services, this will be provided at one of the military Departments of Community Mental Health, at the most convenient site to meet the individual's circumstances whenever possible. More details of the programme are available at:</p>

	<p pid="b.222W.3/3">At the tactical level, as part of the UK's comprehensive approach to our operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans, personnel in theatre engage regularly with their deployed counterparts in the FCO and DfID. PJHQ staff monitor and advise as necessary on these interactions.</p>
	<p pid="b.222W.3/4">The MOD has also developed a formal agreement with DfID on the provision of military assistance to humanitarian relief operations and is in the process of agreeing service levels with the FCO on the provision of military assistance to evacuation operations.</p>

	<p pid="b.223W.3/2">Total factor productivity for UK farming, which shows the volume of output leaving the industry per unit of all inputs including fixed capital and labour, rose by 2.1 per cent. in 2006. More information about the productivity levels of UK farming can be found in the DEFRA publication 'Agriculture in the United Kingdom'.</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/3">DEFRA continues to conduct research, at both the farm level and through aggregate comparisons with other countries, into what influences the productivity of UK farming.</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/4">Improving productivity is a key element for our vision for farming, which identifies an industry that is profitable in the market place, makes a positive net environmental contribution and manages the landscape and the natural assets that underlie it.</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/5">We are undertaking a range of actions to improve the competitive position of farming in England. These include:</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/6" class="indent">i. The use of Axis 1 funding of the new Rural Development Programme for England, which will be used to promote greater awareness of market opportunities, including for diversified enterprises, the benefits of collaboration and co-operation, and the acquisition of skills needed to exploit new opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/7" class="indent">ii. Restructuring the five statutory horticulture and agriculture levy boards into one overarching levy board with subsidiary, sectoral companies, thus allowing for efficiencies and commonalities to be identified, in order to help the sectors involved. For example, the new structure will facilitate exchange of information across the sectors on issues of common interest such as water and waste.</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/8" class="indent">iii. In addition to that available under the agriculture development scheme, the Government have provided a significant amount of dedicated funding to the Food Chain Centre and the Red Meat and Cereals Industry Forums, and English Farming and Food Partnerships, as a transitional measure to help the industry adapt to a more market-orientated future.</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/9" class="indent">iv. Implementation of the non-food crops strategy, which aims to drive forward the bio-based economy through research, dissemination of technology and knowledge, and building supply chains from agriculture to industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/10" class="indent">v. Supporting the quality regional food sector through a five year &pound;5 million programme (which began in 2003-04) with the specific objective of creating a flourishing high quality regional food sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/11" class="indent">vi. Working with stakeholders to progress the action plan to develop organic food and farming in England which aims to create a sustainable and competitive organic farming and food sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/12" class="indent">vii. Support for farmers to take advantage of financial risk management products to enable them to be more resilient to increased price volatility, and to increase uptake of the business benchmarking software that is available under through the whole farm approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/13" class="indent">viii. Helping farmers and growers under the public sector food procurement initiative (PSFPI) to develop the capabilities and capacity necessary to meet the public sector's requirements for food.</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/14" class="indent">ix. Establishment of the biomass action plan with the objective of addressing barriers to the production of biomass energy, and stimulating the development of the sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/15" class="indent">x. Improving the regulation of farming, by making it more effective, and efficient for farmers, thus helping them to reduce costs and increase competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/16" class="indent">xi. The whole farm approach (WFA) helps farmers to identify where there is a regulatory requirement and the actions necessary to fulfil that requirement, supported by targeted help and guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/17" class="indent">xii. Developing a business competence framework for the environmental and land-based sectors to provide a clear understanding of what skills an individual will require to work in particular industries and in particular jobs within those industries.</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.3/18" class="indent">xiii. Supporting the initiative which aims to encourage new people into the farming industry with the appropriate skills to succeed in a market-driven environment.</p>

	<p pid="b.228W.3/2"><i> (a)</i> It is not possible to provide figures for discards solely in UK waters. The discard estimates used by ICES in stock assessments are carried out in relation to particular sea areas (e.g. the North Sea) rather than national waters.</p>
	<p pid="b.228W.3/3">Since 2002 all EU countries have been required to collect data on discarding under Council Regulation 1543/2000, but the information is not yet compiled systematically. Quantities of discards are estimated quarterly using data collected by scientific observers aboard commercial fishing vessels. They are required to record the quantity landed and discarded, and the species and size composition of the discards each time the fishing gear is hauled. Deploying scientific observers in this manner is expensive and time consuming, with the result that it is usually only possible to sample a small proportion of the overall fishing trips in a given area. As a result it is necessary to extrapolate from the limited sampling to provide estimates for the entire fleet. Although the sampling is intended to cover a representative sample of the fleet, this does mean that the estimates of total discards are subject to uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="b.228W.3/4">Quarterly figures for discards of some important commercial species in 2006 are given in the following table. The table also includes estimates of landings and discard rates by the same fleet segments in order to provide an indication of the relative importance of discarding in each case.

	<p pid="b.228W.3/62">There are a number of reasons for these discards. The mixed nature of most fisheries in EU waters means that fish of these and other species often swim together with others which fishermen have no interest in (for example because there is no market for the fish or they have no relevant quota allocation), all of which may be caught at the same time. Discards also arise from the catching of juvenile or undersized fish. In order to avoid this happening and those fish that are not required having to be discarded, UK Fisheries Departments are funding a range of work, in collaboration with the industry, looking at making the respective fishing activity more selective in terms of either species or size. The industry will be encouraged to use any such gear modifications which prove successful. The EU Commission has also made clear in its recent publication on discards that it attaches high priority to tackling this issue throughout EU waters.</p>
	<p pid="b.228W.3/63"><i> (b)</i> Discard estimates from other EU countries are not yet available for 2006, but these should appear later in the year. The UK is continuing to press the Commission to ensure all member states provide full sets of the relevant data. In the longer term, there are plans to develop a &quot;Discards Atlas&quot;&mdash;a compendium of available information from member states on discards&mdash;as a resource for fisheries science.</p>

	<p pid="b.232W.2/4">In a modern economy, the production, availability and distribution of all our food is dependent upon a secure energy and fuel supply, as well as upon other transport infrastructure. It is clear that our food chain&mdash;whatever the degree of agricultural self-sufficiency&mdash;relies on various forms of energy and that energy security is a primary concern. The Government's 'Energy Review', published in July 2006, specifically considered how our energy security can be maintained and enhanced in an uncertain world.</p>

	<p pid="b.232W.5/1">The potential implications would depend on the type of GM crop being grown and the specific policy that beekeepers were following. No commercial GM cropping is expected here for several years at least and it is difficult to make firm assumptions about the circumstances that might arise in the future. What can be said is that GM crops will only be grown here commercially if they are approved as safe at EU level, and if there is a market for them because they offer some recognised benefit. We know that beekeepers have concerns about GM presence in honey, and we will continue to discuss the coexistence of GM and honey production with them. From a regulatory standpoint it should not generally be necessary to avoid placing hives near to GM crops, as research has shown that any GM presence in honey should always be well below the 0.9 per cent. EU labelling threshold.</p>

	<p pid="b.236W.2/5" class="indent">31 per cent. of farm households were below the modified low income threshold (gross before housing costs) in 2005-06 compared with 21 per cent. for all households and 18 per cent. for self-employed households.</p>

	<p pid="b.246W.3/1">The main source of estimates of self-reported drug use is the British Crime Survey (BCS) but this provides information at the national and regional level only. However, the Home Office has commissioned a research study to provide estimates of the number of problematic opiate and crack cocaine users at local and national level. The results of the first year of this three-year study estimated that there were about 593 problem drug users (probable range 447 to 907) in Bexley Drug Action Team area in 2004-05. There are no comparable estimates available for previous years but this research project will produce estimates for 2005-06 and 2006-07 in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.249W.5/2">Anecdotal evidence from a number of police forces, including the Metropolitan Police, is that this type of theft is a growing problem in some force areas. To help combat it, the Home Office met a number of the main manufacturers in 2005 and, as a result, some of the manufacturers fast-tracked the introduction of security features into new models. The Home Office also produced a crime prevention advice leaflet aimed at motorists showing them the simple steps they could take to help prevent them becoming victims of this type of crime. This leaflet is available on the Home Office website and is intended for use by police and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships.</p>

Copies of the annual reports are held in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.254W.8/2">The vast majority of winter fuel payments are made automatically without the need to claim as we hold sufficient information on our benefit systems. It is not possible to say how many people may be eligible for a winter fuel payment and are not receiving it. This is because not everyone aged 60 or over will be eligible for a payment. In order to assess whether a person is eligible we need to establish their circumstances and this can only be done once they have contacted the Department. A person may be ineligible for various reasons such as serving a custodial sentence, in hospital receiving free in-patient treatment for more than 52 weeks, or subject to immigration control.</p>

	<p pid="b.266W.8/1">The Department does not produce leaflets for members of the public on this issue, nor does it collect data on leaflets that may be produced by other sources.</p>
	<p pid="b.266W.8/2">A leaflet on genetic risk and consanguineous marriage has recently been produced as part 2 of a collaborative project by the London IDEAS genetic knowledge park and the Genetic Interest Group (GIG, a national alliance of patient organisations) that aims to address the lack of availability of multilingual information on genetic disorders and risk. However, this leaflet is for use by specialised genetics services as an adjunct to genetic counselling. It is currently available in English, Urdu, Gujarati, Punjabi and Turkish. It is one of a series dealing with genetic disorders and risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.266W.8/3">The Department does not provide guidance for general practitioners or other health professionals on the issue of the risks associated with consanguineous sexual relationships. In general, guidance on issues of practice is a matter for the appropriate professional or regulatory bodies. In addition, local national health service organisations may decide to issue guidance to help practitioners deal with issues which are of particular relevance to their local population.</p>
	<p pid="b.266W.8/4">The Human Genetics Commission supports the need for proper provision of education and information about marriage within a kinship group. This should entail access to counselling and support, preferably in the individual's or couple's preferred language, and a no-blame approach that enables at-risk couples to come forward for testing. Those wanting specific advice on their individual risk should consult a clinical geneticist or genetic counsellor in their local NHS regional genetics centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.266W.8/5">From later this year the curriculum for trainee general practitioners will include learning objectives to equip them to refer patients at risk of genetic conditions appropriately and to appreciate the importance of considering a patient's cultural and religious background and beliefs concerning inheritance in providing care. These have been developed by the Royal College of General Practitioners in partnership with the NHS National Genetics Education and Development Centre, which is funded by the Department.</p>

However, research in these areas has started us on the road to a better understanding of conditions such as motor neurone disease, diabetes and cystic fibrosis that will help us to develop effective treatments, with time. Scientific opinion remains that research in these areas will revolutionise the treatment for such conditions in the 21st century.</p>

	<p pid="b.271W.5/1">We are aware that several insulin presentations will be discontinued from the United Kingdom market during 2007. However, we do not believe that patient care will be compromised as alternative treatment options remain available. All companies need to keep their product portfolios under close review, and may decide to discontinue a product for a number of reasons. The Department has no powers to insist that a company continue to keep a product on the market if it decides not to. Officials are in regular contact with the companies who supply insulins to the UK market and are continuing to monitor the situation.</p>

	<p pid="b.271W.8/1">Over the last five years, the Department has provided NHS Blood and Transplant dedicated funding&mdash;over &pound;4 million in 2006-07&mdash;to support a number of specific hospital based initiatives to increase organ donor rates, including 25 living kidney donor schemes. Since 2001-02, there has been a 2 per cent. increase in kidney transplants.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.8/2">Over 14 million people have registered on the Organ Donor Register (ODR), which represents approximately 23 per cent. of the United Kingdom population. The Department gives around &pound;1 million pounds yearly to NHS Blood and Transplant to run the ODR and to promote transplantation. The Department also provides Section 64 grants to a number of charities.</p>
	<p pid="b.271W.8/3">In addition, an Organ Donation Task Force is currently identifying barriers to organ donation and will report later this year on what further steps could be taken to increase organ donation rates.</p>

This letter explains the purpose of the survey, the selection procedures and encourages participation. It also describes on whose behalf the survey is being conducted.

	<p pid="b.281W.11/6" class="indent">When interviewers call at the address they provide interviewees with a leaflet which covers many of the points referred to above, in more detail. This leaflet also explains to respondents that data obtained in the interview are confidential and are used for statistical purposes only.

	<p pid="b.288W.2/1">Sunderland city council, Manchester city council, Kent county council, Coventry city council and the Royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea have all signed a formal Expression of Interest as a part sponsor of one or more academy projects. In each case the council proposed to become part-sponsor but with the non-state sponsor appointing a majority of the governors and taking responsibility for the governance of the academy, as is required under the academies programme even when a local authority is part sponsor. It is not permitted that the local authority appoint more than two governors or play the leading role in the academy governance.</p>
	<p pid="b.288W.2/2">Once a formal Expression of Interest has been signed and approved by Ministers there are two further stages in the development of an academy before it opens&mdash;a &quot;feasibility stage&quot; during which the project team prepares detailed plans, including an educational vision and model, and formally consults with the local community; and an &quot;implementation stage&quot; during which detailed plans for school improvement are developed by all the stakeholders, and any necessary building work is carried out. Sunderland city council's interest is in three academies, all of which have entered their feasibility stage. Manchester city council has signed an Expression of Interest for a total of seven academies, all of which have entered their feasibility stage. Kent county council has an interest in five projects, of which one is already open and four have entered feasibility. The Royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea has signed an Expression of Interest for one academy, which is in its implementation stage. All of the academies have non-state co-sponsors.</p>

	<p pid="b.291W.2/1">We are working with national and local employers on both the design of Diplomas and their implementation at a local level. 5,000 employers have been involved in the design of the first five Diploma lines including major corporations such as BT, BSkyB and Sainsbury through Diploma Development Partnerships (DDPs). A large number of employers are also currently involved in the development of the second five Diploma lines and we expect even more will get involved in the development of the final four.</p>
	<p pid="b.291W.2/2">The DDPs also have an important role in engaging both large corporations and local employers in the direct delivery of Diplomas. To this end the DDPs will be running nine regional events in May for local consortia who were successful in the recent Diploma Gateway process and will be offering the first Diplomas in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.291W.2/3">Our key partner bodies in education business links, the local Education Business Partnerships, Trident, and others also have a role to play. Between them they have links to at least 300,000 businesses already working with schools and colleges. They are engaging with DDPs, Sector Skills Councils, and local Diploma delivery consortia to help local employers to support Diploma students with work experience placements and other essential work-related input. If Diplomas are genuinely to provide the kind of knowledge, skills and attitudes that employers value, we need them to get involved in supporting all aspects of teaching and learning. The nature of this will depend on each employer's capacity and might include providing support materials; sponsoring projects; mentoring young people or simply giving talks on relevant topics. Bill Rammell recently announced improvements that we are making to the existing infrastructure for supporting work-related learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.291W.2/4">In addition, the Secretary of State has appointed Sir Alan Jones as the Diploma Champion for Employers. Employer to employer promotion of the expected value to business is key in ensuring that we get a high level of employer engagement and active involvement in Diplomas. Sir Alan Jones is already attending a number of events which will enable him to talk to a large number of employers. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-05">5 June</phrase> the Secretary of State and Sir Richard Lambert will also host a joint CBI/DfES breakfast event for CEOs focusing on the Diplomas.</p>

	<p pid="b.295W.0/1">We have no plans to issue guidance to schools on encouraging families to eat at home at night round the table. Arrangements for eating outside of school are rightly matters for individual families to decide. However, our school food programme is designed to help children to recognise the benefits of healthy eating, not only at school but also at home. This includes ensuring that all secondary school pupils will have an entitlement to learn to cook from 2008. This will ensure that they have the necessary skills to enable them to reproduce that healthy food at home.</p>
	<p pid="b.295W.0/2">New school food standards to be introduced in September 2007, cover both food served at lunchtime and at other times of the school day, building on the interim standards introduced in September 2006. The new school food standards will restrict snacks provided in schools to nuts, seeds, fruit or vegetables with no added salt sugar or fat. This will ensure that the food available to children throughout the day in school is healthy and nutritionally balanced. Recognising the benefits of healthy eating should also help to discourage pupils from buying unhealthy snacks on the way to and from school.</p>

	<p pid="b.295W.3/1">The Department's 'Safefy Education: Guidance for schools DfES/0161/2002' provides information on how the framework for Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) can address the issue of accidental injury arid death in children and young people. The framework includes teaching young people at primary school level about school rules relating to health and safety issues, and at secondary school level to develop skills to cope with emergencies, including first aid and resuscitation techniques. Beyond this, the guidance also highlights how other parts of the national curriculum can be used to develop children's ability to recognise hazards and respond appropriately to risky situations.</p>
	<p pid="b.295W.3/2">The Department encourages schools to develop strategies that are effective at a local level in raising the profile of safety education and dealing with medical emergencies, working with suitable partners where appropriate to do so. We are aware of the valuable support that organisations such as the British Red Cross offer individual schools or groups of schools at a local level to enrich curriculum work in this area.</p>

	<p pid="b.296W.0/1">In 2001 pupils whose parents received income support (IS), income based jobseekers allowance (IBJSA) or support under part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 were entitled to receive free school lunches. Children who received IS or IBJSA in their own right were also entitled to free school lunches.</p>
	<p pid="b.296W.0/2">In April 2003 an additional free school meal eligibility criterion was introduced, predominantly to protect pupils who prior to <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-06">6 April 2003</phrase> were entitled to receive a free school lunch but, who after that date would otherwise have lost that entitlement as a result of the changes to the tax credit and welfare system. The additional criterion allowed pupils whose parents who were in receipt of child tax credit, without additional working tax credit, and an income as assessed by HMRC that did not exceed &pound;13,230, (2003/04 tax year) (currently 2007/08 &pound;14,495) to receive free school meals.</p>
	<p pid="b.296W.0/3">Also from April 2003 legislation requires:</p>
	<p pid="b.296W.0/4" class="indent">a claim for a free school lunch, by or on behalf of a pupil, to be made before they could be considered for a free school meal; and</p>
	<p pid="b.296W.0/5" class="indent">children who receive education suitable for a child under compulsory school (who would otherwise be eligible to receive a free school meal) to satisfy an additional requirement of receiving that education both before and after the lunch period before being eligible to receive a FSM.</p>
	<p pid="b.296W.0/6">A final change was made in April 2003 that extended free school meal eligibility to pupils whose parents receive the guarantee element of state pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="b.296W.0/7">Figures for maintained schools in England show, with the exception of 2004, that since 1997 there has been a continuous downward trend in the number of children known to be eligible to receive free school meals. The 2004 figures reflect the additional families that were brought into entitlement as a result of the changes to eligibility criteria in 2003. Figures show a similar, although lesser percentage, downward trend in the number of pupils that take-up their entitlement.</p>

	<p pid="b.319W.9/1">The Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG) is a ring-fenced grant which provides additional support for underachieving ethnic minority pupils and for pupils for whom English is an Additional Language. The total grant for 2007-08 is &pound;179 million. Cambridgeshire will receive &pound;104,811.</p>
	<p pid="b.319W.9/2">Approximately &pound;435 million of the &pound;24.6 billion Schools Formula Spending Share (SPSS) for 2005-06 was distributed on the basis of numbers of children for whom English is an Additional Language, and from low performing ethnic minority groups.</p>
	<p pid="b.319W.9/3">The Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG), which replaced SPSS for 2006-07, gives local authorities allocations for multi year periods: the allocations for 2007-08 will depend on pupil numbers in schools in January 2007 and the guaranteed unit of funding for each authority set in December 2005 is influenced by the number of its children for whom English is an Additional language.</p>
	<p pid="b.319W.9/4">The Dedicated Schools Grant is supplied to local authorities in support of the Schools Budget. It is for the local authorities&mdash;in conjunction with their Schools Forum&mdash;to fund the schools they maintain from their Schools Budget. The Dedicated Schools Grant Guaranteed Unit of Funding for Cambridgeshire in 2007-08 is &pound;3,622.90.</p>
	<p pid="b.319W.9/5">We will set indicative allocations for a three year period for 2008-09 to 2010-11, following the current consultation as part of the new school funding arrangements for 2008-09, which will be finalised when we have the pupil numbers for each year. The possibility of an Exceptional Circumstances Grant to deal with additional pressures which may fall on local authorities after we set out three year allocations is under consideration as part of our consultations.</p>
	<p pid="b.319W.9/6">The Government are working in partnership with local areas to spread best practice in meeting specific pressures that have arisen as a result of recent migration. In addition, we have set aside &pound;400,000 over a two year period to fund a New Arrivals Excellence Programme to build capacity in local authorities to support schools with limited experience of teaching new arrivals with little knowledge of English.</p>

	<p pid="b.322W.5/38">Central Government capital support for investment in schools has increased from under &pound;700 million in 1996-97 to &pound;6.4 billion in 2007-08 and will rise further to &pound;8.0 billion by 2010-11. Progress is being made year-by-year in improving the quality of the school building stock. The bulk of schools capital is now allocated by formula to authorities and schools so that they can address their local priorities, including the replacement of decayed temporary accommodation, on which we have set a high priority. Given the high levels of funding, authorities have the opportunity to replace temporary buildings where they are considered to be unsuitable.</p>
	<p pid="b.322W.5/39">Modern, high-quality mobile or demountable buildings provide a good environment for teaching and learning where there is short-term need. They might, for instance, be needed to cope with a short-term increase in pupil numbers, or where extensive remodelling or rebuilding of permanent accommodation means providing temporary accommodation on the school site, rather than transporting children elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="b.325W.8/19">The introduction of the dedicated schools grant (DSG) in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded. The 1997-98 to 2005-06 figures are based on an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education; the 2006-07 DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending.</p>
	<p pid="b.325W.8/20">In addition, DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through CLG's local government finance settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. This means we have a break in our time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>
	<p pid="b.325W.8/21">To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, we have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described above this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year. There are other grants that support the schools budget, these are not included in the provided DSG figures. The cash figures for all funded pupils aged three-15 in East Sussex and England are shown in the following table.</p>

The majority of this money will support the delivery of the 'Out and About package'&mdash;a series of training modules and supporting guidance to help teachers, school staff and providers deliver high quality learning outside the classroom experiences. Because the package is being put out for competitive tender, it is not possible to provide an exact figure for its total cost. In addition to the Manifesto funding, the government will continue to fund other projects that support learning outside the classroom, for example in 2007-08, the joint DCMS/DfES Museums and Galleries programme will be supported by &pound;4.7 million funding and the London Challenge New Views will receive &pound;1.6 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.338W.2/2">In September 2008 the Diplomas will only be available on a limited basis across the country. Other vocational qualifications will continue to be available and schools and colleges will be able to choose what to offer to young people. The impact of the introduction of diplomas on other vocational qualifications therefore will be determined by the choices that schools, colleges and ultimately young people make. We expect young people to increasingly choose a diploma or apprenticeship rather than one of the other vocational qualifications available to them, except where those vocational qualifications are part of a diploma, as we build up to the national entitlement from 2013. Our aim, as set out in the 14 to 19 White Paper, has always been to achieve a clearer set of choices for young people, each one leading to a recognised and valued qualification.</p>
