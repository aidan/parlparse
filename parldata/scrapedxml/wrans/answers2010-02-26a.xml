	<p pid="a.769W.3/1">Following the severe weather conditions in February 2009, the Government asked the UK Roads Liaison Group to identify the lessons that should be learnt regarding highway authorities' preparedness for extreme weather events. The UK Roads Liaison Group made 19 recommendations, one of which advised that:</p>
	<p pid="a.769W.3/2" class="indent">&quot;in considering appropriate service standards, at least six days resilience would represent sensible good practice for determining the number of days resilience during the core winter period&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.769W.3/3">It is for each authority to consider the recommendations and decide for themselves how best to take them forward. However, a write round in late October 2009 by regional resilience teams (RRTs) in the Government Offices found that of those local authorities that responded (a third of local highway authorities) all but one were holding at least six days' supply, and more than half of those responding arranged to hold 10 days' supply or more. Northamptonshire county council reported that it had reviewed the UKRLG's recommendations and that it held 11,000 tonnes at that time.</p>

Overall, within the Ministry of Justice (excluding the National Offender Management Services (NOMS)) 73 per cent. have completed a declaration. Among full-time staff 58 per cent. have completed a declaration form, with 3.9 per cent. recording that they have a disability. Among part-time staff 3.5 per cent. declared a disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.782W.3/2">For NOMS, 55 per cent. of directly employed staff have completed a declaration, with 6 per cent. recording that they have a disability. Among full-time staff 55 per cent. completed a declaration, of whom 6 per cent. declared a disability and among part-time staff 58 per cent. completed a declaration and 6 per cent. of those declared a disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.782W.3/3">2 per cent. of senior civil servants (SCS) employed within the Ministry have declared a disability. As the actual number of SCS staff involved is less than 10, any disclosure of their working patterns and average salaries may lead to individual identification.</p>
	<p pid="a.782W.3/4">For staff employed in grades below the SCS, insufficient numbers of employees have made any declaration of their status in relation to disability to enable the Ministry to determine, with any accuracy, average salary information.</p>
	<p pid="a.782W.3/5">However, during 2008-09 (the latest figures available) the average salary for full-time staff employed in the Ministry of Justice (excluding National Offender Management Services (NOMS)) was &#163;23,986 and the average full-time equivalent (FTE) salary for part-time staff for 2008-09 was &#163;20,717. For staff employed within NOMS, at <phrase class="date" code="2010-01-31">31 January 2010</phrase> the average full-time salary was &#163;24,876 and the average FTE salary for part-time staff was &#163;23,986.</p>
	<p pid="a.782W.3/6">Both the Ministry of Justice and NOMS encourages staff to declare relevant information to assist with diversity monitoring.</p>

SOCA is not able to say how many people have been convicted of a specific drug trafficking offence since its inception.

The YJB's forthcoming publication &quot;Youth Justice Annual Workload Data 2008-09&quot; reports that local authorities and their partners, such as social services, police and probation, contributed a further &#163;222.8 million to the operation of youth offending teams in England and Wales in 2008-09.</p>

However, the economy was starting from a position of strength and is actively supported by policies implemented by the Government, including the fiscal stimulus and a significant package of support for those out of work. In Castle Point, people are benefiting from this investment. Over the second half of 2009, more than 450 people moved off of the claimant count each month on average. The claimant count fell for two consecutive months in October and November and stands below the level reached in September.

	<p pid="a.812W.5/56">The expenditure on pharmaceuticals is included as its primary aim is prevention. Nevertheless, strictly, expenditure on pharmaceuticals is not included in the OECD prevention and public health category. Hence, for comparison with other countries using OECD data, these &quot;medication&quot; figures should be excluded. Excluding pharmaceuticals in line with OECD methodology gives a total expenditure on public health and prevention of &#163;3.7 billion. If pharmaceuticals were included, the overall total for 2006-07 would be &#163;5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.812W.5/57">Total health expenditure for England for the same period was approximately &#163;93.5 billion. This suggests that about 4 per cent. of health expenditure is directed towards prevention (using the figure without pharmaceuticals and without health-related expenditure, so that this can be compared with other OECD countries).</p>

	<p pid="a.815W.0/4">The product information for Epilim contains detailed advice in relation to the use of Epilim during pregnancy. It is currently advised that women of childbearing potential should not be started on Epilim without specialist neurological advice and the benefits of Epilim use should be weighed against the risks to the foetus.</p>
	<p pid="a.815W.0/5">Information on possible side effects which may occur during treatment with Epilim are also outlined in the product information. These side effects may have been reported during clinical trials or since Epilim has been marketed and have been assessed as either having a causal association or a strong suspicion of an association. Of the known side effects it is recognised that children who are treated with Epilim are at particular risk of developing liver damage and pancreatitis.</p>

	<p pid="a.821W.2/1">The Home Office has responsibility for the police recorded crime statistics and figures for the number of offences of bigamy recorded by the police are given in Tables l and 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.821W.2/2">Court proceedings statistics are collected by the Ministry of Justice. Information showing the number of persons proceeded against at magistrates courts and found guilty at all courts for bigamy in England and Wales from 1998 to 2008 are given in Tables 3 and 4.</p>
	<p pid="a.821W.2/3">The police recorded crime data are based on the number of offences recorded in each financial year. Court proceedings data are based on the number of offenders. These data are published on a calendar year basis and are counts of persons classified by their principal offence. For these reasons the two datasets are not directly comparable.</p>

	<p pid="a.828W.8/1">There has been no change to the eligibility for free passports. This is not an age related concession, but was introduced in recognition of those who could have made a substantial contribution to the national effort during the second world war. The free passport scheme is an extension of the initial scheme that offered free one-year passports to second world war military veterans attending 60th Anniversary Commemorative Events in 2004. It was decided to extend the scheme to full validity 10 year passports and to recognise those who may have made a contribution to the overall war effort, whether or not they had served in the armed forces. It therefore applies to those born on or before 2<sup>( )</sup>September 1929 who would have been aged 16 or over at the end of the war.</p>
