	<p pid="a.654W.5/2">Defra has overall policy responsibility for coastal erosion risk in England and grant aids individual local authority improvement projects to reduce this risk but does not build defences, nor direct the authorities on which specific projects to undertake.</p>
	<p pid="a.654W.5/3">Erosion risk will vary around the coastline depending on local conditions and defences in place. Defra has encouraged the relevant authorities to produce Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) which provide large-scale assessments of the risks associated with coastal processes and present long term policy frameworks to manage these risks in a sustainable manner. In 2001 Defra funded a national study of information on long term coastal processes and evolution over the next century (Futurecoast). This is designed to be used by coastal authorities to inform their current revisions of SMPs. The Office of Science and Technology's Foresight Future Flooding report, published in 2004, used Futurecoast and other information to consider possible rates of coastal erosion for the whole country under different scenarios over the next 80 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.654W.5/4">Management of coastal erosion risk and associated monitoring in specific locations is the responsibility of the relevant local authority in each area. Defra has not carried out any specific assessment in the areas identified.</p>

	<p pid="a.656W.0/2">A table showing available data has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.0/3">Rent forms part of the HRA, along with various allowances for expenditure (management, maintenance, major repairs allowance, debt charges etc). Some authorities are in deficit and we are providing net subsidy of around &pound;200 million in 2005&ndash;06, with similar amounts forecast for future years.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.0/4">Where an authority has an assumed surplus (negative subsidy) transfers are made to the ODPM according to calculations and assumptions made independently of the actual rents an authority charges. These transfers are recycled through the subsidy system and paid to authorities with an assumed deficit. None of the transfers are used for 'other purposes'.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.0/5">Prior to 2004&ndash;05, net subsidy entitlement was calculated differently. Housing element requirements were calculated similarly to the current HRA subsidy, but then added to the rent rebate element which was then accounted for in the HRA. Where the housing element was a negative amount, it was deducted from the rent rebate subsidy entitlement, and any net subsidy requirement was met by the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="a.656W.0/6">In some cases, where surpluses remained after the two subsidy streams had been reconciled, the balance would be transferred to that authority's own general fund and lost to housing. No data were routinely collected to show the amounts transferred.</p>

In addition, officials are closely involved with the borough council and other partners in bringing forward housing, growth and other agendas. There have already been a number of ministerial visits to North Northamptonshire and more are planned. Ministers from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister are more than happy to discuss housing development and infrastructure provision in Wellingborough during future visits to Northamptonshire.</p>

	<p pid="a.670W.2/1">The British Government supports peace building and reconciliation in Sri Lanka through a variety of programmes and activities. Its peace building and Reconciliation Strategy aims to describe the activities needed to establish the conditions necessary to sustain peace in Sri Lanka. It supports and complements the Norwegian facilitation between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The Strategy is agreed across the three Government Departments involved in the Global Conflict Prevention Pool and informs decisions on dispersing funds from that pool in Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.2/2">Our programme includes support for UNICEF, OXFAM and Save the Children Fund, we are working to improve the access and quality of basic health and education services for communities in conflict affected districts. The goal is to ensure that these services are provided equitably across Sri Lanka, thus addressing one long held grievance, and to help return communities to normal peacetime conditions. Under these programmes 75,000 emergency education kits have been provided to schools in the North and East, student drop out rates have reduced by 50 per cent. and over 1,800 child soldiers have been returned to their families. Psychosocial care is provided to these and other children affected by the conflict. Measles, Polio and DPT (Diphtheria-polio-tetanus immunization) vaccination has been provided for all children in conflict affected areas and vitamin supplements to 90 per cent. of children. Some 88 per cent. of pregnant and lactating women now receive ante-natal care and nutrition supplements.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.2/3">To establish a more secure environment in the North and East, support for de-mining and mine awareness is provided through the United Nations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). This has helped encourage some 500,000 conflict displaced people to return to their homes. Their return has been supported with grants of material and tools to rebuild homes and restart their livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.2/4">We are also working with NGOs and civil society groups to reduce tensions within communities and to promote their resolution without resort to violence, including the implementation of an early warning mechanism to mitigate and prevent conflict in the east of Sri Lanka. To help these communities enjoy a more secure environment within which to pursue their livelihoods, we are working with the police and the security services to improve their awareness of human rights and adherence to international humanitarian law. Under the strategy, we also assist the Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission to provide increased access to justice for disadvantaged groups. Through the Asia Foundation, we are helping to strengthen legal institutions and processes at a local and national level by improving language skills for court staff, improving paralegal and advocacy skills for community based organisations and funding research into discrimination. This programme also includes support for public interest litigation relating to the protection of civil rights including for internally displaced persons (IDPs).</p>
	<p pid="a.670W.2/5">We also provide support for peace building and reconciliation through our diplomatic engagement. The Government of Sri Lanka have expressed gratitude for Britain's constructive contribution in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.672W.12/1">There are a variety of estimates of the size of the various Iraqi militias. But both these, and the extent of their influence, are difficult to assess with any accuracy. Ethnic, religious and tribal loyalties are widespread within Iraqi society and part of the reform and democratisation process of Iraqi institutions is the removal from office of those individuals whose loyalties are fundamentally not to the state. The capability of the Iraqi interior and defence ministries, and of the Iraqi Security Forces, will be important factors in assessing the conditions that will enable the transfer of responsibility for security to the Iraqi civilian authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.673W.2/1">It is not the policy of the Ministry of Defence to advise service personnel requiring medical treatment following active service in Iraq to attend NHS hospital A and E departments for treatment. The Defence Medical Services (DMS) manages the medical treatment pathways for all members of the UK armed forces, both regulars and mobilised reservists, who require medical treatment as a result of active service and makes all the necessary arrangements to ensure that it is delivered. There are of course other occasions where service personnel resident in the United Kingdom will present to A and E departments for emergency treatment of injuries and illnesses; service personnel are entitled to NHS care, including emergency care, and this is set out in the Department of Health's Establishing the Responsible Commissioner document.</p>
	<p pid="a.673W.2/2">The DMS has a number of referral options depending upon the nature of the medical treatment required. For example, the DMS refers service personnel with complex musculoskeletal or neurological needs requiring hospital care to one of the six Ministry of Defence Hospital Units (MDHUs) embedded within NHS trusts or to non-MDHU NHS facilities if the location and availability of clinical service is more socially convenient and clinically appropriate for the patient than MDHU care. Service personnel with moderate/minor musculoskeletal injuries who have been assessed and have a working diagnosis and a planned care pathway are referred to one of our 12 Regional Rehabilitation Units, while those with more complex rehabilitation needs are referred to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.673W.2/3">I am aware of a very small number of cases where the system has not delivered the standards of care that we always endeavour to provide for military patients. The MOD takes all allegations of poor medical care very seriously, and will investigate any complaint that individual service personnel or ex-service personnel raise with us.</p>
	<p pid="a.673W.2/4">It is not possible to provide an estimate of the number of British servicemen and servicewomen who have paid for private medical treatment following injuries incurred during active service in Iraq, as such information is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The armed forces do sometimes refer personnel for private care when this is considered appropriate. In such circumstances, the costs are borne by the Department. Whichever course of action is taken, it is with a view to ensuring that military patients are assessed and treated in a timely fashion and receive the optimal high quality treatment and rehabilitation to deliver the best possible outcome, including an early return to operational fitness when this is clinically possible.</p>

However, while decisions on any replacement for the Trident system are likely to be required in the current Parliament, they are still some way off. Initial preparatory work is being undertaken by officials on possible options for the future of the UK's nuclear deterrent. However, Ministers have not yet begun to consider the position on this issue in any detail and it is therefore too early to speculate, among other things, on the range of options that might be available and their potential costs.</p>

Photovoltaics will continue to receive support, along with other microgeneration technologies, through the new &pound;80 million low carbon buildings programme over the next three years. In addition, the Government have just launched their microgeneration strategy which will seek to tackle non-grant barriers hindering development of sustainable markets for these technologies. This will include working with industry to develop a route map for each microgeneration technology. These measures will help the photovoltaic industry to continue to develop in the UK, building a platform for business to take decisions on international developments.</p>

	<p pid="a.677W.2/1">The matter raised is the responsibility of the Office of Communications (Ofcom). Ofcom is the independent regulatory for the communications sector, deriving its main powers and duties directly from statute rather than by delegation from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and accountable to Parliament in its own right. The Chief Executive of Ofcom has pointed out that under the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (&quot;the Regulations&quot;) Ofcom is required to maintain registers of the numbers allocated to subscribers who have notified Ofcom that they do not for the time being wish to receive unsolicited communications for direct marketing purposes by means of telephone (Telephone Preference Service) or fax (Fax Preference Service).

	<p pid="a.677W.2/3">The invitation to tender includes: the aims and objectives for the registers; services and tender retirements; and minimum criteria for evaluation of tenders. I am informed by Ofcom that eight companies expressed an interest in tendering for the new contract, although three tenders were actually received by Ofcom. Having evaluated the tender and interviewed the bidders, Ofcom decided to award the new contract to TPSL the existing provider of the registers.</p>
	<p pid="a.677W.2/4">Accordingly, my officials have asked the Chief Executive Officer of Ofcom to reply to the hon. Member and to send me a copy of his response. Copies of the Chief Executive's letter will also be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.677W.5/1">Greater levels of entrepreneurship are essential if we are to succeed by increasing economic growth, and female entrepreneurship can, make a crucial contribution in this growth. Because there are unique issues attaching to female entrepreneurship the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has established the National Women's Enterprise task force, in association with women's business support organisation Prowess. The task force will champion women's enterprise issues across Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.677W.5/2">Both directly and through regional development agency ONE NorthEast the Government supports a range of initiatives which are achieving increases in the numbers of entrepreneurs in the North East of England. Support provide through the Business Link network in the region, ongoing restructuring and simplification Government business support, and the &pound;26.4 million to be shared by Easington, Derwentside, Wear Valley, Sedgefield and South Tyneside under the local enterprise growth initiative (LEGI) will all contribute to the encouragement of new business start-ups in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.677W.5/3">While many initiatives are aimed at all potential entrepreneurs, there are some which seek to increase opportunities, enhance levels of business skills and raise entrepreneurial aspirations specifically among the female population.</p>
	<p pid="a.677W.5/4">For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.677W.5/5" class="indent">ONE North East in association with regional partners in the public and private sectors has drawn up the North East of England enterprise strategy. The strategy draws together the priorities for developing enterprise in the region and outlines and actions, timescales and responsibilities for their delivery with the aim of encouraging the region's entrepreneurs to create, develop and grow their enterprises. Recognising the importance of encouraging female entrepreneurs, a North East Women's enterprise action plan is currently being developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.677W.5/6" class="indent">ONE NorthEast backs the Women into the Network, which has already achieved success in encouraging an enhanced culture of entrepreneurship in the region by assisting the integration of aspiring women entrepreneurs into existing business networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.677W.5/7">The Government announced this month that ONE NorthEast will receive &pound;80,000 to establish a pilot Women's Enterprise unit, which will assess measures needed to accelerate rates of women's entrepreneurship in the North East of England.</p>

	<p pid="a.683W.12/1">The most recent data available that allows assessment to be made of the number of households with no access to a bank account is the Family Resources Survey from 2002&ndash;03. This indicates that 8 per cent. of households in the United Kingdom had no bank account of any kind. This equated to 1.9 million households containing around 2.8 million adults. This data is broken down to Government Office regional level. This shows 10 per cent. of households in the West Midlands were unbanked.</p>
	<p pid="a.683W.12/2">In 1997&ndash;98, the Family Resources Survey was collected on a Great Britain basis, excluding Northern Ireland. 8 per cent. of households in the West Midlands were unbanked at that time compared to 8 per cent. of households in Great Britain as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.683W.12/3">In December 2004, the Government and the banks agreed to work together towards the goal of halving the number of adults in households with no access to a bank account of any kind and of making significant progress within two years. The Financial Inclusion Taskforce has been asked to monitor progress. The taskforce recently made its first annual report, which concluded that steady progress has been made towards the goal but also encouraged banks to continue to address the difficulties faced in opening a bank account.</p>

The numbers for 1997&ndash;2004 revise the information supplied in the reply to your similar question in July 2005 as a result of further research. Not all of the applications resulted in a search. There were some cases where the Registrar General was not satisfied that all the conditions were fulfilled; in some instances the applicants decided not to pursue their application. From 2005 applications were made under the Freedom of Information Act. The number of applications is significantly lower than for 1901 because the concession which allowed the release of information from the 1911 Census was more restrictive.</p>

This is the standard definition used for ASHE. The ASHE does not collect data on the self employed and people who do unpaid work.</p>
	<p pid="a.689W.3/5" class="indent">I attach tables showing Average Gross Weekly Earnings by parliamentary constituency for the years 1997 to 2005 for full-time and part-time employees on adult rates. These statistics are already published on the National Statistics website at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=13101">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=13101</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.689W.3/6" class="indent">The ASHE, carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It is a one per cent sample of all employees who are members of pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.695W.5/1">Climate change and access to energy are global problems that need a global response. Maximising energy efficiency (in both the production and use of energy) and diversification of energy sources and technologies has both environmental and developmental benefits. Both of these are crucial for developing countries, which are more vulnerable to rising oil prices and the adverse impacts of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.695W.5/2">There is an estimated annual $60 billion shortfall in energy investment in developing countries. This is why at Gleneagles the G8 asked the World Bank and other Multilateral Development Banks to develop a framework to increase investment in cleaner and more efficient energy in developing countries and to address the need for more investment to support adaptation to climate change. The World Bank has made good progress on this work and will present proposals for its component of the framework to the Development Committee at the spring meetings in Washington D.C. this month. The Government believes this framework presents a good opportunity to leverage more public and private investment in clean energy and encourage more effective use of existing financing instruments.</p>
	<p pid="a.695W.5/3">At the spring meetings the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for International Development will propose an initial annual target of $20 billion for the investment framework. We expect this to include public and private sector investment, non-concessional lending from the Multilateral Development Banks, and grant and concessional financing from relevant mechanisms. Concessional financing from donors, including the UK, will play an important role in the framework. We expect the World Bank to set out financing required from all sources in order to leverage $20 billion in total investment.</p>

	<p pid="a.697W.9/1">Other than for those due to turn 18 before the next statutory annual publication of the register, electoral registers in the UK do not identify the age of electors and no record is kept of categories of electors upon that basis. The Electoral Administration Bill currently before Parliament includes a new duty on electoral registration officers to take all necessary steps to ensure comprehensive registers. The Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) is actively working with committed organisations to promote awareness of voter registration at the national and local levels, in particular it has delivered a pan-London campaign (&quot;1824 Collective&quot;) directed at London's 'urban youth'. Lessons learnt from these initiatives will be used to inform the DCA's ongoing programme of work in democratic engagement (which includes raising voter registration levels). At present, DCA is working with the Department for Education and Skills, student unions, universities and colleges and local authorities to encourage eligible student populations to register to vote. It is hoped that the introduction of 'citizenship' into the school curriculum will prove to be a major step in raising awareness of young people in the democratic process and can be expected to develop further over time.</p>

	<p pid="a.704W.11/5">Demand-responsive, flexibly routed and community transport services have a particularly significant role to play in rural areas. We have encouraged their development in particular by Rural Bus Challenge competitions held from 1998 to 2003, which have supported some 300 rural transport projects. In addition, many rural community transport services have since 2002 been eligible to receive Bus Service Operators Grant and regulations were introduced in 2004 to enable flexibly routed bus services to be registered with the Traffic Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.704W.11/6">We are expecting all local transport authorities to include accessibility strategies in their next Local Transport Plans. Our guidance to authorities makes clear that the strategies should take account of the particular needs of rural communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.704W.11/7">From <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year people aged 60 and over and disabled people in rural and urban areas alike are entitled to free off-peak bus travel within their local authority boundary.</p>
	<p pid="a.704W.11/8">For rail services these are either directly supported by the Department or through Passenger Transport Executives, Transport for London and the Scottish Executive. Some &pound;5.8 billion of Government funds will be spent on the railway in 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="a.704W.11/9">The Government's Community Rail Development Strategy seeks to improve the value of local and rural rail services to the taxpayer and the communities they serve. This pragmatic approach includes greater flexibility in the setting of fares and timetables to ensure that the resources available for running the service are used as effectively as possible. Part of the strategy involves forging closer links between the community and the railway through community rail partnerships (or rail development companies) that bring together local stakeholders and the railway to jointly develop services.</p>

	<p pid="a.708W.2/1">The Department publishes projections for 25 years, using a base year of 2000 to forecast traffic growth up to 2025. The latest projections were published in 2005, consistent with the Future of Transport White Paper, projecting a 33&ndash;40 per cent. growth in traffic from 2000 to 2010, for all vehicle types on Inter-Urban Highways Agency roads in England and a 23&ndash;29 per cent. growth for the same period for all road types for England. For the period 2000 to 2015, growth is 40&ndash;51 per cent. for Inter-Urban roads and 29&ndash;38 per cent. for all roads. The projections for 2000 to 2025 are 51&ndash;69 per cent. and 38&ndash;53 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.708W.2/2">The projections currently do not differentiate between motorways, trunk roads and detrunked roads. Traditionally, motorway traffic growth has been higher than other trunk roads, suggesting motorway traffic growth would be at the upper end of the projection ranges. More detail on the projections can be found in the 'Future of Transport: Modelling and Analysis' available on the Department's website:</p>

	<p pid="a.708W.5/1">The term &quot;road rage&quot; is used to cover a wide range of aggressive behaviour. Unless a serious incident takes place the police do not become involved. It is not therefore practicable to assess the impact on drivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.708W.5/2">Rule 125 of the Highway Code gives guidance on being careful of and considerate towards other road users.</p>
	<p pid="a.708W.5/3">Those who drive aggressively may be prosecuted for offences such as careless and inconsiderate driving (section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, as amended by the Road Traffic Act 1991). Conviction may result in disqualification, a fine of up to &pound;2,500 and an endorsement of 3&ndash;9 penalty points. Courts also have the discretion to require offenders to retake the driving test, including the theory test.</p>

	<p pid="a.715W.3/1">I have received numerous representations in response to the Foyer Federation's 'Give us a chance' campaign. I have also received other correspondence and parliamentary questions about the 16 hour rule. In addition, I have accepted an invitation from the joint chairs of the all parliamentary group on foyers and on youth affairs to attend a meeting to discuss the 16 hour housing benefit rule. This provides both an opportunity to listen and advise what work is already in progress to identify how DWP and Jobcentre Plus can positively support people to study in order to improve their current educational attainment, leading to enhanced employment and career prospects.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.3/2">Work to review the interaction between study rules and benefits is ongoing. One of the outcomes of the recent Social Exclusion report &quot;Review of Financial Support, Supporting Young People to Achieve&quot; is that from April 2006, if someone is in non-advanced education when they turn 19 they can continue to receive certain benefits, including income support, and therefore housing benefit, and education maintenance allowance until they have completed their current course of study or reach age 20.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.3/3">This is clearly an improvement on the previous situation, but it is likely that there will still be some young people who have had to abandon their attempts to catch up on learning because they reach 20 before they have finished their course. Because of this, the Government are committed to keeping this new age limit under review. Additionally, we recognise that for some a different approach may be needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.715W.3/4">Consequently, from September as part of the new deal for skills we will be piloting in some Jobcentre Plus districts the effect of allowing low skilled jobseekers to take up full-time further education courses as a route into work when a lack of skills is considered to be a significant barrier.</p>

It should be noted that many of these cases will not progress to this latter stage of the process, as they may be closed, usually at the request of the parent with care, with the remainder being identified as being subject to a Reduced Benefit Decision; had Good Cause accepted; or actually being a change of circumstance in relation to an existing case rather than a new application.</p>
	<p pid="a.716W.6/13" class="indent">In the 3 months ending <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase>, in 61 per cent. of the 674,000 cases where a positive maintenance liability had been established, the non resident parent had either made a payment via the Agency's collection service, or a maintenance direct arrangement was in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.716W.6/14" class="indent">Where the parent with care is on the old scheme and in receipt of Income Support or Jobseeker's Allowance (income based) the parent with care does not receive any of the maintenance paid, as it is retained by the State, and offset against expenditure on means tested benefits. We are not able to give a precise figure as to the number of the above cases in which this applies, due to limitations with currently available management information. We do know that around 80 per cent. of the total amount of maintenance collected by the Agency goes to the parent with care.</p>
	<p pid="a.716W.6/15" class="indent">You also asked how many parents with care were receiving less than &pound;130 per week in benefits. Information relating to the overall amount of social security benefits being received by CSA clients is not available.</p>

	<p pid="a.721W.5/1">The contract for the Post Office card account was signed by DWP and Post Office Limited in March 2002. It was clear in the contract that Government funding for the Post Office card account would only continue until <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2010</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.721W.5/2">As we were migrating customers from order books to Direct Payment we had to decide what information we provided customers with, and when, so that they could make informed choices about the accounts they wanted to use. Since the Post Office card account had a lifetime of seven years, our judgment was that this was a reasonably lengthy period for a financial product of this type and there was no need draw customers' attention to it at the outset.</p>

	<p pid="a.729W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.729W.3/2">Defra's Market Transformation Programme (MTP), which supports Government policy on sustainable products, is aware from discussions with industry that this functionality could be added to televisions (with the exception of IDTVs which require a degree of constant power) at a reasonable cost. However, there are currently no televisions available on the market which switch automatically from stand-by into off after a pre-set time.</p>
	<p pid="a.729W.3/3">The Government are committed to reducing the amount of power used by products when in stand-by mode. The new Eco-Design for Energy Using Products Framework Directive provides a route for setting mandatory standards for products and we are pressing for stand-by power to be a priority area for action. The MTP has also been working to promote other measures: for example, an EU-wide voluntary agreement means that the majority of new televisions sold in the UK now consume around 1 watt of power in stand-by mode rather than the 3&ndash;8 watts consumed by older models. Discussions are now under way to extend this agreement to cover other consumer electronics.</p>
	<p pid="a.729W.3/4">The Budget also announced a new initiative, in partnership with major retailers and the Energy Saving Trust, to introduce voluntary schemes in the retail sector which encourage the purchase of more energy efficient alternatives in consumer electronics.</p>

Since the launch of the programme in 2004, a range of documents have been published to support local delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.730W.3/3">These include the &quot;National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services&quot; (2004), &quot;Every Child Matters: Change for Children in Health Services&quot; (2004), the &quot;Children Act 2004&quot;, which provides the statutory framework underpinning the Every Child Matters programme (including &quot;Statutory guidance on inter-agency co-operation to improve the wellbeing of children: children's trusts&quot; (2005) and &quot;Making arrangements to safeguard and promote the welfare of children&quot; (2005)). Other publications include &quot;Health and the Whole Child: What Children's Trusts mean for Health Professionals&quot; (2006), &quot;Pathways to Success&quot; (2006) and &quot;Joint planning and commissioning framework for children, young people and maternity services&quot; (2006).</p>
	<p pid="a.730W.3/4">A range of exemplars have also been published, including asthma, acquired brain injury, autism and complex disability. The good practice guide &quot;Transition: Getting it Right for Young People&quot;, was published in March 2006.</p>

In conjunction with the aims of the directive to protect trial subjects, particular emphasis is laid on the issue of informed consent for trials involving minors. The Government are committed to making an assessment of the effects of implementation of the directive as soon as reliable evidence is available. The Medicines and Health products Regulatory Agency, which acts as the licensing authority for all clinical trials within the directive's scope, has asked the United Kingdom clinical research collaboration to review the evidence to date, consider how to reduce any adverse regulatory impact, including the perceived extra bureaucracy involved, and agree plans for long-term monitoring. Additionally, Cancer Research UK and the national clinical research network have undertaken initial assessments of opinion about the effect of the directive on cancer clinical trials across the UK. Other assessments are being carried out at the European level with the Federation of European Cancer Societies.</p>

	<p pid="a.734W.5/1">The legislation that governs clinical trials of drugs is the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004. The Medical Device Regulations 2002 govern the trials of medical devices. These regulations apply to trials conducted in hospitals as well as to trials conducted in units attached to hospitals or elsewhere. One requirement of the regulations governing clinical trials is that anyone conducting a trial does it in accordance with the conditions and principles of good clinical practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.734W.5/2">The Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care (Department of Health, 2005) applies the same principles across all health and social care research which relate to the responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Health. A core standard for health care organisations is that they have systems to ensure the principles and requirements of this framework are consistently applied. National health service bodies have to take this standard into account in discharging their duty, under the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003, to put and keep in place arrangements for the purpose of monitoring and improving the quality of health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.734W.5/3">The clinical negligence scheme for trusts is a scheme established under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 for meeting losses and liabilities of health service bodies in England and Wales. Health Service Guidelines HSG(96)48 set out the scope of NHS Indemnity, which includes the liability of NHS bodies for negligent harm to subjects of clinical research.</p>

	<p pid="a.735W.9/7" class="indent">Between September 1997 and June 2005, the number of consultants at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust has increased from 137 to 224. The number of nurses increased from 784 in September 1997 to 1,101 in September 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.736W.2/1">The Health Protection Agency's (HPA) radiation protection division has the responsibility for providing advice on exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF). As part of its policy of ongoing evaluation of scientific evidence it reviewed its advice in 2004 on limiting exposure to EMF including that from electric and magnetic fields from power lines (extremely low frequency or ELF). The currently adopted restrictions on exposure are designed to prevent adverse health effects for members of the public of all ages and of varying health status. The HPA's advice is available on its website at <a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation</a></p>
	<p pid="a.736W.2/2">At the request of the Department, the HPA's radiation protection division addressed the issues of uncertainty in the science and aspects of precaution. The HPA's advice noted that an association between prolonged exposures to power frequency fields and childhood leukaemia has been found, the scientific reasons for which are presently uncertain. In the light of these findings and the requirement for additional research the HPA proposed that</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;the need for further precautionary measures should be considered by Government&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.2/4">In response, the stakeholder advisory group on ELF EMF (SAGE) was set up to explore the implications for a precautionary approach and make practical recommendations for precautionary measures. SAGE is currently developing its advice and is expected to report later this year.

By 2007&ndash;08 spending on the NHS will have increased to over &pound;97 billion. With this level of investment all NHS bodies should be able to plan and achieve financial balance every year. However, NHS organisations need to continue to look at the way they provide services to ensure that they are delivering the best possible value for money. In some areas, they will need to make tough decisions to ensure funding is used in the best possible way.</p>

	<p pid="a.737W.6/1">The NHS Cancer Plan sets out the Government's plans to reduce waiting times for diagnosis and treatment. A target of a maximum two-month wait from urgent general practitioner referral to first treatment for all cancer patients was put into place at the end of December 2005 and should be met for all cancer patients treated from <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.737W.6/2">The quarter's data, for the period January to March 2006, will be used to assess performance against this target and will be available in June 2006. The 62-day target is challenging but has been achieved for breast cancer and for other cancers in other parts of the country. The national health service is working hard to ensure that this target will shortly be met for all cancer patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.737W.6/3">The national cancer waits project team are working with those trusts and health authorities who are finding it challenging to understand the pathways their patients experience, and who need to improve their services to deliver these targets. This work will continue until we are sure that the changes they are making are delivering, and are sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.737W.6/4">We have also made guidance available to cancer networks, trusts and clinical teams on the 10 &quot;High Impact Changes&quot; that will most help them to deliver cancer waiting times and improve the patients' experience and we are sharing examples of best practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.737W.6/5">We have set up a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) improvement programme, with specialist teams providing tailored support for trusts that have significant challenge in meeting their target and are monitoring the trusts' performance. Work has begun with three trusts that were first to volunteer to pilot the support programme; Sandwell and West Birmingham, Northumbria, and Aintree NHS Trusts. These teams, which comprise a programme manager, analyst and specialists in infection control, will move on to support up to 17 further trusts during 2006&ndash;07. Selection will depend on progress towards the MRSA target and other factors. I will announce the additional trusts to join the programme at stages, during 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.737W.6/6">The NHS now has an operating standard of six months for inpatient treatment. At the end of February 2006, less than 100 NHS patients were waiting more than six months for treatment. The Healthcare Commission is responsible for assessing NHS organisations against these standards annually and the Department will continue to scrutinise performance on waiting times, taking action through strategic health authorities if issues arise in relation to waiting times for patients.</p>

	<p pid="a.738W.2/1">There are many different types of cancer, the causes of which are multifactorial rather than there being a single cause for any particular type of cancer, and this should be recognised. It is known that lifestyle factors such as smoking, consumption of alcoholic beverages, physical activity/obesity, and also occupational exposure to certain chemicals in the past, especially asbestos, have a major influence on cancer incidence. It is very difficult to estimate the burden due to environmental factors but some of the available data is summarised as follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.738W.2/2">Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to produce leukaemia and other cancers, although there is little direct data available on the burden of disease from this cause. Exposure to radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas, is a cause of lung cancer and there is a markedly increased risk in smokers. It has been estimated that about two per cent. of cancer deaths in Europe may be due to radon.</p>
	<p pid="a.738W.2/3">Exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight increases the risk of skin cancer. Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the United Kingdom and the incidence of the disease is rising rapidly. However, up to 80 per cent. of cases could be avoided.</p>
	<p pid="a.738W.2/4">There is little convincing evidence to indicate that environmental exposure to chemicals in the UK causes cancer. However, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (passive smoking) is known to be associated with a 10 to 30 per cent. increase in lung cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.738W.2/5">Additionally, dietary factors are estimated to account for approximately 30 per cent. of cancers in industrialised countries&mdash;making diet only second to tobacco as a preventable cause of cancer. In particular, obesity is associated with an increase in risk of some cancers such as colorectal and breast cancers while increasing the intake of fruit and vegetables and physical activity is associated with decreased risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.738W.2/6">Cancer is predominantly a disease of the elderly, with the incidence of the disease increasing markedly with age. Longevity of an individual is therefore associated with an increased risk of developing cancer, and the aging of the population is associated with an increasing number of cancer cases overall.</p>

	<p pid="a.740W.2/1">The most recent full-year figures for new medicines approval times by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) are for 2004&ndash;05. These show an average approval time, from receipt of the application to grant of the licence, of 288 calendar days. This period however includes the time taken by applicants to supply any necessary new or correcting information following the initial assessment of their application. When this is taken into account the actual number of net working days taken by the MHRA reduces to an average of 122 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.2/2">For the relatively small number of completely new medicines, for example those containing new drugs and with the potential for meeting unmet medical needs in major diseases, the MHRA, during the same period, has maintained its record of assessing these in under 40 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.2/3">For all types of variations to product licences, whether straightforward or complex, and again in the most recent full year for which figures are available, 2004&ndash;05, the average time taken to approve, from receipt of the application to grant of the variation, was 67 calendar days. This includes time taken waiting for the company to provide any further information needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.2/4">More recent figures show a lengthening of assessment and approval times. For example, for the first seven months of 2005&ndash;06 (April to October) the approval time for new product licences had increased to 153 net working days or 404 gross calendar days.</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.2/5">These exceed the MHRA's assessment and approval target times and it is well aware of the impact this is having on pharmaceutical company business. This lengthening of assessment and approval times has been caused by a combination of adverse factors including increases in workload, difficulties in recruiting professional assessment staff, especially medically-qualified staff, and transitional implementation problems during the introduction of a new information management system.</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.2/6">The MHRA is taking a number of steps to improve service levels. These include organisational restructuring, additional recruitment, re-training of staff, voluntary schemes for extended working hours, and information system performance enhancements.</p>

However, it is very important that teenagers who are sexually active have access to contraception, including emergency contraception, and sexual health advice to minimise the risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections.</p>
	<p pid="a.741W.2/2">Health professionals provide contraception and advice on abortion to young people within an established legal framework which involves assessing the young person's competence to understand the choices they are making and encouraging them to talk to their parents.</p>

	<p pid="a.742W.2/19">Notes:</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.2/20">1. Figures for 1997&ndash;98 to 2001&ndash;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. Figures for 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04 have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.2/21">2. The significant decrease in expenditure in 2004&ndash;05 is because student grants unit expenditure by the Cumbria and Lancashire SHA (&pound;369 million was included in the authority's accounts in 2003&ndash;04) was transferred to the NHS Pensions Agency in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.2/22">3. Data is shown from 1997&ndash;98 to 2004&ndash;05, which is the latest year for which information is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.2/23">4. Expenditure is taken as the total expenditure of the strategic health authority, predecessor health authorities and PCTs within the SHA area.</p>
	<p pid="a.742W.2/24">5. Expenditure on general dental services and pharmaceutical services accounted for by the Dental Practice Board and Prescription Pricing Authority, respectively, are excluded.
