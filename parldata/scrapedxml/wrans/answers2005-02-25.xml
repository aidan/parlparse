Network Rail, the British Transport Police and a number of train operating companies also have staff who visit schools on a regular basis to reinforce safety messages. The NRCG's Annual Plan 2005, copies of which will be placed in the Libraries of the House and are available at <a href="http://www.trackoff.org">www.trackoff.org</a> , describes the approach to be taken to increase awareness of railway crime issues during this year.

Of these prosecutions, 16 were for failure to file returns required by s.39 Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965, as amended by the 2001 Order and 15 were for breach of s.43 Friendly Societies Act 1974, also as amended by that Order. The prosecutions were brought for offences contrary to s.61 of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965 and section 98 of the Friendly Societies Act 1974. All resulted in convictions. In 4 cases, 12-month conditional discharges were ordered and in the other 27 cases fines totalling &pound;16,675 were imposed.</p>
	<p pid=".839W.10/3">It has not been possible in the time available to ascertain the number of visits made in the context of each case in order to verify regulatory compliance, as visits which may be characterised in this way are made on a regular basis by staff of the Financial Services Authority. Nor has it been possible in the time available to obtain a breakdown of prosecutions by size of firm.</p>

	<p pid=".843W.6/16">Figures are cumulative. This table shows marginal deduction rates for working households in receipt of income related benefits or tax credits, where at least one person works 16 hours or more a week and where higher earnings would lead to reduced benefits or tax credits. They include the marginal effects of income tax and national insurance contributions, and the withdrawal of housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".843W.6/17">This analysis does not take into account the way in which the new tax credits will respond to rises in income. The new tax credits only respond to rises in income in the current year of more than &pound;2,500, disregarding the first &pound;2,500 of any rise. This means that recipients will not see their tax credits reduced as soon as their income rises, so reducing the effective marginal deduction in any one year.</p>
	<p pid=".843W.6/18">As a result of the Government's reforms, almost half a million fewer low-income households now face marginal deduction rates in excess of 70 per cent. than did so in April 1998. The increase in the number of households facing marginal deduction rates of between 40 and 70 per cent. is primarily due to the introduction of tax credits, and more recently the extension of support to workers aged 25 or over without children.</p>

	<p pid=".844W.3/1">The available figures show that the detection rate for domestic burglary in Northamptonshire in 2003&ndash;04 was 15 per cent. Detection rate figures for individual months are not provided as they are potentially misleading. This is because many crimes are not detected in the same month that they are recorded. Detection rates are therefore estimated on the basis of those detected in that month. This tends to provide reliable estimates only for longer periods than one month, and the Home Office therefore prefers to provide figures for twelve month periods at least.</p>

	<p pid=".852W.14/1">Cambodia faces a challenging governance agenda of which combating corruption is of central importance, as the president of the World Bank made clear recently.</p>
	<p pid=".852W.14/2">Strengthening governance remains a key part of UK bilateral assistance for Cambodia. The UK is helping the Government undertake critical reforms that will help tackle corruption. For example, we are helping the Government undertake reforms of management of public funds and we have supported work to tackle illegal logging.</p>
	<p pid=".852W.14/3">At the annual consultative group meeting between Government and donors in Cambodia in December last year, the Government committed to specific actions to tackle reported corruption, enact anti-corruption legislation and increase Government openness and transparency.</p>
	<p pid=".852W.14/4">However, these promises need to be backed by faster progress towards reform. I raised this issue with the Cambodian Minister of Justice, Mr. Ang Vong Vathana, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-27">27 January 2005</phrase>. Our ambassador in Phnom Penh also raised it with the Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".852W.14/5">We welcome the Cambodian Government's intention to adopt soon an anti-corruption law. We hope that the political will needed to implement the legislation will be forthcoming.</p>

	<p pid=".854W.5/55">Figures for gross contributions are after account is taken of the UK's abatement and the bringing to account of surpluses and deficits in respect of member states contributions in earlier years. Since 1988, member states' contributions exclude 10 per cent. collection costs (25 per cent. from March 2001) in respect of sugar and agricultural levies and customs duties payments&mdash;which are deducted before contributions are made to the Community. Prior to 1988 member states made their sugar and agricultural levies and customs duties contributions available in full. The 10 per cent. collection costs were paid from the expenditure side of the Budget to member states and thus scored as receipts.</p>

Training for magistrates is paid for and delivered at local level in 42 administrative areas. The budget for magistrates training is not ring fenced and currently cannot be isolated from the overall grant allocation made by the Department for Constitutional Affairs to the Magistrates Courts Service. The JSB provides a core continuing professional education curriculum, the aim of which is to strengthen and deepen the skills and knowledge of existing judicial office-holders. High Court judges are invited to relevant continuation seminars. In addition, the JSB provides a programme of regular after-court seminars for the senior judiciary. There is no ring-fenced budget for High Court judges' training and the resources devoted to it can only be identified at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".867W.2/1">I attended the Education and Youth Council on behalf of the United Kingdom. During the education part of the Council, we discussed the education and training aspects of the Lisbon mid-term review and adopted conclusions on the importance of education and training to Lisbon. The conclusions will be transmitted to the European Council and ask it to emphasise education and training in the Lisbon mid-term review, for example by calling on member states to have lifelong learning strategies in place by 2006 and by improving the exchange of good practice on education and training at European level. As part of the discussion, Commissioner Figel presented the Commission's communication on Lisbon and explained that it identified six key areas of work for Education Ministers; effective investment; national lifelong learning strategies; higher education; vocational training; European qualifications framework and the Youth Pact.</p>
	<p pid=".867W.2/2">I tabled a paper setting out the UK position and also spoke to emphasise that growth and employment should be the focus of the Lisbon strategy and that achieving the Lisbon goals depended on investing effectively in education and skills, which was strongly supported. I also highlighted the importance of a flexible labour market and suggested that while it was important for the state to pay for basic skills, employers and individuals should invest in higher level skills. I also suggested that member states should work together on reforming higher education funding, discuss the use of ICT in delivering lifelong learning and collect evidence on the links between skills and productivity.</p>
	<p pid=".867W.2/3">On the basis of presentations from experts, we held an exchange of views on how discussion did not lead to any conclusions but the presidency has asked the Commission to continue to look at these issues. I also tabled a paper under this item and explained that the UK was beginning to give schools more autonomy, but that school leadership was also a key element to success. I also noted, along with Italy, that we are developing an approach based on the principle of personalising the learning experience to the needs of the individual. On the issue of equal opportunities for all, I explained that financial incentives were being offered in the UK for pupils from lower income backgrounds to stay on in school after compulsory education.</p>
	<p pid=".867W.2/4">During the youth part of the Council, we discussed and adopted conclusions on the youth aspects of the Lisbon mid-term review. The conclusions endorse the initiative proposed by France and supported by Germany, Sweden and Spain to establish an EU Youth Pact. I tabled a UK position paper and said that I saw the Youth Pact as an opportunity to demonstrate to young people that the EU is not simply a remote bureaucracy with no impact on their lives. The Pact should work towards eliminating youth unemployment, developing young people's skills and confidence to prepare them both professionally and personally and encouraging a positive approach to learning amongst young people. Commissioner Figel explained that the Commission would adopt a communication in May, which would outline their ideas for the content of the Pact.</p>

	<p pid=".870W.5/1">Information on expenditure for the 2003/04 academic year relates to the last year of the pilots which ran three different models for bonus payments, all of which differed from the way bonuses work in the national scheme. Only a third of England was covered and the scheme was administered by local education authorities. Within the overall expenditure on EMA pilots in 2003/04 it is estimated that some &pound;21.5 million was spent on bonuses.</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/2">In the national scheme young people studying a two-year course may receive up to &pound;500 in bonuses as long as they make good progress in their studies and they return to study after Christmas and summer holidays.</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/3">Estimated costs for each academic year of the national scheme are available up to 2007/08 and assume that the current model and assumptions continue unchanged, for example it is assumed that 75 per cent. of young people on EMA will receive bonuses. These estimated costs, which take account of the phased implementation are as follows.</p>

	<p pid=".875W.2/1">The Government recognises the importance of overseas students to the UK. They provide significant benefits to the economy and to individual institutions and we want that to continue. However, as self-governing bodies, universities and higher education colleges are responsible for their own admission decisions. It is up to each institution to decide on the proportion of overseas students it plans to recruit. This does not affect the overall position of home students. Throughout the UK overseas students are recruited in addition to home students and the Government remain committed to widening participation in higher education. We continue to believe that all those who have the potential to benefit from higher education should have the opportunity to do so.</p>

The analysis does not explicitly examine gas price or fuel price differential scenarios but it is noted that the impact of CO <sub>2</sub> prices can be sensitive to the background assumptions, such as energy prices and power station efficiencies. Higher gas prices will tend to require higher carbon prices in order to meet required emission reductions. The report is available electronically:</p>

The use of hydrogen for stationary power generation and heat did not in general meet these criteria, but hydrogen could be useful in situations where there are substantial renewable energy sources but the export of electricity is constrained (e.g. the Western Isles).</p>

	<p pid=".891W.15/1">As stated in my answer to question 217505 Government's renewable target of 10 per cent. of energy from renewable sources by 2010 would mean a reduction, per year, of 2.3 million tons of carbon dioxide over that same energy being produced by gas. The 10 per cent. target relates to all renewable technologies. The Government do not have a wind turbine programme. The support being provided by Government for renewables under the RO is technology neutral.</p>

	<p pid=".893W.0/1">I understand that the question refers to the strategy being developed by the interdepartmental, cross-sectoral Working Group set up to address the issue of homelessness in the context of promoting social inclusion. The Working Group's remit is to consider how Government Departments, agencies and non-departmental public bodies can best work together to ensure that the risk of homelessness is reduced and that the full range of appropriate services is available to homeless people. The strategy being developed by the Working Group, which must be affordable and deliverable, will aim to ensure that better services are delivered by using existing resources in a more joined-up way. However, the Housing Executive is currently spending almost &pound;30 million per year on temporary accommodation and other services for the homeless.</p>

This is clearly working, with the proportion of Catholics among regular officers rising from 8 per cent. in 2001 to 17.14 per cent. today.

	<p pid=".905W.0/1">The Comptroller and Auditor General presented a report to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-23">23 November 2004</phrase> entitled &quot;Reforming NHS Dentistry: ensuring effective management of risks&quot;. This includes a review of the Personal Dental Service (PDS) system. This reported that in 1998, the Department commissioned the university of Birmingham to review the implementation of the PDS pilot scheme. The review focused on all 15 first wave pilots and five of the second wave pilots and examined developments over the first three years of operation, As the aim of each pilot was unique the review reviewed each pilot's progress against its specific objectives and did not compare relative performance.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.0/2">The review's key findings were that the PDS system improved access to national health service dental services and provided greater flexibility to provide NHS services. Changes in the method of payment changed the nature of professional work undertaken; the specialist pilots were successful in providing specialist dental care in a non-hospital setting; and most pilots had a key person whose enthusiasm was central to facilitating progress. There was also some evidence to suggest that dentists may initially prescribe proportionately fewer intricate dental appliances from dental laboratories under the PDS system than dentists working to the current general dental services contract. Against this, the research shows that dentists in the PDS spend more time on treating patients and this should generate more work for dental laboratories. Case studies which the NHS Modernisation Agency are carrying out on the field sites, which they are managing to develop and test new ways of working in NHS dentistry should provide further information on changes in practice.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.0/3">In managing PDS schemes, primary care trusts seek to ensure that patients receive all the services, which are clinically necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".905W.3/1">The available information is in Appendix E of the supplement to the 30th report 2001 of the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration Cm 4999. In table 89, in March 2000, mean hours per week of a general dental practitioner on general dental service (GDS) (national health service) work were 25.13 hours with 7.91 hours on private practice and with 1.16 hours shared time. GDS time as a percentage of GDS time and private practice time in March 2000 was 76 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".905W.3/2">We are to introduce new contractual arrangements for NHS dentistry which are intended to make NHS dentistry more attractive to dentists. One of the main changes is the replacement of the treatment based, item of service method of paying dentists with a remuneration package derived from an evidence-based assessment of patients' overall oral health care needs. This will enable dentists to spend more time with their patients and reward them for giving oral health promotion advice.</p>

	<p pid=".906W.2/1">Free sight tests on the national health service are already available to priority groups: children under 16, those aged 16&ndash;18 in full-time education, people on low incomes who might otherwise be deterred by the cost of a private sight test and defined categories of people at particular risk of developing eye disease. In April 1999 we extended free sight tests to all people aged 60 and over.</p>
	<p pid=".906W.2/2">Based on the most recent data available, we estimate that the cost of extending free sight tests to all those who currently pay privately for sight tests would be an additional &pound;89 million based on the 2004&ndash;05 rate of &pound;17.82 per test.</p>
	<p pid=".906W.2/3">We believe that the current range of entitlements to free sight tests and optical vouchers is sufficient to meet the needs of young people, people on low incomes and individuals at particular risk of developing eye disease. A further extension would not be the best use of the funds available for the development of the NHS.</p>
