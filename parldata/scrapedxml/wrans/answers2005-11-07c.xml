The guidance sets out the cases that must be referred to prosecutors for charging decisions and the circumstances in which a release on bail before charge may be appropriate in accordance with the amendments to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.1W.3/2">In April 2005, further guidance was issued to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the police on the subject of granting pre-charge bail to obtain a charging decision from a Crown prosecutor.

	<p pid="c.1W.3/3">The decision to detain or grant pre-charge bail to obtain a charging decision from a Crown prosecutor is solely for the custody officer. There is no need to consult a Crown prosecutor to authorise the granting of bail or to confirm the conditions</p>

	<p pid="c.4W.0/1">The Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)'s Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS) produces two sets of reports that warn of imminent food crises in Africa. The &quot;Foodcrops and Shortages Report&quot; from February 2005 stated that the harvest in Niger was normal against the five year average, and did not require exceptional and/or emergency assistance. The &quot;Food Supply Situation and Crop Prospects&quot; Report in April 2005 similarly omitted Niger from its list of countries facing food emergencies. Only in its June 2005 edition did the &quot;Foodcrops and Shortages Report&quot; recommend emergency assistance for Niger, and only in September 2005 did Niger feature on FAO/GIEWS' list of countries facing food crises.</p>
	<p pid="c.4W.0/2">The FEWSNET bulletin first flagged Niger as a country under &quot;Warning Status&quot; in December 2004, but it was not until June 2005 that this was upgraded to &quot;Emergency Status&quot; demanding &quot;highest priority urgent action&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.4W.0/3">DFID attended the presentation of the World Food Programme (WFP)/FAO's initial Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission (CFSAM) findings from the Sahel region in December 2004, where cereal production for the entire region was reported as average, in spite of drought and locusts, but where pockets of need were identified within all the Sahel countries. Based on the evidence, DFID judged that large scale food aid would not be required at that time.</p>
	<p pid="c.4W.0/4">DFID does not have any officials based in Niger. The London based humanitarian unit responsible for monitoring emerging crises in Africa had been monitoring the situation in the Sahel since the locust invasions of August 2004. In April 2005, the first incontrovertible evidence of a deteriorating situation was provided by Medecins Sans Frontieres. A full account of DFID's subsequent response is set out in my parliamentary written statement on the Niger food crisis made on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-11">11 October 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2005-10-11.26WS"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 26&ndash;27WS</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.9W.14/1">In comparison to domestic chickens, feral pigeons are generally unsusceptible to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Experimental studies show that while pigeons can be infected with HPAI they do not appear to excrete the virus. This suggests that pigeons are unlikely to form a reservoir of infection of virus. However, the risk cannot be completely discounted and the public is encouraged to report any unusual die-off in pigeons or any other wild birds to the DEFRA helpline (08459 33 55 77) when further advice will be provided.</p>

The list of susceptible material includes several plants which commonly grow wild in England and Wales, including <i>Chaenomeles</i> (Flowering Quince), <i>Cotoneaster</i>, <i>Crataegus</i> (Hawthorn) and <i>Sorbus</i> (Mountain Ash).</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.0/2">The first UK finding of fireblight was in Kent in 1957. It is now widespread in Wales, England and also parts of Scotland but absent from Northern Ireland. The disease can be spread by wind, rain, birds and pollinating insects, as well as on contaminated pruning tools and by the planting of infected plants which may or may not show symptoms. It is known to have spread in England along hawthorn hedges planted alongside railways, motorways and main roads. There are no pesticides currently available to treat the disease.</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.0/3">Nurseries intending to move fireblight-host material have to be registered with DEFRA and must have at least two inspections per year in order to retain their ability to trade susceptible plants within the EU.</p>

	<p pid="c.24W.3/1">Exporters of plants and plant products to non EC countries must satisfy the plant health requirements of the importing country. In many cases importing countries require consignments to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate issued by the official services in the country of origin as evidence that those requirements have been met. In the case of fireblight-susceptible host plants, where requested by an exporter and if required by the importing country, DEFRA's Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate (PHSI) will undertake inspection of the material and, if it is found to comply with the conditions of import, will issue the necessary phytosanitary certificate. This would include details of the plant genera and species.</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.3/2">In relation to movements within the EU, growers of fireblight host material are required to register with DEFRA as producers of plant material requiring a plant passport and they also have to apply to DEFRA for authorisation to issue plant passports. An element of the authorisation process is to designate a technically experienced person who is responsible for passporting and associated plant health matters on the premises. In order to retain their authorisation producers must be inspected at least twice a year by the PHSI. One of these inspections will take place during the period of growth of the plants and the other at the time of despatch of material, including a check of records and documentation. If at any time a registered plant passporter is shown to be deliberately falsifying information or contravening the passporting regulations, his authorisation to issue plant passports may be withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid="c.24W.3/3">PHSI are normally graduates and invariably have a background or qualification in horticulture or agriculture. On appointment they receive a period of intensive training, which will include plant, pest and disease identification, familiarisation with the legislation under which they will operate, plant passporting and export certification arrangements etc. On completion of this formal training they shadow experienced Inspectors for a further period of field-based training, including visits to plant passporting and/or exporting nurseries. Identification of fireblight hosts is included as part of this general training.</p>

	<p pid="c.32W.3/34">The table shows monthly average farm gate milk prices in pence per litre for the last thirteen months for the United Kingdom, and weighted annual averages for 2001 to 2004. The average prices are calculated from monthly surveys of milk purchasers conducted in England and Wales by DEFRA, in Scotland by SEERAD and in Northern Ireland by DARD. The size of the sample surveyed is estimated to account for 99 per cent. of milk production this month. The farm gate price is the average price received by producers, net of delivery charges. No deduction has been made for superlevy.</p>
	<p pid="c.32W.3/35">The University of Manchester report &quot;The Economics of Milk Production England and Wales 2002/03&quot;, commissioned by DEFRA and the Welsh Assembly Government, calculated the average weighted cost of production to be 18.33 pence per litre. However the report also found that there is a huge disparity in the costs of production and profitability between the most and least efficient dairy farmers. The 25 per cent. of farmers with the lowest cost of production were producing milk for an average 12 pence per litre less than the 25 per cent. with the highest costs. Data on production costs broken down by year are not available.</p>

	<p pid="c.33W.2/1">The National Equine Database is being established jointly between Defra and the horse industry as it will help to meet Government objectives over passports and disease surveillance and the industry's own objectives to improve its prospects by enhancing breeding. Information about pedigree and performance can be commercially valuable and, although Defra will meet its share of future running costs, the industry will need to cover its costs. Our initial research did show that some basic information is available free from other sources, as it will be from NED. A recent study commissioned jointly with the industry indicated that the combination of the quality and accessibility of the information on the database will enable its costs to be recovered from fees.</p>

	<p pid="c.38W.9/2">The Phoenix Fund was created in 2000 to stimulate enterprise in disadvantaged communities by providing business support and by improving access to finance. It was always intended to be a pump priming measure and was not designed to provide long-term or core funding for business support organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.38W.9/3">Responsibility for regional economic development and business support now lies with the Regional Development Agencies. However, the Government have introduced the Community Investment Tax Relief to enable organisations like Bolton Business Ventures to raise further finance from the private sector to lend on to small businesses.</p>

	<p pid="c.45W.8/2">Some of England's regional development agencies (RDAs) have commissioned sculptures and statues in their regions over the last five years as part of their wider efforts to regenerate deprived or run down areas, consistent with RDAs' statutory purposes set out in the RDAs Act 1998. Making the places where people live and work more attractive, can stimulate increased business investment, and community cohesion. Works of art also play a part in making business paths more attractive and assisting with inward investment and in promoting tourism and interpretation of historic areas and landscapes. RDAs play an important role in such developments, often working in partnership with business, local government and other public and voluntary organisations in order to promote the region and its economy.</p>

	<p pid="c.50W.5/2">The Government do not have funding targets for renewable energy. The Government have a target of 10 per cent. of electricity from eligible sources of renewable energy by 2010, with an aspiration to double that by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="c.50W.5/3">To support progress towards the Government's renewables target we introduced the renewables obligation (RO) in 2002. The RO requires electricity suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their electricity sales from renewable sources. The RO, together with exemption for renewables from the climate change levy, is expected to provide support to industry of around &pound;1 billion a year by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.50W.5/4">We have also allocated support of around &pound;500 million, between 2002 and 2008, for capital grants and research and development, to help develop renewable and other low carbon technologies.</p>

	<p pid="c.55W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.2/2">The move to Direct Payment and the introduction of universal banking services, which have brought banking services into many rural and urban deprived areas for the first time, have resulted in a number of benefits for individuals and the communities in which they live. Many people who were previously financially excluded in these areas now have more choice and improved local access to banking services.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.2/3">The banking industry have worked with Government to make basic bank accounts, which were specifically designed to address the needs of the financially excluded, more accessible. Since the start of universal banking in April 2003, a net total of around 1.4 million basic bank accounts have been opened&mdash;and the majority of these have the facility to withdraw cash at post office counters as well as through bank branches and ATMs. Some 20 million people are able to access their current accounts through post office branches.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.2/4">In April 2003, only 43 per cent. of DWP customers were paid directly into an account&mdash;following the move to Direct Payment and the introduction of universal banking services that figure has now increased to over 97 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.55W.5/1">Variability, or volatility, is a normal part of the working of a well-functioning commodity market. Current UK wholesale spot gas prices are determined by the price of oil and the day-to-day balance between demand and supply in the UK gas market.</p>
	<p pid="c.55W.5/2">When the market is tight small changes in demand and supply will have a bigger impact on price volatility than if the market were over-supplied. The balance of demand and supply, and thus the volatility of prices, will depend on many external factors, including the weather and the availability of storage facilities or import infrastructure on a day-to-day basis. In view of the unpredictability of many of these factors it is not possible to make accurate estimates of future price volatility.</p>

We are introducing new measures for a civil penalty regime and a tougher criminal offence for employers in the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill, currently before the House. Our strategy also involves increasing enforcement, encouraging compliance by business, and developing joint working between agencies responsible for enforcing workplace regulations.

The new measures will target both the individual and the collective responsibility of the alcohol industry through Alcohol Disorder Zones, Drinking Banning Orders, 48-hour directions to leave and powers to close premises for up to 48 hours where alcohol is persistently sold to under-18s. The Bill will build on the Licensing Act 2003, which comes into force on <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase> and expands police powers to tackle badly run premises&mdash;through more effective reviews and revocation of licences where appropriate&mdash;as well as increasing many of the penalties and fines for alcohol-related offences.</p>

Recent activities in the programme have included a series of Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaigns in which the police have clamped down on binge and under-age drinking. And we have been working closely with the alcohol industry to develop a Principles and Standards document which will help retailers and producers to prevent sales to under-age children and drunks, put an end to irresponsible drinks promotions and put in place end of evening dispersal policies to help drinkers get home safely and quickly.</p>

The panel has created a Guide to Community Engagement which is a resource for all policing practitioners, and which contains both practical and strategic advice for practitioners who want to develop or improve their approach to engagement.

	<p pid="c.85W.2/1">The race for justice project was commissioned in 2002 to identify the views of the minority ethnic communities about their perceptions of the agencies that work within the Criminal Justice System in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. It was designed to engage with black and minority ethnic communities, increase awareness, address concerns and try to increase confidence in the criminal justice system. In particular, the project has worked with newcomers to the area, producing a booklet 'Welcome to Britain' which addresses some of the main issues for newcomers to the Hampshire area.</p>

My right hon. Friends the Deputy Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer have agreed with Sir Michael that he will extend his work so that he can consider issues relating to the functions of local government and its future role, as well as, and prior to, making recommendations on local government funding. The Government have introduced into the House the Council Tax (New Valuation List for England) Bill which provides for the postponement of council tax revaluation. This will enable revaluation to take account of the Lyons Inquiry's extended work which will inform the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007.</p>

The first LOP(R), on HMS Vanguard, has been completed and the second, on HMS Victorious, began in January 2005. The total cost of the LOP(R)s programme up to the end of the last financial year, rounded to the nearest &pound;1 million is as follows.

	<p pid="c.104W.2/2">The original objection to the Yelland Farm development lodged by this Department was based on the advice of the local commander at Okehampton Training Area. However, further advice was obtained from the RAF Low Flying Policy Office, Joint Helicopter Command and HQ Army Training Estate. After these authorities had been consulted, it was confirmed that the proposed wind turbines at Yelland Farm would not prevent or restrict the RAF's or Army's ability to operate over the nearby Dartmoor and Okehampton Training Areas. On that basis, MOD withdrew its objection.</p>

	<p pid="c.108W.5/2">Building Schools for the Future is our long-term strategic programme to transform facilities for secondary pupils over 15 years, subject to future public spending decisions. We have grouped investment in annual waves. Wave 1 projects were announced in 2003 and aim to sign contracts in the financial year 2005&ndash;06. Wave 2 and 3 projects were announced in 2004 and aim to sign contracts in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 respectively. As the projects are large and involve many schools, building work can take several years after contract signature.</p>
	<p pid="c.108W.5/3">We plan to announce the next waves of investment after the coming comprehensive spending review, probably late in 2007. In the meantime, we have told each local authority when their schools may begin in the 15-year programme. On current plans, the Stroud and Cotswold area of Gloucestershire is not due to begin in the programme until waves 13 to 15, i.e. 2017 at the earliest.</p>
	<p pid="c.108W.5/4">This indicative planning information allows local authorities to look ahead strategically, discuss options with schools and communities and agree long-term education visions for schools and their buildings. By doing this, local areas will be well placed to make good use of other investment, as it becomes available, and to use the local flexibilities of the Single Capital Pot and prudential system. In this way, authorities should find that they will be able to achieve much on their critical paths to starting Building Schools for the Future.</p>
	<p pid="c.108W.5/5">We have just announced that, given Gloucestershire's position in Building Schools for the Future, it will receive around &pound;20 million investment between 2006 to 2008 to rebuild one of its worst condition secondary buildings as a school of the future. My officials will be writing to the authority about this shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.114W.5/1">The School Improvement Partner of a maintained school works under contract to the local authority that maintains the school. She or he has no powers independent of the local authority and controls no funding. Although there is a degree of central specification of the responsibilities of the School Improvement Partner, no responsibilities are taken from the local authority's remit by the introduction of the School Improvement Partner. Similarly, the Schools Commissioner will hold no powers, funding or responsibilities that are currently within the remit of local education authorities. The Schools Commissioner's role in relation to local authorities will be to support and challenge them in carrying out their new duties to promote choice, diversity and fair access; and to advise the Secretary of State on the exercise of her powers of intervention if they are failing in those duties.</p>

	<p pid="c.115W.2/2">When a school is judged, by Ofsted, to be failing the local authority is under a duty to prepare, within 10 working days, an action plan to improve the school. There are then termly visits from Ofsted to monitor the implementation of the action plan and the school's progress. Since 1998 the number of failing schools has more than halved and the average time to turn round such a school has reduced from 24 to 21 months. The Schools White Paper published last month includes proposals to ensure that school failure is remedied even more quickly. In particular, we propose to extend the range of intervention powers available to authorities and to require them to consider the full range of their powers immediately on receipt of an adverse Ofsted inspection report on a school.</p>

	<p pid="c.123W.5/1">In March 2005 the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced a &pound;115 million &quot;Boost for Modern Foreign Languages&quot;, providing support for language teaching and learning for this and the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="c.123W.5/2">Part of that funding will support new approaches for teaching and learning for 11 to 18-year-olds, including alternative qualifications to traditional GCSEs and vocational options at key stage 4 which will provide more flexibility for pupils in their studies and meet the needs of a wider range of pupils. We have expanded the list of qualifications that count towards performance table scores to include more language qualifications. We are also funding a range of projects and materials to promote languages and to develop innovative curricular models which will be show-cased to provide schools with delivery ideas and support. For example, we funded CILT, the National Centre for Languages to produce 'Languages Work', a suite of materials designed to promote the value of language learning, support take up of languages beyond key stage 3, and how language skills can enhance future employability.</p>
	<p pid="c.123W.5/3">Last September the new languages recognition scheme, the languages ladder, became available nationally. The scheme can be used by learners of all ages and is available in eight languages. The scheme differs from existing approaches to assessment in that there are separate qualifications in each language for reading, writing, listening and speaking. The scheme can provide motivation and recognition of achievement at key stage 3, thus encouraging take up at key stage 4. Finally, the scheme can support language learning at key stage 4 within a wide range of learning pathways, including vocational and work-related contexts.</p>

	<p pid="c.124W.2/1">The LSC's core administration costs have fallen steadily from 4.6 per cent. of total funding in 2001&ndash;02, to 2.5 per cent. of its planned total budget in 2005&ndash;06. The LSC's administration budget for the next two years was set out in the Secretary of State's Grant Letter issued on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-31">31 October 2005</phrase>. This Grant Letter provides the LSC with just over &pound;252 million (2.4 per cent. of planned total budget) for 2006&ndash;07 and just under &pound;240 million (2.2 per cent. of planned total budget) for 2007&ndash;08 to cover its administration costs including the cost of capital and depreciation. This reflects efficiency savings already agreed. The overall administration budget will be reassessed when the results of the consultation on the LSC's &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;, particularly its restructuring, are finalised. At this stage further savings could be released to the sector.</p>

	<p pid="c.128W.6/1">The Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are jointly implementing a national school sport strategy. The strategy is delivering an ambitious public service agreement target to increase the percentage of 5&ndash;16 year olds who spend a minimum of two hours a week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent. by 2006 and then 85 per cent. by 2008. The long-term ambition, by 2010, is to offer all children at least four hours of sport every week. In the five years to 2008 over &pound;1.5 billion is being invested (including &pound;686 million lottery funding) to implement the strategy. The 2004&ndash;05 school sport survey results found that overall, 69 per cent. of pupils in the 11,498 schools involved, were participating in at least two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week. The results were published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-02">2 September 2005</phrase> and copies have been placed in both Houses of Parliament Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="c.130W.8/1">All Skills for Life courses funded by the Learning and Skills Council for England are referenced to the National Standards for Literacy and Numeracy, which cover Entry Levels 1, 2 and 3 and Levels 1 and 2. This ensures that there is consistency in a learner's studies across the country, whatever their environment or situation. The standards are constructed to facilitate progression from one level to the next in order to promote high quality learning which naturally leads the learner through the levels and where each level sets the context for higher level work in the next. Entry Level 2 Skills for Life courses build on the work done at Entry Level 1 but broaden and raise the expected levels of achievement. For instance, in literacy the contexts are extended from &quot;forms, lists, messages, notes and records&quot; at Entry Level 1 to also include &quot;e-mails and simple narratives&quot; at Entry Level 2.</p>

	<p pid="c.130W.11/1">From April 2001 to July 2005, a confirmed 1,130,000 adults have achieved a qualification in literacy, language or numeracy and have counted towards the Skills for Life Public Service Agreement (PSA) target. However, the Department currently only has detailed and complete information on Skills for Life achievements from April 2001 until July 2004. During that period approximately 865,000 learners achieved at least one Skills for Life qualification in literacy, language or numeracy and therefore counted once towards the Skills for Life PSA target. The total number of Skills for Life achievements of these learners was approximately 1,280,000 achievements, which is an average of 1.48 per learner. Therefore, a significant number of learners will have gained two or more achievements. The specific information requested is not readily available and can be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.137W.2/3" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, pursuant to the Answer of 7th June Official Report column 452W on disability living allowance, what progress has been made in developing a new claim form for disability living allowance; and which groups are being consulted as part of this development. The Secretary of State has asked me, as Chief Executive of the Disability and Carers Service (DCS), to reply to your question.</p>
	<p pid="c.137W.2/4" class="indent">The DCS has been developing and testing different disability living allowance (DLA) claim forms since September 2003, in order to address concerns from disabled people and their representative organisations about the difficulties they were experiencing in claiming disability benefits. This has culminated in a claim form for DLA adult working age customers, currently being tested in the areas serviced by the Disability Benefits Centres at Manchester and Bootle. The effectiveness of the claim for both customers and DCS will be evaluated fully before any decisions are made about the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.137W.2/5" class="indent">The establishment of the DCS as an Agency on 1st November 2004 marked an increased focus on understanding the needs of its customers through early proactive and open consultation with customer representative organisations. Consequently, the claim form currently being tested was subject to considerable consultation and input from a wide range of customer groups through the DCS Advisory Forum (formerly the Modern Service Working Group). The Forum provides the DCS' main consultation mechanism through its membership of 14 national Voluntary and Community Sector officers, who represent customers with a wide range of disabilities. Some of the Forum members also sought input from additional organisations, whom they considered could offer valuable input.</p>

	<p pid="c.141W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning his assessment of the impact of the reduction in the number of job clubs and the effect of the use of larger contractors to manage services. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.141W.2/4" class="indent">Jobsearch help has not been provided through Jobclubs for a number of years. The service that Jobclubs used to offer is now delivered through Programme Centres, and these centres continue to play an important role in our portfolio of provision. However, in planning to make best use of reduced funding this year for our contracted provision, it was important that we gave priority to programmes helping those at greatest disadvantage including, for example, the New Deals. This does mean that, in some areas, Programme Centre contracts have not been extended or referral numbers have been cut this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.141W.2/5" class="indent">The policy of using fewer, larger, contractors to manage services is being introduced in the current Jobseeker's Allowance New Deal contracting round for contracts due to begin in April 2006. It is too early to judge the effect. However, this policy has been introduced to rationalise a contract portfolio of some several thousand contracts. It should provide better value for money in contract management terms, as well as offering contracts of a size that are a more commercially viable proposition for providers. It aims also to alleviate the burden for smaller providers by offering them the scope to work with other local partners rather than having to bid for separate small contracts.</p>

	<p pid="c.146W.5/2">In order to qualify for a Sure Start Maternity Grant (SSMG), claimants must have an award of one of the income related qualifying benefits or tax credits in respect of the date of claim. The qualifying benefits or tax credits are income support, income based jobseeker's allowance, pension credit, child tax credit at a rate higher than the family element and working tax credit that includes a disability or severe disability element. People who receive incapacity benefit qualify for an SSMG if they receive a qualifying benefit or tax credit.</p>
	<p pid="c.146W.5/3">An SSMG can be claimed at any time from the 29th week of pregnancy until three months after the birth. There will be claimants who, although they do not qualify before the baby is born, will be entitled to a qualifying benefit or tax credit following the birth and as a consequence may be entitled to receive an SSMG.</p>

An additional stage that further tightens the NOx limit for heavy duty vehicles (trucks and buses) is already in place and will come into force in 2008. The European Commission is also giving consideration to further measures that are expected to take effect from the end of this decade.

	<p pid="c.160W.12/1">The Government maintain a set of draft emergency regulations which could be made in the event of any emergency which met the thresholds set out in Part 2 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. The thresholds are that the emergency itself must be sufficiently serious, it must be necessary to take new powers, and that any new powers taken must be proportionate to the situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.160W.12/2">These draft regulations are generic, and so do not include any specific regulations which relate to an influenza pandemic. However, they do include a range of powers in relation to human health and connected matters, which could be quickly adapted to the specific requirements of a pandemic should the need arise.</p>

	<p pid="c.166W.3/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-21">21 May 2004</phrase>, the Director of Public Prosecutions issued guidance to police officers and Crown prosecutors under section 37A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The guidance sets out the cases which must be referred to prosecutors for charging decisions and the circumstances in which a release on bail before charge may be appropriate in accordance with the amendments to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Further guidance was issued in April 2005 to the CPS and the police on the use of pre-charge bail.</p>

	<p pid="c.166W.6/1">My Department set out proposals to reform the civil enforcement process in the White Paper &quot;Effective Enforcement&quot;, published March 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.166W.6/2">The introduction of our proposals, which are subject to the availability of parliamentary time for new legislation, seek, among other things, to streamline the charging order process as opposed to increasing powers. In addition, in looking to address the issue of vulnerable debtors and unscrupulous lenders, the proposals aim to tighten the licensing procedure for those involved in enforcement to tackle some of the difficulties experienced within the lending sector. My Department and other Government Departments continue to liaise closely on this.</p>
	<p pid="c.166W.6/3">While looking to protect vulnerable debtors the Government also recognise that responsible creditors who are owed money and having gained valid judgments through the courts should have the right to enforce that judgment by the most appropriate means available.</p>

	<p pid="c.173W.11/1">Ministers have received letters from hon. Members in recent months on behalf of constituents concerned about the impact on Iraqi farmers of the Coalition Provisional Authority's Order no. 81. Other than this correspondence, Ministers have received no representations on the replacement of locally grown seeds in Iraq by genetically modified seeds, imported from the US or elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="c.173W.11/2">Order 81 concerns the registration and protection of intellectual property rights in new plant varieties. The Order was the subject of consultation and co-ordination with the Iraqi Governing Council, and was consistent with the needs identified by the United Nations for the development of Iraq and its transition from a centrally planned to a market-based economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.173W.11/3">This Order has no effect on existing breeds of plants, such as those used by most Iraqi farmers. It should not therefore affect the ability of Iraqi farmers to save seeds from traditional sources. Farmers will also continue to have a choice of sources for their seed supply, saving their own seeds of traditional and unprotected varieties, or buying seeds which are subject to patent or plant variety rights protection.</p>

Friend the Foreign Secretary raised the implementation of the Ley Reguladora de Actividades Urbanisticas (LRAU) with the Spanish Foreign Minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos, in October 2004.

They have also made representations both bilaterally and in conjunction with other countries. The Valencia Autonomous Community's (VAC) own Ombudsman has criticised law 6/94. In response to lobbying, the Valencia regional government drew up a new law to replace the LRAU, the Ley Urbanistica Valenciana (LUV). While the proposed new law addresses some of the concerns expressed by interested parties, it does not give the sort of tenure guarantees and property rights that are enjoyed in other parts of Spain and other European countries: nor does it fully address many of the Ombudsman's criticisms.</p>

An update was published in September 2004, based on local development plans in 2003.

	<p pid="c.183W.3/2">Under the Housing Act 1996, local authorities have a statutory duty to provide assistance to those who are homeless, or threatened with homelessness, and a main homelessness duty (to ensure that suitable accommodation is available) is owed where the authority is satisfied that the applicant is eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and within a &quot;priority need&quot; category.</p>
	<p pid="c.183W.3/3">The priority need categories were extended in July 2002 to include all applicants aged 16 or 17. Previously the category &quot;vulnerable young persons&quot; would have included those aged 16 and 17, but these cannot be separately identified. Since that time, the authority has reported 860 applicants aged 16 or 17 and found to be owed a main homelessness duty, as follows:</p>

	<p pid="c.183W.3/16">Upon acceptance some of these applicants will have been provided with a settled housing solution immediately, while others will have been placed in some form of temporary accommodation, which could include bed and breakfast. As information reported about households in the various forms of temporary accommodation does not distinguish the applicant's age, it is not possible to provide the number 16 and 17-year-olds placed in bed and breakfast.

	<p pid="c.185W.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, through Government office for the north-east, is working with a range of bodies in Hartlepool to deal with the issues of social and affordable housing. The borough has considerable reserves of housing land, particularly brown-field land at Victoria Harbour and at Middle Warren, where a wide range of house types and prices can be accommodated.</p>
	<p pid="c.185W.2/2">The New Deal for Communities (NDC) partnership is working in west central Hartlepool to address the issue of market failure which was becoming a problem. One of the biggest challenges for the NDC is to tackle the decline in older terraced housing in the area, to make it an area where young families want to move into and where people want to stay. A plan has been put in place, approved by residents, and a resident led company, Hartlepool Revival, has been set up to put the plan into action. The company has its own legal status and is seen as the sustainable element of NDC in Hartlepool.</p>
	<p pid="c.185W.2/3">Excellent groundbreaking work was undertaken by the NDC, which involved wide participation from NDC residents and local stakeholders. This resulted in the publication of the promised Community Housing Plan in May 2003. The Community Housing Plan is the residents' and NDC's way of tackling the housing market failure that parts of the area have suffered.</p>
	<p pid="c.185W.2/4">The Community Housing Plan was developed by social regeneration consultants, in consultation with local residents, to determine the future of the 113 streets in the NDC area. This ensured community leadership of the creation of a plan which is robust enough to stand up in all necessary legal areas alongside the statutory local plan and the local authority's housing strategy. Hartlepool borough council has an active role in the management of this programme via their presence on the NDC housing sub-group. The plan will establish principles which will guide the &quot;Area Re-Modelling Project&quot; in years 3&ndash;10, including establishing areas which may be considered for possible demolition. The plan is expected to transform the NDC area upon completion.</p>

	<p pid="c.185W.5/1">The Government continue to support work to assess overall infrastructure requirements for housing growth, such as the approach taken in the Milton Keynes Prospectus and in other growth location business plans. For example, partners in Milton Keynes have estimated that the infrastructure required until 2016 to accommodate 15,000 new homes in the expansion areas of Milton Keynes will cost &pound;1.2 billion. We welcome this work and anticipate that partners in other growth locations will undertake similar infrastructure assessment exercises.</p>
	<p pid="c.185W.5/2">Assessing the infrastructure requirements for growth is a complex and evolving process due to both the detailed layout of development and new approaches in the nature of service provision affecting what is needed.

	<p pid="c.187W.0/1">My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister does not give consent to specific pathfinder projects. However, given the significance of the proposals relating to the Newcastle Breweries site, officials from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) were consulted and kept informed by the pathfinder throughout the process leading to the purchase. In order to maintain compliance with the Pathfinder's funding agreement, the land purchased will need to be redeveloped for residential or mixed use. Any profit from the disposal of the land will need to be used for regeneration activities within the pathfinder area or returned to ODPM.</p>
	<p pid="c.187W.0/2">No decisions have yet been taken by the Pathfinder on the numbers of affordable housing units or housing units for special needs that will be built on the Newcastle Breweries site. The Pathfinder will need to consider a number of factors, including the views of the community, housing market intelligence, technical surveys and detailed work on the identification of options for housing provision to secure optimum design, type, and tenure.</p>

Without prescribing solutions this enables builders to take up the benefits of renewable and other &quot;low and zero carbon&quot; technologies. In September the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced further improvements to these energy efficiency requirements that will come into effect next April and will encourage greater take-up of renewable systems.</p>

	<p pid="c.192W.0/1">A local planning authority's duty to publicise planning applications is explained in Department of Environment Circular 15/92, &quot;Publicity for Planning Applications&quot;. Within the requirements of the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995, authorities have discretion to decide what level and type of publicity would be appropriate in a particular case. The term &quot;vicinity&quot; is not defined. However, the circular does urge authorities to go beyond the minimum legal requirements when inviting local people to comment on planning applications. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects authorities to make use of their websites in this context. Authorities should also set out, in Statements of Community Involvement, their own policy on consultation about applications; for example, when and how local amenity or residents' groups should be informed.</p>

	<p pid="c.201W.2/1">Women in the age group 65 to 75 years of age will have had the opportunity to participate in the Department's breast screening programme (for women aged 50 to 64) and may continue, if they wish, to be screened after age 65. It is the Department's intention to extend the screening programme to all women in the age group 65&ndash;70, as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.201W.2/2">In March 2003, my Department's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Henrietta Campbell announced the launch of three new leaflets about breast awareness/breast screening. One of these &quot;Looking for Changes&quot; is intended for women of all ages and copies were sent to every GP and practice manager in Northern Ireland, as well as to health promotion units in all four health and social services boards. This leaflet is available in five different languages. Among other things, the leaflet encourages women to make an appointment with their GP if they become aware of any changes in their breasts. Breast cancer is rare in women aged 18&ndash;25 years old.</p>

A thorough search process was required, and the method chosen by the police as the most comprehensive and least disruptive to day to day policing was to employ a team of dedicated searchers, controlled centrally by the HET. This team, comprising of agency staff on short-term contracts, commenced work in March 2005 with a remit to search every police building of the PSNI estate. The Forensic Science Agency of Northern Ireland commenced a parallel search of its own, to complement the HET undertaking.</p>
	<p pid="c.201W.8/2">The search of all 29 PSNI district command units and HQ premises is due for completion by mid November 2005. It has been conducted in close collaboration with the setting up of the PSNI central storage facility, where all items will eventually be stored. The items recovered will be retained in Northern Ireland to facilitate the review process to be completed by the HET.</p>

	<p pid="c.205W.0/1">Carers have access to the full range of social security benefits, including carers allowance, and tax credits, depending on their individual circumstances, and to a wide range of services from their local Health and Social Services Trust, which are designed to offer practical support for their caring role. The Government are satisfied that targeting help in this way represents the best use of resources, and has no plans to introduce a pay scale for carers.</p>

The tables are based on the police district command unit in which the offender's address falls. Where numbers are small conviction rates for each DCU are not calculated but the number of prosecutions and convictions are presented, along with the overall conviction rates for each year. Due to changes in the way data is collected figures for 1999 are not directly comparable but table four shows Northern Ireland level prosecutions and convictions for that year, for the three offence categories in question. It should be noted that many offences of common assault, breach of peace and drunkenness may be brought to justice via a police caution rather than via a court prosecution.</p>

	<p pid="c.214W.2/1">The purpose of education action zones (EAZs) was to help schools in specific designated areas become a community resource providing facilities, services and support both in and beyond education. Some &pound;2 million per annum was allocated for EAZs but to date only modest funding has been provided to Education and Library Boards to assist them in developing proposals. Inter-agency support was a requirement for EAZ funding and was included in all of the proposals received. No start dates had yet been determined for EAZs. As the hon. Member will have seen from the draft Budget 2005, we are now proposing to extend these benefits to schools right across Northern Ireland, targeted initially at schools in disadvantaged areas, through the new investment in extended schools, as part of the Children's and Young People's package. We propose to roll education action zones, into this wider initiative. The Budget proposals are, however, still at draft stage, and views on them are welcome.</p>

It forms a part of a 'ladder for development' to Modern Apprenticeships and all other training development opportunities offered by the Department. The programme is open to all NIO staff, although it is not expected that those currently holding a GCSE in English and/or maths would typically require this type of support. The programme is promoted during the Induction programme and by means of information flyers. Literacy and numeracy training is also embedded in the Department's general course training programme.</p>

The programme of capital investment is planned to continue over the coming years and it is expected that this will remove further temporary classrooms from the estate.

	<p pid="c.233W.5/1">The Northern Ireland Prison Service have record of only once instance where a member of the public made representation, via electronic mail in September 2005, regarding the location of Magilligan Prison. It is known that a number of families of prisoners would favour a location nearer to major centres of population.</p>
	<p pid="c.233W.5/2">However the Service is aware of the interest in the issue, and is fully engaged with staff on the subject. Magilligan Prison has a positive relationship with the local community and the Director General of the Prison Service recently attended a meeting of Limavady Borough Council's Economic Development Committee at which a range of views were expressed. No firm decision has yet been taken on the prison's future location.</p>

	<p pid="c.243W.6/1">The time allowed for marketing authorisation of products is specified in European legislation and is the same for all types of drugs and whether approved by national licensing or by the European Commission through the European Medicines Agency's scientific committee for human medicinal products. The maximum time allowed for the evaluation of the company's data for the initial authorisation of a new product is 210 days in both cases. Variations to the initial authorisation, for example to add new uses, have to be evaluated within 90 days in both cases. The national agencies and the European agencies may also accelerate those procedure times where justified for example by urgent unmet medical needs for potentially life-saving drugs.</p>
	<p pid="c.243W.6/2">However, if one considers the needs of all European patients, approval can be faster using the European Union single procedure than a series of separate national approval procedures. That is one of the reasons why many complex new drugs using new biotechnology methods of production must use the European 'single licence' procedure. From November, all new anti-cancer drugs must also use this procedure so that they can be available to all European patients as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="c.247W.8/1">The Department does not accept the Royal College of Physician's contention that 78 per cent. of consultant physicians intend to retire early. There is often a distinct difference between the intention expressed when doctors are asked such a question and what actually happens when individual doctors reach the relevant age. The average retirement age for consultants has been relatively steady in recent years at around 63 to 64 years of age.</p>
	<p pid="c.247W.8/2">The Department has developed a range of flexible retirement options, so doctors approaching retirement can adapt their working patterns without affecting pension entitlement. By extending their working lives through flexible retirement, experienced doctors can continue to provide their important services to patients and local communities.</p>

	<p pid="c.251W.2/3" class="italic">Health Protection Agency (HPA)</p>
	<p pid="c.251W.2/4">Over the past few years the HPA and its predecessor bodies have introduced a number of measures to reduce water on its large sites at Colindale, Chilton and Porton.

	<p pid="c.255W.5/2">The consultation process carried out by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) included preparing a regulatory impact assessment (RIA) to determine the impact on industry and consumers, which was followed by a 12-week consultation period with stakeholders on the proposed regulations and the draft RIA. The impact on industry, on allowing the re- introduction of L-tryptophan into supplements, was considered and on balance was considered to be positive given that supplements containing tryptophan have been prohibited for sale since 1990. Consumer choice will also be increased without presenting an appreciable risk to health. This approach is consistent with the Cabinet Office code of practice on consultation and the code of good practice in consultations and policy appraisal.</p>
	<p pid="c.255W.5/3">The use of advisory statements was not considered appropriate due to the severity of the symptoms of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome in people taking dietary supplements containing tryptophan pre-1990, and the uncertainty relating to gaps in the scientific evidence. The United Kingdom Government's committee on toxicity (COT) decided to recommend a daily dose level of 220 milligrammes (mg) on a precautionary basis that would not present an appreciable risk to health.</p>
	<p pid="c.255W.5/4">Following the closure of the formal consultation exercise on the regulations for the use of tryptophan in foods, the COT secretariat has reviewed the data submitted by respondents. They found that there was no new evidence to that already reviewed by COT in 2004, when it reached its conclusions on the safety of tryptophan that would support a higher level of tryptophan being used in food supplements. The FSA therefore adopted the level and purity criteria recommended by COT, and this has therefore been adopted into UK legislation to reintroduce the sale of tryptophan supplements in the UK, in the interests of consumer choice and safety. We have asked COT to review its recommendation and any new information on tryptophan since June 2004, and this will be considered at the COT meeting in December. Depending on COTs advice the legislation may be amended. A summary of consultation responses and full RIA will be sent to all respondents, and made available on the FSA website.</p>
	<p pid="c.255W.5/5">Tryptophan was not considered by the expert group on vitamins and minerals (EVM) as it is not a vitamin or mineral. The EVM proposed safe upper levels (SULs) for vitamins and minerals using the well-established paradigm for setting acceptable and tolerable intake levels for chemicals in food. Where the data were not adequate to set a SUL, the EVM gave guidance on levels that would not be expected to result in adverse effects.</p>
	<p pid="c.255W.5/6">The COT uses the same paradigm in its consideration of the safety of tryptophan as a supplement. In its evaluation the COT noted significant uncertainties and decided that an uncertainty factor of 10 should be applied to derive a dose that would not be expected to be a risk to health in the general population. The limit proposed by the COT was 220 mg of tryptophan per day.</p>

	<p pid="c.266W.5/1">Control totals are used where it would be impossible to return to financial balance in a single year. The aim is to bring strategic health authorities (SHAs) as close as possible to financial balance for their local health communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.266W.5/2">The control totals are set in consultation with SHAs. Irrespective of the control totals set, SHAs carry forward deficits and surpluses to the following financial year.

Individual budgets would include a number of income streams rather than simply social care services in order to give the individual a more joined-up package of support. Individual budgets would also give the individual choice over how they receive their allocation; it does not have to be a cash allocation. Most importantly, individual budgets put people in the centre of the planning process, recognising that they are the person best placed to understand their own needs and how to meet them.</p>

The national programme for information technology, aiming to deliver a national health service care records service by 2010, will, in time, support appropriate access to patient care records by all staff involved in providing that care. Social services will only have access to patient health records with the consent of the patient concerned or where access is already permitted by law, so new legislation will not be required.</p>

We have supported legislation that strengthens the rights of carers to an assessment of their own needs as carers and involves a right to a carer's assessment.
