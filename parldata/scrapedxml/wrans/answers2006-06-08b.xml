	<p pid="b.758W.10/2">Data from DVLA's ANPR cameras are used solely by DVLA for VED enforcement. In addition, DVLA complies in all respects with the BSI code of practice on the storage of digital evidence, which covers the secure handling of data through the use of access controls and tight audit trails.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.10/3">Data from VOSA's eight mobile ANPR cameras is used solely by VOSA for intelligence gathering to enable targeted enforcement. VOSA hold 11 databases such as test certificate and O licence that are used to identify non-compliant operators. Intelligence gathered is encrypted and saved to disk then down loaded to the back office function. Access is via a decryption key held by the Intelligence officer. In addition, VOSA complies in all respects with the BSI code of practice on the storage of digital evidence, which covers the secure handling of data through the use of access controls and tight audit trails.</p>
	<p pid="b.758W.10/4">The ANPR data gathered by the ANPR cameras operated by the National Traffic Control Centre (NTCC) has two characters dropped from the number plate before being encrypted, creating a depersonalised record, which is transmitted back to the NTCC. Once this has been matched to a record from an adjacent camera or a defined period has lapsed the data is deleted. The only information being retained being the average journey time for that section at that time. No one has access to the full number plate data.</p>

The information is used for traffic flow monitoring, journey time reliability and performance monitoring of schemes such as the M42 Active Traffic Management Scheme. The HA is only given reports and depersonalised information.</p>

	<p pid="b.760W.8/1">The proposal for 'turn left on red' is not considered suitable for traffic management purposes in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.8/2">Although there are similarities between the road traffic signalling systems in the UK and abroad, there are also differences. Many other countries use fixed time signals, where the green period is based on average flows. These periods will not necessarily be proportional to the actual flow. 'Turn right (left) on red' is often used to overcome resultant delays. The majority in the UK are either vehicle actuated or connected to an Urban Traffic Control system using 'live' information. Timings are proportional to the flow and 'turn left on red' would not afford the same advantage.</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.8/3">There are also differences in junction type. Where 'turn right (left) on red' is used, for example in the United States, most junctions have good visibility between side and main road traffic. Many junctions in the UK have poor intervisibility because of existing buildings and the junction geometry. Any uncontrolled movements from the side road would involve increased risks and an increased accident potential at the junction.</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.8/4">Also, in the UK many pedestrian phases display a green figure on the 'side road' while a red is shown to the 'main road'. Allowing vehicles to turn left on red would pose increased risks to all pedestrians, especially vulnerable road users such as blind and partially sighted pedestrians, who are often given audible and/or tactile signals as an indication that all conflicting vehicular movements have stopped.</p>
	<p pid="b.760W.8/5">Studies in the mid-1970s, in six states of the USA where 'turn right on red' was introduced, showed that pedestrian and cyclist accidents increased, ranging from 48 per cent. to 123 per cent. Vulnerable groups showed the greatest increase.</p>

	<p pid="b.762W.9/1">&quot;Drugs: Guidance for Schools&quot; issued to all schools by the Department in March 2004 makes it clear that drugs have no place in schools. The guidance outlines a range of strategies, including drug testing of pupils, which schools can adopt to ensure a drug-free school. We also expect that all schools should have a drug policy available to all pupils and parents. We have made clear that where pupils are permanently excluded for supplying an illegal drug, the Secretary of State would not normally expect the governing body or the independent appeal panel to reinstate the pupil. We will also be conducting an evaluation study of drug testing in maintained schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.765W.3/1">Corruption is a serious problem in much of Africa. DFID is supporting a wide range of activities to help countries detect and take action against corruption. Some of the recent discussions I have had with African leaders and parliamentarians about corruption are outlined below.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.3/2">When I visited the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in October 2005, the main focus was to urge the Congolese Government to tackle corruption&mdash;particularly within the army pay system.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.3/3">I had frank discussions with President Kibaki of Kenya about corruption when I visited in January 2006. Since then some steps, including the removal of three senior Ministers, has taken place in response to public pressure following the release of the Githongo dossier and Goldenberg report. This is an encouraging start but Kenyans are calling for more to be done. When I met President Kibaki again recently, I stressed the importance of continued progress in the corruption investigations. I have also met several Kenyan Members of Parliament (MPs) to discuss progress on corruption and specifically the Public Accounts Committee report on the so-called Anglo-Leasing affair.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.3/4">I met President Kagame and Ministers in Rwanda in November 2005. Discussions focused on the Rwanda-UK Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which covers corruption among other issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.3/5">When visiting Tanzania in May 2006, President Kikwete and I focused discussions on corruption and growth. Following progress made by his predecessor Benjamin Mpaka, President Kikwete is determined to improve governance and tackle high-level corruption.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.3/6">I met President Museveni when I visited Uganda in May 2006. I discussed the President's commitment to tackle corruption made in his election manifesto and subsequent public statements.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.3/7">President Mwanawasa of Zambia and I met in February 2005 and emphasised the importance of continued commitment to combating corruption and continuing improvement of public financial management.</p>

	<p pid="b.766W.5/1">The World Bank's Africa Action Plan does not specifically address climate change. However, the World Bank fully recognises the severity of the impact climate change will have in Africa and is committed to helping countries address these. It is also looking at improving the ways African countries can benefit from a global shift towards cleaner energy, through carbon finance projects, for example.</p>
	<p pid="b.766W.5/2">Last year at Gleneagles the G8 asked the World Bank to lead the development of a new global investment framework to speed up the adoption of cleaner energy in developing countries to help address climate change. As part of this framework the World Bank is also developing approaches to help countries adapt to the impact of climate change. This work was discussed by governors at the World Bank's Spring Meetings in April. In my written statement to the Development Committee at the Spring Meetings I welcomed the valuable work the World Bank had done so far and stressed the need for this to be developed further by the Annual Meetings in September. I also said that helping member countries meet the challenges of climate change should be a key objective of the World Bank over the coming years. The statement is available on DFID's website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.771W.2/3">The total planned bilateral DFID assistance for 2006-07 is currently &pound;30 million, with the &pound;23.2 million balance being channelled mainly through non-Government organisations, multilateral organisations, or directly through DFID&mdash;administered projects. In many of these projects, the Government of Nepal is an important partner, even though DFID funds do not go through the Government budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.771W.2/4">No provision has been made from DFID's bilateral programme for support to the Nepali Defence Ministry.</p>

The interdepartmental Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) is a potential source of UK funding and this is currently being considered.</p>

	<p pid="b.771W.8/1">The recent political developments in Nepal offer an important new opportunity to make progress towards a lasting peace and a return to multi-party democracy. DFID is currently considering, with other donors and other UK Government Departments, how best to respond to the new situation, so that development assistance contributes effectively to peace, democracy, poverty reduction and social inclusion of marginalised groups. Early priorities are likely to include support for ceasefire monitoring; voter education and other help relating to a constituent assembly; and resources to improve access by the poor to essential services and infrastructure. In addition to DFID's bilateral programme, consideration is also being given to financial and technical support to the peace process from the interdepartmental Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP).</p>

	<p pid="b.772W.2/1">Multilateral and bilateral donors are considering how best to help Nepal make progress towards a lasting peace and a return to multi-party democracy. Donors are committed to close co-ordination among themselves and with the Government. This should ensure that aid funds and advice are well targeted; are provided in ways that are easy to use; avoid duplication; and do not place unnecessary demands on the new Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.772W.2/2">Donor assistance can help in three broad areas: direct support for the peace process (such as ceasefire monitoring); building confidence in the peace process by ensuring that poor and excluded groups see real improvements in their quality of life; and by building the capacity of state institutions to function effectively and thereby gain people's confidence and trust.</p>

	<p pid="b.773W.2/1">I spoke to Jan Egeland recently about the situation in Darfur, and he has also briefed my officials both in Sudan and at the UN in Geneva following his most recent visit. I very much share his concern about the deteriorating security situation there, which has worsened dramatically since January, with increasing levels of banditry, armed clashes and attacks on civilians and UN and NGO staff. The rising level of insecurity threatens to reverse progress made in 2005. Over the last four months alone, 250,000 people have been driven from their homes by the violence. The ability of the UN and NGOs to access the most vulnerable people is becoming a critical issue with no or very limited access to up to 650,000 people in Darfur.</p>
	<p pid="b.773W.2/2">In recent weeks we have seen encouraging steps forward with the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), and the more recent announcement from the Government of Sudan agreeing a joint African Union/United Nations Technical Assessment Mission to travel to Darfur. Stabilising security in Darfur is crucial if the DPA is to succeed. A UN force would build on the achievements already made by the African Union's Peacekeeping Mission in Darfur (AMIS).</p>

	<p pid="b.783W.8/1">The remit of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) at Porton Down is to undertake research on behalf of the UK Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.783W.8/2">DSTL participates in International Collaborative Programmes with other allied nations on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. These are conducted under signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) to ensure the free and open exchange of information between the participating nations. DSTL is not a commercial contract organisation but does accept commercial contracts where these support MOD's wider programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.783W.8/3">All research work undertaken as part of these collaborative programmes is closely aligned to supporting, complementing and enhancing the MOD research programme. This exchange of information will include research involving the use of animals. This assists the advancement of the International research programmes and prevents the duplication of research funding. The participation by DSTL in these International Collaborative initiatives means that some aspects of the research programme will receive funding through foreign Governments, or their contractors. The research involving the use of animals is only a small sub-set of the overall collaborative research programme and is not accounted for separately.</p>
	<p pid="b.783W.8/4">In conducting any animal research, DSTL fully complies with all of the legislative requirements that are placed on research organisations licensed to undertake research involving animals, under the terms of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 as administered by the Home Office. This compliance includes a full ethical review of the proposed work where the benefits of saving lives have to justify the use of animals in research. This ethical review also ensures that there is no unnecessary duplication of animal-based research.</p>
	<p pid="b.783W.8/5">DSTL submits the results of its scientific research to peer reviewed open literature publications wherever possible. It is estimated that, security concerns included, 95 per cent. of DSTL research is published in the public domain. These publication figures include research involving the use of animals. Therefore, the results of the research, the development of techniques and alternatives are available to all researchers to review, regardless of which country they work in or whether they are employed in the commercial or Government sector.</p>

We have no record as to whether these may have been held as prisoners of war during world war two.</p>

	<p pid="b.799W.0/1">The Government's response to the report was published in October 2004 and set out the measures that were in place at that time, or were being developed to address the issues raised in the recommendations. Copies of the Government's response have been placed in the House Library. Significant developments have since taken place on a number of issues relevant to the report:</p>
	<p pid="b.799W.0/2" class="indent">In March 2006, the Government published the new Climate Change Programme which sets out the UK's programme to tackle climate change domestically and to secure agreement on action to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.799W.0/3" class="indent">A new support scheme for biomass heat in the industrial, commercial and community sectors will be introduced. The scheme will be worth at least &pound;10-15 million in England over the next two years and will run for a total of 5 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.799W.0/4" class="indent">Subject to State aid approval, a second application round of the Bio-energy Infrastructure Scheme will be launched during 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.799W.0/5" class="indent">DTI's Low Carbon Buildings Programme started in April 2006 and supersedes the previous Clear Skies Initiative and Solar PV programmes. The scheme provides grants for householders, community organisations, schools, the public sector and businesses to install microgeneration technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.799W.0/6" class="indent">Following the report from the Biomass Task Force, setting out their recommendations to overcome the barriers to developing biomass heat and electricity, the Government published its response in April 2006. This accepts that energy from crops, trees and waste can make a strong contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and sets out 12 key ways to make this happen. A number of the initiatives have already begun.</p>
	<p pid="b.799W.0/7" class="indent">The 2006 revisions to the Building Regulations, together with the changes in 2002, will improve energy efficiency standards by 40 per cent. A draft Code for Sustainable Homes has been issued which sets out voluntary standards going beyond the minimum set out in the Building Regulations. The Minister for Housing has set out the Government's aim to support a long term ambitious framework for moving first to low carbon and then towards carbon neutral development.</p>

The aim is to obtain precise and verifiable information about when candidates have displayed the particular behaviours and expertise at the level required for the vacancy. There have only been two general promotion boards, in 2003 and in 2004, to fill a number of vacancies and projected vacancies in the senior civil service. Selection was also through a generic competence-based process, supported by psychometric and cognitive tests, a presentation and final panel interview.</p>

	<p pid="b.803W.2/1">During 2006, the England rural development programme will continue to be funded by EU rural development money from the European agricultural guidance and guarantee fund (EAGGF) and by transfers from Pillar 1 direct payments through voluntary modulation. Receipts from both of these funding sources will continue to be co-financed on an equal basis by the UK Exchequer and the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.803W.2/2">From <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>, a new rural development programming period will commence with slightly different rules. The EAGGF will be replaced by a new fund called the European agricultural fund for rural development (EAFRD). This will include funds transferred from the 5 per cent. compulsory modulation applied in the old EU-15 member states. Any money from this fund must be co-financed by the national exchequer. This will normally involve equal funding by the Exchequer and the EU, although new rules allow this to be set at a ratio of 45 per cent. exchequer funding to 55 per cent. EU funding for some schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.803W.2/3">The December 2005 EU budget summit agreed that from 2007, member states could decide at what level to match-fund any receipts from voluntary modulation. However, final decisions have yet to be taken about the levels of voluntary modulation and co-financing which will apply during the period 2007-13.</p>

Given the importance of the SPS to the farming community RPA has, with ministerial agreement, sought to focus as many staff as it can on that scheme. This has meant that less effort has been deployed on some other activities at particular points over the past year and has resulted in a reduction in previous performance levels on other schemes.

	<p pid="b.807W.3/1">The Agency did not recover assets equivalent to 100 per cent. of its budget for 2004-05 which was its second full year of operation. Civil recovery cases in the High Court can take over two years to complete litigation. This period is longer where respondents seek to use all their rights of appeal. The impact of legal challenges, although inevitable with new legislation, has delayed the progress of cases in the High Court.

	<p pid="b.807W.6/1">Draft regulations were submitted to the Domestic Affairs Committee prior to being laid before Parliament. A full regulatory impact assessment was completed. It was acknowledged that small organisations would probably not be able to satisfy the minimum threshold and would need to approach other organisations in order to obtain checks on their employees and incur the associated costs. However, in some cases it was concluded that the costs of using such an organisation would be lower than the administrative costs of running and maintaining a small volume Registered Body.</p>
	<p pid="b.807W.6/2">The proposed changes arose from a key recommendation of the 2002 Independent Review of the CRB and were supported by the recent Bichard Inquiry. The intention is to make the Registered Body network more professional and more experienced in the disclosure process which will allow the CRB to ensure that the network of users is proficient in the security and policies of the CRB.</p>
	<p pid="b.807W.6/3">As part of the continuous consultation process, the CRB are working with the voluntary and community sector (VCS) to resolve issues about access to the disclosure service. To this end, there are several voluntary and not-for-profit Umbrella Bodies (UBs) that serve the VCS and details of these are available on an improved web page of the CRB website. Charges by these UBs are comparatively low and in some cases, services are free to volunteers. Access to the disclosure service will be maintained by this UB network. By using voluntary or not-for-profit UBs, the cost of accessing the disclosure service will be kept to an absolute minimum for voluntary organisations and, in many cases, the charges will be less than the administrative costs associated with direct registration with the CRB.</p>
	<p pid="b.807W.6/4">The CRB will provide advice, guidance and support to organisations on the options available to access the disclosure service before their registration is cancelled due to low volume.</p>

The licensee must comply with a number of specific licence conditions, including a requirement to be supervised by a probation officer and to live only at approved addresses. Although the supervision element of the licence may be removed after a minimum of four years, the life licence remains in force for the rest of the person's life and can be revoked at any time if such action is necessary on risk grounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.810W.9/2">A total of 1,565 life licensees were under active supervision on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> and their addresses are known to the relevant probation areas. In 23 other cases where the life licence has been revoked, the life licensees are unlawfully at large pending their arrest and return to custody. The police are notified when prisoners abscond and their details are entered on the Police National Computer.</p>

	<p pid="b.813W.5/1">The Identity Cards Act 2006 does not provide for any direct access to information on the National Identity Register (NIR) for organisations, either with or without the consent of the individual. The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) intends to provide an identity verification service. This does not provide direct access to the NIR but rather it intends to verify an individual's identity in a method appropriate to the situation, ranging from an electronic card authentication to the provision of information to an organisation based on a specific request.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.5/2">The Identity Cards Act 2006 establishes a number of conditions and safeguards regarding the use of the identity verification service by organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.5/3">It is expected that most identity checks will be done with the consent of the individual. Section 12 covers the provision of information with the consent of the individual. It limits the information that may be provided to organisations as part of a verification check with consent and also allows for regulations to be made prescribing how the individual's authority and consent for the provision of information is to be given. Private sector companies will only be permitted to use identity services with the consent of the individual and thus are regulated under this section.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.5/4">Sections 13-16 cover the use of identity services in relation to the provision of public services. These sections ensure that the use of identity services by public service providers must be approved by Parliament by affirmative order and may also be subject to consultation with the users of that service before it can commence.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.5/5">Powers to provide information from the NIR without consent are strictly limited and laid out in Sections 17-21. Information may be disclosed without consent to Security and Intelligence Agencies for the purposes of carrying out their functions. The Police and the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs may also be provided with information held on the scheme but the type of information and the circumstances in which it may be provided are limited under Section 17(3) and 17(4). Furthermore, Section 18(4) limits the provision of information on when a person's record on the Register has been checked to purposes connected with the prevention and detection of serious crime alone. Under Section 17(5) and 20(1), the provision of information without consent to any other Government Department or public authority could not occur unless it had been approved by Parliament by affirmative order.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.5/6">The Act also provides for the accreditation of organisations before they can be provided with information from an individual's record from the NIR. The accreditation process will establish the business need for the information and whether their internal systems and procedures are satisfactory. The process will also establish the terms and conditions under which an organisation can use the identity services offered by IPS.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.5/7">With regard to the use of this information by organisations, there are also a number of safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.5/8">Firstly, user organisations will continue to be subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 in how they handle any information received from a verification check. Thus, the safeguards within that Act and the independent oversight of the Information Commissioner in relation to its provisions will apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.5/9">Secondly, the National Identity Scheme Commissioner (NISC) or, where appropriate, the Intelligence Services Commissioner will provide independent oversight as to how the National Identity Scheme operates and the uses to which ID cards are put. The NISC will publish a report every year, which will be laid before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.5/10">Thirdly, IPS will also reserve the right to audit any user organisation's processes to ensure they remain compliant with the terms and conditions of the use of the identity verification services.</p>
	<p pid="b.813W.5/11">Finally, Section 21 of the Identity Cards Act provides for the establishment of restrictions on how the provision of information without consent may operate, which may include stipulations that only certain ranks or postholders in an organisation are permitted to receive any information provided after a request for information from the NIR.</p>

	<p pid="b.822W.6/1">The Government of Afghanistan's National Police Reform Programme has not, up to now, reached the southern provinces and training of the National Afghan Police (ANP) in Helmand province has been slow. This has been largely due to the difficult security situation in southern Afghanistan which has hampered the International Community's efforts to provide training and follow-up support. Since the establishment of the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team in Helmand on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-01">1 May 2006</phrase>, the UK has been working closely with the provincial government and the Ministry of Interior to accelerate progress. At the beginning of this year there were around 1,700 ANP in Helmand, of varying levels of expertise. Many will need additional training. Approximately 200 additional trained ANP officers have since been redeployed from elsewhere in Afghanistan to reinforce the current force levels while new recruits are trained and equipped under the German/US police training programme. The pay and rank review currently underway will determine the final shape of the police structure in Helmand.</p>

The MHRA advises the MA holder as to the classification of recall, recipients who should be informed, wording of notifications, investigations and it reviews proposals for corrective actions. In many cases, the MHRA issues a drug alert to inform possible recipients and support action being taken by the MA holder.</p>

If there is a significant concern about potential patient harm, the MHRA may advise contact to patient level.

	<p pid="b.846W.14/1">The Department does not centrally collect data on the number of patients who underwent the wrong procedures or died due to medical errors in hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="b.846W.14/2">The Government are, however, concerned about national health service patients affected by adverse events and that is why it established the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) in July 2001 and asked it to set up a national reporting and learning system (NRLS) for patient safety incidents. This system is now in place across the NHS and all trusts have been connected and reporting to the system from late 2005. Data collected by the NPSA are based on incidents reported by NHS staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.846W.14/3">From November 2003 to the end of May 2006 there were 2,575 incidents reported as wrong or inappropriate treatment or procedure in the surgical and anaesthetic specialties. In 1,918 cases (74.5 per cent.), there was no reported harm to the patient, in 437 cases (17 per cent.) low harm, 179 cases (7 per cent.) moderate harm, 35 cases (1.4 per cent.) severe harm and in six cases (0.2 per cent.) it was reported that the patient died.</p>
	<p pid="b.846W.14/4">Data on deaths due to medical errors in acute hospitals over the last 10 years is not available. In July 2005, the NPSA published &quot;Building a memory: preventing harm, reducing risks and improving patient safety. The first report of the National Reporting and Learning System and the Patient Safety Observatory&quot;. At the time of publication, the NPSA estimated that the annual figures for NHS acute hospitals in England would be in the order of 840 patient safety incident-related deaths from 572,000 reported incidents from acute hospitals each year in England. The estimate was derived from 18 acute hospitals consistently reporting to the NPSA from October to December 2004 and was adjusted for variations in reporting, as well as deaths which had been incorrectly labelled as patient safety incidents. The estimates cover all patient safety incident- related deaths including those due to medical errors in acute hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="b.846W.14/5">The NPSA is due to publish a second report with its latest analysis of all patient safety incidents shortly.</p>

There will be some exceptional cases where an organisation needs longer to make the necessary changes, while still maintaining patient care. However, because over-spending by one organisation has to be balanced by under-spending elsewhere, we will continue to challenge and expect organisations to return to monthly balance as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.850W.14/1">Under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, there is a requirement to notify local authorities of cases of certain infectious diseases so that they can consider whether to use the measures to control disease that the Act provides. Section 11 of the Act sets out the procedure for notifying the relevant local authority of cases of cholera, plague, relapsing fever, smallpox, typhus and food poisoning. Regulations made under the Act (the Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations 1988) apply section 11 to certain other infectious diseases<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.14/2">However, statutory notification of specified infectious diseases is only one of a range of methods by which epidemiological surveillance and control of infectious diseases are carried out. HIV, sexually transmitted infections and H5N1 are not notifiable diseases<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.14/3">For HIV, local and national data are collected from several sources including reporting of diagnosed cases by clinicians and laboratories and by unlinked anonymous surveys of HIV prevalence in population sub-groups, such as genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinic attendees and injecting drug users in contact with specialist services. Similarly, for other sexually transmitted infections, there are other surveillance methods used including returns from GUM clinics of episodes of sexually transmitted infections and the national chlamydia screening programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.14/4">Making HIV and other sexually transmitted infections notifiable might raise concerns about patient confidentiality and could deter individuals at risk of infection from seeking advice, testing and specialist care.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.14/5">H5N1 infection does not readily pass from birds to humans and there is currently no evidence that this pathogen is capable of spreading from person-to-person efficiently or of sustaining such transmission. This infection can only be diagnosed by laboratory confirmation of the pathogen as the clinical illness has similarities with several other infections. H5N1 infection in birds or poultry, which comes within the definition of avian influenza, is notifiable as a disease of animals and as an animal disease that may transmit to humans. This allows measures to be put in place to reduce the risk of spread to other birds or poultry and to humans.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.14/6" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> Acute encephalitis, acute poliomyelitis, anthrax, diphtheria, dysentery (amoebic or bacillary), leprosy, leptospirosis, malaria, measles, meningitis, meningococcal septicaemia (without meningitis), mumps, ophthalmia neonatorum, paratyphoid fever, rabies, rubella, scarlet fever, tetanus, tuberculosis (where the opinion of the registered medical practitioner that the person is suffering from tuberculosis is formed from evidence not solely derived from tuberculin tests) typhoid fever, viral haemorrhagic fever, viral hepatitis, whooping cough, and yellow fever.</p>
	<p pid="b.850W.14/7" class="indent"><sup>(2 )</sup>Viral hepatitis is statutorily notifiable and can be transmitted sexually. However, apart from hepatitis B virus, sexual transmission is not the most important mode of infection.</p>

	<p pid="b.859W.2/1">When VAT was introduced in 1973, zero-rating applied to the construction and alteration of all buildings. The repair and maintenance of buildings has, however, always been standard-rated. Due to difficulties in administering the borderline between 'repairs' and 'alterations', the zero rate for alterations was largely withdrawn in 1984 by the then Government, although the zero rate for work carried out in the course of an approved alteration to a listed building was retained.</p>
	<p pid="b.859W.2/2">Under agreements with our European partners we can keep our existing zero rates of VAT but we are not able to extend them or introduce any new ones. The VAT treatment of repairs and approved alterations to listed buildings could therefore only be levelled if the Government were to withdraw the existing zero rate for approved alterations. The Government have no plans to do so.</p>
