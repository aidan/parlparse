This work was completed at 13.50 hrs. The police took the advice of the Highways Agency's maintenance contractor and decided that barrier repairs should be carried out at this time, rather than be left until later, for the safety of the travelling public. The barrier repairs were completed and the northbound lane 3 reopened by 15.10 hrs. Full running capacity on the motorway was restored in time for the afternoon/evening peak.</p>

	<p pid="b.1193W.4/1">English Heritage and Westminster council officers were consulted at all stages of the design process of the new covered walkway in Star Chamber Court, in full accordance with the DOE Circular 18/84 on listed building clearance procedure. The final design was a product of these consultations. English Heritage and Westminster council officials attended detailed briefing meetings on a regular basis at which the developing design was assessed and amendments proposed. The final design is a synthesis of this and it is not possible to attribute specific features to any particular source.</p>

	<p pid="b.1194W.2/1">Civil Contingency Reaction Forces (CCRFs) are based on the 14 TA Infantry battalions spread across the country. Each CCRF comprises a pool of around 500 personnel drawn from the Volunteer Reserve Forces, who have volunteered for the CCRF commitment in addition to their normal role. CCRF membership is dynamic and details of individual availability, including where volunteers have been deployed as part of their normal Reserve role, are not held centrally. It is, however, the case that when a CCRF member is mobilised to meet other commitments we aim to replace that individual immediately by another volunteer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1194W.2/2">There are no specific recruitment schemes in place, nor are such schemes necessary given that the pool of potential volunteers consists of existing members of the Volunteer Reserves. The future size of the CCRFs is being considered as part of a wider review of the TA.</p>
	<p pid="b.1194W.2/3">CCRFs would not be deployed in a situation which required the use of force so no question of rules of engagement would arise. Volunteers are not held at permanent readiness, although we aim to be able to deploy a CCRF within 24 hours. There are no specific criteria which would lead to a decision to mobilise a CCRF; they form part of the pool of resources upon which we could draw in the event of a request for military assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1194W.2/4">While the supporting infrastructure is based on the army's regional structure, it is not the case that a CCRF would only be mobilised to undertake operations within its &quot;home&quot; region. Consequently, all CCRFs are available to undertake operations anywhere in the UK over an extended period, including in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.1194W.2/5">No CCRF members were mobilised in response to the terrorist attacks in London on 7 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July 2005</phrase>. The civil authorities coped extremely well in the aftermath of the attacks and made no request for military assistance which would have required the sort of large scale general duties support which could be provided by a CCRF.</p>

	<p pid="b.1202W.5/1">Between the mid 1970s and mid 1990s, relative child poverty more than doubled. This Government have committed to halve child poverty by 2010&ndash;11 and to eradicate it by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/2">Macro-economic stability, active labour market policies such as the new deal, policies to make work pay such as the national minimum wage and the working tax credit, and financial support for families, have all contributed to reducing child poverty since 1998&ndash;99. On an after housing cost basis, this approach has lifted 600,000 children out of relative poverty (60 per cent. of less of contemporary median income), and 1.8 million children out of absolute poverty (60 per cent. or less of median income in 1996&ndash;97, uprated by prices), between 1998&ndash;99 and 2003&ndash;04. Since 2000&ndash;01, 300,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty and 800,000 children have been lifted out of absolute poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/3">Financial support for families has been based on the principle of progressive universalism, with support for all families and additional support for those who need it most. Child benefit provides universal support, and the Government have increased the rate of child benefit for the first child by more than 25 per cent. in real terms since 1997. The child tax credit (CTC) was introduced in April 2003, and targets additional financial support based on the needs and circumstances of the whole household. As a result of the Government's reforms to the tax and benefit system since 1997, by October 2007, in real terms, families with children will be, on average, &pound;1,550 a year better off, while those in the poorest fifth of the income distribution will be, on average, &pound;3,350 per year better off.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/4">The Government have set out its spending plans to 2007&ndash;08, including a commitment to increase the child element of CTC in line with earnings. While it is possible to model the immediate effect of further changes, there are uncertainties in projecting the numbers of children in relative low income poverty. A further increase of &pound;5 per week in the rate of child benefit would initially lift around 350,000 children out of poverty, at a cost of around &pound;3.4 billion. A further increase of &pound;500 per week in the child element of CTC would initially lift around 750,000 children out of poverty, at a cost of around &pound;3.5 billion. Increasing the rate of child benefit for all children to the rate for the first child would lift around 250,000 children out of poverty, at a cost of around &pound;1.7 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202W.5/5">The Family Resources Survey does not enable the Government to make an estimate of the cost or effect of reducing the rate of child benefit when a child reaches the age of 12. The Government have not made an estimate of the cost of eradicating child poverty by 2007&ndash;08, which would depend on the definition used, and would be subject to large uncertainties around future income growth, changes in the income distribution, and individual changes in behaviour in response to policy changes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1207W.6/1">Information is not held centrally on the benefits in all occupational pension schemes in the public sector. The Treasury is responsible for the general policy on the statutory public service pension schemes. All of these schemes provide survivor pensions for partners of scheme members where there is a legal partnership through marriage or civil registration in the case of same gender couples. Our policy is not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in provision for partners who are not married or civilly-registered to the scheme member. Any scheme may modernise its benefits to provide survivor pensions for unmarried and unregistered partners provided this improvement is introduced in a way which does not add to costs falling on the taxpayer. Of the statutory public service schemes <i>(a)</i> the 2002 section of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (premium) and the new armed forces scheme launched in 2005 have introduced provisions for unmarried and unregistered survivor pensions, as have the parliamentary pension scheme and the scheme for UK Members of the European Parliament with effect from 2004; and <i>(b)</i> none of the other public service schemes have yet done so. Many of the other schemes have proposals to do so as part of the restructuring of benefits associated with increases to normal pension ages and other changes which will overall reduce taxpayer costs, including the schemes for local government, the NHS, teachers, police, and firefighters.</p>

	<p pid="b.1217W.5/2">Within this framework, the criteria used by DFID to assess the effectiveness of projects in support of better governance are defined by the scope of each individual project. Examples of criteria of effectiveness for governance projects might include the number of eligible citizens able to register and vote at elections, the election of representatives of disadvantaged or marginalised communities to decision-making arenas such as local government councils, or the establishment of channels for monitoring citizen satisfaction with key service sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217W.5/3">More generally, DFID uses the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria to evaluate its own programmes. The criteria are: relevance; efficiency; effectiveness; impact; and sustainability:</p>

	<p pid="b.1218W.2/1">DFID, along with all Government Departments, is committed to see reform of developed country agriculture policies, including trade policies, which distort international markets, and which if reformed, could deliver real development gains to the world's poorest countries. In the assistance we provide to developing countries, we do not start from the premise that their agriculture trade policies specifically must be reformed. The assistance that DFID provides to developing countries under our trade related capacity building programme is designed to support their own priorities and development needs, as identified by the countries themselves, and falls into three broad categories; helping developing countries to determine their own trade policies; helping them to negotiate their priorities in both bilateral and multilateral fora; and helping them to capture the potential benefits from trade. Since 1998, we have committed &pound;181 million to trade related capacity building, and are set to increase this Aid for Trade to &pound;100 million per annum by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.1218W.2/2">For the least developed countries (LDCs), we contribute to the reform of their trade policies, including agricultural trade policies, through our support to the integrated framework (IF). The IF is an international initiative which assists LDCs to take the steps necessary to improve their trading performance in a manner which supports economic growth and poverty reduction. A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) is carried out for each LDC participating in the IF which identifies constraints to the trading performance of LDCs, policies, infrastructure, institutional and private sector capacity. It also provides technical advice on how to address these constraints. Agriculture trade policies will be considered in participating LDCs with agricultural export sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1218W.2/3">The IF is active in over 30 countries, 21 of them in Sub Saharan Africa including Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mali, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Zambia. DFID has contributed a total of &pound;4.5 million to the IF since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.1218W.2/4">DFID has also contributed &pound;850,000 to the Standards and Trade Development Facility (STDF), a multi-donor funded programme that assists developing countries in improving their expertise and capacity to analyse and implement international sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1218W.2/5">DFID has recently published an agriculture policy paper. This identifies the need to improve the benefits of agricultural trade to poor people and poor countries and reaffirms DFID's strong commitment to agriculture, which we recognise as fundamental to poverty reduction and to the livelihoods of poor people.</p>

	<p pid="b.1219W.2/1">DFID has not made any recent assessment of the humanitarian situation in Fallujah.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.2/2">Humanitarian assistance and reconstruction in Fallujah is the responsibility of the Iraqi Government, with support from the United States. Significant progress has been made since military operations concluded, and further projects are under way to improve basic services. To date, Fallujah has received US$100 million for reconstruction, and US$103 million in housing compensation. The Iraqi Prime Minister recently approved a further US$75 million housing compensation, so that Fallujah will have received a total of $281 million. Power and water is currently estimated to be available to over 80 per cent. of the population as a rule; however, a recent fire at an electricity substation has restricted these services. Prior to April 2004, the population of Fallujah was estimated at 300,000; today the population is around 239,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1219W.2/3">Statistics on birth rate, death rate and infant mortality in Fallujah since 1990 are unavailable. For Iraq as a whole, this data can be estimated from surveys, However, when information is required at a more local level, the only source of information in most developing countries, including Iraq, is a population census. The most recent census, conducted in 1997, only contains details at the Governorate or regional level. Town-level estimates of birth and death rates are unlikely to have been calculated at any stage.</p>

	<p pid="b.1220W.2/1">As in any conflict or humanitarian emergency, child health has suffered hugely in Sudan. In 2004, UNICEF's figures showed that out of 1,000 live births in Sudan, an estimated 91 would die before the age of five. By way of comparison, the UK's under five mortality rate is six out of 1,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220W.2/2">This financial year, DFID has allocated &pound;112.75 million for our work in Sudan. We aim to contribute towards the most critical needs in Sudan, especially in Darfur, Southern Sudan and the East. Of this, we channelled &pound;45 million through the UN Work plan and &pound;25 million via NGOs for a wide range of assistance including water and sanitation, emergency health care, shelter, food and nutrition; all of which help to reduce mortality.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220W.2/3">For example, DFID currently funds a project which provides bed nets to women and children in Southern Sudan where malaria, a large contributor to infant mortality, is endemic. This follows similar programmes in Kenya and Gambia where it has been found that impregnated bed nets can reduce overall mortality rates by up to 30 per cent. in malaria endemic areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220W.2/4">Although only a snapshot of the situation over the last six months, the recent World Health Organisation (WHO) mortality survey in Darfur revealed that death rates have dropped by two thirds in some areas. This points to the effectiveness of the responses in stabilising and improving the humanitarian situation in Darfur. With raising levels of insecurity, however, this remains extremely fragile.</p>

	<p pid="b.1220W.5/1">DFID is working with developing country governments and their revenue authorities to improve collection of taxes and customs duties. Increasing tax revenue will increase funding available for essential services such as primary education and primary healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220W.5/2">DFID has not made an assessment of the impact of tax evasion and tax avoidance on developing countries' finances. The high number of businesses not formally registered in many countries is a significant constraint on collecting taxes. DFID is undertaking a study looking at the impact of tax on business which will, among other matters, examine the impact on incentives for businesses to remain in the informal sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220W.5/3">80 per cent. of taxes in developing countries are collected from formal companies, through VAT, corporate taxes, and taxes on labour. In contrast, the collection of personal tax is very small, so the potential for tax avoidance and evasion is less significant in terms of proportion of tax revenue from individuals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220W.5/4">Through work on the investment and regulatory climate facing the private sector, and on building capacity through training in inland revenue and customs offices, DFID is contributing to reducing the avoidance and evasion of taxes in developing countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.1221W.2/1">A preliminary analysis of the barrier's route, published by the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in March 2005, identified that some 142,640 acres (10 per cent.) of West Bank land will lie between the completed barrier and the Green Line. This is some of the most fertile land in the West Bank and is currently home to 49,400 Palestinians. Where the Barrier has been constructed, Palestinians face economic hardship from being restricted from or not being able to reach their land to harvest crops, graze animals or earn a living. Residents have also been cut off from schools, universities and specialized medical care by the constructed Barrier.</p>

	<p pid="b.1224W.5/1">The Aimhigher area studies are being carried out as part of strand 3 of the national Aimhigher evaluation. While we know which areas were shortlisted for interview, we do not know which four areas were actually interviewed by independent contractors EKOS for this forthcoming report, as all individuals and areas were guaranteed anonymity as part of the interview process. This was to ensure that the answers provided reflected the true opinions of the respondent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.5/2">The main objective of the area selection process was to identify a broad range of Aimhigher Partnership areas which are reflective of the various types of Aimhigher activity undertaken throughout the country. Rurality was not one of the formal selection criteria of the initial shortlisting process, but a spread of areas with regard to the level of rurality or urbanisation was ensured.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.5/3">The contractors have informed us that all districts within the rural area selected are formally classified as rural in the ODPM user guide.</p>

	<p pid="b.1224W.8/1">Since September 2001, all teachers appointed in Further Education colleges have been required by law to obtain the Further Education Teachers' Certificate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.8/2">From September 2007, all new teachers within the 'whole' of the publicly funded FE learning and skills sector will be expected to undertake the new teaching requirement, which is to obtain Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills status and a full Licence to Practise. This is set out in the Government's November 2004 reform document &quot;Equipping our Teachers for the Future: Reforming Initial Teacher Training for the Learning and Skills Sector&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.8/3">Higher Education teaching staff are not within the scope of the current and future regulations referred to above for FE. But, from 2006, it is expected that all new teaching staff in Higher Education will obtain a relevant teaching qualification accredited against national professional standards for teaching in Higher Education.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.8/4">The Government expects to spend a total of approximately &pound;18 million on incentives to recruit and retain FE teachers in 2005/06 and a similar amount in 2006/07. Three schemes available to eligible college teachers are Teacher Training Bursaries, Golden Hellos, and Key Worker Living. There are no age limits on these incentives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1224W.8/5">The Department has also funded, through the Higher Education Funding Council for England, a Golden Hello programme to encourage new entrants into teaching shortage subjects within Higher Education, totalling &pound;20 million from 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-01-17b.43045.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-01-17b.1227W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1849" speakername="Beverley Hughes" colnum="1227W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060117/text/60117w15.htm#60117w15.html_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.1227W.5/1">The Government have invested well over &pound;17 billion on early years and childcare services since 1997 as part of an unprecedented expansion of provision for young children and families. The 2005 Foundation Stage Profile results for this local authority demonstrate that generally children are achieving good levels of development by the end of the Foundation Stage. Nonetheless, we want to continue to improve outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1227W.5/2">The Ten Year Childcare Strategy sets out ambitious plans to create a sustainable framework for high quality services for children and families. To support this, the Childcare Bill 2005 will take forward, and give statutory force to key commitments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1227W.5/3">To raise the quality of early education the Bill provides for a new duty on local authorities to improve the outcomes of all children under 5, and close the gaps between groups with the poorest outcomes and children more generally, by ensuring early years services are integrated and accessible. The Bill also provides for a reformed and simplified regulatory framework for early years and childcare to reduce bureaucracy and raise quality.</p>
	<p pid="b.1227W.5/4">Local authorities receive support on early education through the Foundation Stage strand of the Primary National Strategy (PNS). That support includes disseminating effective practice; supporting the transition from Foundation Stage to Key Stage 1; supporting integrated provision; ICT development in the early years; working with parents as partners; and helping to embed the Foundation Stage Profile.</p>
	<p pid="b.1227W.5/5">All local authorities now have access to Key Elements of Effective Practice (KEEP), guidance developed through sector wide consultation by the Foundation Stage strand of the PNS. KEEP represents an agreed view across the sector about the knowledge; skills, understanding and attitudes practitioners need to effectively support young children's learning and thereby raise quality.</p>
	<p pid="b.1227W.5/6">We have committed &pound;790 million over 2005&ndash;08 to support the development of extended services in or through schools which includes after school activities. &pound;110 million of this was allocated in 2005&ndash;06 and Lancashire local authority received &pound;1,824,687. We are unable to break this information down to parliamentary constituency level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1227W.5/7">Of the &pound;680 million to be allocated across 2006&ndash;08, &pound;250 million will go direct to schools through the School Standards Grant and the remaining &pound;430 million will be distributed to local authorities through the Standards Fund and the General Sure Start Grant. Of this Lancashire local authority will receive &pound;3,531,061 in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;4,515,291 in 2007&ndash;08. The funding is to 'kick start' extended services and can be used flexibly, for example, to support the development of childcare including the training of childcare workers. Many schools will choose to develop services in partnership with existing local private or voluntary sector providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1227W.5/8">We are also funding the National Remodelling Team (NRT), Continyou and 4Children to support local authorities and schools nationally as they implement extended services. This support includes guidance on developing and sustaining childcare and working with existing voluntary and private providers to improve the delivery of after school childcare.</p>

Medical students on four year fast track courses do not pay tuition fee contributions, except in their first year, because the Department of Health pays the fees in years 2 to 4.

	<p pid="b.1234W.3/1">My Department is committed to helping people, including lone parents, gain the skills to help them into employment. Lone parents are identified as a priority disadvantaged group for the LSC, and FE colleges also provide financial assistance towards childcare costs from ring-fenced Learner Support Funds. The Government's Skills Strategy is focused on improving the employability of all adults with low skills, including lone parents. Many lone parents lack qualifications at or above level 2, are therefore a priority for support; including Information, Advice and Guidance and free tuition from 2006&ndash;07 for a first full Level 2 qualification.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234W.3/2">DfES also has specific strategies to help teenage parents into learning. For example, through the Care to Learn programme, &pound;22 million is being made available in 2005&ndash;06 to provide help with childcare costs for an estimated 4,700 young parents; and those aged 16 and 17 and caring for their child and in learning also receive the education maintenance allowance maximum of &pound;30 per week, plus attendance and completion bonuses.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234W.3/3">In addition, my Department works with Jobcentre Plus to support the new deal for lone parents which provides a package of advice and support to help and encourage lone parents not in work to improve their employment opportunities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1235W.0/2">From 2006/07 statutory fee support for part-time students with the lowest incomes will increase by more than a quarter, with 85,000 expected to receive fee support (approximately a third of eligible part-time undergraduate students).</p>
	<p pid="b.1235W.0/3">The estimated cost of the new statutory part-time fee support package for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 is approximately &pound;40 million per year.

Institutions will be able to use this resource as an additional fee support on top of the grant or to increase help to students facing financial hardship.</p>
	<p pid="b.1235W.0/5">Funding for 2008&ndash;09 will be considered as part of the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

We have not made projections for students studying at less than 50 per cent. and have not made estimates of extending eligibility for statutory fee support below 50 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1235W.6/23">There are several possible reasons for the rise in bankruptcy figures. Media coverage of the issue of student loan borrowers declaring themselves bankrupt during the passage of the Enterprise Act 2002 may have contributed to the rise in bankruptcies in 2003 and 2004. In addition, one of the effects of the Enterprise Act itself was to reduce the period of discharge from bankruptcy from three years to one. As a result provisions were included in the Higher Education Act 2004 to prevent student loans being written off on discharge from bankruptcy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1235W.6/24">Bankrupt student loan borrowers, though, continue to benefit from the same non-commercial terms as other borrowers, including income thresholds and repayment in line with income.

However, in 2004 the Department made regulations that require lenders to give consumers clear information about the key features of credit products before and at the time the agreement is made, including the way in which interest is treated and on default charges.

	<p pid="b.1251W.8/1">I have no plans to introduce an interest rate ceiling in the United Kingdom. In the light of research, published by the Department in August 2004, the Government are not convinced that legislating for interest rate ceilings would help consumers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1251W.8/2">Rate ceilings could cause lenders to exit parts of the market and reduce the supply of certain credit products.

The regulatory impact assessment for the Bill, which was published in October 2005, gives an initial cost estimate of &pound;29.6&mdash;&pound;59.4 million in the first year of implementation.

	<p pid="b.1262W.2/15">I have set targets for this year to ensure that no-one is waiting more than 12 months for in-patient or day case treatment by March 2006, with shorter waiting times for cardiac surgery (six months), cataract surgery (six months), and major joint replacement (nine months). This is just a first step, and waiting times must be further reduced over the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1262W.2/16">In bringing about these improvements, I have introduced an Alternative Offer Scheme whereby patients will be made an offer of treatment by an alternative provider, including outside Northern Ireland where necessary. While every effort is made to treat people at their local hospital, where this is not possible I believe it is more important to get people the treatment they require and end the anxiety and frustration caused by long waiting times.</p>

	<p pid="b.1268W.2/1">Every effort is made to handle all correspondence effectively and efficiently. All correspondence from hon. Members and Peers is handled in accordance with the principles set out in 'Handling Correspondence from Members of Parliament, Members of the House of Lords, MEPs and Members of Devolved Assemblies: Guidance for Departments'. The same principles apply when handling correspondence from members of the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.2/2">The department aims to respond to correspondence from the public within 20 working days. The Home Office responded to 92 per cent. of 9,788 items of centrally received public correspondence received in the period June to September of this year within target. Not all correspondence received from the public is tracked, for example correspondence relating to casework is not monitored.</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.2/3">A number of initiatives are in place to encourage improved correspondence performance:</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.2/4" class="indent">the development of factsheets</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.2/5" class="indent">promotion of the use of centralised drafting facilities</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.2/6" class="indent">forums for the sharing of good practice</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.2/7" class="indent">relevant training is available in subjects including the use of Plain English</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.2/8" class="indent">Management information is gathered across the group and used to monitor performance and focus attention on areas where improvements are required.</p>
	<p pid="b.1268W.2/9">The computerised correspondence tracking system has now been operational since 2003. The department has reviewed processes for the handling of correspondence and introduced measures that mean cases reach the appropriate drafting officer promptly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1270W.9/1">There is a fundamental difference between someone who rents out a room in their own home and someone who provides a bed and breakfast service to the general public.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270W.9/2">When a person rents a room in a house the arrangement is usually of a long-term nature and involves the paying of rent on a weekly or monthly basis. The person renting the room becomes a tenant and the house becomes their home, As a tenant they are entitled to certain legal rights of occupancy and it will be classed as their residence for the purposes of, for example, the census and electoral register. Such arrangements may involve a close relationship between the landlord and tenant. For example, they may include sharing washing and cooking facilities as well as other communal areas in the house. We believe it is right that when someone offers to take someone into their home on this basis that they should be allowed to discriminate on who they accept as tenants. That is why we have provided an exemption for the letting out of rooms in small dwellings at clause 48 of the Equality Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270W.9/3">The situation with bed and breakfast accommodation is different. This involves a service that is provided to the general public on a commercial basis. People often stay in bed and breakfast accommodation for only a brief period of time and the service is often paid for on a daily basis. The person staying in such accommodation does not become a tenant and has no legal rights of occupancy. We do not believe that there is any justification for an owner of a bed and breakfast to discriminate on the grounds of religion or belief in the way they provide their services. Clause 46 of the Equality Bill would not make it unlawful to provide a service which reflected the religious beliefs of the owner, for example, to offer a Christian bed and breakfast service where grace was said at mealtimes or where rooms included objects associated with the Christian faith.</p>

These will be levied by the Courts on conviction in the usual way.</p>

Initially the lead will be achieved by a dedicated Family Support Project which will be created in areas where they are needed. These projects assign a key worker to each family who coordinates the range of services and agencies that are involved with the household. Over time the effective approaches from these projects need to be mainstreamed and a local body (such as the crime and disorder reduction partnership) made clearly accountable for leading the local response to the most challenging households.</p>

	<p pid="b.1277W.5/1">It is an operational matter for the chief constable of each area to decide how he or she wishes to deploy the available resources to best serve their communities. However in doing so chief constables must take account of nationally set targets on reduction of crime and service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277W.5/2">We are introducing national standards setting out the quality of service which members of the public can expect whenever they have contact with the police. Public satisfaction with the police has now become a part of how police performance is measured.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277W.5/3">We will give individuals and communities a voice in determining local policing priorities, engage communities in finding solutions to problems, and, where people are dissatisfied with the response to persistent problems, they will be able to secure a response from councils and the police. We want people to know who their local police officers are, and how to contact them. I have also pointed to the fact that every area will have a dedicated neighbourhood policing team by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277W.5/4">It is also the case that some resources are allocated directly to the local level, for example the BCU Fund, worth &pound;50 million in 2005&ndash;06. This is aimed at BCU Commanders and is intended to help the police play a full and active role in the delivery of crime and disorder reduction partnership strategies. BCU Commanders may spend the money on a wide range of crime and disorder interventions, including target hardening activity focusing on repeat victims, tackling antisocial behaviour through interventions such as pub watch schemes, youth inclusion work including support programmes for young people and CCTV. The interventions might also include anti-drugs work.</p>

	<p pid="b.1280W.5/1">Re-offending rates, which are measured through convictions, are only currently available for England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.1280W.5/2">The most recent re-offending data for adults were published in 'Re-offending of adults: results from the 2002 cohort' which is available through the Home Office's website (<a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/index.htm">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/ index.htm</a>). The report shows the proportion of offenders who re-offended within two years and were subsequently convicted. The conviction for the offence is counted even if it occurred beyond the two year follow-up period. Results are given for 2000 and 2002.</p>
	<p pid="b.1280W.5/3">Reconviction data for 1997 through 2000 were published in 'Prison statistics England and Wales 2002' and data for 2001 were published in 'Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2003'. Both of these are publications are available on the Home Office website. These series count only those convictions that were secured within the two year follow-up period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1280W.5/4">Reconviction rates should be used with caution as a number of different factors can influence them. Reconviction rates can be adjusted to take account of the changing characteristics of offenders and these adjusted rates are published on the Home Office's website. The most recent data show that there has been a reduction in re-offending for all offenders of 0.2 per cent. against the 2000 baseline. The Home Office Public Service Agreement target is to reduce re-offending by 5 per cent. by 2006.</p>

If a breach of the order is proved and the original offence was committed on or after <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase> the court must either make the requirements of the order more onerous or re-sentence.

As part of the Government's Prolific and other Priority Offenders programme, Southend Youth Offending Team, in partnership with other agencies, is currently targeting 20 young offenders who have been identified as being most at risk of becoming future prolific offenders. The focus is on working intensively with these young offenders to address all the risks associated with their re-offending through a multi-agency response.</p>

	<p pid="b.1285W.11/1">While core IT equipment is centrally provided, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) operates a devolved system of budgeting under which directorates and overseas posts have the freedom to buy a range of IT and other equipment to support their work. Laptop computers, in particular, are frequently bought from such devolved budgets and no central figures exist for the numbers used within the FCO. To obtain this information would incur disproportionate costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1285W.11/2">Since 2003, officially supplied mobile telephones for use by the FCO in the UK are obtained under the central Government GTM contract owned by the Office of Government Commerce. Records available show that in the financial year 2004&ndash;05 the Department bought 269 mobile phones and 18 &quot;Blackberries&quot; at the prices specified under that contract. Prior to 2003, mobile phones were obtained under a variety of contracts, but there was generally no charge for the equipment supplied. Responsibility for contracts for mobile phones used by staff overseas is devolved to our overseas missions and to obtain the relevant figures would incur disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1288W.8/1">In accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC (the &quot;Comitology decision&quot;), the Commission publishes an annual report on the workings of committees operating in accordance with arrangements set out in that decision. The report for 2004 (reference 14850/05, COM(2005)554) was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-11">11 November 2005</phrase> and was deposited in Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase> in accordance with the arrangements for the scrutiny of EU documents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1288W.8/2">We estimate that there have been nearly 5,000 working group meetings during the UK's presidency of the EU, many of which relate exclusively to reserved matters. We do not have figures for earlier periods and it would incur disproportionate cost to attempt to quantify how many have been held since <phrase class="date" code="1999-07-01">1 July 1999</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1288W.8/3">The Scottish Executive do not keep records of attendance at working group or committee level, although where the subject matter of such groups is of sufficient relevance to the Scottish Executive then officials from either the Scottish Executive's EU Office in Brussels or visiting officials from Scotland will attend. Attendance is at the discretion of lead departments, the Scottish Executive being consulted where the matter is of devolved interest.</p>

Documents subject to scrutiny by the European Scrutiny Committee are defined by the Committee's Standing Order, SO 143, and the vast majority are publicly available texts. In a very small number of cases, for example, negotiating mandates with third parties, the documents are classed as restricted. In these cases, the Government makes unclassified summaries of the decisions available to the European Scrutiny Committee and provides a full explanatory memorandum at the concluding stage.</p>

	<p pid="b.1289W.5/1">There are periods during the year when the Council of Ministers meets but when Parliament is in recess. However, the Government works closely with the European Scrutiny Committee so that business is planned in a way which limits the occasions when legislation is agreed before the Committee has completed its scrutiny. There are, however, occasions when this is not possible. In the years since figures have been available, there were 20 occasions in 2003, and five in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1289W.5/2">Parliamentary figures show that in 2005 there were 68 occasions when the Council adopted uncleared proposals when the House was in recess. Figures for 2005 included 51 occasions when there were overrides when the House was in dissolution, and 17 occasions during summer recess. Final confirmed figures for the second half of the year will be provided by the Government to the European Scrutiny Committee in line with the commitment to provide twice-yearly reports on scrutiny overrides.</p>

	<p pid="b.1292W.2/16">Patient counts:</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.2/17">Patient counts are based on the hospital episode statistics unique patient identifier (HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.2/18">Data Quality:</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.2/19">Hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Health and Social Care Information Centre liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.2/20">Ungrossed data:</p>
	<p pid="b.1292W.2/21">Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).</p>

	<p pid="b.1302W.8/1">We have invited manufacturers to tender for a contract to supply pandemic flu vaccine once the pandemic strain is known. The United Kingdom will need approximately 120 million doses to be available as soon as possible. This proposal to purchase in advance the capacity needed to make pandemic flu vaccine will make sure that an effective vaccine is available for use in the UK as quickly as possible after a flu pandemic starts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302W.8/2">We are finalising a contract for the purchase of two to three million doses of vaccine against the H5N1 strain currently circulating in South East Asia and other areas. This vaccine can be used for research and for possible use for healthcare workers in an emergency, and may provide some limited protection against a pandemic emerging from that source. We hope to award this contract shortly and should receive some stocks in the next few months. Award of these contracts will provide manufacturers with resource to develop vaccines and increase production capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302W.8/3">We have already met with several manufacturers to discuss a range of vaccine production technologies, in addition to the standard egg based technology, such as DNA and cell-culture vaccines which may allow production capacity to be increased.</p>

	<p pid="b.1308W.0/1">The Department funded an evaluation of the national health service stop smoking services in England. The evaluation included an analysis of how well the services were doing in enabling access to the services of smokers from hard-to-reach groups. Results from the evaluation show that the NHS stop smoking services in England are successfully reaching smokers living in the most disadvantaged areas. The evaluation was published in a special supplement of the journal, &quot;Addiction&quot; in April 2005. A copy is available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1308W.0/2">The Department has also asked the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to look at two areas of smoking cessation: the first is for brief interventions and referral, the second is for optimal provision of services for smokers. The scopes for these two pieces of work are available on NICE'S website. In both cases the scopes place particular emphasis on looking at groups where smoking rates are high including manual working groups, pregnant women, low income/lone parents and homeless people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1308W.0/3">The Department ran a major marketing campaign during 2005 to raise awareness of local NHS stop smoking services. This campaign included television, press, radio and ambient advertising. As with all tobacco education campaigns, the campaign had a strong focus on the routine and manual audience. In February 2006, a new major campaign, promoting local NHS stop smoking services will be launched. This will again focus on the routine and manual group audience.</p>
	<p pid="b.1308W.0/4">To build on the continued good progress of the NHS stop smoking services in reaching and exceeding previous targets for helping smokers to quit, the Department set from April 2003 a more demanding national target of helping 800,000 smokers to quit by March 2006. To help meet this increased target, the services have expanded substantially, supported by extra investment of &pound;138 million over the three years. The table shows the substantial and continued increase in capacity in NHS stop smoking services.</p>

In particular 18 weeks does not replace other waiting times targets or standards where these are tighter than 18 weeks, for example, rapid access chest pain clinics. There will be other mechanisms to reduce the patient pathway in areas not included in 18 weeks, as outlined in the NHS improvement plan, and the 18 weeks maximum wait may be extended to other areas in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.1314W.0/1">Earlier this year, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister published our future strategy on homelessness &quot;Sustainable Communities: settled homes; changing lives&quot;. The strategy contains our commitment to continue working to ensure that the needs of rural communities are met.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314W.0/2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will continue to support all local authorities with additional resources to help them implement requirements of the Homelessness Act and tackle and prevent homelessness in their area. Rural authorities have received around &pound;7 million in each year since 2003&ndash;04 and as confirmed last month over &pound;7.5 million has been allocated to rural authorities for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. In addition, the Homelessness and Housing Support Directorate in ODPM has appointed a specialist adviser from a local authority who is tasked specifically with promoting good practice in tackling homelessness in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314W.0/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will continue to promote approaches that work in a rural context, where access to affordable housing can be more limited, where remoteness can act as a barrier to accessing relevant services and where there may be less developed partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314W.0/4">Through regional workshops and training the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will help the preparation of sub-regional homelessness strategies that link into the Regional Housing and county Supporting People strategies, and draw on the strengths of the Local Strategic Partnerships, to tackle the causes of homelessness in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314W.0/5">The number of households accepted as owed a main homelessness duty in rural authorities during 2004&ndash;05 fell by 6 per cent. compared with 2003&ndash;04.</p>

	<p pid="b.1315W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1315W.5/2">The Property Misdescriptions Act 1991 makes it a criminal offence to make false or misleading statements about specified aspects of land (which includes buildings) offered for sale by those in the estate agency or property development business. The categories of information which fall into those controls include the existence or nature of any planning permission or proposals for development, construction or change of use. There is no general requirement to disclose information, but where information is given it must be accurate and must not be misleading.</p>
	<p pid="b.1315W.5/3">Trading Standards Officers can, where they have reasonable cause to suspect that an offence has been committed, require the production of books, documents or hard copy of information held on computers and can take copies of them. Where they have reasonable grounds to believe that an offence has been committed they can seize and retain such material. On summary conviction, the penalty under the Act is a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum (currently &pound;5,000). For conviction on indictment, e.g. before a Crown court, this is an unlimited fine. These provisions follow the standard pattern for legislation of this kind.</p>

	<p pid="b.1318W.5/1">Since 2003, the local government ombudsman has issued two formal public reports setting out findings of maladministration. The local government ombudsman's summaries are set out as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.1318W.5/2" class="italic">1. North East Lincolnshire council (03/C604) social services for children (report issued <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-11">11 March 2004</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="b.1318W.5/3">'John Swift' (not his real name for legal reasons) is a young person whose care is the responsibility of the council. He complains about the standard of care he received in a foster placement and that the council failed to consider his complaints properly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1318W.5/4">The ombudsman found that there was inadequate preparation before and during the early part of the John's placement with his foster parents. She was also critical of the council's failure to have guidance for foster carers about whether and when it might be appropriate to ask fostered young people to be out of the house when the foster carer was not present.</p>
	<p pid="b.1318W.5/5">The Ombudsman recommended that the council should:</p>
	<p pid="b.1318W.5/6" class="indent">Pay John &pound;100 in compensation;</p>
	<p pid="b.1318W.5/7" class="indent">Complete its current review of the issue of requiring young people in foster care to vacate the foster home in certain circumstances and issue guidance to foster parents on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.1318W.5/8">The council has agreed, and the ombudsman considers this will remedy the injustice caused by the maladministration identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.1318W.5/9" class="italic">2. North East Lincolnshire council (03/C/4267 and 7084) public rights of way (report issued <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-15">15 December 2005</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="b.1318W.5/10">Mr Jennings' and 'Mr Crosby' (not their real names) complained about the obstruction of a footpath near their homes. The footpath had been inaccessible for its whole length for a number of years despite complaints and representations from a number of people and the Ramblers Association. The ombudsman had been critical of Humberside county council, by public report, for its failure to take action to reopen this footpath.</p>
	<p pid="b.1318W.5/11">This problem was one inherited by the council from its predecessor, Humberside county council. The council was aware of this problem at the time, and indeed considered the matter at committee level in October 1996. Nothing more was done though until 2005 when another committee took action which is likely to re-establish this footpath.</p>
	<p pid="b.1318W.5/12">The ombudsman acknowledged the financial difficulties which had confronted the council and made prioritising work and expenditure difficult, but she had to remind the council that Parliament had placed upon the council a statutory duty to assert and protect the rights of the public to use and enjoy public footpaths. The failure here to respond to this statutory duty was, in the ombudsman's view, maladministration. The ombudsman felt this was aggravated by the failures of both the council and its predecessor to comply with recommendations contained in the previous report issued about this matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.1318W.5/13">Although the ombudsman commended the council for the action it is taking now, she was critical of the time taken to reach this point. The ombudsman felt that the council's failure to respond to the previous report, and the failure over many years to take any effective action, reflected very poorly on the council.</p>
	<p pid="b.1318W.5/14">The council has now instigated action which should resolve this matter and re-establish the footpath. However the ombudsman felt that the complainants had been put to great trouble in being forced to pursue their complaints as they did and, commending their patience, felt that the council should pay each of them &pound;500 to compensate them for their time and trouble.</p>

	<p pid="b.1322W.3/1">There is no standardised approach to assessments for Supporting People services, and arrangements will vary between authorities and between providers. It is, however, usual for an assessment to be made of an individual's personal circumstances in order to obtain housing-related support. This could take account of things like physical and mental health, social, family, domestic and financial circumstances. The basic aim will be to determine eligibility, so a decision can be made on who is entitled to a service funded through Supporting People and in accordance with grant conditions applying to the programme; and why, and what, if any, charges for the service should be made.</p>

We consider that the new style strategic board as proposed in the paper, if Parliament legislates to establish it, should be re-located out of London. In advance of this, I have given approval for the board to re-locate a small number of posts to Manchester in 2006, provided this can be achieved without the need for any extra grant funding from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
