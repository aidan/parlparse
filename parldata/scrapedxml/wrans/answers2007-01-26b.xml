	<p pid="b.2055W.11/1">The Government take the issue of alcohol misuse seriously, particularly among young people, and set out a programme of measures in the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England in 2004. The strategy noted the work being undertaken by Ofcom to review the rules on alcohol advertising on television.</p>
	<p pid="b.2055W.11/2">Ofcom conducted and assessed research about the impact of alcohol advertising and concluded there was insufficient evidence to support a ban. However, Ofcom's code amendments, which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-01">1 January 2005</phrase>, significantly strengthened the rules on broadcast alcohol advertising in many areas particularly to protect the under-18s.</p>
	<p pid="b.2055W.11/3">In parallel with the changes to the TV Advertising Standards Code, the non-broadcast code was tightened to ensure that the content of all advertisements was socially responsible and that they did not contain a particular appeal to youth culture or links to sexual success and did not encourage antisocial behaviour. These new rules were introduced in October 2005 and have been monitored and enforced by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). I understand the ASA and the Committees of Advertising Practice will be conducting further research this year to assess the effectiveness of the new code rules and will assess whether any further changes are required.</p>
	<p pid="b.2055W.11/4">The Department has made no separate assessment of the merits of an alcohol advertising ban.</p>

We intend section 8 to come into force in October 2007. It will not affect the provision of child care by the governing body of a maintained school, and it will not apply to day care for children in need provided under section 18 of the Children Act 1989.</p>

That guidance will make clear that the restriction in section 8 relates only to new or expanding local authority child care. There is no requirement for local authorities to close their existing provision, or change it when section 8 comes into force. If, however, a local authority wishes to expand existing child care in terms of the number of places or the hours offered, or if it wishes to open new provision, the requirements of section 8 will need to be met.</p>

	<p pid="b.2061W.0/2">Mainstream school funding is provided through the dedicated schools grant (DSG) which sets local authorities allocations for 2006-07 and 2007-08: the allocations for 2007-08 will depend on pupil numbers in schools in January 2007 and the guaranteed unit of funding per pupil set in December 2005, which took account of the number of children for whom English is an additional language and those pupils from ethnic minorities who are underachieving.</p>
	<p pid="b.2061W.0/3">The increase in Peterborough's DSG guaranteed unit of funding was 7 per cent. in 2006-07 and will be 6.8 per cent. in 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="b.2061W.0/4">The guaranteed unit of funding per pupil was set in December 2005 to provide authorities with predictability and stability over a multi-year period; local authorities were fully consulted as part of this process. I am therefore not planning discussions with individual local authorities on their DSG allocations for 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="b.2061W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.2061W.3/2">The production cost was &pound;18,861. However, as it is now more than three years since the guide was published, it is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the manpower costs incurred by the Department for Transport and the Department for Education and Skills in researching and writing the guide.</p>
	<p pid="b.2061W.3/3">A total of 8,238 copies of the guide have were distributed up to the end of December 2006, 2,206 in 2003, 2,751 in 2004, 2,662 in 2005 and 619 in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.2061W.3/4">Both Departments have promoted the Travelling to School project to bring about a step change in home to school travel patterns. School travel plans are seen as the key strategies in cutting congestion and pollution while allowing more pupils to take regular exercise, and the objective is for every school in England to have an approved school travel plan in place by the end of the decade. At the end of March 2006, just over 10,000 schools had a school travel plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.2061W.3/5">An initial evaluation in 2005 of the Travelling to School project found a strong evidence base that school travel plans can be effective mechanisms for reducing car dependency on the journey to school. They can also deliver wider benefits including improvements in pupil behaviour, increased confidence and independent mobility for pupils with special educational needs, improved punctuality and school attendance, engaging schools and pupils from deprived areas, building positive relationships with local authorities and local communities and improved safety.</p>

	<p pid="b.2063W.11/1">Data at the parliamentary constituency level is not available. However, according to the Office for National Statistics' Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, median hourly pay excluding overtime in the north-west of England (including Merseyside) rose 34 per cent. since the introduction of the National Minimum Wage (NMW) (from &pound;6.95 in 1998 to &pound;9.32 in 2006). Though the NMW would have made some contribution to this increase, no quantitative assessment of its impact has been made.</p>

	<p pid="b.2064W.0/1">The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is a non-departmental public body responsible for the decommissioning and clean-up of the UK's historic public civil nuclear legacy. Safety is clearly a Government priority and the NDA is responsible for ensuring this in managing its budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.2064W.0/2">The NDA is funded by a mixture of grant in aid from my Department and income from its commercial operations. Grant in aid for the NDA in 2007-08 was settled in the 2004 Spending Round. The figure is &pound;1,381 million. There is no question of this funding being cut.</p>
	<p pid="b.2064W.0/3">For the last two years the level of spend by the NDA has been running at a significantly higher level that that assumed in the 2004 Spending Round. This was made possible because of unexpectedly high additional commercial income.</p>
	<p pid="b.2064W.0/4">The performance of some of the NDA's commercial operations is subject to uncertainty and the NDA now expects less commercial income for the financial year 2007-08 than it originally forecast. As a consequence, the NDA has asked my Department to provide additional grant to cover its additional spending plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.2064W.0/5">The Department is in discussion with the NDA about its funding request as part of routine annual budgeting discussions, and is considering how much additional NDA expenditure (that is, above and beyond that provided by the 2004 Spending Round) can be sustained through increases in grant in aid.</p>
	<p pid="b.2064W.0/6">The NDA's Annual Report and Accounts 2005-06 were published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-26">26 October 2006</phrase> and copies were placed in the Libraries of the House. The Accounts are also available on the NDA website at: <a href="http://www.nda.gov.uk">www.nda.gov.uk</a></p>

The company has provided the following figures relating to the numbers of post office branches in the constituency. There are 42 post office branches in the Cotswold constituency, 40 classified as rural and two classified as urban. The information is placed in and available from the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.2067W.3/2">The Government's support helps Post Office Ltd to cover the fixed element of sub-postmasters' pay and to meet infrastructure costs such as IT operating costs, cash distribution, direct marketing, and the agents' information help line. As the Government's subsidy for the network is used to cover the costs incurred by Post Office Ltd in maintaining an uncommercial network rather than specific branches, the funding is not directly attributed to individual post offices.</p>

	<p pid="b.2068W.8/1">Since 2002 the Government have set out a series of policy commitments and provided funding to realise the recommendations of Sir Gareth Robert's report 'SET for Success'.</p>
	<p pid="b.2068W.8/2">The 10-year science and innovation investment framework emphasised the importance of science, engineering and technology (SET) skills for the future of the UK. This was reinforced by the further programme of commitments in the March 2006 science and innovation investment framework next steps.</p>
	<p pid="b.2068W.8/3">Research Councils are implementing those recommendations in the Roberts report on improving the attractiveness of postgraduate study and careers in higher education. For example, the minimum PhD stipend was raised to &pound;12,000 in the academic year 2005 and to &pound;12,300 in 2006, and has been increased since in line with the GDP deflator; a study has been undertaken to assess the impact of enhanced stipends and salaries on the recruitment and retention of postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers in key shortage areas; mechanisms have been put in place to support PhDs of longer duration than three years; funding for nearly 800 academic fellowships has been awarded to 79 universities throughout the UK; research councils are working with the higher education sector to enhance personal and professional skills development for research staff based on research grants; and, the concordat for contract workers is also being reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="b.2068W.8/4">In addition to this, initiatives to secure a firm and sustainable pool of qualified people in science have included SETNET (the science, engineering, technology and mathematics network) and the science and engineering ambassadors (SEAs)programme with currently over 13,000 SEAs enthusing young people about science which will increase to 18,000 by March 2008. The UK Resource Centre for Women in SET has been set up and is working with over 70 employers to increase numbers of women in SET, and 38 schools are currently participating in an initiative run by SETNET to increase the participation of ethnic minority school children in science.</p>

This will include an assessment of the completeness of the data set required to construct a &quot;safe-to-escape curve&quot; that will meet our safety requirements.

	<p pid="b.2077W.5/1">The White Paper &quot;The Future of Air Transport&quot;, published in December 2003, sets out the Government's support for the development of two new runways in the south-east. This approach is reiterated in the Progress Report on the White Paper published in December 2006. The Government support the development of a second runway at Stansted Airport, and a third runway at Heathrow, provided that stringent environmental conditions can be met.</p>
	<p pid="b.2077W.5/2">We expect BAA to make a planning application for a second runway at Stansted later this year. In addition, we expect to consult this year on further expansion of Heathrow in the light of the outputs of environmental assessment work. Following the outcome of the consultation, it will, however, be for BAA, as the airport operator, to bring forward any development proposals for Heathrow for consideration through the planning system in the normal way.</p>

The conclusion arising out of these assessments was that the least environmentally risky option was to tow the vessel to a place of refuge in UK waters. The south coast of England provided better options for a place of refuge than the French coast, where there were no suitable places of refuge within reasonable distance.</p>

However, as a matter of policy, the FCO would seek to ensure that the principles underlying this legislation would be applied in the management of those staff. Whether UK legislation would apply to locally engaged staff working in the Governor's office would depend on a number of factors and would need to be assessed in each case.

	<p pid="b.2087W.3/1">Under the Disability Equality Duty introduced by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, DFID is required to publish and implement a Disability Equality Scheme. This is a plan setting out how we will carry out the Disability Equality Duty, monitor, and report on progress.

	<p pid="b.2088W.2/1">The UK's 2006 White Paper on International Development commits us to tackling barriers to access to markets and financial services, and supporting microfinance initiatives in partnership with banks and regulators.</p>
	<p pid="b.2088W.2/2">For DFID, microfinance is part of a broader strategy to promote stronger and more inclusive financial sectors. In addition to programmes that have microfinance as the central activity, DFID supports programmes to improve access to finance for poor people where microfinance is just one component. These programmes aim to encourage the entry of financial institutions into the microfinance sector and assist Governments to improve the regulatory environment for financial institutions to serve the poor.</p>
	<p pid="b.2088W.2/3">In the last three financial years (not including the present year) DFID spent the following on microfinance and financial sector projects.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.2088W.2/6"> <td><i> April to March:</i></td> <td><i> &pound; million</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.2088W.2/7"> <td>2003-04</td> <td>40</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.2088W.2/8"> <td>2004-05</td> <td>23</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.2088W.2/9"> <td>2005-06</td> <td>23</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.2088W.2/12">The totals for the years preceding this were not disaggregated and calculating this now would involve a disproportionate cost. In total, DFID has spent over &pound;165 million to support microfinance and financial sector projects and had committed &pound;140 million more at <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-31">31 October 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.2088W.2/13">DFID continues to design and implement new programmes which will improve access to finance. Since the last review of commitments in October, DFID has approved a &pound;9.3 million, five-year financial sector development programme in Nigeria and a &pound;32.8 million seven-year PROSPER programme in Bangladesh, which includes capacity building for microfinance institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.2088W.2/14">A number of the international agencies that DFID supports are active in promoting microfinance and financial sector development. The World Bank, the International Finance Corporation and several regional development banks all provide significant funding or technical assistance in these areas. We do not have the necessary level of disaggregation of figures to provide a figure for the total spent on microfinance and financial sector development.</p>
	<p pid="b.2088W.2/15">DFID has also been successful in leveraging financing from the private sector. For example, DFID provided a first-loss facility of &pound;820,000 via the Financial Deepening Challenge Fund that generated a total fund of &pound;80.6 million from 13 institutional investors for the Deutsche Bank Community Microfinance Facility.</p>

	<p pid="b.2089W.2/4">The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is a good example of this approach, involving palm oil growers, environmental organisations, and manufacturers and retailers of products containing palm oil in the development of criteria for more sustainable palm oil production.

The Home Secretary has therefore instigated a Government wide review of the way in which such information is shared and used.</p>

The long-term needs of older people within house building programmes are being addressed through the following means:</p>
	<p pid="b.2097W.8/3" class="indent">A. Communities and Local Government is leading work on a cross-Whitehall strategy for housing and older people. The strategy will review current provision and plan for the future in the context of an ageing society. We expect to publish the strategy in summer 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.2097W.8/4" class="indent">B. We have recently published Planning Policy Statement 3, which states that Local Planning Authorities should plan for a mix of housing on the basis of the different types of households that are likely to require housing, including the accommodation requirements of specific groups such as older people. Regional Assemblies are expected to reflect the needs of the elderly in the evidence base that they use to underpin their Regional Spatial Strategies and Regional Housing Strategies.</p>
	<p pid="b.2097W.8/5" class="indent">C. For house building programmes, we are now encouraging home builders to follow the principles set out in the Code for Sustainable Homes, which includes lifetime homes standards as an optional element. We are also considering making assessment under Code standards mandatory in future. Through the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE: the Government's adviser on urban design and architecture) we are also promoting take-up of the principles of Inclusive Design&mdash;design that caters for everyone's needs, including those of older people. I am placing copies of this document in the House Library, or it can be found on the intranet at:</p>

	<p pid="b.2099W.0/3">CLG's agencies obtain 52 per cent. of their electricity from renewable sources, and at this time they have no plans to increase this percentage, although the situation is reviewed annually. This review takes into consideration factors such as cost, market forces and Government commitments.</p>

	<p pid="b.2110W.2/1">Any shortfall between the local housing allowance and contractual rent at the time of national roll-out of the local housing allowance will depend on the trends in local rent levels and the accommodation choices made by tenants. The trends in local rent levels up to the point of national roll-out are currently hard to predict and local housing allowance rates will vary across local private rent sector markets. This is true for all claimants, including those single under 25-year-olds without dependants who are subject to the local housing allowance shared room rate.</p>
	<p pid="b.2110W.2/2">However, we estimate that overall, the majority of all new claimants at rollout will gain under the proposed national local housing allowance compared to what they would have been entitled to under the current housing benefit rules.</p>

	<p pid="b.2112W.11/1">The decision to introduce a new cattle compensation system, in February last year, was not made lightly, and was taken only after two public consultations. Wherever possible, the Government have responded to detailed concerns raised by interested organisations. Following our consultations, significant enhancements to the system were made&mdash;in particular, the number of table valuation cattle categories was increased from the proposed 29 to 47.</p>
	<p pid="b.2112W.11/2">In line with Government's on going commitment to work in partnership with interested organisations, Defra has set up the Cattle Compensation Advisory Group (CCAG) to monitor, with the industry, the introduction of the new compensation system.</p>
	<p pid="b.2112W.11/3">Defra and the CCAG are discussing a range of ideas the group has suggested for enhancing the current compensation arrangements&mdash;these include the specific areas raised by the hon. Member. While Defra has not ruled out the possibility of changes to the compensation system, they are not inevitable. Any changes would need to be justified and fair to farmers and the taxpayer. They would also need to take account of the extensive evidence on the level of over-valuation experienced under the previous system based on individual valuations.</p>

	<p pid="b.2116W.5/2">The UK quotas are adjusted to take account of post- council and end of year swaps.

	<p pid="b.2116W.5/3">The initial allocations made to 10 metre and under vessels are calculated from fixed quota allocations for each stock, which are based on the catch pattern of these vessels during a standard reference period. The allocations vary from stock to stock.</p>

	<p pid="b.2118W.5/1">Action to reduce the amount of waste which is sent to landfill is driven by regional and local strategies and supported by nationally funded programmes. As well as encouraging more sustainable resource use, diverting waste from landfill contributes to our efforts to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.2118W.5/2">The landfill allowances trading scheme (LATS), which we established in 2005, is the main measure in place to help local authorities (LAs) meet national obligations under the EU Landfill Directive to divert biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) from landfill. LATS is a market mechanism that provides LAs with the flexibility to reduce the amount of BMW they landfill in the most cost effective way.</p>
	<p pid="b.2118W.5/3">In addition, the Government are providing funding and support to LAs to help them promote and develop more sustainable waste management practices such as recycling, reuse and waste minimisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.2118W.5/4">The Waste Implementation Programme (WIP) has a number of projects under way which will help LAs reach their statutory recycling targets by providing best practice, guidance and toolkits for waste management. WIP provides direct support and information to LAs on planning, waste disposal and recycling. In addition, the WIP-funded waste and resources action programme (WRAP) is working with a number of LAs on programmes designed to improve the efficiency of recycling schemes and establish home composting and other minimisation activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.2118W.5/5">Funding is provided to LAs to increase recycling and divert waste from landfill through the waste performance and efficiency grant (a three-year targeted grant totalling &pound;260 million), with a further &pound;535 million available from private finance initiative credits from 2006-08.</p>

	<p pid="b.2119W.2/1">The Marine Fisheries Agency's targets were refined in the light of operational experience and to ensure realistic and appropriate measures of performance. Specific explanations for each amended target are set out as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.2119W.2/2" class="italic"> Fishing Vessel Licensing</p>
	<p pid="b.2119W.2/3">The amendment reflects the Agency's work to simplify the issue of fishing vessel licences for over 10 metre vessels. Such licences are now issued every two years rather than annually.</p>
	<p pid="b.2119W.2/4" class="italic"> Quota Management</p>
	<p pid="b.2119W.2/5">The revised target ensures that the Agency reports on its performance in managing fisheries quotas for which it has responsibility. The previous target included management of quotas that were the responsibility of other fisheries administrations in the UK that the Agency was not responsible for.</p>
	<p pid="b.2119W.2/6" class="italic"> Grants</p>
	<p pid="b.2119W.2/7">The target was amended in the light of operational experience. It was unrealistic, within available resources, to require 100 per cent. of claims to be processed within eight weeks. The revised target remains challenging, but is more realistic. The Agency will, however, continue to aim for all claims to be processed within the eight-week deadline.</p>
	<p pid="b.2119W.2/8" class="italic"> Marine Environment</p>
	<p pid="b.2119W.2/9">The Agency undertakes inspections of Food and Environment Protection Act (FEPA) licensed construction sites, ensuring that accessible sites are inspected during licensing periods. However, licensing periods do not correspond with the period covered by the annual performance target. This makes it difficult to report or measure activities in a meaningful way. The Agency is developing a risk-based approach to inspection, which will take account of the environmental and fisheries sensitivities of the FEPA licensed activity. The target was amended to reflect that decision. Risk-based inspection targets will apply for 2007-08.</p>

	<p pid="b.2120W.2/1">Agriculture as a whole contributes 7 per cent. of all UK greenhouse gas emissions and 14 per cent. globally, but less than 1 per cent. of carbon dioxide. Emissions of carbon dioxide attributed to agriculture arise from direct energy use such as the use of diesel in tractors, gas in heating greenhouses, and electricity used in livestock buildings. The bigger challenge is on two other gases, methane and nitrous oxide, of which some 36 per cent. and 67 per cent. respectively comes from agriculture, livestock, manures, and artificial fertiliser. About 86 per cent. of this methane comes from enteric fermentation in the digestive system of animals (sheep, pigs and bovines), and about 14 per cent. from animal waste. Methane emissions from agriculture have declined by 12 per cent. since 1990.</p>
	<p pid="b.2120W.2/2">In December 2006, Defra announced a &pound;750,000 investment in research on ruminant nutrition regimes to reduce enteric methane and nitrogen emissions from livestock. This research project will build on our knowledge-base and take an integrated approach to the development of ruminant nutrition regimes to deliver reductions in total greenhouse gas emissions (particularly methane) per animal and per unit of meat and milk output. Approaches for consideration include the modification of forage-based diets, alterations to concentrate feed formulation and ingredients, and feed supplements. All options and solutions will be looked at.</p>
	<p pid="b.2120W.2/3">This research builds on a wealth of past work where Defra and its predecessor have invested in research to improve the productivity of dairy cattle. The resulting increases in individual cow milk yields can reduce methane emissions per unit of milk produced. The Defra research has included, for example, developing grass varieties that are high in sugar and lead indirectly to a reduction in methane emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.2120W.2/4">The Government are also reviewing its approach to anaerobic digestion (AD), a system which, when used in agriculture, processes animal manures and food wastes, and generates methane (biogas) which can be captured and used as a renewable energy source. This technology reduces methane emissions from manures when the methane is captured effectively. Defra is investing in research at the Institute for Grassland and Environment Research looking at how AD technology can be embedded into farming and agricultural systems to deliver a wide range of benefits, including methane mitigation. This research is being done in conjunction with a large EU-funded project looking at the optimisation of AD technology.</p>

Several representations were received that referred to, or recommended, a separation distance above 20 m, and these were considered by ACRE before it finalised it's advice to Ministers.</p>

The conditions require groundkeepers and volunteers (plants that develop from true seed) to be closely monitored and controlled after the trials have ended. The trial sites will not be released from statutory control until there have been two consecutive years in which no groundkeepers or volunteers are observed. The application of these provisions will be overseen by the DEFRA GM Inspectorate. ACRE's advice and the statutory consent are available on the DEFRA website.</p>

DEFRA has commissioned an independent research project examining the international evidence on incentive schemes and the potential impact of incentives in England, including their distributional impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.2124W.6/3">England's Waste Strategy is currently being reviewed and DEFRA is considering the full range of measures that could encourage producers and consumers to change their behaviour regarding waste and recycling in general. Most existing incentive schemes reward those householders that produce less residual waste after recycling. By minimising waste and recycling or home composting as much as possible, householders can help to keep down waste costs and, therefore, help reduce pressures on council tax bills. Pensioners tend to produce less waste than the average household, so would be likely to gain from any incentive scheme. Any new initiatives on waste would of course need to take into account the impact on different groups, including the vulnerable and those on low incomes, as part of a Regulatory Impact Assessment.</p>

	<p pid="b.2126W.8/1">Since the 1985-86 whaling seasons, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has maintained a moratorium on the hunting and killing of all great whales. Norway and Iceland, who objected to the introduction of the moratorium, are thus not bound by it and therefore conduct whaling operations legally.</p>
	<p pid="b.2126W.8/2">The UK will continue to protest at the highest diplomatic level against Norway and Iceland's activities which, though legal, are not in keeping with the spirit of the IWC. We will continue our efforts, along with other countries, to urge these countries to reconsider their position and reverse this unjustified and unnecessary practice. Indeed, in November, the UK led a diplomatic demarche of 25 countries together with the European Commission in condemning the Icelandic Government's decision to resume commercial whaling.</p>
	<p pid="b.2126W.8/3">DEFRA officials also ensure that Foreign and Commonwealth Office posts in the relevant capitals are briefed, and engage in discussion with their counterparts on whaling at every appropriate opportunity. This ensures that these countries are in no doubt of the importance that the UK places on whale conservation.</p>

It does not therefore have plans in place to raise the level of OSS use, but rather will make software procurement decisions on a case-by-case basis.</p>

	<p pid="b.2132W.0/2">Since 1997 the Government have introduced a range of measures to improve the energy efficiency of residential housing, in addition to VAT reduced rates. In the latest pre-Budget report alone, the Chancellor announced further support for the Government's Energy Efficiency Commitment, which requires energy suppliers to achieve energy efficiency targets for the household sector. Other measures and initiatives announced in the pre-Budget report include an examination of new methods for financing energy audits and energy-saving measures; tax measures to support 'zero-carbon' homes, along with an ambition that all new homes will be 'zero-carbon' within a decade; and an extension to the Landlords Energy Saving Allowance.</p>

Hon. Members will be able to contribute to this consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.2135W.0/3">This will be supplemented by wider engagement with the public, patient representatives and local clinicians through meetings, which will help inform the local implementation of the CATS scheme, to be held by both the Department's project team and PCTs in the areas covered by the CATS scheme. This ongoing process of consultation and engagement is designed to ensure that all members of the health economy, including patients, primary care trusts, acute trusts (and staff groups within those organisations) have the chance to understand and comment on the solution that is developed.</p>
	<p pid="b.2135W.0/4">Upon completion of negotiations with the preferred provider, a contract is anticipated to be awarded for the Cumbria and Lancashire CATS scheme in late spring 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.2135W.0/5">As regards Blackburn, a site has been identified further to discussions with the East Lancashire PCT which does not involve the use of the Queens Park hospital site. The PCT and SHA will be working together to manage the impact of the introduction of CATS, not just in Blackburn, but across the whole of Cumbria and Lancashire.</p>

	<p pid="b.2136W.2/1">European food law places primary responsibility on food operators to ensure that the food and animal feed that they sell complies with food safety legislation. The European Commission has powers to introduce emergency measures to control the import of potentially contaminated food and feed and has done so in cases where this is necessary, such as following the discovery of unauthorised genetically modified (GM) material in long grain rice from the United States. The Commission also represents the European Union (EU) in discussions with trading partners on issues where there is an agreed EU position, including GM food and feed. The Commission, through its Joint Research Centre (JRC), is also able to provide practical support for laboratories involved in analysing food and feed for unauthorized GM material. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is encouraging the Commission and the JRC to expand this work. At national level, the FSA is responsible for overseeing the food law enforcement activities of local authorities. It also supports local authorities by funding training, providing grants and making other resources available.</p>

	<p pid="b.2141W.2/1">The tariff uplift is based on the estimated increase in the cost of services within the hospital and community health service (HCHS) sector. The 2.5 per cent. increase in pay settlement and drift translates into a 1.7 per cent. increase in HCHS costs because pay represents around two-thirds of total HCHS costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.2141W.2/2">Pay settlement is the level of pay increase awarded following the recommendation by pay review bodies. Pay drift is the increase in paybill beyond increases due to workforce growth, pay settlement and staff on-costs. For example, a decrease in workforce growth or improved staff retention may lead to pay drift due to a change in the distribution of staff between different incremental points on the pay scale.</p>

	<p pid="b.2142W.5/1">The provision of social services in the Gravesham area is the responsibility of Kent county council. Funding for local authorities' social service responsibilities are paid through formula grant (revenue support grant and national non-domestic rates) and specific grant. Formula grant is unhypothecated provision and decisions on the use of that grant are for local authorities to make, bearing in mind their statutory responsibilities and the wishes of their electorate. Under the provisional local government finance settlement 2007-08, Kent county council receives a formula grant of &pound;228.685 million, which is an increase of 2.7 per cent. on a like for like basis. In addition, Kent will receive the following revenue grants for adult social care amounting to &pound;42.591 million:</p>
