	<p pid="b.594W.2/1">DFID officials have been in discussion with NGOs such as Oxfam, WDM, WaterAid and others for over a year about more effective ways to support public utilities.

	<p pid="b.594W.2/2">In April of this year, DFID funded regional workshops in Asia and Africa. Working with utility managers, these explored the possibilities of establishing regional partnerships&mdash;and examined the support they might need.

	<p pid="b.622W.3/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply. The relevant tables have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.3/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Questions about employment and unemployment. (156032, 156033, 156034, 156035)</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.3/4" class="indent">These questions ask for the same information as questions received in July this year, and I refer you to the answer given in <i> Official Report</i> volume 463 of <phrase class="date" code="">26 July</phrase>, column 1460.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.3/5" class="indent">However, since the previous questions were answered, we now have new employment and unemployment data from the Annual Population Survey (APS) for April 2006 to March 2007, and the April to June 2007 Labour Force Survey (LFS) household dataset.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.3/6" class="indent">As in the previous answer, Table 1, attached, shows the number of males, females and people, who were (i) aged 16 and over, (ii) young persons aged 16 to 24 and (iii) persons aged 25 and over, resident in the Jarrow constituency, who were in employment, for the 12 months ending in March 2007 from the APS. The table also shows employment rates which allow changes to be seen in the context of changing population numbers. Tables 2 to 4 show data for South Tyneside metropolitan borough, the North East and Great Britain respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.3/7" class="indent">For unitary and local authorities, the ONS produces estimates of total unemployment, following ILO definitions, from a statistical model. Annual estimates for other areas and breakdowns are compiled from the annual local area LFS and the APS following ILO definitions.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.3/8" class="indent">Table 5, attached, shows the number of males, females and people, who were (i) aged 16 and over, (ii) young persons aged 16 to 24 and (iii) persons aged 25 and over, resident in the Jarrow constituency, who were unemployed, for the 12 months ending March 2007, from the APS. The table also shows unemployment rates which allow changes to be seen in the context of changing population numbers. Tables 6 to 8 show data for South Tyneside metropolitan borough, the North East and Great Britain respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.3/9" class="indent">Table 9, attached shows employment levels, unemployment levels and rates for lone parents aged 16 and over and employment rates for lone parents of working age, resident in the South Tyneside metropolitan borough, the North East and Great Britain, for the three months ending in June, for 2007 from the LFS household datasets. Data for the Jarrow constituency are unavailable as Parliamentary Constituency markers are not held in this dataset.</p>
	<p pid="b.622W.3/10" class="indent">The estimates in Tables 1-9 are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty. In this case, the sample sizes for the Jarrow constituency and South Tyneside metropolitan borough are not sufficient to give an accurate estimate of even the direction of the change over time.</p>

	<p pid="b.623W.4/1">The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) commissioned research entitled &quot;Practical Application of Regulatory Impact Diagrams to Buoyancy Equipment at Work for Fishermen&quot; which was completed in February 2001. This addressed all factors which may affect the wearing of buoyancy devices at sea.</p>
	<p pid="b.623W.4/2">All fishing vessels are required to carry lifejackets but the report argued that prior to taking a regulatory approach to wearing lifejackets, we needed to identify the needs and experiences of lifejacket users, in order to gauge the requirements for regulations. This finding was supported by research which demonstrated that safety precautions show little correlation with the likelihood of accidents.</p>
	<p pid="b.623W.4/3">Following publication of this report the MCA has participated in research by the Seafish Industry Authority (Seafish) and the Royal National Lifeboat Institute on Lifejacket and Buoyancy Aid Acceptability Trials. The trials of 24 products were in two stages, a test tank assessment to ensure that products are effective when worn with 'sea gear' and long term assessments by fishermen in the course of fishing.</p>
	<p pid="b.623W.4/4">The results of the research have been made available to the industry to inform the purchase and wearing of such equipment and manufacturers of buoyancy aids and lifejackets to inform development.</p>
	<p pid="b.623W.4/5">The MCA has also recently undertaken research on the approach taken to the wearing of lifejackets adopted by other countries, and the effect on casualty statistics, and is currently assessing the findings of this research.</p>

	<p pid="b.630W.8/5" class="indent">These questions ask for the same information as questions received in July this year, and I refer you to the answer given in <i> Official Report</i> volume 463 of <phrase class="date" code="">26 July</phrase>, column 1460.</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.8/6" class="indent">However, since the previous questions were answered, we now have new employment and unemployment data from the Annual Population Survey (APS) for April 2006 to March 2007, and the April to June 2007 Labour Force Survey (LFS) household dataset.</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.8/7" class="indent">As in the previous answer, Table 1, attached, shows the number of males, females and people, who were (i) aged 16 and over, (ii) young persons aged 16 to 24 and (iii) persons aged 25 and over, resident in the Jarrow constituency, who were in employment, for the 12 months ending in March 2007 from the APS. The table also shows employment rates which allow changes to be seen in the context of changing population numbers. Tables 2 to 4 show data for South Tyneside metropolitan borough, the North East and Great Britain respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.8/8" class="indent">For unitary and local authorities, the ONS produces estimates of total unemployment, following ILO definitions, from a statistical model. Annual estimates for other areas and breakdowns are compiled from the annual local area LFS and the APS following ILO definitions.</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.8/9" class="indent">Table 5, attached, shows the number of males, females and people, who were (i) aged 16 and over, (ii) young persons aged 16 to 24 and (iii) persons aged 25 and over, resident in the Jarrow constituency, who were unemployed, for the 12 months ending March 2007, from the APS. The table also shows unemployment rates which allow changes to be seen in the context of changing population numbers. Tables 6 to 8 show data for South Tyneside metropolitan borough, the North East and Great Britain respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.8/10" class="indent">Table 9, attached shows employment levels, unemployment levels and rates for lone parents aged 16 and over and employment rates for lone parents of working age, resident in the South Tyneside metropolitan borough, the North East and Great Britain, for the three months ending in June, for 2007 from the LFS household datasets. Data for the Jarrow constituency are unavailable as Parliamentary Constituency markers are not held in this dataset.</p>
	<p pid="b.630W.8/11" class="indent">The estimates in Tables 1-9 are for a subset of the population in small geographical areas, they are based on small sample sizes, and are therefore subject to large margins of uncertainty. In this case, the sample sizes for the Jarrow constituency and South Tyneside metropolitan borough are not sufficient to give an accurate estimate of even the direction of the change over time.</p>

	<p pid="b.635W.2/1">The average unit tour interval for the infantry and the Royal Regiment of Artillery is 23.5 and 20.8 months, respectively. This is calculated on the basis of the mean time between the start of the most recent deployment and the end of the previous deployment for all formed units within each arm.</p>
	<p pid="b.635W.2/2">The unit tour interval is a less relevant measure when applied to the Corps of Royal Engineers, the Royal Logistic Corps and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. This is due to the frequency with which personnel move between formed units within these corps (which means that the personnel deployed with a unit will be substantially different from the personnel who deployed with the same unit on a previous occasion). Unit tour interval data for these corps is not therefore routinely collated.</p>

	<p pid="b.637W.8/1">The information is not held in the format requested as all three services conduct urban warfare exercises at varying scales.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.8/2">Land units are mandated to conduct urban training throughout the training cycle. However, urban training does not take place in isolation but is integrated into wider exercises. Training may involve low level activity focusing solely upon the urban environment or as part of wider collective training. The intensity of this urban training differs according to time and exercise area. By way of example, for the period September 2006 to September 2007<sup>(1)</sup>, the Copehill Down Urban Training Village on Salisbury Plain was used for 296 days of urban training.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.8/3">Both the RN and RAF also conduct urban warfare exercises but at a much smaller scale. Since 2001 the annual programme for Commando Training Centre Royal Marines has routinely included urban warfare exercises, specifically 22 for Recruit Training, five for the All Arms Commando Course and two for Young Officer Courses, making a total of 29 annually. For the RAF, 14 urban warfare exercises were conducted in each year in the period 2001-03, rising to 18 annually thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.8/4">The individual training programme also includes urban training, though to varying degrees dependent upon the assessed need. By way of example, training at both the Infantry Battle School and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst routinely incorporates urban exercises as part of their courses.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.8/5">Urban training is extensively practised within Pre Deployment Training for current operations, and incorporated into all unit training packages for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The exact emphasis upon urban operations is driven by the role of the unit concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.637W.8/6" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> Records for the amount of urban training across the entire Defence Estate are not held.</p>

	<p pid="b.639W.6/1">The 1998 St. Malo text from the summit between the UK and French Governments declares the intentions of the two countries to enable the European Union to play a full role on the international stage. It concentrates particularly on what is now known as European Security and Defence Policy, while recognising the need for ESDP to develop in a way which is both supportive of and supported by NATO's crisis management activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.639W.6/2">Since 1998 ESDP has developed considerably. It has enabled the EU to launch four peacekeeping operations: in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2003 and 2006); Macedonia (2003); and Bosnia (launched in December 2004), as well as numerous smaller civil-military operations. The current Bosnia operation took over from NATO's SFOR and has proven the efficacy of the Berlin Plus arrangements agreed in 2003 for EU access to NATO assets.</p>
	<p pid="b.639W.6/3">Other successes include the establishment of the European Defence Agency in 2004 to drive forward capability development and improve defence/industrial co-operation; the continuing development of a capacity for military and joint civil/military planning, based on agreed consultation arrangements with NATO; and the establishment of full operating capability for the rapid-response Battle Groups initiative, achieved in January 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.639W.6/4">The Government are therefore fully satisfied with progress to date, and we will continue to play a leading role in further progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.640W.3/1">The Government are committed to eradicating the threat of animal rights extremism and has in place a robust interdepartmental strategy to achieve this. The strategy is centred on an improved law enforcement approach, with additional resources provided to the police to tackle animal rights extremism, a central police team set-up to drive forward police action nationally, and legislation enacted to protect animal research organisations. The strategy has been overseen by a Cabinet Committee which has been encouraged by the significant fall in illegal extremist activity, and the many significant convictions of animal rights extremists in the past 18 months, some for blackmail. A number of other animal rights extremists are awaiting trial and other major investigations remain ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="b.640W.3/2">While the Government respect, support and will protect the right to peaceful protest, we are equally clear that it is wholly unacceptable that a very small number of animal extremists should mount campaigns of fear and intimidation in an attempt to stop individuals and companies going about their lawful and legitimate business whether it is connected with animal research, farming or zoos and aquariums. The Government will continue to drive and review the strategy to eradicate the extremist threat.</p>

	<p pid="b.641W.11/1">Breath test devices currently available for use outside police stations are screening devices, used for a preliminary test to obtain an indication whether a person's alcohol level is likely to be above the prescribed limit. If a person tests positive, he can be arrested, taken to a police station and required to take an evidential test.</p>
	<p pid="b.641W.11/2">There is no statutory requirement on mobile police units to carry breath screening devices. Vehicles engaged in traffic law enforcement or responding to traffic incidents are however very likely to, and other vehicles may do. This is an operational equipment matter for the chief officer. If the vehicle does not have a screening device, one will normally be readily available and the person to be tested can be required to remain a reasonable length of time for it to arrive. Failure to co-operate with a preliminary test when the officer reasonably suspects there is alcohol in the person's body is an offence for which the person can be arrested.</p>
	<p pid="b.641W.11/3">In addition to the offence of driving while over the prescribed limit, there is a separate offence of driving whilst under the influence of drink. An officer can arrest for this offence and subsequently require an evidential test provided he has reasonable grounds for suspecting the offence and an arrest is necessary for its prompt and effective investigation.</p>

	<p pid="b.644W.0/1">The Road Traffic Act 1988 gives a constable power to require a driver to provide a breath specimen for a preliminary breath test. This is generally taken at the roadside. Under section 6D of the 1988 Act, the driver may be arrested if as a result of the test, the constable suspects that that his/her breath or blood alcohol level exceeds the prescribed limit or if for any reason the driver does not cooperate with the test and the constable suspects alcohol (or drugs) to be in the driver's body.</p>
	<p pid="b.644W.0/2">The purpose of this arrest is to enable a constable to require the driver to provide an evidential sample which, depending on the circumstances, may be breath, blood or urine, to be analysed to determine whether the driver may have committed a specific drink/driving offence under the Road Traffic Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.644W.0/3">The taking and retention of fingerprints and DNA for the purposes of investigating other offences and for identifying suspects are governed by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). Under PACE, fingerprints and DNA cannot be taken without consent unless the driver has been arrested for, or charged with, a specific recordable offence, for example, driving with excess alcohol or when unfit to drive through drink or drugs, failing without reasonable excuse to take a preliminary breath test or failing without reasonable excuse to provide an evidential specimen for analysis. Biometric data under PACE is taken at a police station.</p>
	<p pid="b.644W.0/4">Police may retain fingerprints and samples lawfully taken under PACE. It is a matter for the chief officer for each force area to determine whether or not samples or fingerprints should be retained.</p>

It provides an aid to determining the most appropriate solution to a problem, to ensure that the funds secured from general taxation are invested for the benefit of the nation as a whole.

	<p pid="b.657W.5/1">To date, the Government have made available a significant package of &pound;57 million to support areas affected by the flooding of June and July 2007. The county of Gloucestershire was allocated &pound;2,623,000 of flood recovery grant, which includes &pound;623,500 for the borough of Tewkesbury, &pound;646,500 for the city of Gloucester and &pound;623,500 for the Cotswold district council. Gloucestershire county council was allocated &pound;1,007,900 from the Department for Children, Schools and Families. None of the other local authorities within Gloucestershire provide education or children's services and thus were not eligible for this funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.5/2">The Department for Transport has written to Gloucestershire saying that they will be allocated at least &pound;10 million for highways works and there are ongoing discussions about further funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.5/3">The Regional Development Agency with responsibility for Gloucestershire announced a &pound;2 million flood recovery package for the region. Eligible businesses are able to claim up to a maximum of &pound;2,500. As at <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-04">4 October 2007</phrase>, 455 grant offers had been made, totalling &pound;1,030,000 and 239 of these offers have been claimed, totalling &pound;526,000 paid out by the Regional Development Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.657W.5/4">This is additional money to that available under the Bellwin scheme. The scheme provides emergency financial assistance from the Government to local authorities, to help meet the uninsurable costs of immediate action to safeguard life or property or prevent severe inconvenience to inhabitants in the case of an emergency or disaster. In recognition of the exceptional nature of the recent flooding, special arrangements apply for these schemes. We have significantly extended the period for which the affected authorities can claim for eligible costs and increased the proportion of costs they can receive to 100 per cent. above the threshold.</p>

	<p pid="b.659W.8/1">The Landfill Tax acts as a financial incentive for all businesses, not just small to medium sized firms, to encourage recycling of materials. The Business Resource Efficiency and Waste (BREW) Programme (funded from Landfill Tax) allows businesses to receive free and independent support and advice to help them increase their profitability by sending less waste to landfill and recycling more.</p>
	<p pid="b.659W.8/2">There are no specific financial incentives for small to medium sized companies to recycle packaging. However, the Packaging Regulations do provide an incentive for businesses to reduce and minimise the amount of packaging used. This is because they are obliged to recover and recycle a specified amount of packaging waste; determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle. A producer using less packaging, can reduce the costs incurred under these regulations.</p>

	<p pid="b.666W.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">15 May</phrase> Communities and Local Government published a technical guide, &quot;Improving the Flood Resilient Performance of New Buildings&mdash;Flood resilient construction.&quot; This guide provides information on how homes can be constructed so that, if they are flooded, it should be easier to clean and repair them and enable early reoccupation. This guide includes information on flood resilient flooring, threshold and floor levels. The Department will consider the options for further action in relation to the flood performance of buildings in the light of Sir Michael Pitts' inquiry into the effects of the summer floods.</p>
	<p pid="b.666W.0/2">Meanwhile all development is subject to Planning Policy Statement 25, &quot;Development and Flood Risk (PPS25)&quot; which aims to locate development away from flood risk whenever possible. In those areas where virtually all land is within high flood risk areas and there are few, if any, low risk sites for development, PPS25 imposes new requirements for resilience that ensure that buildings in higher risk areas are safe and less susceptible to flood damage.</p>
	<p pid="b.666W.0/3">The mitigation process described in PPS25 includes the use of resilient or resistant construction. With regard to raising floor levels, while this can assist, it is not without adverse consequences: raised floors can make access and egress more difficult, especially for older people or the infirm; placing buildings on mounds can displace flood water, causing problems elsewhere; raising buildings can create a void under the building where flood water accumulates, bringing problems of removing flood water and contaminants after the flood subsides.</p>

The CHM has thoroughly reviewed the safety of vaccines containing mercury (thiomersal).</p>
	<p pid="b.670W.14/2">Several large studies have found no evidence of a link between thiomersal-containing vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders. MHRA and CHM advice, available on the MHRA website, is that there is no evidence of harm from the very small quantities of thiomersal contained in some vaccines, with the exception of possible allergic reactions such as skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection. This view concurs with that of the World Health Organisation, the United States Institute of Medicine and the European Medicines Agency.</p>

	<p pid="b.672W.5/1">The interim report, published on <phrase class="date" code="">4 October</phrase>, explains that the review is primarily a local process involving thousands of frontline staff, patients and public in the design of care pathways based on best practice evidence. This is core business for the national health service and as such involves no additional cost to the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="b.672W.5/2">The success of a review like this depends of course on the thorough involvement of patients, public and staff and good communication. The total departmental spend so far on staff, patients and public engagement in direct connection with the review is &pound;1.2 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.672W.5/3">The clinicians, managers and other staff leading the review work locally are receiving the great majority of representations from clinicians, managers and other staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.672W.5/4">Lord Darzi personally has met with over 1,500 NHS staff in 17 NHS organisations, read more than 1,400 letters and e-mails from people, including NHS staff, from up and down the country and participated in a nationwide day of detailed discussions with 1,000 people including NHS staff from nine towns and cities. An event attended by representatives of 250 stakeholder groups has been held. In addition, officials at the Department of Health regularly meet with representatives from NHS organisations on various issues right across the span of the review.</p>
	<p pid="b.672W.5/5">Each strategic health authority is responsible for establishing eight local clinical pathway groups. Lists of members should be sought directly from the strategic health authorities themselves.</p>

More can and should be done in this regard, and I sympathise with all those affected. The UN, and also the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, are aware of this issue and we support them in their efforts to address the problem. The process envisaged by the <phrase class="date" code="">8 July</phrase> Agreement would provide a framework in which the issue of preserving cultural heritage could be discussed and addressed by the two communities.</p>
