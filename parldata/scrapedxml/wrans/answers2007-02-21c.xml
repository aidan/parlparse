	<p pid="c.702W.0/1">The Highly Skilled Migrants Programme was amended in November 2006 to trial changes proposed as part of the move to a points based system for managed migration. The points based system will simplify the multitude of current routes into a scheme with five tiers for entry. One of the key objectives for changing the scheme is to reduce subjectivity and base decisions on objective evidence, making the process more transparent for the applicant. The aim of the change in November was to allow for a period of 'live testing' of the proposed tier one criteria, presenting an opportunity to review the effects of the criteria and refine them before full tier one roll-out. Tier one in the new scheme will be broadly equivalent to the existing Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP) in aim (to attract the most highly skilled who can benefit the UK) and entitlements (unrestricted access to the UK labour market, no need to have an employer in UK sponsoring application, the option to settle in the UK after five years, the right to bring dependants). The changes are therefore not expected to have a measurable impact on the UK economy.</p>

Usability testing with members of the public was carried out as part of the design stage. A consultative group, including The Federation of Small Businesses, Tax Aid, Consumers Association and the accountancy bodies representatives, were closely involved in the development and redesign.</p>

	<p pid="c.709W.2/1">Following the introduction of the race duties we produced a Race Equality Scheme (RES) in 2002. We revised and updated our RES in 2005.</p>

	<p pid="c.709W.2/9">Our achievements under our RES include:</p>
	<p pid="c.709W.2/10" class="indent">more robust data. We carried out ethnicity surveys in 2003 and in 2006 to ensure that the arrangements we have in place for monitoring the ethnicity of staff are comprehensive and in line with our obligations under the RES. Our monitoring has shown that our employment policies and processes are in line with best practice;</p>
	<p pid="c.709W.2/11" class="indent">in 2003 we set up a Partnerships and Networks Development Unit to engage with a wider range of external communities in the UK. This helped to meet the requirement of the Race Equality Duty to promote good relations between people from different ethnic communities. Individual Directorates and overseas Posts also engage with minority ethnic communities on a regular basis;</p>
	<p pid="c.709W.2/12" class="indent">in 2006 we drew up a new recruitment strategy to encourage greater diversity in our recruitment and to consolidate our outreach efforts.

	<p pid="c.710W.2/3">(Figures rounded to nearest &pound;100).</p>
	<p pid="c.710W.2/4">The FCO has two categories of bonus awards. The majority are awarded during the annual pay round based on appraisal evidence of performance during the year. The appraisal rating and the rank of the individual determine the size of the bonus. The median bonus payment for delegated grades in 2006 was &pound;900. The average award for staff in the Senior Management Structure (SMS) was &pound;5,146.</p>
	<p pid="c.710W.2/5">The remainder are awards under a Devolved Bonus Scheme, which allows Directorates to nominate staff in the delegated grades, particularly the most junior, for smaller bonuses during the year for exceptional contributions above and beyond normal responsibilities. In financial year 2005-06 the average bonus under this scheme was &pound;395.</p>
	<p pid="c.710W.2/6">Our policy is to differentiate reward to staff and link it directly to performance. We therefore spend a high proportion of annual reward in the form of non-pensionable bonus payments designed to help drive high performance in the FCO. The framework for bonus payments to staff in the SMS/Senior Civil Service is set centrally by the Cabinet Office for all Whitehall Departments.</p>

Since the request to enter the European Parliament was submitted just a few days before, only 12 representatives of the group, from many different nationalities, were permitted entry to the Parliament with their Kirpans. The representatives of the group were able to speak to some Members of the European Parliament. If the group had applied further in advance then entrance for all would have been facilitated. There have been no EU discussions of this issue.</p>

	<p pid="c.717W.2/2">The reason that licence points accrued in Northern Ireland are not simply added to those accrued in Great Britain in consideration of possible disqualification from driving is that the points are issued in separate jurisdictions under separate (and in Northern Ireland devolved) legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/3">Any sentencing court in Great Britain may, if presented with a Northern Ireland licence or its paper counterpart, take into account information contained on it, including Northern Ireland penalty points, if it so wishes.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/4">Any driver disqualified from driving in Great Britain is also so disqualified in Northern Ireland, and vice versa, as a result of measures introduced in the Crime (International Cooperation) Act 2003 and the Road Traffic (Driving Disqualifications) (Northern Ireland) Order 2003, and brought into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-11">11 October 2004</phrase>. The 2003 Act and the 2003 Order also enacted the necessary primary legislation to enable us to ratify the 1998 International Convention on driving disqualifications.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/5">We have given priority to dealing with the most serious offenders, by concentrating on driving disqualifications, where officials of all three Administrations, Great Britain, Northern Ireland and Ireland, are working closely together to initiate cooperation between the United Kingdom and Ireland as soon as practicable within the framework of the 1998 International Convention.</p>
	<p pid="c.717W.2/6">The Department is examining the feasibility and implications of bringing into effect mutual recognition of penalty points for motoring offences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This is being done as part of a wider study, undertaken in cooperation with the Irish Government, of the feasibility of cooperation between the United Kingdom and Ireland to penalise motoring offences. I hope to be able to take a view on the way forward at the same time as we initiate practical cooperation on driving disqualifications between the UK and Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="c.723W.5/1">Our bio-security guidance to farmers has consistently highlighted the need to limit and control access to poultry flocks wherever possible, and to prevent incursion by wild birds and rodents. Access to poultry sheds via ventilation systems should be regularly inspected as a routine part of good bio-security practice.</p>

	<p pid="c.724W.8/1">The Government have already set statutory performance standards for recycling and composting for all local authorities in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.724W.8/2">261 authorities (66 per cent.) in England met or exceeded their individual targets in 2005-06, with households recycling 26.7 per cent. of their waste. This exceeded the Government target of 25 per cent. and was a 4 per cent. increase from the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="c.724W.8/3">However, we still have more to do to increase our recycling and composting rates, which is why we have raised local authorities' existing 'floor level' target from 18 to 20 per cent. for 2007-08. This higher baseline target will ensure a more even level of service provision across the country and help close the gap between the lowest and the highest performing local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.724W.8/4">In October 2006, the Government published the Local Government White Paper, &quot;Strong and Prosperous Communities&quot;. In the new local government framework, the new generation of local area agreements (LAA) will include a single set of targets for improvement (a maximum of 35 out of the 200 mandatory indicators), tailored to local needs and agreed between Government and local partners. There will be a duty for local authorities and other local partners to work together to agree the priorities in the LAA. Once agreed with Government, local partners would be required to have regard to these priorities for improvement. In this way central government is focusing its action on the things that really matter to people everywhere, guaranteeing national minimum standards, but also leaving room for local innovation and local priorities. We are developing proposals for how waste should feature in this new framework.</p>

	<p pid="c.725W.5/2">It is the responsibility of each local authority (LA) to decide how best to collect and manage their waste; DEFRA does not assess LA performances on the collection of specific materials.</p>
	<p pid="c.725W.5/3">However, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) report, &quot;Realising the value of recovered glass&quot;, published in January 2007, included an assessment of current collection processes and the impact this has had on the market for recovered glass.</p>
	<p pid="c.725W.5/4">WRAP's report found that, although almost all LAs now operate kerbside dry recyclable collection schemes, only around two-thirds of them collect glass, Very few materials recovery facilities currently accept glass, which makes it difficult for it to be collected when co-mingled with other recyclables. Collecting glass separately from other dry recyclable materials can be expensive.</p>
	<p pid="c.725W.5/5">Nevertheless, the report found that the amount of glass collected by LAs via the municipal waste stream has increased in recent years. In 2005-06, local LAs in England recovered 377 thousand tonnes of glass from kerbside collections, with a further 382 thousand tonnes from bring/civic amenity sites. This compares to around 160 thousand tonnes from kerbside collections, with another 390 thousand tonnes from bring sites in 2004-05.</p>
	<p pid="c.725W.5/6">In 2002, only 84 LAs had kerbside glass collection schemes, compared to the estimated 300 authorities by mid 2006. The number of LAs operating such schemes is expected to increase further over the next few years as LA's targets for recycling and composting become even more demanding.</p>
	<p pid="c.725W.5/7">WRAP will also shortly be initiating a project to improve LA's understanding Of the quality Standards required for the different uses of recycled glass, how to achieve those standards and the relative environmental benefits of different end uses.</p>

	<p pid="c.726W.2/1">Recycling is strongly promoted by a range of Government policies and we have set demanding targets, both nationally and locally, for household waste recycling and composting.</p>
	<p pid="c.726W.2/2">Recycling and composting of household waste has doubled in the last four years and almost quadrupled since 1997. Our consultation on the Waste Strategy review, carried out last year, also included proposals to set much more ambitious household waste recycling and composting targets, to reach 40 per cent. by 2010 and 50 per cent. by 2020. The targets are not material-specific, but we expect the range of materials collected by local authorities to increase further as recycling and composting targets become more demanding and as collection and treatment capacity increases.</p>
	<p pid="c.726W.2/3">Expanding kerbside collection service is one way to help drive up recycling rates and under the Household Waste Recycling Act 2003, all local authorities in England are required to collect at least two types of recyclable waste from all households in their area by the end of 2010. Most households already receive this, or a better level of service.</p>
	<p pid="c.726W.2/4">Government support for, and engagement with, the poorest performing authorities will help close the gap between the poorest and the best performing local authorities and ensure a more even level of service provision across the country. Local authorities' ever diminishing landfill allowances, allocated under the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme, also provide a strong incentive to divert greater amounts of biodegradable waste (including compostable garden and kitchen waste), from landfill, as does the escalating landfill tax.</p>
	<p pid="c.726W.2/5">On a national basis, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), funded by DEFRA and the devolved Administrations, is working to promote sustainable waste management by creating stable and efficient markets for recycled materials and products. WRAP also runs the Recycling and Organics Technical Advisory Team (ROTATE), which provides support and advice available to all local authorities in England on the separate collection of dry recyclables and organic wastes. This includes advice to those authorities planning to introduce a new scheme or the collection of new materials.</p>

It was produced in partnership with the BBSRC and was subsequently reviewed by the Defra Management board and BBSRC council on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-23">23 November 2006</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-05">5 December 2006</phrase> respectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.727W.2/3">The report provides a comprehensive overview of the VLA and IAH and recognises the essential services the two institutes provide to the UK in the field of animal and public health. It also acknowledges their research and surveillance activities, which provide cutting edge science for application in the field and highlights that there is much to be gained through closer co-operation between the two institutes.</p>
	<p pid="c.727W.2/4">Based on their scientific activities and provision of services to the UK, the report provides a reasoned case for the option for merger to be considered further. Further analysis to identify suitable governance arrangements and work to build an agreed business case would be required before this could happen. Therefore, Defra, in agreement with the BBSRC, considers that the VLA and IAH should remain separate organisations while actively continuing to explore opportunities for greater collaboration, in line with option A of the Preston report.</p>

	<p pid="c.727W.5/1">The regulation of veterinary medicines is controlled by EC directive 2001/82 as amended by directive 2004/28/EC. The Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2006 (VMR) implement this directive in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.727W.5/2">The directive and the VMR permit veterinary surgeons to use other medicines where no authorised veterinary medicinal product exists for the condition in the animal being treated. This is called the Prescribing Cascade and allows, among other options, for a human medicine to be prescribed where there is a clinical need.</p>
	<p pid="c.727W.5/3">Veterinary medicine is private medicine and there is no specific legislation governing the cost of veterinary medicines. The Competition Commission (CC) reported on the Supply of Prescription Only Medicines in April 2003. They made a number of recommendations to improve the competitiveness of the veterinary medicines market and these are being implemented. No assessment has been made of the cost of drugs or the affordability of care for sick domestic animals although this is, of course, only one element in the total cost of treatment.</p>

	<p pid="c.728W.2/2">The appointment of local veterinary inspectors (LVIs) by the state veterinary service (SVS) is covered in 'General Procedures for Local Veterinary Inspectors' (chapter 58A of the SVS instructions). The chapter has been agreed with the British Veterinary Association and a copy is held by each veterinary practice that provides LVI resource to the SVS.</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.2/3">LVI appointments are approved on the basis that they will operate within the specifics of the 'Memorandum of Conditions of Appointment'. This Memorandum states that</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.2/4" class="indent">&quot;the appointment of a LVI should terminate on reaching the age of 65 unless the Minister, in his or her absolute discretion, decides that it shall continue&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="c.728W.2/6">The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 specifically exclude the provision of goods and services and DEFRA, therefore, does not consider the Memorandum of Conditions of Appointment of LVIs to be in breach of this legislation.</p>

We are unable to break this figure down by service as this information is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.5/2">However, we are able to break down the number of Army personnel admitted to our independent provider of in-patient mental health treatment. In the period <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-15">15 February 2007</phrase>, 311 personnel were admitted in total, of which 184 were members of the Army.</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.5/3">MOD has sponsored research by Kings College, London to gain further understanding of the extent of mental health problems encountered by those who have served on Operation Telic. Kings College London published reports in May 2006 which concluded that the overwhelming majority of our servicemen and women are returning from operations in Iraq in good health, and that there has been no significant difference between the mental health of regulars who did deploy to Iraq and of those who did not.</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.5/4">The study did find that a slightly higher percentage of reservists who served on Telic 1 displayed symptoms of common mental health problems and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than reservists who did not deploy.

Follow-up support was provided for one year by the two social work assistants.</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.8/2">With the closure of DKPH on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>, and the transfer of inpatient mental healthcare to the Priory Group, the two social work assistant posts and the specialist administrator post were disbanded. One mental health senior social worker (MHSSW) remained in Catterick, to cover the North of England; one was posted to RAF Leuchers to cover Scotland and Northern Ireland; and a third was posted to Tidworth Garrison to cover the rest of England. Army Primary Health took over responsibility and funding for these three posts.</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.8/3">During the financial year 2004-05 each of the three services agreed to fund the establishment of one further mental health social worker post, bringing the total to six, based at RAF Leuchers (Scotland and NI); Catterick (Northern England); RAF Cranwell (Midlands and Wales); Colchester (London and the East of England); Tidworth, South and Middle England); and Portsmouth, South West.</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.8/4">For 2005-06-07 the establishment and staff in post have remained the same, except that, due to staff long term sickness, the RAF have funded a locum post at RAF Brize Norton from September 2006 to April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.734W.8/5">It should be noted that the requirement and provision for mental health social workers is kept under constant review. None of these staff are or have been uniformed.</p>

	<p pid="c.737W.5/1">The Military Managed Ward (MMW) at Selly Oak reached Initial Operating Capability just before Christmas 2006. It provides clinical care by a combined team of military and civilian personnel for military patients whose clinical condition allows for them to be nursed in this ward. There are military managers involved at every level on the MMW, with a Military Ward Manager responsible for all aspects of the military presence on the ward, whether staff, or patient issues, and for liaising with appropriate authorities. The MMW Ward Manager is assisted by three Military Deputy Ward Managers who are responsible for the planning and delivery of patient care.</p>
	<p pid="c.737W.5/2">An enhanced military nursing structure is in place for this ward comprising military nurses and military health care assistants. Military nursing staff are on duty on every shift on the ward. In addition patients have the support of the Defence Welfare Service and military liaison officers based at the hospital.</p>
	<p pid="c.737W.5/3">Full operating capability for the MMW is planned to be declared by this summer, subject to successful completion of building works within Ward S4.</p>

	<p pid="c.738W.3/1">The Refreshment Department recognises the economic, environmental and social advantages of sourcing <i> (a)</i> seasonal and <i> (b)</i> local produce as part of its responsible purchasing agenda, but must achieve this within the constraints of the European public procurement regulations, which prevent local positive discrimination between EU members.</p>
	<p pid="c.738W.3/2">The Department is working closely with its suppliers to increase the awareness of chefs and other food buyers of the seasonality and availability of produce, and the recently appointed executive chef has commenced a programme of reviewing all menus to increase the use of local and seasonal produce. In the absence of a legal definition of &quot;local produce&quot;, this is taken by the Refreshment Department to apply to all UK produce. On this basis, almost 100 per cent. of fresh meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy produce is locally sourced, and an estimated 25-30 per cent. of fruit and vegetables when in season.</p>

The lifts, while adjacent, have different functions. HoP 77 in addition to being a Members only lift has been converted to be accessible by wheelchairs and serves the ground, Principal, first and second floors. HoP 15 serves the Refreshment Department basement in addition to these floors.</p>
	<p pid="c.739W.2/2">The controls for both lifts have been linked with an option to operate independently or together (duplex). There are advantages and disadvantages of each mode of operation. In independent mode a specific lift can be called. If, however, the user has no preference, both call buttons could be pressed causing slower service to other floors. In duplex mode the nearest lift is sent, ensuring best service to all floors. During a Division, however, the Members only lift may be called by a non-Member resulting in slower service to Members. Furthermore if the user requires the disabled lift, this may not be the one that arrives.</p>
	<p pid="c.739W.2/3">Switching between either operation mode is straightforward. The controls are currently set on independent mode to favour Members during a Division and disabled Members, staff and visitors.</p>

	<p pid="c.739W.5/1">In 2005-06 36 per cent. of the parliamentary estate's waste collected was sent for recycling. A number of steps are being taken to increase recycling of waste such as: increasing awareness; introducing an environmental management system; separating waste; and introducing battery recycling bins. These are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.739W.5/2" class="italic"> Increasing awareness</p>
	<p pid="c.739W.5/3">An environmental awareness campaign was started in late 2005 which has included guest speaker presentations, exhibitions, a film show and articles in the inHouse staff magazine. A waste management exhibition is currently being considered for the parliamentary estate.</p>
	<p pid="c.739W.5/4" class="italic"> Environmental Management System</p>
	<p pid="c.739W.5/5">The House of Commons has agreed for an environmental management system to be implemented on its estate and the House of Lords will consider this in the near future. It is intended, as a first step towards implementing this, to run an environment champions programme on the parliamentary estate. This programme will be run with the purpose of reducing energy consumption and increasing waste recycling in the estate's buildings.</p>
	<p pid="c.739W.5/6" class="italic"> Separation of Waste</p>
	<p pid="c.739W.5/7">The waste contractor will shortly be providing a recycling operative on the estate to further separate the waste collected from inside the buildings, since some waste which has been contaminated with other waste cannot be sent for recycling and has to be incinerated instead. The employment of a recycling operative should increase the quantity of waste sent for recycling and decrease the quantity of waste sent for incineration. Any metal which has not been collected on the estate for recycling, is separated from the general waste at the incineration plant and sent for recycling from there.</p>
	<p pid="c.739W.5/8" class="italic"> Recycling bins</p>
	<p pid="c.739W.5/9">Bins for collecting batteries for recycling will be located in each parliamentary estate building soon and more recycling bins will be located in the Palace of Westminster and Refreshment Department outlets.</p>

	<p pid="c.740W.2/1">No estimates have been made of the potential for the generation of energy from solar panels on the roofs of the parliamentary estate.</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.2/2">In late 2005, a brief study was conducted to assess the potential for solar photovoltaic (PV) and solar hot water systems on the vast areas of pitched and flat roofs of the Palace of Westminster. The report said that large areas of the roof would be suitable for the installation of either solar PV or hot water systems, but the integration and connection of solar hot water systems to the building's existing hot water services would be &quot;complex, expensive, aesthetically challenging and perhaps be of little benefit given the small quantity of hot water used within the Palace during the summer months&quot;. Utilising solar PV systems would provide better value for money but the simple payback period would still be far longer than the expected life of the systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.740W.2/3">A consultant has recently prepared a report on several renewable energy system options for the Palace of Westminster and this report is currently being considered to determine which systems should be investigated further. A proposal from another consultant to conduct feasibility studies for utilising renewable energy systems in all the parliamentary estate outbuildings has been received and considered and it is expected that these studies will start within the next few months.</p>

	<p pid="c.751W.0/1">The Learning and Skills Council published a report of a survey 'Impact on Adults with Learning Difficulties and/or Disabilities&mdash;Issues from the 2006/07 Planning Round' in February 2007. The survey was conducted to ascertain whether courses for adults with learning difficulties and/or disabilities had been reduced from September 2006 onwards on the basis of funding or inadequacy. The report concluded that changes in provision were targeted on inadequate and poor performing courses and not because of cost cutting measures. The Learning and Skills Council will continue to monitor the situation, and report again later this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.751W.0/2">This LSC survey shows there has not been any wholesale reduction of provision and that in the majority of cases identified reasons for reductions have been sound and done in consultation with the local LSC and other partners and learners. Alternatives have been sought and provided in the majority of cases. It is not appropriate that learners should receive provision of poor quality that does not offer progression and where they may be learning very little.</p>

	<p pid="c.751W.3/1">The programme expenditure incurred by the Learning and Skills Council at local authority level is not collected by my Department. This is an operational matter for the LSC as they determine the level of funding required at local level to deliver their key priorities and targets. Mark Haysom, the council's Chief Executive, has written to the hon. Member with further information and a copy of his reply has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.751W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Mark Haysom, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-19">19 February 2007</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.751W.3/3" class="indent">I am writing in response to your Parliamentary Question, how much the Learning and Skills Agency spent on programme expenditure in Peterborough City Council area in each year since 2001. I thank you for your enquiry but unfortunately I am unable to provide you with the information you seek.</p>
	<p pid="c.751W.3/4" class="indent">There are 47 local offices of the Learning and Skills Council each of which is responsible for the management of a local budget. The key priorities and targets that relate to each of the 47 local offices are not aligned to Local Authority areas. Cambridgeshire LSC includes the Unitary Authority of Peterborough and Cambridgeshire County Council. The LSC contracts out its programme budgets to local providers who deliver both within and across local authority boundaries. Our management information systems therefore do not routinely hold information on programme spend that relates to a single Local Authority area.</p>
	<p pid="c.751W.3/5" class="indent">We can, with relative ease, identify what spend against a specific budget line has been contracted or spent as a whole, or with, a particular provider. However, in the main our provider contracts do not specify that learners or activity must be in specific local authority areas. For example some of our providers may contract with us via an office in Peterborough but may utilise their funds to deliver activity outside the Unitary Authority area of Peterborough. In order for us to track where activity occurred we would need to analyse our learner data and work out costings for each learner. This would be considerably time-consuming, particularly for the requested period of six years. I fully appreciate why this information would be of interest to you but we do not gather or hold information in this format.</p>
	<p pid="c.751W.3/6" class="indent">We are able to determine total programme funding spend within the Cambridgeshire LSC area. If you would like this information we will be able to provide it, but we would expect a task such as this, which extends to a period before the inception of the LSC, to take approximately four weeks. We would also have to buy in additional resources to review and analyse archived financial records so as to provide a response.</p>
	<p pid="c.751W.3/7" class="indent">Should you wish us to proceed with your enquiry, or discuss your request further, please contact: Dr Jon Nay, Area Director, Cambridgeshire (Jon.Nay@lsc.gov.uk, 01733 895202).</p>

As the then Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, West, reported to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-19">19 January 2006</phrase> there were 4,045 individuals on List 99, <phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-01-19.967"><i> Official Report</i> column 967</phrase>. A significant proportion of these have been barred as a result of child sexual offences.

The information about offences or allegations that have led to a person being barred or restricted by the Secretary of State is not included in List 99. The identification of all the cases where a person has been placed on the List as a result of a conviction for a sexual offence against a child would require each of the 4045 case files to be checked could be undertaken only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.756W.5/1">The Education Act 2005 requires that the School Organisation Committee and Schools Adjudicator must have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State when deciding secondary school competition proposals. The relevant guidance was issued in August 2006 and is available on the Department's School Organisation website. The guidance sets out a range of factors that must be considered including: the effect on local standards and contribution to school improvement; whether the proposed admission arrangements are fair and equitable; the extent of parental demand for the type of school; the impact on local diversity; cost effectiveness; the views of interested parties; the contribution to local community cohesion and also the needs of families and the wider community. The guidance also makes it clear that the decision maker must balance the different strengths of all the proposals and decide which best meets the criteria for a new school overall and also the specific requirements for the new school.</p>

	<p pid="c.758W.8/2">Data are drawn from the operational client management systems maintained by Connexions services. It only includes those people known to the service (about 85 per cent. of the population); some young people who attended independent schools or were at school outside England are excluded.

The definition differs from that used to measure the national departmental PSA NEET target. Along with not covering the entire population, the Connexions NEET measure excludes those on gap years, those in custody and those undertaking voluntary work. The PSA measure is for academic rather than calendar age 16-18.</p>

	<p pid="c.762W.13/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that environmental issues are addressed at all levels, including the local level. We want to ensure that, where local area agreements can contribute to the delivery of the Government's and local areas' environmental objectives, they do so. Many local areas have already chosen to include targets relating to environmental issues in their local area agreements. Local area agreements have already facilitated enhanced partnership working between local bodies of the type necessary to ensure that environmental issues are addressed effectively and in partnership. The duties on local authorities and their local partners proposed in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill will further facilitate such joint working, including by making local area agreements the single mechanism for central and local government to agree targets to reflect the key priorities for improvement in each local area.</p>

	<p pid="c.764W.6/2">The purpose of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, as amended by the Consumer Credit Act 2006 is to provide for consumer protection in relation to the provision of credit and hire purchase transactions. A debit card is purely a payment mechanism, not a vehicle for the extension of credit and thus falls outside the scope of the Act. Similarly, a charge card does not provide credit as, although it enables the cardholder to defer payment for goods and services, the full balance must be settled each month.</p>

	<p pid="c.779W.0/1">International comparisons of benefit receipt are difficult to make because of differences in benefit design, definitions of disability and demographics. Although information is not available to make comparisons with other EU countries, the available evidence shows that the proportion of the working age population in the UK in receipt of incapacity benefits is 6.6 per cent., slightly below the OECD average of 7 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="c.782W.5/1">If state second pension remained unchanged, it would become a flat-rate benefit around 2056. However, in line with the recommendation of the Pensions Commission, we have put in place the means to accelerate this eventuality. Through the measures introduced in the Pensions Bill the state second pension will become completely flat-rate in around 2030. We believe this strikes the appropriate balance between moving quickly to flat-rate provision, and providing a transitional period where some earnings-related compulsion remains for a period while personal accounts bed in.</p>

	<p pid="c.793W.8/1">As stated in the Regulatory Impact Assessment of the Identity Cards Bill, published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-25">25 May 2005</phrase>, it is estimated that the cost of a card reader would fall within a range of &pound;250 to &pound;750 depending on their level of sophistication and performance&mdash;for example, whether they are able to check a biometric as well as the card in high-risk, high- value transactions where the card is present.</p>
	<p pid="c.793W.8/2">However, integrated with other security and verification requirements, this cost could fall substantially over the years ahead and no allowance has been made in these figures for reductions in cost due to volume discount or cost reductions owing to an increasingly competitive market for card readers, particularly in the wake of the rollout of the 'Chip and PIN' network.</p>

A second edition (ISBN 0-11-341313-0) will be published shortly. In addition, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate has prepared a short publication, 'Living and Working in Britain', which will soon be available in a printed version and on the IND website in a number of languages.

	<p pid="c.807W.0/1">Biomedicines are medicines that are made from, or contain, biological active substances, unlike conventional medicines, which contain chemical active substances.</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.0/2">Pharmaceutical manufacturers are allowed to copy branded medicines once all patent and data protection periods have expired. Copies of branded conventional medicines are known as generics and copies of biomedicines are known as biosimilar medicines. Because of the biological nature of biomedicines and biosimilar medicines, there may be subtle differences between the branded reference product and each copy product. This means that there are additional factors to be considered when copies of biomedicines are made and when they are assessed by the regulator for a marketing authorisation.</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.0/3">Under current regulations a company applying for a marketing authorisation for a biosimilar medicine must provide comprehensive data to demonstrate the quality of its product, and include data to show that its product is comparable to the reference product. It must also submit safety and efficacy data, although the extent of such data will depend on the product and its similarity to the reference product. Much of the clinical data to support an application for a marketing authorisation for a biosimilar product will derive from separate clinical trials conducted using this product.</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.0/4">In contrast, manufacturers of copies of conventional medicines (generics) are required only to demonstrate bio-equivalence with the relevant reference product, which broadly means that they only need to demonstrate that if the same dose of the generic and reference product is given, the same effect can be expected.</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.0/5">Applicants for marketing authorisations for all medicines (including biosimilar medicines) must provide a description of their pharmacovigilance system (this is a description of how they intend to monitor the safety of the medicine in use). The requirements of a pharmacovigilance system are laid down in legislation. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) carries out inspections to ensure the pharmacovigilance system is suitable and the company is fulfilling its obligations. Companies wanting to market a new product must also provide a risk management plan which describes the current knowledge of the product, outlines a plan to fill any gaps in knowledge and any measures needed to minimise any risk from the product.</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.0/6">Because biosimilar medicines are not identical copies of reference products, the subtle differences may make a difference to their effect when taken by patients. These differences may not become fully apparent until greater experience in the use of the medicines has been established. It is preferable, therefore, that when such products are prescribed they should be clearly identified and prescribed by brand name to ensure that patients receive the exact product prescribed and that their safety in use can be properly monitored.</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.0/7">Information on how to use a medicine and the possible side effects associated with its use is provided to patients in the patient information leaflet (PIL) which accompanies the medicine. When new information arises that impacts on the balance of risk and benefit of any medicine this is evaluated and, where appropriate, the PIL is amended, and if necessary health professionals are advised.</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.0/8">Health professionals and patients are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to any medicine to the MHRA via the voluntary yellow card scheme, which collects and monitors such reports, evaluates them and takes any action necessary to ensure patient safety. The MHRA is committed to increasing overall reporting of adverse reactions and an Expert Advisory Group of the Commission on Human Medicines is advising on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.0/9">The rules governing the content of an application for a biosimilar medicine and the assessment undertaken by the regulator are laid down in legislation and guidelines. Specifically, the data requirements to support an application for a biosimilar medicine are outlined in Section 4 of Part II of Annex 1 of Directive 2003/63/EC. Volume 9a of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union, which provides guidance on applying the legislation, was published by the Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-25">25 January 2007</phrase>. The MHRA has participated in all the groups that have discussed these provisions and has endorsed the European legislation that sets out the rules for assessing applications for biosimilar medicines and the various guidelines including the Guidelines on Similar Biological Medicinal Products drawn up by the EU Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use.</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.0/10">To date only two biosimilar products (growth hormones) have been authorised for use in the United Kingdom. They were both authorised through the European centralised procedure overseen by the European Medicines Agency. They are intended to be prescribed by physicians adequately experienced in diagnosis and management of patients with growth deficiency. The Government are not aware any of any reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with the use of these two products.</p>

Clinical responsibility rests with the NHS professional who makes the decision to refer and who must therefore be able to justify any treatment they recommend.

It includes as part of its printed resources, and on the SunSmart website, information to promote awareness of the risks to health associated with the use of sun beds. It emphasises the risks for minors, and others who are particularly vulnerable to ultra-violet rays, for example due to skin type or family history. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE)guideline for customers and operators of sun beds also recommends that sun beds should not be used by young people under 16 years, and the Department and the HSE are in discussion about whether this guidance needs to be strengthened.</p>
