Individuals may not work beyond the age of 70 except in exceptional circumstances. The normal retirement age in the senior civil service is 60. However, the Department retains members of the senior civil service if it is judged to be in the public interest to do so and it is satisfied as to the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties. This flexibility allows the Department to meet its business needs, retaining valuable knowledge and skills, while giving staff as much choice as possible about when they retire.</p>

	<p pid="b.487W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/2">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/3" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-11">11 May 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/4" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions regarding (1) the size of the electorate and the registration rate in each local authority in (i) England, (ii) Wales, (iii) Scotland and (iv) Northern Ireland in each of the last 10 years; (2) the percentage of those eligible to vote who were registered to vote in each local authority in (a) England, (b) Wales, (c) Scotland and (d) Northern Ireland in each of the last 10 years and (3) the total electorate for (a) the Vale of Clwyd and (b) Denbighshire in each of the last 10 years. (68582, 64195 and 65905)</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/5" class="indent">Firstly, please allow me to explain why it has taken a little while to reply to your questions. I understand from the House of Commons Library that you are most interested in Parliamentary electorate by local authority. This is not a standard output so it has taken some time to collate the data and ensure it is on an equivalent basis. This is further complicated by different data being available for England &amp; Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Electoral data are held locally by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS), the Electoral Office Northern Ireland (EONI) and for England &amp; Wales the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Regarding the question on total electorate for Denbighshire and the Vale of Clwyd, we do not normally publish data on total electorate (rather we publish local/European electorate and separately Parliamentary electorate data). For years up to and including 2001, data are not held electronically in a form that enables us to calculate 'total electorate'. Therefore, in order to obtain the data you requested we have referred to the annual paper returns from Denbighshire to collate the necessary data.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/6" class="indent">Historical UK Electorate by LA</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/7" class="indent">Electoral data are available on the number of people registered to vote in Parliamentary elections and also on the number of people registered to vote in local/European elections. Annual population data are only available on a &quot;usual residence&quot; basis: the mid-year population estimates. Since population data are available by age, the mid-year population aged 18 and over can be calculated. Thus it is possible to calculate an estimate of the 'registration rate' using &quot;the percentage of the usually resident population, aged 18 and over who are registered to vote&quot; as either Parliamentary or local/European electors).</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/8" class="indent">It is not possible to 'split' estimates of the usual resident population in order to give estimates of the population entitled to vote. We do not hold data (e.g. populations of non-EU citizens) that enable us to produce such a 'split'.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/9" class="indent">The attached tables (one for each year), therefore, provide information, for each local authority in the UK, on (i) the annual 'usual resident' mid-year population; (ii) the size of the (a) Parliamentary electorate and (b) local/European electorate; and (iii) the percentage of the &quot;estimated usually resident population&quot; aged 18 and over who are registered to vote as (a) Parliamentary electors and (b) local/European electors. These are labelled as 'registration rates' on the tables and this term is used in the remainder of this reply. These data provide the closest available approximation to the information you requested. It is not possible to calculate the percentage of the eligible population who are registered to vote: the resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/10" class="indent">This 'registration rate' is not a published National Statistic: there are a number of issues that mean care needs to be taken when interpreting the data. In particular care needs to be taken when considering local authorities where the usually resident population differs radically from the population eligible to vote. An example of such a local authority is Forest Heath. There are a large number of United States Air Force personnel, contractors, and dependants in Forest Heath who, as American citizens, are not eligible to vote. These people are however included in the population estimates as they are usually resident. Therefore, the estimated 'registration rate' calculated for Forest Heath is considerably reduced. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), in order to aid comparisons of the resident population of voting age and the number of people who are registered to vote, does calculate 'registration rates' on occasion in the manner outlined above.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/11" class="indent">The attached tables give comparisons between the number of registered electors and annual mid-year population for the ten years up to mid-2004 (the latest available population estimates for the UK) for all local authorities in the UK. Each table shows a comparison against Parliamentary electorate (where available) and against local/European electorate. The availability of Parliamentary electorate by LA differs by country as this is a non-standard output. Data availability also differs from year to year. Recent improvements to the way the data are held for England and Wales mean these data can now be calculated for more recent years. For England and Wales data on Parliamentary electorate by LA, for years prior to 2002, could only be calculated by reference to individual paper LA annual returns and would involve disproportionate cost. For Scotland, 2004 data on Parliamentary electors by LA will be available shortly and we will provide you with an update of these tables when they become available. For Northern Ireland data on Parliamentary electors by LA are not currently available.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/12" class="indent">In order to give an estimate of the number of electors at the mid-year point, <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>, a weighted average is taken of the two closest sets of electoral data. This gives the best possible comparison with the population estimates. Footnotes to the tables indicate the formulae used to calculate these weighted comparisons.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/13" class="indent">Attainers have been excluded from the electorate data to give the best possible comparison. Therefore, the data may differ to that published elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/14" class="indent">We have also updated the data where there are known (small) errors in or updates to previously published data. This means that the attached data provide the best possible comparison.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/15" class="indent">The local/European electorate gives a better comparison than parliamentary electorate to the usually resident population as EU citizens are included and UK citizens resident abroad are excluded from the local/European electorate. However, a number of other difficulties remain when comparing these sources. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible) and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place (e.g. students may register at parental and term-time addresses). These factors may have a differential impact from place to place.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/16" class="indent">There is also inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate (both parliamentary and local/European) as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This is the main reason some areas show apparent rates in excess of one hundred per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/17" class="indent">In order to aid comparison two further tables are attached that show the estimated 'registration rates' for all ten years. Table A shows these rates for Parliamentary electors and Table B for local/European electors. However, any comparison of these data across years should be made carefully as electoral legislation and other changes (such as EU expansion) can change the size of the electorate.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/18" class="indent">A copy of the tables will be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.487W.3/19" class="indent">The tables provide as comprehensive as possible comparisons between historic local authority population and electorate numbers. I understand from the House of Commons Library that you are also interested in the percentage of residents who are registered to vote on a Parliamentary constituency basis. Official Report number 82 column 1719, <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-12">12 December 2005</phrase>, provides the best possible consistent UK comparison for Parliamentary constituencies. For England and Wales we hope to investigate the possibility of producing population estimates by Parliamentary constituency in the future using Small Area Population Estimates. For Northern Ireland, population estimates by Parliamentary constituency are already available from the Northern Ireland Statistical and Research Agency (NISRA).

	<p pid="b.494W.6/4">Our current approach in &quot;Opportunity for All&quot; is to present a range of low income thresholds (50, 60 and 70 per cent. of median income). This gives an idea of the depth of poverty and it is simple to interpret. Indeed, the incorporation of two different relative low income thresholds into our new child poverty measure (60 and 70 per cent. of median income), together with the absolute tier, further ensures that different depths of poverty will be looked at separately.</p>

	<p pid="b.496W.2/4" class="indent">As noted in Table 1 of the Agency's Quarterly Summary Statistics (QSS), the old scheme caseload reduced from 965,000 in March 2005 to 923,000 in March 2006. There are three reasons for this fall:</p>
	<p pid="b.496W.2/5" class="indent">i. Some cases will have been closed or withdrawn either at the request of the parent with care or because the youngest child in a case has reached an age at which he or she no longer qualifies for child support, and any outstanding arrears on that case have been paid by the non-resident parent.</p>
	<p pid="b.496W.2/6" class="indent">ii. Some cases will have had relevant links to new schema cases and been reactively converted onto the new scheme during the period in question.</p>
	<p pid="b.496W.2/7" class="indent">iii. The old scheme no longer has any intake-any new applications received by the Agency from 3rd March 2003 onwards are treated as new scheme applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.496W.2/8" class="indent">The above means that the old scheme caseload can be expected to reduce steadily over time. It should be noted that the Agency's new scheme caseload increased by 144,000 over the same period, from 452,000 to 596,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.502W.5/5" class="indent">The establishment of DCS as an Agency on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-01">1 November 2004</phrase> marked an increased focus on understanding the needs of its customers through early and proactive consultation with customer representative organisations. As changes have been made to some of the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) claim forms over the last year, DCS has undertaken specific consultation activity with the DCS Advisory Forum and where appropriate the wider lobby. The DCS Advisory Forum is the Disability and Carers Service's (DCS) main mechanism for consulting with the Voluntary and Community Sector. The forum was originally established in 1998 to provide advice and guidance to officials of DCS and the Department on the impact of change initiatives on disabled customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.502W.5/6" class="indent">We are currently reviewing the DLA National claim form. This will be issued to the DCS Advisory Forum in May. Full consideration will be given to any comments received and full responses to those comments will be provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.502W.5/7" class="indent">In July 2005, we consulted with the DCS Advisory Forum on the proposed DLA Adult Claim form to be used within the Customer Case Management (CCM) test taking place at Manchester and Bootle Disability Benefit Centres (DBCs). At special events in July and September 2005, we also consulted with a high number of local voluntary and community organisations within the Manchester and Bootle DBC catchment areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.502W.5/8" class="indent">In January 2006, we returned to the DCS Advisory Forum to consult with them on the proposed second version of the CCM claim form.</p>
	<p pid="b.502W.5/9" class="indent">As a result of this consultation activity, a number of suggestions were submitted, many of which we have been able to incorporate. This has led to improvements being made to the form which will make it easier for customers to understand and answer the questions; provides customers with the option to describe the help they need and the difficulties they have at the end of each question; the layout, format and wording have also been improved and makes the form visibly clearer and easy to read.</p>
	<p pid="b.502W.5/10" class="indent">When a suggestion has been made but not acted upon, for example where the suggestion would unfairly advantage one group of disabled people at the expense of other groups, reasons were given to the Forum to explain why the suggestion was not taken up.</p>
	<p pid="b.502W.5/11" class="indent">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March 2006</phrase>, the provision for customers to make e-claims via the internet for a range of DWP benefits was introduced, including DLA and AA. DCS took the lead on consulting on behalf of the Department with Interactive Demonstration and Preview events of the DWP e-Services taking place in Manchester and Birmingham in November 2005. These events provided customer representative groups with early sight of the DLA, Attendance Allowance, State Pension UK, Jobcentre Plus, and Child Support maintenance application e-forms. The DCS Advisory Forum, Jobcentre Plus Key Stakeholders and the Pension Service Partnerships Against Poverty Group were invited to attend these events, with representation from wider customer representative organisations also attending on the day. As a result of the comments received at these events, improvements to the DLA e-claim form are to be made. Steps are now being taken to include the provision for customer representatives to include their details, an option to provide Textphone details and increasing the size of text boxes.</p>
	<p pid="b.502W.5/12" class="indent">Our consultation approach via the formal DCS Advisory Forum, the wider lobby where appropriate, and via customer feedback channels allows for continuous dialogue and suggestions from our customers or their representatives as to how our claim forms can be improved.</p>

	<p pid="b.503W.2/1">The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 placed new duties on public authorities to promote equality for disabled people, 'the Disability Equality Duty'. This Department (DWP) has taken the following steps to meet the Disability Equality Duty:</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.2/2">DWP is host to the Office for Disability Issues (ODI), which was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase> to take forward the Government's strategy for improving the life chances of disabled people. One element of this work will be to overset the effective implementation of the Disability Equality Duty. The ODI is working in partnership with the Disability Rights Commission to support and encourage Departments to commit to meaningful actions that will improve their policies and services and realise the potential of their diverse workforces.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.2/3">The Department is already working towards the publication of its disability equality schemes by <phrase class="date" code="">4 December 2006</phrase>. The process was formally launched in April 2006 and will mean both central units and agencies involving disabled people in developing action plans for tackling problem areas and identifying positive actions to address these. We have also already begun planning for the Secretary of State's report due in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.2/4">DWP is currently revising its existing guidance on accessible communications with a view to introducing a new standard for information accessibility. This set of standards will form part of the disability equality scheme referred to earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.2/5">We have commissioned public access audits of all its premises used by the public during 2003. A total of 1,735 buildings were surveyed, and a programme of public access improvement works commissioned on 1,032 sites which are scheduled for completion in June 2006. The existing public access provisions are subject to annual review and any future additional requirement is built into the annual maintenance work programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.2/6">The Department wants staff to understand and embrace diversity and an important part of achieving this has been the development of a diversity toolkit which makes all our diversity and equality policy and information easily accessible in one place on an internal website. The toolkit also is now being used by around 70 other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.2/7">The Department is keen to ensure we meet the workplace needs of disabled staff and potential staff and recently DWP has run two pilot exercises on a revised process for delivering reasonable workplace adjustments for staff. The development of the new process was partly in response to the length of time it took to assess and put reasonable adjustments into place, and partly to ensure that the recommended adjustment was the most suitable for that individual. A third pilot is due to start shortly. This will be followed by a formal evaluation exercise. On completion of the first two pilots, and subject to the evaluation, we will commence planning for national implementation across the Department and agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.2/8">DWP encourages all business units to consider the potential impact of policy and services on all equality groups, ahead of future legislation. For example, at least three impact assessments have been completed to date by the Disability and Carers Service, taking into account disability, with a number of additional assessments in the process of being completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.2/9">The Department has been working in partnership with the Employers' Forum on Disability in order to address the needs of its disabled customers. In particular, it has contributed, along with other public and private organisations, to the interactive &quot;Disability Confident&quot; training resource pack which uses both video and DVD format. This addresses the key principles of dealing with disabled people in general, and particularly communications issues relating to those with specific impairments. This earned a special commendation in the prestigious 'World of Learning Awards'.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.2/10">Both the Minister for Disabled People and senior officials participate in an annual series of meetings with disabled customers and those with disability interests to explain current and planned policy, and to gain a better knowledge of people's views and concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.2/11">DWP consults with staff on disability issues through a National Disability Staff Network Group. The Department has recently reviewed all of the staff network groups with the intention of raising their profile and enabling them to contribute to successful diversity outcomes for the Department. Representatives from all of the groups have met with the recently appointed Permanent Secretary twice and he has committed to meet with them on a quarterly basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.2/12">DWP also analyses, and acts upon, staff perceptions on diversity issues in the annual staff attitude survey; and meets regularly with trade unions side to consider disability along with other diversity issues. In addition, staff can raise diversity issues at regular staff forum events held around the country and via a site on the DWP intranet.</p>

	<p pid="b.505W.0/1">The department has undertaken substantial in-house analysis to determine both the trends and the reasons for the change in the number of those claiming incapacity benefit for mental and behavioural disorders.</p>
	<p pid="b.505W.0/2">The rise in the number of people with mental and behavioural disorders claiming incapacity benefits mirrors a rise in the overall number of individuals in the population with mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.505W.0/3">Claimants with mental and behavioural disorders as a primary diagnosis now make up an increasing proportion of the overall caseload accounting for almost 40 per cent. of the total caseload, compared with 25 per cent. in the mid 1990s; although growth in the proportion of the caseload with mental and behavioural disorders has been slowing in recent quarters. This is both because they make up an increasing proportion of inflows and because they have lower off-flow rates than other groups. It follows that, people with mental health conditions are, on average, much more likely to become long-term claimants.</p>

	<p pid="b.512W.3/1">The Government welcome the 2005 annual report of the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), published in March 2006, and congratulates the IWF and their partners on their achievements. The IWF report an increase in the number of reports made to their hotline, from 17,255 in 2004 to 23,658 in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.512W.3/2">This resulted in 6,128 reports being made to law enforcement agencies and other national hotlines around the world. The report also highlights the fact that only 0.4 per cent. of potentially illegal child abuse content identified by the IWF in 2005 was hosted in the UK. This represents a major improvement from 18 per cent. in 1997, and demonstrates the commitment of the IWF, the UK industry, and others, to work collaboratively to remove potentially illegal child abuse content wherever in the world it originates. The IWF report that there were no instances of either criminally obscene content or criminally racist content hosted in the UK during 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.512W.3/3">The Government also pay tribute to the IWF for supplying a list of websites to ISPs, mobile operators, search providers and filtering companies so they can play their part in protecting UK internet users from being inadvertently exposed to potentially illegal child abuse content by various blocking techniques. The fact that the IWF's core funders have grown in number to over 60 is evidence of their strengthening reputation.

	<p pid="b.515W.2/1">We consider that the Sexual Offences Act 2003, with its emphasis on consent freely entered into, is sufficient to prosecute men who knowingly have sex with women against their will, including women who have been illegally trafficked. The Act provides at section 74 that</p>
	<p pid="b.515W.2/2" class="indent">&quot;a person consents if he agrees by choice, and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.515W.2/3">If the trafficked woman is engaging in prostitution under duress then we find it difficult to see how she would be considered to be freely consenting. There are also evidential assumptions at section 75 of the Act which, if proven, will mean that the complainant is taken not to have consented and these include the use and threat of violence and unlawful detention of the victim. Furthermore, creating a further offence of paying for sex with a trafficked woman may give the appearance that it is a lesser offence than rape; it is not.</p>

	<p pid="b.515W.5/2">There is no statutory definition of 'pornography' in UK legislation. Under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 it is a criminal offence to publish any article which is considered to be 'obscene': that is, an article, if its effect when taken as a whole, is such as to tend to 'deprave and corrupt' persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.</p>
	<p pid="b.515W.5/3">In the Government's recent Consultation Paper on the Possession of Extreme Pornographic Material, material which is explicit and has been solely, or primarily produced for the purpose of sexual arousal is considered to be 'pornographic'. By explicit we mean material in which the activity can be clearly seen and is not hidden, disguised or implied. In terms of regulation, we consider the harm that any type of material (whether pornography, violence, portrayal of drugs use, etc.) is likely to cause to the vulnerable, particularly children.</p>

	<p pid="b.519W.6/1">The UK's project assistance priorities have been aligned with the spirit of the UN human rights recommendations in Colombia since the latter were first published in 2003. We also take into account UK Project Programme Priorities, other donors' activities in Colombia and areas where the UK can add particular value through experience or expertise. In Colombia, current priorities for UK project assistance include the protection of child rights, improvements in the rule of law, protection and promotion of freedom of expression and human rights defenders, security sector reform and conflict resolution. We aim to support sustainable institutional reform, as well as the most vulnerable communities in Colombia. The Department for International Development also supports non-governmental organisations' projects in Colombia on sustainable economic development for vulnerable communities, health and education, environment, strengthening civil society and projects to help reduce poverty and inequality.</p>
	<p pid="b.519W.6/2">The EU has long provided the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) office in Colombia with both political and financial support. The EU budget is currently supporting three projects that directly help respond to the needs highlighted in their recommendations, covering capacity building of state and municipal institutions responsible for human rights. Each year the EC delegation in Colombia review the UNHCHR's office's fresh recommendations in order to be able to adapt EU co-operation projects in general, especially in the human rights field.</p>

Following the flawed Presidential elections on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-19">19 March</phrase> the Belarusian regime has moved to crack-down on the opposition and to stifle any dissent. Demonstrations have been broken up and the main opposition leaders and their key supporters have been arrested or detained. The independent press remains muzzled or has been driven underground. Non-governmental organisations are subject to harassment and their funding severely curtailed.

As relevant today as it was in 1965, the NPT offers the best hope of achieving a world free from nuclear weapons. That is why the UK has consistently worked to sustain the objectives and strengthen all three pillars of the treaty.</p>

This is based on an assessment of need and if individuals' needs have not changed there is no reason to expect them to lose their entitlement to NHS Continuing Healthcare. However, it would be inappropriate to give a guarantee that every individual would continue to receive NHS Continuing Healthcare after re-assessment if their needs have changed.</p>

	<p pid="b.550W.5/2">From April 2006, the NHS implemented major reforms to dentistry to build upon this success. New contracts for dentists have abolished the traditional fee per item remuneration system and support new ways of working with a greater focus on preventative care.

	<p pid="b.553W.6/1">New disability equipment such as mobility aids, environmental controls, communication aids, posture management, pressure management and moving and handling systems which are classed as medical devices and have been placed on the European market since June 1998 are required to meet the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC. This directive is brought into United Kingdom law under the Medical Device Regulations 2002 (amended 2003). Such medical devices must carry the CE mark indicating conformity to the directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.553W.6/2">Before applying the CE mark the manufacturer must ensure that all risks are removed or minimised and any residual risks constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefit to the user and are compatible with a high level of protection of safety. If it is not possible to reduce these risks by means of inherently safe design or construction whilst providing benefit to the user then the manufacturer must inform users of the residual risks by means of labelling on the device and/or warnings contained in the user information.</p>
	<p pid="b.553W.6/3">On behalf of the Secretary of State for Health, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) acts as the competent authority for the UK Medical Device Regulations. The MHRA has a specialist unit covering all aspects of assistive technology which includes disability equipment. Proactive and reactive investigations involving medical devices including assistive technology are carried out. Where appropriate the MHRA also works with or refers cases to other regulatory bodies in the United Kingdom such as Trading Standards and also liaises as necessary with other competent authorities within Europe and also with the United States of America, Canada, and Australia.</p>
	<p pid="b.553W.6/4">The requirement for all medical devices placed on the market in the United Kingdom to carry an appropriate CE marking applies equally to products advertised on the internet, regardless of their country of origin. However, the regulation of the sale of medical devices available on the internet is more problematic than with sales from more conventional outlets. The MHRA advises the public to be wary when purchasing any medicinal or healthcare product from an unknown source, such as the internet, as it is not possible to guarantee the efficacy or safety of such items.</p>

It also sets out the percentage of applicants notified of the outcome of the submission within 30, 60 and 90 calendar days of receipt of a valid submission.

	<p pid="b.556W.8/2">The MHRA is in regular discussion with both industry associations and individual companies about the processes in place to assess applications and the time scales involved. I am aware that their performance regarding licence and variation approval times during the past months has been affected by a combination of adverse factors including increases in work load, difficulties in recruiting professional assessment staff, especially medically qualified staff, and transitional implementation problems during the introduction of a new information management system. The MHRA is taking a number of steps to improve service levels. These include organisational restructuring, additional recruitment, re-training of staff, voluntary schemes for extended working hours, and information system performance enhancements. The MHRA's new information management system will provide the potential for greater efficiency within the MHRA and also provide a number of additional benefits to the industry, such as the ability to make electronic applications, and track progress of outstanding applications.</p>
	<p pid="b.556W.8/3">The MHRA is committed to developing regulation which is proportionate, accountable, consistent, transparent and targeted and is currently considering how unnecessary regulatory burdens, primarily in relation to over the counter (OTC) medicines, could be eased. To take this important initiative forward, the MHRA is leading the better regulation of OTC medicines initiative. As part of this process, industry has been asked to quantify the business impact of the time taken to respond to applications for a change to product information and this will inform proposals for change.</p>

	<p pid="b.560W.0/2">As part of the programme of work set out in &quot;Health Reform in England: update and next steps&quot; (December 2005), the Department is developing a new system of commissioning health services, which will operate as a partnership between general practitioner (GP) practices, primary care trusts (PCTs) and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.560W.0/3">The commissioning policy framework will be published in the summer of 2006. This work is being led by the Department's Policy and Strategy Directorate, with the support and advice of an external reference group drawn from a wide range of stakeholder and partner organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.560W.0/4">PCTs are responsible for commissioning the choices offered at referral in consultation with patient groups. The Isle of Wight PCT has commissioned services from seven providers, four of which can be reached within approximately one hour 30 minutes travelling time. Some patients will need assistance with travel to hospital. PCTs are responsible for ensuring that there is provision of ambulance services (which could include patient transport services) to such extent as they consider necessary to meet all reasonable requirements. It is, therefore, for the local NHS to decide who provides patient transport services for eligible patients in their area. In addition, patients on a low income may be entitled to reimbursement of their travel costs under the hospital travel cost scheme. This applies to any of the hospitals on their PCT's choice menu.</p>
	<p pid="b.560W.0/5">&quot;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&quot; set the direction for designing services which will provide patients with access to care as close to their home as possible. This may involve the use of community hospitals and through increasing provision of secondary care services in a primary care setting, for example by GPs with a special interest.</p>

	<p pid="b.561W.3/1">Clause 29 of the Health Bill inserts two new sections, sections 72A and 72B, into the Medicines Act 1969 in relation to the responsible pharmacist. The Government believe that the general rule should be one responsible pharmacist, one pharmacy, if the responsible pharmacist is to discharge his or her responsibilities for the safe and effective running of the pharmacy. For the vast majority of pharmacies, we expect each to have its own responsible pharmacist. However, we also believe that there should be provision to consider any exception to this rule, where circumstances justify such an exception. Section 72A(2) provides for a pharmacist to be responsible for more than one pharmacy at any one time only in circumstances to be specified in regulations and where there is compliance with certain conditions set out in the regulations. Our intention is to consult, in due course, with all interested parties on what these circumstances and conditions might be.</p>

Data on asylum seekers supported by NASS broken down by parliamentary constituency are also available from the Library of the House. Separate arrangements exist for unaccompanied asylum seeking children who are supported by local authorities; the local authority receives funding from the Home Office for this purpose. As at the end of March 2006 NASS was reimbursing Kingston upon Hull for providing support to 13 unaccompanied asylum seeking children, this figure is based on management information.</p>

	<p pid="b.572W.9/1">The Low Pay Commission reported that, in 2004, the pay gap for people with a work-limiting disability was 13 percentage points. This Department is not aware of any further data on the pay gap between disabled and non-disabled workers in Kingston upon Hull or the UK in the years 1997 to 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.572W.9/2">The Equal Opportunities Commission's Code of Practice on Equal Pay recommends that it is good practice for employers, when comparing the pay between men and women to also look at disability and seek advice from the Disability Rights Commission to ensure that the relevant provisions of the disability legislation are taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.572W.9/3">As a result of a strong economy and active labour market policies, the employment gap between disabled and non-disabled people is starting to close. The employment rate for disabled people was 38.1 per cent. in spring 1998, rising to 46.6 per cent. by spring 2005; over the same period, the employment gap fell from 35.1 per cent. to 28 per cent.</p>

Part of the discussion focused on the study scoping a possible Brazil: UK: Africa Partnership on Bioethanol that is currently being undertaken by E4tech for the Office of Science and Innovation. This project arises from a visit made to Brazil by the UK Government's Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir David King, as part of the preparations for the UK G8 Summit in Gleneagles in July 2005. The final report on the study will be available for discussion at the Brazil:UK Science Days at the Royal Society on 22 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-23">23 May</phrase>. The aim of the project is to try and address two difficult global problems, climate change and African development, through a tri-partite partnership.

	<p pid="b.578W.5/1">The Government have welcomed the work of an industry working group which is looking at options for greater use of paper free holding and transfer of shares. The responses to the &quot;Company Law Reform&quot; White Paper of March 2005 showed strong support for this initiative, but it is also clear that more information is needed on the costs and benefits of a paper free approach. The Government does not wish to rule out any option at this stage, and has therefore decided to extend the existing power relating to transfer of securities under section 207 of the Companies Act 1989 so that it could be used to require, as well as to permit, the paper free holding and transfer of company shares. In doing so, we wish to ensure that the new arrangements for paperless holding and transfer of securities do not deprive individual shareholders of existing rights which may be important to them.</p>

	<p pid="b.579W.10/1">The infection rate within a flock will depend on the stage at which the disease is detected. The rate of spread and local epidemiology within a poultry population will depend on many factors, but once the virus is introduced into a holding its rate of spread within the flock will be most strongly influenced by the virus strain, the host species and the production type.</p>
	<p pid="b.579W.10/2">Recent incidents of low pathogenic H7 avian influenza in Italy have usually resulted in infection rates of 100 per cent., especially where the disease was not detected early and intervention strategies were not put in place. Early detection of low pathogenic viruses is particularly difficult since clinical signs are often very mild or not apparent. In the outbreaks of H7N7 highly pathogenic avian influenza in flocks in the Netherlands in 2003, 100 per cent. of birds became diseased when there was no early detection or intervention. The average infection rates for H7 or H5 avian influenza in flocks of poultry will depend on the influence of all of the factors mentioned above.</p>

	<p pid="b.580W.5/1">The UK national laboratory at the Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA), Weybridge follows standard international protocols (including EU directives) to detect avian influenza viruses.</p>
	<p pid="b.580W.5/2">A combination of screening and confirmatory tests are used. Initially, samples are screened using a rapid, highly sensitive and specific real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR) that detects all influenza A viruses. Further tests of this type are used specifically for the detection of H5 and H7 subtypes, in addition to conventional PCR tests that provide information on the pathogenicity of the virus.</p>
	<p pid="b.580W.5/3">In all cases involving suspicion of disease in poultry, or following positive detection in any host, virus isolation in embryonated fowls' eggs is carried out to provide further characterisation. In addition, especially for H5 or H7 viruses, blood samples are analysed for virus-specific antibodies using standard haemagglutination inhibition tests.</p>
	<p pid="b.580W.5/4">As an international reference laboratory&mdash;and the EU community reference laboratory for avian influenza&mdash;the VLA takes a leading role in developing new technologies for diagnosis, together with the transfer and standardisation of such methodologies to other laboratories. The Agency is also responsible for ensuring test harmonisation across all national laboratories and ensuring that common testing methodologies are used.</p>

	<p pid="b.581W.11/1">The Department commissioned a report from Professor David Colman and Yaqin Zhaung, 'Changes in England and Wales Dairy Farming since 2002/03: A Resurvey', which was published last year. This showed that more farms had ceased production than had been previously indicated and there was a higher concentration of more profitable and larger herds among those that left. It reconfirmed previous findings which indicated that milk production is likely to fall.</p>
	<p pid="b.581W.11/2">Although the trend of farmers leaving the industry is not new, in terms of the sustainable future of the dairy industry, the apparent trend of some of the more efficient dairy farmers leaving the industry is worrying. We commissioned the report because we wanted some firm evidence of what was happening in the dairy sector. This is part of that evidence base. The Dairy Supply Chain Forum, chaired by my noble Friend, Lord Rooker, is working to understand why these farmers are leaving. While it is likely that profitability will be an important factor, there are also issues such as succession and possibilities for diversification which need to be considered.</p>

	<p pid="b.587W.3/1">The Environment Agency has produced a report, 'Drought prospects 2006', explaining the likely consequences of a continuing rainfall deficit and recommending action by water companies and the public. This report is available on request from the Agency (telephone 020 7863 8710) or from its website: <a href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk">www.environment-agency.gov.uk</a></p>
	<p pid="b.587W.3/2">Hosepipe bans imposed by water companies affect the watering of private gardens. Some water companies in South East England have applied to the Secretary of State for drought orders to ban the non-essential use of water. If made, such orders could impact on the watering of parks and sports facilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.588W.2/1">The typical duration of hosepipe bans depends on factors such as the amount of water stored in local aquifers, base river levels and reservoir storage. The present bans in Thames Water and Three Valleys Water are likely to continue throughout the summer, and until there is enough rainfall for water companies to be confident they can meet demand for summer 2007.</p>

	<p pid="b.595W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-16">16 September 2005</phrase> Mark Haysom, the Learning and Skills Council's chief executive, announced proposals for a new structure for the organisation with the aim of making it more effective at identifying and responding to local learning and skills needs, and to achieve a less bureaucratic and more strategic relationship with partners and providers. It means that the LSC will spend less time on transactional processes and more time developing relationships with key partners and stakeholders. This requires fewer staff with a different set of skills. The calculation of savings of up to &pound;40 million, which could be released for the benefit of learners, was based on these priorities and a structure that will require some 1,100 fewer posts. The savings include staffing, property and related costs. Due to the complexities involved in the restructuring the level of savings may change.</p>

	<p pid="b.600W.3/1">The Department's current estimate is that 0.6 per cent. of the adult population are problem gamblers. This figure is drawn from the most recent authoritative research: Kerry Sproston, Bob Erens and Jim Orford (2000): &quot;Gambling Behaviour in Britain: Results from the British Gambling Prevalence Study&quot; (National Centre for Social Research, June 2000). This research was conducted using a sample of addresses selected at random. It is not possible therefore to give figures by region.</p>

	<p pid="b.600W.3/5">Data on drug dependence is available from the survey Psychiatric Morbidity Among Adults (aged 16 to 74) Living in Private Households (in Great Britain) carried out in 2000, by the Office of National Statistics.</p>
	<p pid="b.600W.3/6">The latest data available from the drug survey is shown in table two. The same information is not held for those with a gambling addiction.</p>

	<p pid="b.608W.2/1">The Department's radiation protection research programme supports a number of studies investigating the possible health effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF). A study by Dr. Draper and colleagues on childhood leukaemia and distance from power lines, funded under this programme and published in the British Medical Journal last year, has added to a large existing body of work in this area (BMJ, volume 330, <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-04">4 June 2005</phrase>).</p>
	<p pid="b.608W.2/2">The Health Protection Agency's radiation protection division (HPA-RPD) keeps the world-wide research findings on EMF continually under review. In 2004, on the basis of a comprehensive review of the existing body of research to date, the HPA-RPD, previously the National Radiological Protection Board, recommended the adoption of new EMF exposure guidelines in this country. In addition, in view of the scientific uncertainties, the HPA recommended the Government ''consider the need for further precautionary measures&quot; in relation to power frequency electromagnetic fields. They have also noted that the majority of elevated magnetic fields are due to variations in the electricity supply and distribution system, the presence of substations and equipment in the home rather than proximity to power lines.</p>
	<p pid="b.608W.2/3">Practical precautionary measures are currently being considered in detail by a stakeholder advisory group (SAGE) that includes the Government Departments, agencies, electricity industry, specialists and public concern groups. Details of the process can be found on the website at: <a href="http://www.rkpartnership.co.uk/sage">www.rkpartnership.co.uk/sage</a>.</p>

	<p pid="b.609W.2/1">The Health Protection Agency's radiation protection division (HPA-RPD) continually monitors the research relating to the potential health effects of electric and magnetic fields. Prior to April 2005, HPA-RPD was the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) and as such it undertook a comprehensive review of the scientific evidence relating to possible adverse health effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in 2004. This review is available on HPA's website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/publications/documents_of_nrpb/abstracts/absd15-3.htm">www.hpa.org.uk/radiation/publications/documents_of_nrpb/abstracts/absd15-3.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.2/3">It provides the basis of HPA advice on quantitative restrictions on exposure and other measures to avoid adverse effects. It explored evidence on the possibility of variations in sensitivity between different groups in the population including children.</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.2/4">The preparation of this review was carried out at the request of the Department and has particularly examined the issues of uncertainty in the science and aspects of precaution. In developing this review, NRPB took advice from individual United Kingdom and international scientific experts, and from published comprehensive reviews by expert groups. It sought advice from an ad hoc expert group on weak electric field effects in the body and gave careful consideration to the views expressed in response to a consultation document on its proposed guidelines issued in May 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.2/5">Having considered the totality of the scientific evidence in the light of uncertainty and the need for a cautious approach, NRPB recommended that restrictions on exposure to EMFs in the UK should be based on the guidelines issued by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection in 1998.</p>

	<p pid="b.609W.5/1">Primary care trusts and predecessor organisations have responsibility for managing delivery of services provided by general practitioners (GPs); including the adequacy of their practice premises from which to provide services.</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.5/2">Since 1997, there has been a 60 per cent. increase in investment in GP premises. Part of this was through the NHS Plan targets to refurbish or replace 3,000 GP premises and create 500 primary care centres housing services appropriate to meet the local need by December 2004. These targets were achieved through the replacement or refurbishment of 2,848 GP premises and 510 primary care centres. We expect to see an additional 125 of these primary care centres built by the end of this year and 2008 the total will stand at 750.</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.5/3">In addition, there are many examples of new premises provided under the NHS Local Finance Investment Trust initiative (NHS LIFT) that fully satisfy minimum standards. The LIFT programme has contributed to this progress and has proven to be a tremendous success. Already some &pound;812 million in private sector and &pound;210 million in public sector funding has been injected into GP premises and community facilities across the country. There are 42 NHS LIFT schemes established with another eight in procurement.</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.5/4">This has, to date, delivered 68 new buildings open to patients with, on average, a building a week opening during 2006. In addition, we are injecting a further &pound;1 billion national health service capital this year specifically for new buildings and equipment. This money will further improve convenient access to health and social care.</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.5/5">A subjective assessment by PCTs of the proportion of premises meeting the minimum standards as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> has been placed in the Library. This 2005 snapshot by PCTs shows that collectively they have judged some GP premises across the country as being below minimum standards. This needs to be set in context. Judgments for some of those standards are subjective which by their very nature may lead to some PCTs reporting higher levels of premises that do not meet minimum standards than other PCTs with similar premises. Being below minimum standards does not mean the buildings are in a dangerous state of repair. Rather, that the premises may not have for example, adequate access to and within premises and WC facilities for disabled patients and staff. Failure to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act requirements is a common reason for PCTs judging buildings as not meeting minimum requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.609W.5/6">This is not because of a lack of intent by GPs' practices and their PCTs to provide these facilities but because for example, the building is too small to incorporate them; with a general lack of suitable, alternative locations to develop. These are historic problems for inner city PCTs that predate this Government and arose from difficulty of investing in smaller buildings.</p>

	<p pid="b.610W.2/1">Approximately 150 primary care trusts are involved in the health trainer project with wide variations in the ways health trainers are trained for the role. However, most training starts with an initial classroom-based period of between 14 and 35 days, over several weeks, followed by supported learning and skill development in the workplace. This may then be followed by further classroom-based training to allow reflection upon what has worked and provide ongoing training tailored to the individual and local environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.610W.2/2">The mandatory competences, upon which the health trainer training is based, were signed off in March 2006. The training programmes are still being developed, evaluated and modified according to local requirements. Therefore, it is likely that the current programmes will be revised and the range of times to provide the training could change.</p>

The NBS will continue to provide critical services from the centre in Plymouth. For example, the centre will continue to have a local blood bank to meet orders for blood. This means that deliveries of blood to hospitals serviced by the Plymouth centre, including emergency requests will not be affected by any change. The proposal to build the new centre in the most cost-effective way will consolidate some services into the new site from centres in Plymouth, Southampton and Birmingham.</p>

They will develop this with primary care trusts (PCTs) and NHS trusts in their area. Strategies agreed locally may include the creation of local reserves to deal with local problems. The size of the reserves and any contribution from each PCT will vary according to local circumstances, but the underlying principle will be fairness.</p>
	<p pid="b.614W.5/4" class="indent"><i>Turnaround teams</i>&mdash;In December 2005, the Secretary of State announced the creation of turnaround teams. These teams visited the NHS bodies identified as facing particular financial difficulties. The teams consisted of external consultants, they reviewed the bodies' financial positions and produced preliminary reports on what action could be taken to assist recovery. The bodies deemed to be at particular risk were required to engage appropriate turnaround support on the ground to help improve efficiency and cut costs. All the bodies are expected to produce plans to allow them to return to financial balance.</p>

The authors also found no discernible statistical evidence supporting the view that the inflow of A8 migrants is contributing to a rise in claimant unemployment in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.619W.2/1">Evidence from the most recent Home Office Accession Monitoring Report (February 2006) suggests that nationals from the Accession 8 countries continue to come to the UK to work, contributing to the success of the UK economy, while making very few demands of our welfare system or public services. Overall migrants make a net fiscal contribution to the UK. In many cases, Accession workers are supporting the provision of public services in communities across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.619W.2/2">The Report finds that numbers applying for tax-funded income-related benefits, child benefit, tax credits and housing support remain very low. Only 3,270 applications for income support and jobseeker's allowance were received from Accession 8 migrants between May 2004 and December 2005, less than 1 per cent. of the total number of Workers Registration Scheme applicants in that period. Of these, only 195 were allowed to proceed for further consideration. The East Midlands region received 5.7 per cent. of these applications and the East of England received 7.9 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.624W.8/1">The Government, and many Members of the European Parliament, agree that the splitting of the European Parliament site is far from ideal. However, there is a legal and historical basis for the sitting. At the Edinburgh Council in 1992, member states adopted a decision that designated the European Parliament's seat as Strasbourg and committed the European Parliament to holding 12 plenary sessions a year there. Any change to the status quo would need the unanimous support of the 25 member states. Unfortunately, we do not think such unanimity is likely in the foreseeable future.</p>

	<p pid="b.627W.3/1">The responsibility for resolving Nepal's conflict ultimately lies with the people of Nepal, who need to take responsibility for, and ownership of, any peace settlement. But it is clear to us that a lasting solution to Nepal's problems will need the active support of the international community and the assistance of an independent and credible external partner.</p>
	<p pid="b.627W.3/2">We are exploring with the Government of Nepal, and with our international partners, whether and how such a third party role might be helpful, and what its mandate should be. One candidate might indeed be the UN and the UN Secretary-General has made several welcome offers of his good offices. The UN is seen as a credible partner in Nepal; the UN's Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights mission there has proved successful. If all the parties concerned, including our international partners, were to agree on a viable UN role, then the benefits could be significant. But it will still require political will on all sides to make this work and the UN is not the only organisation that could provide such assistance. If external facilitation is agreed there will most likely be financial implications in terms of arranging this. However it is too early to judge what these will be.</p>

Friend the then Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs (Ian Pearson) raised the Government's concerns about the use of organs from executed prisoners with the Chinese Government on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-07">7 April</phrase>. The Chinese Government have acknowledged the practice of organ harvesting from executed prisoners. Despite Chinese Government assurances that prisoners agree to the donations voluntarily and that, in some cases, their families are paid, we are concerned about the use of these prisoners' organs. The Government welcomes the announcement by the Chinese Ministry of Health of a new regulation to come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase>, to ban the sale of organs and introduce medical standards for organ transplants. We have received no evidence to substantiate recent media reports of large scale organ harvesting in China. The Chinese Government have denied such allegations.</p>

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) funds the delivery, including by non-governmental organisations, of project work designed to enhance the ability of source and transit countries to identify and dissuade potential victims of trafficking to assist in their return. Projects address issues such as increasing awareness levels among victims and practitioners, methods of victim identification, reintegration assistance for returnees and training for judicial, law enforcement and immigration staff. The FCO, as part of the draft UK Action Plan on Trafficking, is also devising a strategy to publicise overseas the successful prosecution in British courts of human traffickers.</p>

	<p pid="b.637W.5/2">Local delivery vehicles have been established in most of the major locations of growth to drive the delivery of new homes and infrastructure. In North Northamptonshire the local authorities have been members of the delivery vehicles Catalyst Corby and North Northants Together and are founding members of the newly announced North Northants Development Company&mdash;a merger of the two organisations. The North Northants Development Company will continue to work with their partners to assess priority infrastructure requirements and suitable funding sources.</p>

	<p pid="b.641W.3/1">We cannot pay full financial assistance scheme payments until the final scale of individual losses can be established at the end of wind up. 'Initial payments' allow us to pay some money at a lower rate to those qualifying members who become entitled to assistance before their scheme completes wind up. While the wind-up process may take some time to complete and this may be affected by ongoing court action, all FAS qualifying schemes will ultimately complete wind-up and all eligible qualifying members will then receive full FAS payments.</p>

	<p pid="b.641W.6/2">Attendance allowance is available for those who become disabled after the age of 65 and, unlike, disability living allowance, does not have a mobility component. While some of those in receipt of attendance allowance may have mobility difficulties, receipt of attendance allowance does not of itself necessarily represent mobility needs; rather, it contributes towards the personal care needs of those with disabilities who are over the age of 65.</p>
	<p pid="b.641W.6/3">The Government believe that the benefit arrangements in place for disabled people are both fair and sensible and, in particular, that it is right to give the most help with the extra costs of disability to those who are severely disabled earlier in life.
