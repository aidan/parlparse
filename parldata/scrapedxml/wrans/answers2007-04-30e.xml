	<p pid="e.1378W.5/1">It is too early to make any significant decision on how DFID's programme in Nigeria should be adjusted in response to the elections. Due to the problems encountered, additional elections were being held in many parts of the country on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-28">28 April</phrase>. Currently all sides are reflecting upon the electoral process and the results as these are returned.</p>
	<p pid="e.1378W.5/2">However, we are also reviewing our support for the electoral process, including our support to Independent Nigeria Electoral Commission (INEC). DFID provided &pound;2.5 million of support to a Joint Donor Basket Fund managed by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The other donors are the European Union and Canadian CIDA. The majority of the joint funding was notionally allocated to INEC. But INEC has consistently turned down donor offers of technical support, so spending has been lower than anticipated.</p>
	<p pid="e.1378W.5/3">Given the events of the last three weeks, the UNDP are now doing a stock-take on our joint support to INEC. We are expecting proposals early this week on how we can best wrap-up our existing programme of support for INEC. After this, there will also be a review of lessons and a priority for the coming few months will be to reach a consensus in Nigeria on how best INEC can be supported in future. In addition, we will be undertaking joint analysis on the wider aspects of political governance which need to be addressed in order for the 2011 elections to be an improvement on those of 2007.</p>

	<p pid="e.1379W.2/1">Since Hamas formed a Palestinian Government in March 2006, international banks dealing with the Palestinian Authority (PA) have risked litigation under US anti-terrorism laws. One result of this has been that the PA's single treasury account has been frozen. This has undermined important progress made over recent years to improve public financial accountability and control.</p>
	<p pid="e.1379W.2/2">Although this situation has made it harder to transfer money to the PA, the PA has been able to continue spending the limited funds it has available. DFID and other donors have also continued and increased aid to help meet the basic needs of Palestinians through other channels. For example, European Union (community and member states) aid is estimated to have increased by 27 per cent. in 2007, compared with 2006. This has partially offset the impact on Palestinian livelihoods of Israel's decision to withhold clearance revenues due to the PA.</p>

In 2006, the UN's humanitarian appeal for Darfur was 79 per cent. funded, it is expected that similar levels will be forthcoming this year. DFID's contribution is largely through the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF), to which we contributed &pound;40 million in 2007, accounting for approximately 60 per cent. of the total. This supports critical needs throughout Sudan. DFID also expect to spend around &pound;15 million over the next year in Darfur through direct grants to humanitarian non-governmental organisations and the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>

	<p pid="e.1385W.0/1">Parliament has charged the independent regulator, Ofcom, with maintaining broadcasting standards, notably to protect children and to protect the general public from harmful and offensive material. Ofcom sets out the rules and guidance with which broadcasters must comply. Within this framework, it is the broadcasters' job to make judgments about what individual programmes should contain and the time at which they are broadcast. It is a long-standing principle that the Government do not interfere in programming matters. That applies to both scheduling and content. Where there are deliberate, serious or repeated breaches of Ofcom's rules, the regulator may impose statutory sanctions against the broadcaster.</p>

	<p pid="e.1395W.12/1">The Government's strategy on older people and ageing, &quot;Opportunity Age&quot; was first published in March 2005. A series of consultation events at which the views and ideas of older people were sought has been invaluable in shaping that strategy.</p>
	<p pid="e.1395W.12/2">DWP is piloting a &quot;LinkAge Plus&quot; programme, to test ways of building fully integrated services from health and benefits to leisure and learning. Eight pilots (led by local authorities) have been looking at ways of joining up government for older people. LinkAge Plus puts older people at the heart of the process in identifying effective models that meet their needs and aspirations and involves them in their design.</p>
	<p pid="e.1395W.12/3">DWP also sponsors &quot;Better Government for Older People&quot;, comprising approximately 200 voluntary elected members from older people's forums and groups across the UK, which works to reflect the views of older people in policy making.</p>
	<p pid="e.1395W.12/4">DWP engages in a range of ongoing involvement activities with disabled people to ensure that their needs and views are reflected in both policy making and service delivery. These are outlined in our disability equality schemes published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-01">1 December 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="e.1395W.12/5">The Department sponsored the creation of Equality 2025, a new non-departmental public body providing a mechanism through which disabled people can have direct communication with central Government to influence, at an early stage, Government policies and service delivery that affect disabled people's lives.</p>
	<p pid="e.1395W.12/6">We also consult with disabled people to obtain their feedback on new policy proposals or changes as part of our diversity impact assessment process. The findings from such consultation help to influence the final decision on those proposals or changes.</p>

	<p pid="e.1398W.9/2"><i> </i>Since 1997, claimant unemployment has fallen by 708,000 and the number of people on lone parent benefits has fallen by 230,000. We are also spending &pound;5 billion less on unemployment than we did in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="e.1398W.9/3">The new deal, which has helped more than 1.7 million people into work since January 1998, has contributed to this success. It has helped reduce long-term claimant unemployment to close to its lowest for 30 years and to significantly reduce long-term youth claimant unemployment.</p>

	<p pid="e.1399W.2/1">The size of annuity required to take an individual above pension credit eligibility depends on a wide range of factors. This includes the type of annuity an individual purchases, their entitlement to basic and addition state pension, and any additional needs they may have which affect pension credit entitlement. It also depends on whether their pension will take them above pension credit eligibility at the point of retirement or over their expected lifetime and whether their pension will take them above guarantee credit only or savings credit.</p>
	<p pid="e.1399W.2/2">Under our proposed pension reforms someone retiring in 2053 with a good contribution record (through working or caring) could expect to receive around &pound;135 per week from the state pension on retirement (in 2005-06 earnings terms). This is&mdash;for a single person&mdash;above the end point of pension credit. Couples with good contribution records will be substantially above the end point for pension credit.</p>
	<p pid="e.1399W.2/3">Only those on the guarantee credit alone will face pound for pound withdrawal on private saving. Someone with around 25 years of working or caring retiring in 2050 will have accrued enough state pension to bring them above the guarantee credit only. Our analysis suggests that in 2050 around 6 per cent. of all pensioners will be eligible for guarantee credit only, and only around one in 50 pensioners will retire directly onto guarantee credit only. In addition, those with small amounts of savings will be able to take them as a lump sum under the trivial commutation rules.</p>

	<p pid="e.1405W.8/1">The consequences of any new legislation in terms of training is generally a matter for police forces to determine, although some police training is delivered nationally through what is now the National Policing Improvement Agency.</p>
	<p pid="e.1405W.8/2">In terms of force costs, these will vary dependent upon the local impact of legislation, and each force making an assessment of its own training needs and requirements. It is also important to note that law based or legislative police training (except when an officer joins the police service) remains a relatively small proportion of their training needs.</p>
	<p pid="e.1405W.8/3">Accordingly, policing costs for new training as a result of legislation will vary from police area to area. There are therefore no estimates of the cost of police training specifically as a consequence of new legislation.</p>

Secure Delivery commenced in February 2004, and the last period of data available for the previous Royal Mail arrangements is for 2003.

	<p pid="e.1430W.5/1">In 2006, 2 per cent. of the UK's opening quota was allocated to the 10 metre and under fleet. However, such an analysis is misleading because the total UK quota includes quota for stocks which are of no interest to inshore vessels, such as deep sea species and stocks fished in external waters. In addition, many of these vessels catch types of fish, such as crabs and scallops, which are not subject to quotas.</p>

	<p pid="e.1430W.8/1">An over 10 metre vessel cannot join the 10 metre and under fleet. However, owners of over 10 metre vessels are able to sell their quota and licence and acquire a licence in the 10 metre and under fleet. Central data systems record all changes in ownership as a result of a sale or an agreed transfer. While these systems record details of the owners of vessels and licences, they are not designed to allow the details of the vessels and licences held by any individual owner to be tracked over time.

	<p pid="e.1433W.2/1">While Communities and Local Government (CLG) has overall responsibility for planning policy in England, the interpretation of planning regulations is a matter for the local planning authority in the first instance.</p>
	<p pid="e.1433W.2/2">Polytunnels are important to the horticultural sector for helping growers to supply a wide range of high-quality produce over a full season. Crops, especially soft fruit such as strawberries, need to be protected and polytunnels provide an ideal, cost-effective solution. Growing fruit in polytunnels is in line with DEFRA's Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food in that it meets demand for home grown fruit all the year round. However, extensive polytunnels can have a significant impact on the landscape and the local planning authority must consider each case on its merits.</p>
	<p pid="e.1433W.2/3">I have had no discussions with the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government on the question of planning policy for polytunnels, but DEFRA and CLG officials work closely together on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="e.1434W.0/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="e.1434W.0/2">Since 2000, six older nuclear power stations with a total generation capacity of approximately 2 GW have closed. Total carbon dioxide emissions from the power generation sector over the same period (2000-05) have increased by nearly 5 million tonnes of carbon. The level of carbon emissions from the power sector depends on a number of factors, including the level of demand and the wholesale electricity price, which is underpinned by the price of fossil fuels and the price of carbon in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="e.1434W.0/3">The impact of the closure of nuclear power stations on emissions will depend on the assumptions about the stations which have replaced them. If the capacity has been replaced by generation technologies that emit carbon (such as gas-fired generation, for example) then it is likely that the closure of the older nuclear capacity will have contributed to the rise in carbon emissions from the power sector between 2000 and 2005.</p>

	<p pid="e.1434W.3/1">The Environment Agency (EA) has been working with Yorkshire Water to agree changes to operations at Blackburn Meadows Sewage Treatment Works (Sheffield), within the terms of its permit. Improved maintenance and changes to procedure should improve the ability of the sewage works to deal with future storm events.</p>
	<p pid="e.1434W.3/2">A study is under way into the main storm overflow from Aldwarke Sewage Treatment Works (Rotherham). Any improvements the study identifies will be completed by March 2010.</p>
	<p pid="e.1434W.3/3">The EA is starting discussions with Yorkshire Water to agree a study into the impact of the combined storm overflows from the middle section of the River Don from Sheffield through Rotherham to Doncaster. The study will establish in detail what happens when summer storms occur and what can be done to improve the infrastructure in the future. In the EA's Periodic Review submission to the Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) it will recommend that this study be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="e.1434W.3/4">The Environment Agency's preliminary assessment of 2006 chemical water quality data shows that the River Don between Blackburn Meadows Sewage Works and Rotherham Centre (2.5 km) has deteriorated from &quot;fairly good quality&quot; to &quot;fair quality&quot; since 2005. While the river has deteriorated slightly in quality, it has not failed the long-term water quality objective set for the river.</p>
	<p pid="e.1434W.3/5">The River Don below Blackburn Meadows Sewage Works failed the Freshwater Fisheries Directive in 2005 and has, provisionally, failed in 2006. It is believed that the sewage treatment works caused this failure. Consequently, the EA is also recommending to Ofwat that a detailed study concerning this failure be carried out.</p>

	<p pid="e.1436W.5/1">The Government's Market Transformation Programme (MTP) estimates that in 2005 63 million television (TV) sets were being used in UK homes. Approximately 90 per cent. of these were the traditional cathode ray tube (CRT) type and approximately 10 per cent. were flat screen plasma or LCD types. By 2010, we estimate that the total number of TVs will rise to around 67 million sets, of which approximately 50 per cent. will be CRTs, and approximately 40 per cent. LCD and plasma. The remaining 10 per cent. will be made up of rear-projection and yet-to-emerge technologies such as organic light-emitting diode and field-emission diode screens.</p>
	<p pid="e.1436W.5/2">Our assessment, based on current trends, is that the energy consumed by all TVs could increase from around 10 Terra Watt Hours (TWh) of electricity (roughly 1.1 million tonnes of carbon) in 2005 to over 15 TWh of electricity (1.7 million tonnes of carbon) in 2010. Most of this potential increase in emissions is accounted for by a predicted significant rise in the average electricity consumption of each unit. This will be caused by the trend for consumers purchasing TVs with larger screens, including both plasma and LCD technologies, replacing their older and smaller CRT models, and a small increase in the total TV viewing hours and standby usage by households.</p>
	<p pid="e.1436W.5/3">However, we believe there is a potential, through actions by manufacturers and retailers to bring forward and to promote TVs that are more energy efficient, so that the projected 2010 electricity consumption can be reduced by around 10 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="e.1436W.5/4">The issue of increasing emissions from new generation television sets and the potential impact of emerging technologies was assessed in a report published for DEFRA in June 2005, entitled &quot;An Assessment of Emerging Innovative Energy Efficient Technologies as part of the Energy Efficiency Innovation Review&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="e.1439W.0/1">Currently there is no measure available to the UK to stop forest products being imported on the grounds that some or all of the timber used in their manufacture may not have met the laws of a third country.</p>
	<p pid="e.1439W.0/2">However, the Indonesian Government have banned the export of round logs and most categories of rough sawn timber, as a measure to help tackle illegal logging within their borders.</p>
	<p pid="e.1439W.0/3">To introduce more effective measures, Indonesia is negotiating a Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) with the EU. This would allow member states to ban imports of timber directly from Indonesia which have not been licensed by the Indonesian Government as legally harvested. The UK Department for International Development is actively supporting these negotiations. This Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) agreement, as currently proposed, would not stop Indonesian companies from exporting timber to third party countries, such as China, that do not have FLEGT type agreements with Indonesia. While the Indonesian Government have indicated that they intend to require timber exports to all countries to meet the same legality requirements as those specified under the VPA, the potential for circumvention remains a matter of concern. One solution might be the inclusion of an obligation on FLEGT partner countries to report on levels of timber imports and exports and actions taken to prevent circumvention.</p>
	<p pid="e.1439W.0/4">The European Commission recently completed a public consultation exercise on options for additional measures. The UK has indicated particular interest in proposals for a new regulation which would make it a crime in a member state, to trade in products which contain or were manufactured from timber that had been illegally harvested, regardless of country of origin. It is important to stress that currently these options are presented in outline; the European Commission has made no formal proposal to the Council of Ministers. A great deal of detailed work must be done to ensure that any future legal instrument represents good and enforceable law.</p>

	<p pid="e.1439W.4/1">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has responsibility for assessment of the cost and clinical effectiveness of new cancer drugs such as Sutent. In July 2006, the Department established a formal link with NICE (on behalf of the HPSS) under which NICE guidance is reviewed for its applicability to Northern Ireland and, where deemed to be applicable, is endorsed by the Department for implementation in the HPSS. Sutent has not yet been referred to NICE for assessment.</p>
	<p pid="e.1439W.4/2">The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) has however assessed this drug and has not recommended its use in the NHS in Scotland. In the absence of an assessment by MCE, local commissioners will be informed by the SMC's guidance when assessing priorities for the use of specialist drugs moneys in Northern Ireland. In this context, therefore, the Department would not expect Sutent to be widely available for patients in Northern Ireland until further evidence of the clinical and cost effectiveness of the drug is available.</p>

This showed there will be an initial increase in cost but ultimately these will reduce and that there will be a positive environmental impact. On this basis a report is being drafted which will recommend the continuation of the use of recycled paper and electronic publishing in all Government Departments.</p>

Regulated energy suppliers will thus be obliged, at the very least, to have in place the prescribed standards of complaints handling. The Bill will also introduce new redress schemes for electricity, gas and postal services, which will be able to resolve the full range of consumer complaints in these sectors and make provision for customer redress, including, where appropriate, the payment of compensation.</p>

Places, Streets and Movement and Design Bulletin 32 were intended for residential roads and footpaths although may have been more widely applied. As with the guidance it replaces, Manual for Streets applies to residential streets. However the manual states that many of its key principles may be applicable to other types of streets, for example high streets and lightly-trafficked lanes in rural areas. It is the responsibility of users of the manual to ensure that its application to the design of non-residential streets is appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="e.1459W.2/1">Under S154 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984, liability to inheritance tax does not apply in relation to the death of service personnel, where the Secretary of State for Defence, or the Defence Council, certifies that the individual died from a wound inflicted, accident occurring, or disease contracted, either on active service against an enemy, or on other service of a warlike nature. This includes current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="e.1459W.2/2">Should an individual die from an injury or disease contracted at some previous time, with death being due to, or hastened by, the aggravation of the injury or illness which occurred during a period when the aforementioned conditions applied, then consideration is given on a case-by-case basis to granting an exemption from a liability to inheritance tax.</p>
	<p pid="e.1459W.2/3">As part of the assistance provided to bereaved families, the MOD Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (JCCC) considers whether the circumstances of a death of anyone currently serving in the armed forces allows an exemption from inheritance tax and, where appropriate, provide the executor or family member with a certificate of exemption which can be passed to the relevant tax office.</p>
	<p pid="e.1459W.2/4">For claims arising as a result of injuries or illness sustained in previous conflicts or in retirement, applications for an exemption have to be made to the JCCC by the executor/next of kin following the death of the individual concerned.</p>

	<p pid="e.1470W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-26">26 April 2007</phrase></p>
	<p pid="e.1470W.2/2">Local authorities are central to our ambitions to deliver additional support to parents and we will continue to support and collaborate with them.</p>
	<p pid="e.1470W.2/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March 2007</phrase>, we published, &quot;Every Parent Matters&quot;, which describes the Government's commitment to support the development of a wide range of services for parents to access, as and when they need it. It makes clear that local authorities will be at the heart of planning and delivering these services locally.</p>
	<p pid="e.1470W.2/4">In October 2006 we published &quot;Parenting Support&quot;, guidance for local authorities which describes the approach needed to develop a local strategy to provide a continuum of support for all parents. At the same time we launched the Commissioner's Toolkit, a database of parenting programmes including information on what research suggests about the effectiveness of current interventions. This toolkit is designed to equip commissioners to make decisions which better suit the needs of parents in their community. Over 2006-08 local authorities will receive the &pound;7.5 million Parenting Support Strategy Grant. Its purpose is to assist local authorities in developing and implementing a strategic approach to parenting support, and build upon strategic approaches already in place.</p>
	<p pid="e.1470W.2/5">We have spent over &pound;2.1 billion establishing and sustaining Sure Start Local Programmes and Children's Centres, since 1999, initially in some of our most disadvantaged areas. Currently there are 1,258 children's centres, providing a range of high quality early learning, health and parental support to a million young children under five and their families. There will be 2,500 centres by 2008, and 3,500 by 2010, one for every community. Additionally, we are establishing extended services for pupils, families and the wider community in all schools across the country. The extended schools core offer includes services providing parenting support, and over 4,500 schools are now delivering the offer. All schools will do so by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="e.1470W.2/6">A number of pilots have been developed with local authorities to deliver new ways of supporting parents. The learning from many of these pilots will inform the further roll out of extended schools and Sure Start Children's Centres. For example, Early Learning Partnerships are running in 19 local authorities; targeting hard to reach families and promoting their engagement in early learning for children aged one to three years. Transition information sessions will be run in 20 local authorities by autumn 2007, preparing parents of children in reception and year seven to cope with the wide range of possible challenges that their children may face. Parent Support Advisers are providing a preventative school based role to support parents in 977 schools in 20 local authorities, and we will look to spread practice widely through extended schools. 15 local authorities have been selected to receive a share of &pound;5 million per annum for 2006-07 and 2007-08 to deliver Parenting Early Intervention Pathfinders&mdash;testing different parenting programmes for the families of eight to 13-year-olds at risk of antisocial behaviour. We are investing &pound;10 million per annum to develop the National Academy for Parenting Practitioners. The academy will have a key role in improving practice, training and support for the parenting workforce.</p>

The Government do not collect figures on the number of actions brought against local authorities on accidents in schools, by age or otherwise. Insurers have told Parliament that claims for personal injury in schools are a very small proportion of all such claims to local authorities. Criminal prosecution of a school employer is even rarer.</p>

	<p pid="e.1492W.0/1">The Department works directly with schools and authorities, and also with and through a range of bodies, including HM Treasury, Partnerships UK, Partnerships for Schools and the 4ps, to understand and address the concerns that schools and authorities may have from time to time about private finance initiative contracts for schools. Our aim is to ensure that schools get from private finance initiative contracts the excellent service they deserve. Private finance initiatives were introduced for schools in 1998, and contacts with authorities, schools and with other bodies have been a part of the everyday work of the Department since then.</p>
	<p pid="e.1492W.0/2">In 2005, we published a report which we commissioned from Partnerships UK on operational schools private finance initiative contracts, which is available at <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/docbank/index.cfm?id=9262">www.teachernet.gov.uk/docbank/index.cfm?id=9262</a>. This report found that, on balance, contracts were operating successfully across most of their provision, and that there were some strong examples of good delivery. It made suggestions for improvements, all of which had already been, or subsequently were, acted upon. Further, we have worked with HM Treasury to enable Partnerships UK to act as a taskforce helpdesk for schools which have concerns or difficulties with their private finance initiative contracts. Department officials also continue to work directly with schools and authorities where needed.</p>
	<p pid="e.1492W.0/3">In the past year, directly or through Partnerships UK and other bodies, representations have included benchmarking and market testing; support during the transition to operational status; variations to contract; dispute resolution and poor performance; availability of other schools capital funding; schools changing status while in a PFI contract. Officials also recently met the Association of Schools and College Leaders to discuss a similar range of issues.</p>

	<p pid="e.1493W.2/2">The purpose of all education is to achieve outcomes or results. The secondary curriculum review is based upon the need for all young people to acquire prescribed subject knowledge, skills and understanding including high level skills in literacy, numeracy and scientific understanding; to develop a knowledge of British history and an understanding of our place in the world; and to understand contemporary issues which shape the international context for the next generation.</p>
	<p pid="e.1493W.2/3">The secondary curriculum review also seeks to provide all young people with the skills to continue to learn throughout life; to be inquisitive, independent thinkers; to be problem solvers; and team workers.</p>
	<p pid="e.1493W.2/4">If that is what is meant by 'an outcome-based educational approach' then the secondary curriculum review can be said to be 'outcome based'.</p>
	<p pid="e.1493W.2/5">If however, 'an outcome-based educational approach' is defined as a curriculum which is content-free; lacking in rigour; entirely skills based; and not specific and particular about cognitive content, then that is most definitely not the approach upon which the secondary curriculum review is based.</p>

In some cases it may be appropriate for a homeless household to be placed in accommodation outside the local authority area but authorities are required to ensure that, so far as reasonably practicable, accommodation is secured in their district. Moreover, we have issued statutory guidance&mdash;the &quot;Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities&quot;&mdash;which states that wherever possible the accommodation secured should be as close as possible to where applicants were previously living, so they can retain established links with schools, doctors, social workers and other key services and support essential to the well-being of the household.</p>
