	<p pid="a.525W.9/2">In 2004, HM Treasury undertook a pilot project on gender analysis of expenditure with the Women's Budget Group. The project demonstrated the value of gender analysis in some areas and identified what tools and expertise were necessary within government to carry out gender analysis, but that further work was needed before gender responsive budgeting could be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.525W.9/3">In 2008, HM Treasury will be conducting further work that will determine whether it is prudent and feasible to disaggregate departmental expenditure statistics by gender.</p>

	<p pid="a.534W.8/1">The Government are confident that the overall level of funding for the statutory minimum provision of concessionary travel is sufficient to cover the full cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.534W.8/2">Following the introduction of the free off-peak local bus travel concession within local authority areas in April 2006, central Government provided an extra &pound;350 million in 2006-07 and &pound;367.5 million in 2007-08 for statutory concessionary fares through the revenue support grant. The Department is now paying an additional special grant of &pound;212 million in 2008-09 (and rising thereafter) just to cover the cost of extending the statutory minimum bus concession to provide free off-peak local bus travel anywhere in England. This additional amount of &pound;212 million is based on our assessment of the likely cost impact of the new concession which is based on generous assumptions about pass take-up, fares and increased patronage.</p>
	<p pid="a.534W.8/3">The proposed distribution of this grant was published by the Department for Transport in the Special Grant Report (No. 129) on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-19">19 February</phrase>. The final distribution will be subject to parliamentary debate and a copy of the report is in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.534W.8/4">In addition, the Government paid a grant of over &pound;31 million in total to travel concession authorities (TCAs) in England outside London in this financial year (2007-08) to cover the cost of issuing concessionary travel passes. The passes grant to each TCA is based on an allowance of &pound;4 for each pass currently in circulation, uplifted by 20 per cent. to recognise that the new concession is likely to be more attractive than the existing one.</p>

The overall aim of this programme is to restructure HMRC's estate and business in the most efficient way possible so as to provide a better service at a lower cost to the taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="a.537W.3/1">A common pay framework for the Senior Civil Service (SCS) is determined by the Cabinet Office, and not delegated to individual Departments. This framework includes incentive payments for the highest performing staff who can demonstrate that they have delivered the outcomes expected of them and service improvements that matter to the public. The Cabinet Office also determines the size of the overall SCS bonus pot each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.3/2">Full details of SCS pay criteria and awards are set out annually by the Senior Salaries Review Body. Their 29th Report on Senior Salaries 2007 (Cm 7030) includes a review of the pay system in 2005-06 and recommendations for 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.3/3">In accordance with this guidance, HMRC paid performance awards in four non-consolidated, non-pensionable tranches for 2006-07: zero, minimum (&pound;3,000), medium (9 per cent. of base salary) and high (15 per cent. of base salary). Payment of these bonuses was made in November 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.3/4">Pay for other staff is delegated to individual Departments, who are expected to negotiate pay deals with their staff in accordance with Pay Remit Guidance issued by HM Treasury. HMRC agreed a three-year pay remit with the Treasury in 2005, and a three-year pay settlement with staff and unions for pay awards in 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08. HMRC has made provision for a proportion of the overall funds available to be invested in non-consolidated performance awards.</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.3/5">HMRC's bonus pot of 0.80 per cent. is currently below the minimum level of 2.5 per cent. recommended in the pay remit guidance. HMRC's pay settlement provides for a payment for a &quot;top performer&quot; of between 2.5 per cent. and 5 per cent. of salary, and a smaller payment for a &quot;good performer&quot; whose salary has reached the range maximum.</p>
	<p pid="a.537W.3/6">HMRC sets the actual percentage of performance awards paid each year on the basis of affordability, after analysing performance marks received by staff and the resulting cost implications.</p>

	<p pid="a.543W.3/2"><i> </i>Since 1988-89 English Heritage, the Government's statutory adviser on the historic environment, has given around &pound;356,000 to the Fenland Archaeological Trust (FAT) for surveys, excavation, analysis, detailed publication and public presentation of the Flag Fen site and its surroundings. &pound;300,000 of this was given through the former Archaeology Commissions programme (now Historic Environment Enabling Programme). A further &pound;56,000 was contributed through regional grant aid specifically for the Preservation Hall. In addition to this expenditure a popular account of the site was published in the English Heritage/Batsford series on England's archaeology. In 2008-09 English Heritage will be providing a further contribution of around &pound;1,500 towards the publication of more recent investigations. Supporting the exhibition is outside the remit of English Heritage's grant schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.3/3">FAT is a partner in the &quot;Greater Fens Museum Partnership&quot;, which is receives &pound;96,200 from the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council's (MLA) &quot;Renaissance in the Regions&quot; regional museums development programme. The trust has received &pound;1,500 for object conservation work from MLA.</p>
	<p pid="a.543W.3/4">FAT also secured &pound;600,000 from the Millennium Commission towards the cost of a new Heritage Centre, as part of the &pound;5.408 million Peterborough Green Wheel project. FAT has received two grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF). In March 2006 the trust was awarded &pound;178,000 to support education and outreach activities, and in August 2006, &pound;44,688 was awarded for a project planning grant. HLF is anticipating a larger application as a result of this work.</p>

The usual practice of the Department's National Institute for Health Research and of the Medical Research Council is not to ring-fence funds for expenditure on particular topics. Both organisations welcome applications for support for research into any aspect of human health and these are subject to peer review and judged in open competition, with awards being made on the basis of the scientific quality of the proposals made.</p>

	<p pid="a.553W.5/1">The Government published the White Paper &quot;Trust, Assurance and Safety - The Regulation of Health Professionals in the 21<sup>(st)</sup> Century&quot; in February 2007, which sets out a series of proposals to modernise the system of professional regulation. These proposals include a number of reforms to the governance of the regulatory bodies, such as the introduction of fully appointed, smaller, more board-like councils, where professional members no longer form a majority.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.5/2">The Health and Social Care Bill will introduce provision to require the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence (CHRE) in its annual report to state on how far, in exercising statutory functions, it and each health professions regulatory body has, in the Council's opinion, promoted the health, safety and well-being of patients and other members of the public. It also clarifies that the CHRE is not prevented from investigating particular cases for the purpose of making general reports on the performance of health care regulatory bodies of its functions or making general recommendations to those bodies affecting future cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.553W.5/3">All regulators are currently required to produce annual reports which they send to the Privy Council, who then lay these reports before each House of Parliament. We have introduced further provision as to the content of these reports, which includes a description of the arrangements that the Council has put in place to ensure that it adheres to good practice in relation to equality and diversity. It will be a requirement that the regulator should lay a copy of its annual report and strategic plan before the United Kingdom Parliament, and where appropriate the Scottish Parliament.</p>

Experience in other countries where incentive schemes are in operation also suggests that payments do not need to be high to be effective. The research report published in May 2007 shows, for example, that variable charges in the region of &pound;30 to &pound;50 were shown to drive behaviour change overseas.</p>

More information is available on the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="a.563W.2/2">DEFRA later commissioned research from Eunomia on variable waste charging, which therefore did not have any impact on the earlier reward-only pilot study.</p>

When the Secretary of State designates pilot areas, each designation order will specify a time at which that pilot will end.

	<p pid="a.571W.0/6" class="indent">However, as can be the case with a manual process, there are some occasions when individual payments require additional investigation to ensure that the right money is passed to the right client.</p>

	<p pid="a.571W.3/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-13">13 March 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.3/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.3/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what number and proportion of all current Child Support Agency cases have (a) been subject to maladministration (b) had incorrect maintenance calculations and (c) arrears outstanding; and what proportion of cases are subject to (i) (a) and (b) above (ii) (a) and (c) above (iii) (b) and (c) above and (iv) all three conditions above.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.3/5" class="indent">The Agency does not record information on individual cases in such a way as to allow the analysis you have requested to be carried out. Information concerning maladministration, accuracy of maintenance calculations and outstanding arrears comes from several different information flows, therefore we cannot generate robust data concerning the proportion of cases affected by all three. The Agency can, however, provide the following information, which I hope is of use.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.3/6" class="indent">In 2006/07, the Agency made consolatory payments due to maladministration in 15,420 cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.3/7" class="indent">Between April 2007 and December 2007, a sample of 4,300 cases was checked for accuracy, of which 87% were found to have an assessment which was accurate to the nearest penny. Information on the accuracy of assessments is routinely published in Table 17 of the Quarterly Summary of Statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.571W.3/8" class="indent">As at November 2007 there were 1,220,200 current Child Support cases with an assessment or calculation. 781,900 of these cases had debt outstanding. This equates to 64 per cent of the current caseload. Most cases accrue debt once an assessment or calculation has been carried out. The effective date of the assessment or calculation is often backdated and debt accrues from the effective date.</p>

	<p pid="a.575W.0/19">Of those claimants whose continuous claim exceeds two years about half of the group are made up of those aged 50 plus. Up until April 2007 our customers aged 50 plus were not required to participate in the mandatory intensive activity period when on new deal 25 plus and so a stock of two year plus has built up. We now mandate all our customers to take part, and they will take up training allowances during any activity periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/20">A quarter of the group are those who have entered employment zones (EZs). Unlike the mandatory JSA new deals, customers participating in employment zones are not required to participate in full time activity and so need not break the JSA claim. EZ customers remain on JSA throughout the programme either until they leave benefit or they return to the standard JSA regime. It is therefore possible that some of the very hardest to help (despite significant intervention) remain unemployed beyond two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/21">A smaller group (about 8,000) are those that have been exempted from taking part in new deal and the mandatory option or intensive activity period (this stage would ordinarily take them from JSA on to a training allowance). Customers are exempted at the discretion of an adviser manager for reasons such as being a potentially violent customer, suffering from a serious drink or drug addiction, have a drink or drug addiction which is improving and progress to work provision is underway or those with mental health issues. The number of exclusions on new deal has increased over recent years. Following the work of a Jobcentre Plus led new deal task and finish group in 2007, the number and reason for exclusions is being more closely monitored.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/22">In regard to all claimants referred to we expect that a proportion of the cases are due to administrative error or a delay in a jobseeker entering provision promptly (for which sanctions can be applied). Jobcentre Plus is continually looking at ways of how we can reduce such error and has made significant in roads to reduce the number of 'overstayers' ie those delaying their progress on new deal, down from 17 per cent. in June 2006, to now less than 5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/23">The GP response paper Ready for Work (December 2007) announced the Government's plans for significant changes in the way we help and support our customers back into work:</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/24" class="indent">A stepped programme of support will be available for all customers from day one.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/25" class="indent">The successful new deal gateway will be refreshed and introduced for all customers from six months of a claim (bringing that support forward by 12 months for those 25 and over).</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/26" class="indent">All those reaching 12 months unemployment will enter the flexible new deal (FND), receiving intensive support from a specialist provider. During this time with a provider we expect all customers will enter work or participate in some form of full time activity increasing the chances of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.575W.0/27" class="indent">A high proportion moving into work will reduce the numbers who might otherwise have reached two years. Entering other full time activity will act to prevent the remainder from crossing the two year threshold.</p>

	<p pid="a.579W.2/5">The total number of national insurance numbers registered in 2006-07 was 1,539,000. This includes all adult registrations and those registered via the juvenile registration process just prior to age 16.</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.2/6">It is not possible to provide a direct comparison between the number of national insurance numbers registered to foreign nationals and the total number of national insurance numbers registered because some foreign nationals will obtain a NINO through the juvenile registration process and no numbers are available for this. Also, the data for adult foreign nationals and total NINO registrations are derived in different ways and captured over different periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.579W.2/7">The number of foreign nationals registered with NINOs does not indicate either the number of migrants coming to the UK or the number of foreign nationals in employment. The national insurance figures count all foreign nationals, including those who stay only briefly. ONS immigration statistics define a migrant as someone who stays in the UK for at least a year. Equally, ONS figures are not restricted to arrivals allocated a NINO, for example, non-working students, and family members not requiring a national insurance number.</p>

In December 2006, CLG and DEFRA issued a consultation on introducing minimum requirements for water efficiency in new buildings. The consultation gave a strong endorsement for the adoption of a performance standard for new homes to be administered through the building regulations. The standard will be set at 125 litres per person per day.</p>
	<p pid="a.585W.3/4">The Code for Sustainable Homes sets out standards, above the regulatory minimum, for the sustainability of new homes including energy and water. The code provides a means for house builders to differentiate their products, however, there is no national obligation for privately funded developments to be built to the code. Publicly funded homes must be built to code level 3. There are currently 395 registered developments that are building to the code, covering around 30,000 homes.</p>

	<p pid="a.589W.2/1">Leaseholders have a wide range of rights and protections that have been developed over the last 40 years. Significant improvements have been made to these rights through the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002. The majority of the rights and protections apply equally to leaseholders with social sector landlords as to those with private sector landlords. However, there are some necessary exceptions and variations.</p>
	<p pid="a.589W.2/2">Social sector landlords are primarily responsible for the provision of social housing. Their systems and arrangements are set up in order to achieve this and to comply with specific legislation in that regard, while recognising their obligations to leaseholders. This is one of the many factors that need to be taken into account when considering how best to frame leaseholder rights so that they can effectively deliver the benefits intended to all concerned. This can mean that it will not always be appropriate or helpful to make identical provisions for social sector and private sector leaseholders in order to provide them with similar rights and protections.</p>

In 2006-07 the HEG was replaced for new students by the maintenance grant and special support grant. A maximum of &pound;2,700 (&pound;2,765 in 2007-08) was available subject to means-testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.603W.2/14">Income thresholds for grant entitlement are being changed for students who will be entering higher education in or after September 2008. The income threshold for full entitlement to the maintenance grant is being increased to &pound;25,000 (compared with &pound;17,910 in 2007-08). The threshold for entitlement to a partial maintenance grant is increasing from &pound;38,330 in 2007-08 to &pound;60,005 for 2008-09. We estimate that the increased thresholds will mean that one-third of all students in England entering higher education in 2008-09 will receive a full non-repayable grant, while another one-third will receive a partial grant.</p>

	<p pid="a.612W.6/1">Airport police funding is a local matter for individual airports. There are currently nine airports &quot;designated&quot; under the Aviation Security Act 1982 for policing purposes&mdash;London Heathrow, London Gatwick, London Stansted, Edinburgh, Glasgow International, Prestwick, Aberdeen, Manchester and Birmingham. At these airports the airport operator is required to meet the costs of the agreed police presence. At non-designated airports, they either have a dedicated police presence or the police attend when there is an operational need to do so. These costs are funded wholly or partly by the police authority in which that airport is located, or by other means, for example, voluntary contributions by the airport operator.</p>
	<p pid="a.612W.6/2">The Government are also considering how to implement the conclusions of the independent report into airport policing, with the aim of clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the police, airport operators and other agencies to deliver a high level of security at UK airports and we will set out proposals on this later in the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.615W.0/1">Given the participation of the electricity generating sector in the EU emissions trading scheme, new coal power plants will have no impact on net emissions from industries covered by the scheme. This is because these power plants will have to surrender a carbon emission allowance for each tonne of carbon dioxide they emit, meaning that those carbon allowances will not be available to enable emissions by other EU ETS participants. The EU ETS covers power generation and energy intensive industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.615W.0/2">The market for renewable electricity is established by the renewables obligation which requires electricity suppliers to source a minimum proportion of their supply from renewable energy. Spending on other forms of electricity generation should therefore have no effect on that market.</p>

	<p pid="a.638W.6/1">The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts annual surveys of opium cultivation in Afghanistan. While UNODC does not conduct specific cannabis cultivation surveys in Afghanistan, it provides estimates based upon interviews with village elders while undertaking its opium survey. We remain concerned by the total opium cultivation figures, but welcome the UNODC's findings that it expects cultivation to &quot;decrease slightly in 2008&quot;. Poppy cultivation has increased primarily in the south, where insecurity is greatest. Where security, alternative livelihoods and governance exists, poppy cultivation has fallen: in 2007, the number of poppy free provinces doubled from six to 13. This year we hope to see further progress and support the Government of Afghanistan's target of over half of all provinces going poppy free in 2008. The following data is drawn from the UNODC surveys.</p>

	<p pid="a.639W.5/1">We remain engaged with a wide range of stakeholders and representatives of the ethnic groups in Burma. We are concerned about the situation in Karen State. Attacks carried out by the Burmese army on civilians in northern and western Karen State have been particularly intense over the past two years These have resulted in a significant increase in the number of internally displaced people and refugees on the Thai/Burmese border We have repeatedly called for a halt to such offensives and have urged both the military regime and the Karen National Union to intensify their efforts to find a peaceful settlement that will bring about a permanent end to the conflict. We continue to support Aung San Suu Kyi's statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-08">8 November 2007</phrase> calling for a genuine national dialogue between the government, opposition parties and ethnic groups in Burma. We believe that this statement is all the more relevant in light of the regime's announcement to hold a referendum on the constitution in May 2008 and elections in 2010. If the process is to lead to national reconciliation and stability, it must allow for the full participation of opposition and ethnic groups.</p>

	<p pid="a.643W.8/1">The Government are supportive of efforts to achieve gender equality and continue to work very closely with both the Women's National Commission and the Women's Budget Group on promoting gender equality within the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.8/2">In 2004, HM Treasury undertook a pilot project on gender analysis of expenditure with the Women's Budget Group. The project demonstrated the value of gender analysis in some areas and identified what tools and expertise were necessary within Government to carry out gender analysis, but that further work was needed before gender responsive budgeting could be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.8/3">In 2008, HM Treasury will be conducting further work that will determine whether it is prudent and feasible to disaggregate departmental expenditure statistics by gender.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.8/4">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), for its part, supports a wide range of global initiatives&mdash;bilateral and multilateral&mdash;to tackle the barriers to gender equality including gender stereotyping, violence against women, social and cultural attitudes and discriminatory laws and practices. These initiatives include funding projects overseas which protect and promote women's rights, playing an active role as an elected member of the UN Commission on the Status of Women and in other international forums including the EU and the Council of Europe, supporting their respective initiatives on gender equality, and maintaining a regular dialogue with Governments to help improve the human rights situation for women world-wide.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.8/5">As part of the FCO's gender equality scheme, published in April 2007, the FCO is considering how best to champion world-wide the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and the UN General Assembly Resolution (A/RES/61/143), adopted in December 2006, on violence against women.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.8/6">The FCO's view is that gender should not always be seen as an isolated policy area, unconnected to our other work. As such we have sought to mainstream gender into foreign policy, wherever possible and appropriate, by&mdash;for example&mdash;supporting and encouraging the involvement of women in peace negotiations, reconciliation work and in political and public life more broadly.</p>
	<p pid="a.643W.8/7">In all its work to promote gender equality the FCO works closely with other Government Departments, particularly the Department for International Development and the Department for Communities and Local Government, as well as non- governmental organisations active in this sector and the Women's National Commission.</p>

Once staff have been absent for six months, within a rolling period of 12 months, they are paid half their normal salary. Staff on sick leave may continue to receive salary at half rate for up to six months in a four year period before they cease to receive any salary.</p>

In the Gaza strip, emergency medical assistance is mainly provided by the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the Palestinian Medical Relief Society and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. The Government support the Ministry of Health through the European Commission's funding mechanism known as PEGASE (Palestine European De Gestion Et D'aide Socio-Economique). The Department for International Development has provided &pound;41.6 million to Palestinians in 2007-08 with &pound;18.45 million going through the PEGASE and the Temporary International Mechanism this financial year.

	<p pid="a.668W.8/2">While the Defence programme is regularly reviewed and updated, we currently plan to retain a fleet of 25 destroyers and frigates. The number of ships in service at any given time will vary as the older Type 42 destroyers are replaced by the more capable Type 45s.</p>
