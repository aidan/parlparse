The study found a small increase in congenital anomalies in populations living close to landfill sites. There was no suggestion of excess risks of cancer associated with landfill sites. The Department sought advice on the study from the independent expert Committee on the Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT). COT noted that the findings for birth outcomes were not consistent, and that the study provided no evidence that the rates of anomalies increased after sites had opened.

The output from these existing registrar training places, when combined with other increases and offset by expected retirements in the specialty is expected to result in around 582 trained specialists being available in surgery by 2010. The number of urologists per capita is therefore likely to increase significantly.</p>

	<p pid=".537W.3/1">In May 2001, the Government prepared a partial regulatory impact assessment to consider the impact of the European Union's chemicals management system REACH. A full regulatory impact assessment, with a more detailed cost benefit analysis, taking into account the wider economic impact will be carried out once the Commission has published its proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".537W.3/2">The Government are committed to having a transparent system and would expect to see as much information as possible made publicly available, which would certainly include basic hazard and exposure data associated with substances. However, in order to avoid free riders and to avoid stifling innovation, adequate controls on access to genuinely commercially sensitive data are needed whilst recognising the right of the public to have access to relevant and meaningful information on hazards and risk. We have had discussions with a number of stakeholders and will seek to work with the European Commission to ensure practical proposals come forward.</p>

	<p pid=".540W.3/1">Statutory guidance (PG6/30) was issued by the Government on what constitutes Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost for the mushroom substrate sector in February 1992, with a revision in February 1997. A second review of the guidance is currently being undertaken by the Environment Agency's Local Authority Unit. A draft, which can be found of the Agency's website: <a href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/lapc/">www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/lapc/</a> is currently out for stakeholder comment, with a deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-20">20 January</phrase>. The guidance will then be forwarded, within approximately two months, to my Department for a final consultation stage, and thereafter published.</p>
	<p pid=".540W.3/2">Most processes manufacturing mushroom substrate are regulated under Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. As such they must be authorised by the relevant local authority with the objective of using the Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost to minimise air polluting emissions, including odour.</p>
	<p pid=".540W.3/3">Ultimately it is for local authorities to determine what constitutes Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost for any particular plant. While they must have regard to the statutory guidance, they are not bound by it, and could (subject to appeal) impose more stringent requirements if they considered it necessary and provided they met the relevant statutory test.</p>

	<p pid=".542W.9/1">There have been two main British operations in Afghanistan: Operation Jacana and Operation Fingal. Operation Fingal began in December 2001 and is the on-going United Kingdom support to the International Stabilisation Assistance Force (ISAF), assisting with the provision of security and stability in Kabul. Operation Jacana, which took place from April 2002 to July 2002, was the deployment of 45 commando and elements of 3 commando brigade in support of UK forces operating in south-eastern Afghanistan to deny and destroy the al-Qaeda terrorist infrastructure. Operation Veritas (rather than Neritas) is the name given to the overarching UK contribution to the US-led campaign against international terrorism, and encompasses Operations Fingal and Jacana. Ptarmigan, Snipe, Condor, and Buzzard were names given to objectives within Operation Jacana.</p>
	<p pid=".542W.9/2">Common routes have been used for supply to all UK troops in Afghanistan (including during Op Jacana). During the initial period of operations in Afghanistan, all materiel was supplied by air. As the security situation stabilised, it has been possible to develop land supply routes both within Afghanistan and between Afghanistan and neighbouring countries. However, land re-supply has been limited to common commodities such as food, fuel, bottled water, and building materials. Military equipment continues to be flown into Afghanistan from the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".542W.9/3">There is one land supply route between Pakistan and Afghanistan (Kabul). It has been used to supply the majority of fuel to UK armed forces in Kabul and Bagram. This route is utilised and maintained solely by contractors, who are primarily based in Pakistan. There is a further permanent land supply route within Afghanistan (between Kabul and Bagram), and this is secured and maintained by coalition (including UK) military personnel and civilian contractors.</p>

	<p pid=".550W.6/1">Public funding for the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Families' Association commenced under the terms of an agreed Charter in 1999. No formal performance indicators were set for the Association, but the Charter laid down its objectives and other requirements. Funding was withdrawn from October 2002 because the Association had consistently failed to meet its objectives, and had also failed to meet other requirements of the Charter, including the production of annual reports and accounts and the maintenance of an appropriate management structure. The decision to withdraw funding was made by the Second Sea Lord, as the top level budget holder accountable for these funds.</p>
	<p pid=".550W.6/2">The Department's aim in setting up the Association was to develop an independent organisation to represent the views of Naval Service families. This remains our firm intention and we intend that a new body, with the title, 'Naval Families' Federation', will be in place this spring. We are considering a number of options to ensure that the new Federation grows safely into a well-managed and independent body, preferably with charitable status. This will include the use of carefully selected performance indicators, and the achievements of the Federation against these indicators will be monitored by the Second Sea Lord's Personal and Family Service staff.</p>

The remaining 20 (Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome &amp; Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Zambia) are receiving interim relief. The main objective of the initiative is to ensure that countries exit the HIPC process with sustainable levels of debt. The HIPC Initiative has the flexibility to provide, when appropriate, additional debt relief at completion point. The UK is pressing the World bank and the IMF to widen their approach to topping up, so that any HIPC eligible country facing unsustainable debts, that has demonstrated its commitment to poverty reduction and economic reform, should qualify for this additional relief.</p>

	<p pid=".563W.2/1">The Connexions service has a broad remit: to offer to all young people between 13 and 19 information, advice and guidance (including on careers) to improve participation and achievement in learning, and to signpost personal development opportunities. Since type and level of need is a key determinant of the kind of personal adviser support made available, it is not appropriate to set maximum waiting times. Rather, the Connexions service has developed access to personal adviser support via a wide range of traditional and modern-day channels. In addition to conventional appointment systems, personal advisers are available on a Xdrop-in&quot; basis in schools or colleges as well as in High Street Connexions centres, that are open at times young people want. Instant access is a key feature of Connexions Direct, a telephone and web-based service currently being trialled in several areas of England. Here, support is available from 8 am to 2 am seven days per week and 365 days per year. This is in fulfilment of one of the key Connexions principles: to design and deliver the service around the needs of young people and to listen to their views.</p>

In December 2002 the Government launched the document XTransforming Youth Work Resourcing Excellent Youth Services&quot; which provides a cross-Government view of the key elements of a high quality, well managed and properly resourced youth service. The document underpins the Transforming Youth Work programme and the Government's commitment to work with local authorities to ensure the delivery of a high quality youth service for young people which is at the heart of the Connexions Service.</p>
	<p pid=".564W.0/4" class="italic">Making more young people active citizens and engaging them in developmental activities</p>
	<p pid=".564W.0/5">This aspect will be assessed by the extent to which Connexions Partnerships provide access to opportunities for young people to broaden their horizons, develop their talents and become actively engaged in their communities, through for example Millennium Volunteers and other volunteering initiatives, sports, arts and recreational activities; and through specific programmes such as the Neighbourhood Support Fund.</p>
	<p pid=".564W.0/6" class="italic">Support for Connexions from parents, carers and teachers</p>
	<p pid=".564W.0/7">The views of young people and a range of key stakeholders involved in Partnerships will be sought on a regular basis through a comprehensive programme of opinion surveys starting in December 2002. In addition, the findings of national and local evaluations, the self-assessments undertaken by Partnerships and the outcome of Ofsted inspections will be used to assess progress and inform the development of Connexions Partnerships.</p>
	<p pid=".564W.0/8">One of the key criteria for judging the overall effectiveness of Connexions Partnerships will be the progress they make towards meeting their target of reducing the proportion of 16 to 18-year-olds not in learning and work. With the exception of recently established Partnerships, all Partnerships have been set a target of reducing by 10 per cent. the proportion of young people who are not in education, employment and training by November 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".566W.2/1">The total running costs budget for the Connexions Service National Unit (CSNU) in 2002&ndash;03 is #5.791 million (budgets are not yet agreed for 2003&ndash;04).</p>
	<p pid=".566W.2/2">CSNU is responsible for a range of programme budgets including the main Connexions Service budget, which totals #449 million in 2002&ndash;03. Of that total, #337 million is allocated directly to Connexions Partnerships through the Connexions grant, while roughly one half of the remainder (c. #52 million ) is used to maintain careers services in those areas where Connexions Partnerships are not yet operational. A further third (c. #35 million) goes to Partnerships to fund the pre-launch development costs of those starting during the year and to support Summer Plus activity in response to the Government's street crime agenda. The remaining funds are used centrally to support the Partnership network, for example, through the training of Personal Advisers and the development of tracking systems.</p>
	<p pid=".566W.2/3">In 2003&ndash;04, the total Connexions Service budget will be #475 million, of which #439 million will be allocated directly to Partnerships through the Connexions grant. Of the remainder, #17 million will go to Partnerships to continue supporting Summer Plus while #20 million will, as this year, fund work centrally in support of the Partnership network.</p>
	<p pid=".566W.2/4">The table shows the funding allocated via the grant to each Connexions Partnership in both 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04. In addition to the main Connexions budget, CSNU is responsible for a range of other initiatives such as the Neighbourhood Support Fund, the Millennium Volunteers programme and a number of Youth Service funds. The total programme funding available for these other initiatives is #77.4 million in 2002&ndash;03 and #62.9 million in 2003&ndash;04.</p>

	<p pid=".579W.2/2">Teachers and those who work with children and young persons, in effect, act in loco parents for those in their charge, and they require a high standard of physical and mental fitness to undertake the demands involved. The provisions of the Education (Teachers' Qualifications and Health Standards) (England) Regulations 1999 ensure that such workers are fit for the job, and are essential in adding to the safeguards aimed at protecting the health, welfare and education of children.</p>
	<p pid=".579W.2/3">It is vital that people who work on a regular basis with children and young persons (for example, home tutors, support staff, and welfare officers) are fit to do so. It would not, therefore, be appropriate to limit this requirement to teachers.</p>

	<p pid=".580W.0/1">The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) has provided #1 million to support an Early Support Pilot Programme, which is a pan-disability national initiative aimed at identifying and developing good service provision for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) and disabilities and their families. The Programme includes a number of projects looking at services for children with visual impairment. It will support development in a number of areas, including: initial assessment of need; co-ordination/multi-agency support for families; better information and access for families; improved professional knowledge and skills; service review and development; and improved partnership across agencies and geographical boundaries.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.0/2">The Programme is being evaluated by a team from the National Children's' Bureau on an ongoing basis. The evaluation will inform the future development of the Programme.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.0/3">The Department of Health is responsible for the provision of eye checks undertaken by local primary health care teams in accordance with professional advice. The principal threats to eye health and impaired vision development should be detected at or before school age is reached and be identified during a visual screening on school entry. Consideration is currently being given to the introduction of a universal test for all children when they start school at four or five. Older children may develop myopia (short sight) which is usually recognised when they complain of difficulty seeing clearly at distance. Since the onset of myopia commonly occurs between the ages of nine and 16 it is not possible to identify optimum ages for screening. Children may Xpass&quot; a routine screening examination only to find problems within the next few months. There is then a possibility that some children might not receive advice to attend an optometrist until after their next routine screening appointment. All children up to the age of 15 are entitled to a free sight test as are children aged 16&ndash;18 if they are in full-time education. Whenever parents or carers suspect that there is a problem with their child's sight they should take them to the optician's.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.0/4">There are no plans to collect data on children in school, whose visual needs have not been diagnosed. However, from January 2004 the DfES will be collecting data by type of SEN as part of the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census. Information will be collected on pupils with statements of special educational need and those receiving additional or different help to support their SEN&mdash;School Action and School Action Plus. One of the categories will be visual impairment and schools will be able to record it as either a primary need or a secondary need. It is hoped that this will provide more detailed data on pupils with a range of SEN, including visual impairment.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.0/5">No assessment has been made of the impact of undetected sight problems on the educational attainment and inclusion of children in school. Nor has an assessment been made of current arrangements for eye health education in schools.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.0/6">Students undertaking initial teacher training are required to understand their responsibilities under the DfES's SEN Code of Practice and to know where to go to seek advice. They are also required to be able to demonstrate that they can differentiate their teaching to meet the individual needs of pupils with SEN, including those with visual impairment.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.0/7">Support for training and development in relation to SEN and disabilities is available to local education authorities (LEAs) and schools through the SEN component of the DfES's Standards Fund. The funding is designed to be used flexibly to support developmental opportunities ranging from basic awareness-raising to more in-depth studies, possibly leading to formal qualifications. It is for individual LEAs and schools to determine expenditure priorities according to local needs and circumstances, but it would certainly be possible to use the funding to support training for teachers in the area of visual impairment.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.0/8">The SEN Code of Practice provides practical advice to LEAs, maintained schools and others on carrying out their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for children's SEN, including for children with visual impairment. The Code aims to promote consistency of approach, but, within its guidelines, it is for individual schools and LEAs to determine appropriate intervention based on an assessment of each child's individual needs and circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".580W.0/9">It would be for schools and LEAs to decide whether it was appropriate to carry out a specific visual assessment, if it was thought that visual impairment was contributing to a child's other educational difficulties.</p>

	<p pid=".582W.2/1">Clarification of the nature of stage payments to Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) to purchase new trains confirmed that they did not create an asset, and hence those payments were not a charge on the Department's departmental expenditure limit (DEL). Although the Department for Regional Development made substantial grant payments to NIR in 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03 in respect of trains, none of this scores in the budget under the resource budgeting rules that apply for those two financial years. As soon as this technicality was clarified, in August 2002, #49 million was made available for re-allocation, under the normal rules that apply to all Departments. This funding, together with other funds identified by Departments, has been allocated to good effect across Departments and is profiled to be spent in the current financial year.

	<p pid=".583W.9/2">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I recognise the detrimental impact that crime has on the retail industry and other business sectors. That is why I launched a consultation process in December to seek the views of business organisations and other stakeholders on the best means of creating and maintaining effective partnerships to reduce the opportunities for crime against business and enhance the contribution that business can make to crime reduction.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.9/3">It is our intention to build on the good work already done by organisations like the British Retail Consortium in the development of retail crime reduction partnerships in main town and shopping centres. We will continue to support such partnerships.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.9/4">The Home Secretary announced in April last year a new survey of crime affecting retail and manufacturing business. This will give a range of information about the types of crime which most impact on these business sectors and provide insights into the most effective interventions to address them. Results of the survey should be available in the summer.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.9/5">The Government have allocated #15 million over the years 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04 to improve the security of small retail businesses in deprived areas. Nearly 3,000 shops benefited from the first year's funding and a further 4,500 individual shops and businesses will benefit directly from the #6 million made available under the second year of the scheme. A further #6 million will be available in the third year to enable more shopkeepers to benefit from extra security.</p>
	<p pid=".583W.9/6">Many of the Government's crime reduction initiatives, such as the closed circuit television initiative with nearly 700 schemes approved, also have a beneficial impact on retail crime.</p>

	<p pid=".586W.5/2">There are regular discussions on the whole range of counter terrorist issues through a number of committees. Where intelligence exists about specific threats we seek to thwart them and take whatever response we believe necessary to ensure the protection of the public. If the Government or the police thought it was necessary to give the public a specific warning we would do it without hesitation. Our prime consideration is their safety.</p>

	<p pid=".589W.5/2">Domestic violence is not separately identified in recorded crime statistics collected by the Home Office. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary collects figures from police forces on best value performance indicators (BVPIs) broken down by force and basic command unit (BCU) area.</p>
	<p pid=".589W.5/3">BVPI 153a records the number of domestic violence incidents where there was a power of arrest. Domestic violence is defined as an incident of threatening behaviour, violence or abuse (psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional) between adults who are or who have been intimate partners (defined as more than just friends or acquaintances) of family members, regardless of gender. Family members are defined as mother, father, son, daughter, brother, sister, grandparents, in-laws and step family.</p>
	<p pid=".589W.5/4">Richmond BCU is co-terminus with the London borough and figures can be provided for that area but the data does not enable the number of incidents in Twickenham to be identified. This information has been collected only for the last two years. Previous records were compiled on a different basis and not to BCU level.</p>
	<p pid=".589W.5/5">There were 329 domestic violence incidents (as defined above) in Richmond BCU in 2000&ndash;01 and 384 in 2001&ndash;02. In the Metropolitan police area there were 27,681 incidents in 2000&ndash;01 and 28,794 in 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid=".589W.5/6">It is not possible to say how many of these figures were homicides.</p>
	<p pid=".589W.5/7">The Government are committed to tackling domestic violence at all levels. It is a serious and abhorrent crime that accounts for one quarter of all violent crime and claims the lives of two women a week. Nearly half of all female murder victims are killed by a partner or an ex-partner. The Government will do everything it can to tackle it and ensure that victims receive the highest levels of support and protection.</p>
	<p pid=".589W.5/8">My right hon. Friend Home Secretary recently announced a consultation paper setting out proposals to prevent domestic violence, which will be published by spring 2003. This consultation will build on the initial consultation on domestic violence in the White Paper, XJustice for All&quot;, and the on-going work of the inter-departmental Ministerial Group on Domestic Violence.</p>

Four female foreign nationals were encountered (one Latvian, one Estonian, one Russian and one Colombian) who all declared they were employed at the club.</p>
	<p pid=".590W.2/2">The Latvian and Estonian females confirmed they were part of a group of 17 dancers who were granted a 12 week work permit on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-01">1 July 2002</phrase>. These two individuals advised that they had entered the UK (Northern Ireland) overland via the Irish Republic on a number of occasions since <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-01">1 July</phrase> and had not seen an immigration officer on arrival. A provision of The Variation of Leave (Entry through Ireland) Order 1981 is that persons arriving in the United Kingdom by this route are deemed to have leave for a specific period as a visitor. They have, however, not been granted leave to work by an immigration officer and without doing so are not allowed to take employment. The individuals and the club owner were advised of this and that the deemed leave was due to expire the following day. The Immigration Service has confirmed that the two women departed the UK in order to avoid overstaying their leave.</p>
	<p pid=".590W.2/3">The Russian and Colombian females were both visa nationals but neither held valid UK visas. The Immigration Service therefore served illegal entry papers on them and the Russian national made a voluntary departure on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-20">20 December</phrase>. The Colombian national has submitted an application to remain in the United Kingdom and has been granted temporary release pending consideration of her case.</p>
	<p pid=".590W.2/4">An immigration officer examined the passports of the four foreign nationals encountered at the club and noted that all four were of adult age.</p>

The orders prevent attendance at domestic matches and travel to matches played overseas. There are currently over 1,400 people subject to banning orders.

However, because of the high number of applications in the latter part of 2002 this is currently taking around 10 weeks on average. Some that need further inquiries or more detailed consideration can take around 12 months to decide subject to how easy it is to obtain the information and how quickly applicants respond to such requests. We are taking measures to improve this situation and expect to make significant progress towards our three week target for initial screening over the next two to three months, and to reduce the turnaround time for deciding more complex cases. There are no guidelines on average processing times for specific types of application.</p>

	<p pid=".595W.2/1">These are matters for the Chief Constable of Sussex. I understand that the changes in question stem from a force operational review that the chief constable established with the aim of getting more capacity at the front line of policing. The review acknowledged the important role the traffic division played in the policing of Sussex and concluded that the best way forward was the establishment of a smaller road policing unit (RPU) and a dedicated force wide unit taking advantage of automatic number plate recognition technology. The RPU will concentrate on the investigation of road death, potential road death and serious injury collisions, on patrolling and dealing with incidents on the strategic road network, and on assisting district commanders by providing specialist expertise.</p>
	<p pid=".595W.2/2">These changes reflect the priorities contained within the National Policing Plan 2003&ndash;06. They will enable officers to concentrate on core police business and ensure a high level of service to the community, while also allowing the effective use of specialist skills.</p>
	<p pid=".595W.2/3">I understand from the chief constable that within the new arrangements the established RPU base at Chichester will remain, with an enhanced staffing and vehicle level. Adur and Worthing, with Chichester, are within the West Downs division. Deployment profiles are in the process of being established to provide a response across the division. Road policing lends itself to a flexible approach and support will also be provided from other base areas such as North Downs and Brighton and Hove.</p>
	<p pid=".595W.2/4">The chief constable and force operational review identified the number of differing shift and rest day patterns across the force area as adversely affecting the force's ability to mobilise resources quickly and effectively. A force working pattern was therefore proposed. In line with Police Regulations this pattern was put to the workforce, who voted overwhelmingly for its adoption. A shift pattern has now been developed by the RPU, which maximises resourcing levels at times of operational need such as the morning and evening traffic peaks.</p>

In December 2001 the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister issued guidance on the provision of interim mass decontamination facilities using existing equipment. All fire authorities have trained their personnel who need to use this equipment and approximately 120 of the service's senior commanders have received multi agency training, which will continue.

A further #27.7 million expenditure on equipment costs is already committed in 2003&ndash;04. The full programme will provide an extra 4,000 protective suits.</p>

	<p pid=".600W.5/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2001-08-22">22 August 2001</phrase>, following public consultation, and taking into account the recommendations in the Stewart report, published in May 2000, we introduced changes to the planning procedures and guidance (PPG8) for telecommunications mast development which significantly improved the planning procedures and guidance for telecommunications mast development. Our changes included:</p>
	<p pid=".600W.5/2" class="indent">strengthened public consultation requirements on mast proposals of 15 metres and below so that they are the same as for planning applications;</p>
	<p pid=".600W.5/3" class="indent">increased the time for an authority to deal with prior approval applications to 56 days;</p>
	<p pid=".600W.5/4" class="indent">underlined that school governors must be consulted on all proposals for new masts on or near a school or college; and</p>
	<p pid=".600W.5/5" class="indent">increased fees to enable authorities to carry out full public consultation</p>
	<p pid=".600W.5/6">In November 2000, we published a revised Code of Best Practice on Mobile Phone Network Development. This is a tripartite document between central and local Government and the telecommunications industry and builds on the advice in PPG8 XTelecommunications&quot; and the operators' 10 commitments to improve consultation on mast proposals with local communities and local planning authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".600W.5/7">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no plans to amend further the planning arrangements for telecommunications development.</p>

	<p pid=".602W.0/1">The Adviser Discretion Fund was introduced to give personal advisers more flexibility in the help they can offer their new deal clients. Advisers have the discretion to make awards from the fund, normally up to a maximum of #300, to pay for any goods and services needed to help an individual overcome the barriers preventing them applying for or taking up a job.</p>
	<p pid=".602W.0/2">The Adviser Discretion Fund cannot be used: as a cash inducement to take up a job; to pay for things funded in other ways under the new deal; to pay for Criminal Records Bureau disclosure certificates; or once a client has taken up a job. Payments can be made in error if an adviser mistakenly makes awards for these purposes, or in cases where the total monetary value of the awards made to an individual exceeds #300 (without prior authorisation from the Jobcentre Plus business manager). Information on the level of such erroneous payments is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".602W.0/3">Since the launch of the Adviser Discretion Fund in July 2001, 56 allegations of fraud have been or are currently being investigated, involving a total of #10,921. This represents 0.03 per cent. of awards made and 0.07 per cent. of their total monetary value.</p>

	<p pid=".602W.3/1">We recognise that many people making a claim to benefit will be in need of immediate financial support. To avoid unnecessary hardship, discretionary payments on account of benefit (interim payments) can be made where a claim has not been determined but the Decision Maker is satisfied that the basic conditions of entitlement for the benefit are likely to be met. The amount of any interim payment is automatically recoverable from the main benefit when it is awarded. No record is kept of the number or value of interim payments made.</p>
	<p pid=".602W.3/2">Crisis Loan alignment payments can be made to people awaiting their first payment of benefit which is paid in arrears, or their first payment of wages. Crisis Loans made to people awaiting benefit payments will cover their needs until their first benefit pay-day, following which full or interim payments of benefit can be made. In the main, these payments are made to people of working age (as pensioners are generally paid in advance). Information is not collected separately on the number or value of alignment payments made to people awaiting a first payment of benefit.</p>

There is nothing currently within the Department's procurement policy that would prevent such contracts from being let. The Government believe it is important for consumers to have choice in financial products, including the availability of Xethical&quot; products. However, it would not be appropriate for the Government exclusively to support the development of one specific group of financial service providers. It is for individual consumers to decide the attributes they most value from their financial services and for financial services firms to be transparent about their use of funds and investments.</p>

	<p pid=".604W.5/1">This Government have done much to assist pensioners. The Government want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country. The first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.5/2">From April 2002, the Government are spending an extra #6 billion a year in real terms on pensioners as a result of policies introduced since 1997. This includes #2&frac12; billion more on the poorest third of pensioners. Three times more than an earnings link since 1998 would have given them.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.5/3">The basic state pension is the foundation of income in retirement. The Government increased rates in April 2002 by #3 a week for single pensioners, to #75.50, and for couples by #4.80 a week, to #120.70. From April 2003, there will be further above inflation increases of #1.95 a week, to #77.45, and for couples by #3.10 a week to #123.80.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.5/4">As at March 2002, around 13,100 people in Mitcham and Morden were in receipt of state pension.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.5/5">From April 2003, no pensioner will have to get by on less than #102.10 (#155.80 for married couples). Mitcham and Morden has approximately 2,500 people claiming the minimum income guarantee receiving on average approximately #57 per week compared to #32 per week in 1997.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.5/6">Around half of all pensioner households will benefit from the new groundbreaking pension credit being introduced in October.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.5/7">In addition, other initiatives have significantly helped pensioners. These include winter fuel payments (WFPs), which will continue to be paid to qualifying households at #200 a year throughout this Parliament. In winter 2001&ndash;02, there were approximately 14,300 recipients of a winter fuel payment in Mitcham and Morden.</p>
	<p pid=".604W.5/8">Free TV licences are available for the over 75s, worth #104 a year. The WFPs and TV licences are non income-related and are tax free.</p>
