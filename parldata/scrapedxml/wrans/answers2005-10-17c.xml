	<p pid="c.666W.5/1">As a result of concerns that the Ministry of Defence had about DML's ability to manage a project as complex as D154, the company was subjected to three pre-contract award evaluations, the first in 1994 and the last in 1996. As reported by the NAO in their 1998 report into the sale of the dockyards, DML were subsequently required to implement a number of changes in order to satisfy the Department that they were adequately resourced and structured. These conditions were met and the changes in structure, processes and systems implemented by DML were instrumental in ensuring that key facilities were ready in time for the start of HMS Vanguard's overhaul in 2002. This was a major achievement, a fact that was recognised by the NAO in their 2002 report The construction of nuclear submarine facilities at Devonport&quot;.</p>

It has always been the case that this funding was time limited and not to be viewed as mainstream support.</p>
	<p pid="c.671W.5/3">From April 2005 until March 2006, responsibility for the remainder of the Rural Transport Partnership funding for community transport projects in East Sussex has transferred to the South East England Development Agency. The South East England Development Agency is looking at its rural strategic priorities to ensure careful use of funding support available in the future in line with Government priorities. Of course, there is no certainty at this time whether all existing types of projects will still be relevant. It should be noted that the Regional Development Agencies are not the major source of funding for projects such as the Battle Area Community Transport in rural areas, this will continue to be local authorities.</p>

Wildlife trade is dynamic and trends over time may reflect such diverse factors as policy decisions in exporting countries (e.g. changes to export quotas), traders gaining access to new sources of supply, market forces (supply and demand) and the actions of CITES (through the significant trade process or EC stricter measures).</p>

	<p pid="c.675W.5/1">The disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the chytrid fungus <i>B. dendrobatidis</i>, has been discovered in an introduced amphibian species, the North American bullfrog, at a site in Kent.</p>
	<p pid="c.675W.5/2">During 2005 English Nature has funded the Institute of Zoology to undertake screening of the native amphibians present at the Kent bullfrog site. This work is still in progress, and results are expected soon. Retrospective sampling of native amphibians collected from various locations in southern England in the 1990s detected no B. <i>dendrobatidis</i> infection.</p>
	<p pid="c.675W.5/3">Until the results of the screening of native amphibians at the Kent site are available, it is difficult to give an accurate assessment of the risk posed by the finding of <i>B. dendrobatidis</i> in the UK. This is because research in other countries has demonstrated a range of responses by amphibian populations. In some cases the amphibians are infected by <i>B.dendrobatidis</i> but appear to show no ill effects, some amphibian populations appear to carry the infection with low levels of health effects and mortality, whilst some populations suffer massive mortality and eventual local extinction.</p>
	<p pid="c.675W.5/4">It is encouraging that during routine inspections at the Kent site there have been no obvious signs of disease or higher than normal mortality among native amphibians. Moreover, to our knowledge there is no reported pattern of symptoms or mortality from other amphibian sites that would be consistent with chytridiomycosis.</p>

The 2005 review provides an opportunity to reflect on existing policies and delivery mechanisms, to evaluate progress to date on outcomes and to re-affirm our long-term strategy on waste.</p>
	<p pid="c.677W.0/3">The review will be looking at the targets set in Waste Strategy 2000.</p>
	<p pid="c.677W.0/4">The Government are also currently undertaking a review of recycling and composting targets for local authorities in the light of performance against 2003&ndash;04 targets and will look at what levels and what forms of targets will be the most efficient at continuing the recent improvements we have seen. There will be a public consultation on this later this year.</p>

	<p pid="c.677W.3/1">Local authorities are not currently under an obligation to collect and dispose of commercial waste. However, under section 45 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, they are required to arrange for the collection of commercial waste if requested to do so by the producer of waste. The authority may charge for the collection of commercial waste. Most commercial waste is collected by private contractors.</p>
	<p pid="c.677W.3/2">All waste collected by a council falls under the heading of municipal waste, even if it comes from commercial sources.</p>
	<p pid="c.677W.3/3">For commercial waste (i.e. that portion of waste originating in the commercial sector which is not collected by local authorities), Waste Strategy 2000 sets out a target to reduce the amount of industrial and commercial waste sent to landfill to 85 per cent. of that landfilled in 1998 by 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.677W.3/4">The imposition of landfill tax is designed to help the UK achieve this target. The current rate of landfill tax is &pound;18 per tonne, which is set to rise by &pound;3 per year to &pound;35per tonne by 2010. Business may receive free and independent support and advice to help them increase their profitability by sending less waste to landfill. Envirowise was set up in 1994 for that purpose. Together, these two instruments have gone a long way towards increasing the amount of commercial waste that is being recycled.</p>
	<p pid="c.677W.3/5">The most recent data shows that 36.6 per cent. of commercial waste was recycled or re-used in 2002&ndash;03. Over the same period, the amount of commercial and industrial waste that was landfilled was 86 per cent. of the amount landfilled in 1998. This shows that the Government are certainly on course to meet the Waste Strategy 2000 target.</p>

	<p pid="c.678W.2/1">The Drinking Water Inspectorate has promoted research into the issue of oestrogens from contraceptive pills in water. The research investigated the effect of conventional water treatment processes on the removal and breakdown of oestrogens. This showed that disinfection treatments such as chlorination or ozonation destroy these chemicals and physical treatments such as sedimentation or filtration remove them by adsorption.</p>
	<p pid="c.678W.2/2">Other research has shown an absence of oestrogenic response in fish at raw water abstraction points, prior to treatment for drinking water. In light of these results, the Drinking Water Inspectorate is confident that oestrogens will not be detectable in tap water at significant concentrations and no further research is currently planned.</p>
	<p pid="c.678W.2/3">The use of hormonal substances for growth promotion in farm animals has been banned in the EUsince 1988. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) carries out statutory surveillance to monitor compliance with the ban. Its results show no evidence of abuse of such substances. The VMD's surveillance results are available from its website: <a href="http://www.vmd.gov.uk">www.vmd.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.678W.2/4">The Government, therefore, believe that no specific research on farm animal growth hormones in tap water is needed, as it is not considered that these substances pose a threat to drinking water quality.</p>

	<p pid="c.679W.9/1">Measures to address congestion on the A1 through Tyneside, were identified in the Tyneside Area Multi Modal Study. The Secretary of State, in his response to the study recommendations in 2003, encouraged the Tyne and Wear local authorities to develop measures to help alleviate congestion, and also asked the Highways Agency (HA) to look at other possible congestion relief measures, including widening. The HA has made substantial progress on identifying widening solutions but this needs to be linked to the predicted outcomes from the local authorities' demand management strategy. We have recently received a Transport Innovation Fund bid from the Tyne and Wear authorities, which if successful will allow them to develop their ideas on this strategy.</p>

	<p pid="c.684W.5/1">Under the Town Police Clauses Act 1847, hackney carriage drivers outside London (in England and Wales) are licensed to ply for hire within a prescribed distance&quot; (normally, as is the case in Solihull, the whole of the local authority area, but if the area is divided into zones, then one or more zones). The drivers can wait at ranks and they can pick up passengers who flag them down while they are located in their own prescribed distance; they cannot accept immediate hirings&mdash;whether at ranks or flag-downs&mdash;while outside this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.684W.5/2">In addition to the provisions of taxi legislation, there is also the possibility of regulations restricting the use of hackney carriages on public highways which might have implications for where drivers can accept flagged hirings. These regulations are matters for local traffic authorities. Traffic authorities have powers to restrict or regulate the use of a road by vehicular traffic of any class under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.</p>

	<p pid="c.687W.5/1">The study has been considering the legal and administrative feasibility of a Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation as well as its cost-effectiveness and compatibility with other government objectives. A number of stakeholder workshops were held in the spring to discuss some of the key issues, and meetings have also been held with the European Commission and others. We are close to completing the feasibility study, and hope to publish it shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.687W.8/1">Mobile phone publicity forms part of the Government's THINK! road safety campaign. Radio and cinema advertising has been used primarily to encourage motorists not to use a hand held mobile phone while driving, but the campaign has also produced posters and leaflets which are distributed free to employers via local authority road safety officers who support our campaigns within their areas. Variable messages signs on motorways also carry advice regarding mobile phones in rotation with other THINK! Road safety messages.</p>
	<p pid="c.687W.8/2">From the financial year 2003&ndash;04 when the legislation banning the use of hand held mobile phones was introduced until <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April 2005</phrase>, the Department invested over &pound;1.5 million in mobile phone publicity campaigns. The Department estimates that it will spend a further &pound;500,000 on publicity in this area in this financial year.</p>
	<p pid="c.687W.8/3">In addition, in the financial year 2004&ndash;05 the Department paid a grant to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents under the DFT's challenge fund to prepare a leaflet on Mobile Phones and Driving for Employers&quot; which contained advice and a sample policy that employers might put in place. This projectcost &pound;10,376.

	<p pid="c.688W.2/1">The Government have run national advertising campaigns relating to reducing speed for over 10 years and to reducing drink drive for nearly 40years.</p>
	<p pid="c.688W.2/2">Advertising on each of these areas is taken forward under the THINK! road safety campaign, which has an annual budget of &pound;14.1 million. Other campaign subjects include seatbelts, teenagers and children, motorcycles, driver tiredness and mobiles.</p>
	<p pid="c.688W.2/3">Speed is a year-round problem and to tackle this, the speed reduction campaign runs activity at staggered intervals throughout the year. The campaign includes TV, radio, cinema and posters with an additional radio and poster element dealing specifically with speeding on rural roads.</p>
	<p pid="c.688W.2/4">The drink drive campaign runs an integrated campaign every year focused particularly at Christmas and in the summer when the killed and seriously injured statistics peak. The campaign traditionally always includes TV, radio and posters and has included cinema advertising since summer 2004. In addition, we have broadened our reach to the target audience of young men by linking with the drinks industry. For example, 20,000 pubs across the country supported the summer 2005 campaign by placing posters highlighting the issue in their pubs.</p>

	<p pid="c.689W.0/1">We know from our evaluation of various small-scale yellow and other dedicated school bus schemes that well-designed schemes have the potential to reduce car dependency for journeys to school and the traffic congestion that results from this. However, care needs to be taken to ensure that schemes do not reduce levels of walking or cycling or undermine the viability of important bus services available to the wider public.</p>
	<p pid="c.689W.0/2">We therefore want to encourage individual local authorities to consider school bus schemes as part of broader local transport planning and to decide whether or not they would be appropriate to their area. We will give capital bids for such schemes careful consideration, taking account of value for money, regional priorities and affordability. We approved &pound;18.7 million funding for a yellow bus scheme serving 100 schools in West Yorkshire as part of the local transport settlement for 2004&ndash;05. Funding for this project is being released in three phases with the release of the third phase of funding subject to the first phase meeting its objectives with respect to modal switch from car.</p>

	<p pid="c.691W.2/15"><sup>(6)</sup>The figures for 2002/03 onwards are on a different basis from those for earlier years, so are not directly comparable with the figures up to 2001/02. The figures from 2002/03 onwards are more comprehensive as they include some institutions (such as specialist designated institutions) previously excluded from statistical publications, and also take into account changes to funding arrangements made by the LSC since taking over responsibility for FE funding. The impact of these changes is estimated to have increased overall learner numbers by around 250,000 between 2001/02 and 2002/03, but the effect on numbers of LLDD in particular has not been estimated.</p>

	<p pid="c.691W.5/2">We are committed to ensuring access for all children to a variety of activities beyond the school day. As part of our extended schools strategy, we recently announced funding of &pound;680 million to support schools, through their local authorities, towards developing extended services, including breakfast and after school clubs. By 2010, extended services will be accessible through all our schools; and in half of primary schools and a third of secondary schools by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="c.691W.5/3">We do not endorse individual organisations and so will not be running pilot schemes with Children First. It will be for schools, in consultation with parents and their communities, to decide how to roll out such activities. Some may choose to deliver them direct, or through voluntary or private sector providers like Children First.</p>

	<p pid="c.693W.3/1">Funding for the further education (FE) sector is not being reduced. We are putting more money than ever into further education. Total funding for the FE sector will increase by over &pound;1 billion in 2005/06 compared to 2002/03&mdash;a 25 per cent. increase.</p>
	<p pid="c.693W.3/2">The Department allocates funds for education and training in the post-16 learning and skills sector to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) through our annual grant letter. Funding allocations for FE providers increased by 16.3 per cent. between 2002/03 and 2003/04, by 9.1 per cent. between 2003/04 and 2004/05, and by 4.4 per cent. between 2004/05 and 2005/06.</p>
	<p pid="c.693W.3/3">The particularly large increase in 2003&ndash;04 is a result of the consolidation of previously targeted funds, and the extra investment through Success for All. All colleges received increases in core funding rates of 2.5 per cent. above inflation in 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06, with some colleges receiving even higher increases. The relatively lower increase in 2005&ndash;06 is still significantly higher than inflation and in part reflects actual learner numbers in colleges as compared to plans, and the Government's intention&mdash;as set out in the Skills Strategy and reaffirmed in the Skills White Paper: Getting on in Business, Getting on in Work&quot;&mdash;to rebalance over time the contributions of the state, employers and individuals towards the costs of learning. This was reflected in a 2.5 percentage point increase in the assumed fee contribution to the cost of learning for those learners not in national entitlement groups. Even so, this resulted in seven out of 10 colleges receiving an above inflation increase in budget&mdash;almost half of them getting an increase of over 5 per cent.</p>

If entering higher education in 2005&ndash;06, they could be eligible during the first four years of the course for tuition fee support, the Higher Education Grant, a student maintenance loan and any more specialised grant like the child care grant (which in fact is mainly received by mature students). Currently the only restrictions on funding for eligible students are on tuition fees if a student has previous study and on the maintenance loan if a student is aged over 55 (or 50 if not going into work subsequently). From 2006&ndash;07 there will be no age limit applied to the fee loan and the age limit on maintenance loans will be increased to age 60. The Department of Health pay tuition fees and provide bursaries in the fifth and any subsequent year of the course.</p>

There has been no consultation about the appropriateness of jury trial in the generality of cases, since no further reform is contemplated.</p>

This team will work closely with other Government Departments, the private sector and voluntary sector on a number of activities between now and March 2006, at which point the dedicated implementation body will be launched.</p>

	<p pid="c.707W.5/1">The Government give high priority to tackling sexual offending because of the nature and extent of the harm caused to victims.</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.5/2">We have improved the care available to victims by extending and developing the network of sexual assault referral centres and supporting complementary community-based services for the victims of sexual crime, allocating &pound;4 million from the victims fund over 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06 for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.5/3">Building on what is known to be effective in meeting the needs of victims of sexual violence, the Department of Health and the Home Office are working together on a programme aimed at equipping health care services and professionals to identify and respond more effectively to victims of sexual and domestic violence and abuse by mapping existing services and developing national service guidelines.</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.5/4">We are committed to bringing more sexual offenders to justice. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 redefined and increased the penalties for many sexual offences and clarified the law on consent. We are encouraging more victims to report sexual crime and specially trained police officers and prosecutors have been established to deal with rape cases. At court, we have introduced a range of measures to facilitate the giving of evidence by victims.</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.5/5">The Government are particularly determined to ensure abuse of children is tackled rigorously and works with the police and other agencies, including those working in the internet industry, to develop policies and practice to minimise the risk of children being sexually abused. We are also establishing a new centre which will target paedophiles using the internet to distribute illegal images of children and to groom them.</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.5/6">Following the Bichard enquiry, wide-ranging action has been implemented, including developing consistent standards and working practices between police services, requiring much more effective joined-up working between different agencies and establishing training for head teachers and governors to help them screen out people applying for jobs working with children who may pose a risk.</p>
	<p pid="c.707W.5/7">We have developed the way that the police, probation service and others work together to ensure that decisions about managing known sex offenders are based on the best information available. In addition, there are also tighter requirements for known sex offenders to notify their whereabouts to the police and any plans they have to travel abroad. Based on evidence about what really works in reducing offending, intensive programmes are being run both in prison and the community (for sex offenders).</p>

	<p pid="c.718W.0/2">This will clearly distinguish adult gaming centres, which children will be prohibited from entering, from other premises like seaside arcades (termed family entertainment centres in the Act) which children will be permitted to enter.

A Regulatory Impact Assessment of the Gambling Act was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-21">21 April 2005</phrase>. It concluded that the gaming machine reforms in the Act would increase competition between adult gaming centres and other venues offering machine gambling, including casinos, bingo halls, licensed betting offices and members' clubs.</p>
	<p pid="c.718W.0/4">Arcades are not subject to any control on numbers or a needs test under the existing legislation.

	<p pid="c.722W.9/1">No. Cricket test matches played in England are on the list of events which must be offered to the main free-to-air broadcasters, but only for secondary coverage such as highlights.</p>
	<p pid="c.722W.9/2">The decision to end protection of full live coverage was made in 1998 in the light of the recommendations of the independent review undertaken by the advisory group chaired by Lord Gordon of Strathblane.</p>
	<p pid="c.722W.9/3">Income from broadcasting forms 80 per cent. of cricket's income and the increased income since 1998 has allowed the ECB to invest substantial amounts in programmes for grass roots cricket and central contracts for England players, which have helped to contribute to the current success of the England team.</p>
	<p pid="c.722W.9/4">However, this time round, if the ECB had been prevented from considering bids from subscription broadcasters, competition for the rights would have been very limited and the ECB have told me that this would have led to a loss in income of around &pound;80 million, which would have been disastrous for the game.</p>
	<p pid="c.722W.9/5">The Secretary of State has made it clear that the Government will need to review the list of protected events as digital television take-up increases and viewers have a wider range of options for watching sport. This will provide the opportunity to re-consider the listing of live test cricket. However, this will not affect the 2006&ndash;09 contract.</p>

Of that figure, &pound;341,000 was spent on the development of computer systems to handle RDCO data, but more detailed costs for the implementation and administration of the scheme are not available, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Forecast costs for future years are not available</p>

HMRC also meets the legitimate trade to share intelligence on the oils market, including the effects of the RDCO scheme. As part of the wider oils strategy, the RDCO scheme has contributed significantly to the reduction in the UK market share held by illicit oils from 8 per cent. in 2000 to around 6 per cent. in 2003.</p>

	<p pid="c.728W.8/1">Following concerns from the Law Society that a percentage of land transaction returns were rejected because of scanning errors, HMRC agreed to carry out in-depth research into the issue of forms SDLT8 (requests for further information relating to incomplete or incorrectly completed returns). This suggested that in approximately 5 per cent. of cases received, one or more fields were either not captured or were misinterpreted during the scanning process. This figure includes returns where the handwriting results in information being captured incorrectly.</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.8/2">As a result of this review, HMRC identified a number of modifications which would quickly reduce the percentage of cases in which there is a scanning error. All of the recommendations from the report have now been implemented. As a result of these changes we estimate that about 1 per cent. of cases will now have SDLT8s issued because of scanning issues. HMRC are continuing to work with the Law Society and other stakeholders in order to further reduce these incidents.</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.8/3">Virtually all of these exceptions arise because of handwriting quality. The report can be found on HMRC's website at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/so/sdlt8.htm">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/so/sdlt8.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.728W.8/4">Since <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-26">26 August 2005</phrase>, it has been possible to file SDLT returns on-line directly into the SDLT automated system. Using this service removes the need to use post, and (because of the in-built checks) has a very high probability of returns being correct first time. If complete information is supplied, on-line filing produces an instant acknowledgement that the return has been accepted. HMRC is working with representative bodies to encourage the use of the service.</p>

Mail screening has not been performed internally since 1996 and therefore no comparable figures are available. Rather than specify turn around time, the screening contract requires a percentage of the mail to be available on each of the three daily deliveries in conjunction with the mail services contract. The target of making between 60 per cent. and 80 per cent. of mail available for the first internal delivery at 8am is by and large being met despite teething problems.</p>

	<p pid="c.733W.10/2">The G8 agreed that additional resources will be focused on low income countries that are committed to growth and poverty reduction, to democratic, accountable and transparent government and to sound financial management. Where this is the case, it should be up to the country concerned to decide how best to use the resources to accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which are focused on reducing poverty, improving people's access to education, health, water and sanitation.</p>
	<p pid="c.733W.10/3">In March 2005, the Department for International Development published a policy paper explaining our approach in more detail, 'Partnerships for Poverty Reduction: Rethinking Conditionally'. This states that an effective aid partnership should be based on a shared commitment to: reducing poverty and achieving the MDGs; respecting human rights and other international obligations; and strengthening financial management and accountability, to reduce the risk of funds being misused through weak administration or corruption. We will consider reducing or interrupting aid if partner governments deviate significantly from any of the three objectives. However we will try to strengthen countries' leadership of their own development by not making our aid conditional on specific policy decisions by partner governments. Our assessment of progress will be based on mutually agreed benchmarks, drawn wherever possible from national plans. The assessment will focus on overall impact, rather than specific policies.</p>

Human rights violations have been highlighted by successive highly critical UK co-sponsored UN Resolutions on Burma, most recently at the UN Commission on Human Rights in April.

These guidelines provide an objective, risk-based framework for assessing the need for crossing patrols, taking into account factors such as the volume of traffic, road width, availability of footpaths and provision of other crossing aids such as footbridges or pelican crossings. Where the guidelines demonstrate particular hazards or risks, crossing patrols are normally provided.</p>

	<p pid="c.754W.5/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland three Parliamentary Questions: how many 20 mph residential zones are planned in Northern Ireland, and what the locations are of the planned zones; how many 20 mph residential zones there are in Northern Ireland, and if he will list the location of all current 20 mph residential zones within Northern Ireland&quot;. I have been asked to reply as these issues fall within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.5/4" class="indent">By way of information, I should explain that 20-mph zones are a form of traffic calming and are generally implemented in residential areas where an extensive network of streets is involved and self-enforcing measures can be provided to reduce vehicle speeds to approximately 20-mph. Whenever speeds have been reduced to this, it is then possible to introduce a mandatory 20-mph limit. If the level of traffic calming measures are insufficient to reduce speeds to around 20-mph, then it is not possible to introduce a 20-mph mandatory limit.</p>
	<p pid="c.754W.5/5" class="indent">Roads Service has implemented thirty-seven 20 mph residential zones in the following locations:</p>

	<p pid="c.761W.6/1">The decision to produce the handbook was based on various sources of feedback from MPs and their researchers. This included surveys conducted by NFP Synergy on the attitude of MPs towards various non-departmental public bodies. The research indicated that MPs wished to have more contact with HSE, and that health and safety issues were a common theme in constituency correspondence that they deal with. As a result, the handbook was produced to provide an easy source of reference for answers to a typical range of questions about health and safety, and to provide helpful contact details for more information. The total cost of producing the handbook (including HSE staff time) was &pound;12,000. A number of MPs have thanked HSE for the handbook.</p>

	<p pid="c.763W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning his policy on nursery and childcare support for employees of Jobcentre Plus. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.763W.2/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus currently provides nursery and childcare support in some locations where doing so has helped us address historical difficulties with staff recruitment or retention. The individual business cases behind these arrangements are kept under review.</p>
	<p pid="c.763W.2/5" class="indent">In 2006, we will offer a 'salary sacrifice' scheme to all our employees. The salary sacrifice scheme is a Government initiative whereby the employee 'sacrifices' an amount of their salary (to a maximum of &pound;50 per week) which is converted into childcare vouchers for them to use. National insurance contributions and tax are not deducted from the sacrificed amount, allowing the individual to benefit from the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.763W.2/6" class="indent">More widely, Jobcentre Plus, as part of the Department for Work and Pensions, has policies which support flexible working and which enable our employees to balance their working lives with their caring responsibilities at home. These policies are well used&mdash;31 % of our staff work on a part time basis, and the majority of them make use of flexible working hours. We also offer the facility for people to work during term time only, and will consider accommodating any flexible working pattern, providing that, in so doing, we are able to meet our responsibility to deliver our services to customers.</p>
	<p pid="c.763W.2/7" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="c.777W.2/1">A range of initiatives are in place to improve the recruitment and retention of midwives working in the national health service in England. These include improving pay and conditions, encouraging the NHS to become a better, more flexible and diverse employer, help with accessing child care, increasing training, attracting back returners and running national and local recruitment campaigns. As a result of these initiatives, there are over 2,400 more midwives working in the NHS in England than in 1997.</p>

	<p pid="c.783W.0/1">As vasa praevia is a very rare condition and technically difficult to detect, even for a highly skilled ultrasonographer with the appropriate specialist equipment (a colour Doppler scanner), routine screening of all pregnant women for vasa praevia is not currently advocated by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Neither the national screening committee nor the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) have made any assessments into screening for this condition.</p>
	<p pid="c.783W.0/2">The Department has not undertaken any research into the early diagnosis of vasa praevia.</p>
	<p pid="c.783W.0/3">I currently have no plans to meet the Burton Hospital Trust to discuss their procedures for the diagnosis of vasa praevia in pregnant women. This is an issue for the trust, which should be informed by best medical practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.783W.0/4">The Department has not had any discussions with NICE with regard to the diagnosis of vasa praevia in pregnant women. We have no plans to refer the topic of vasa praevia to NICE at this time.</p>

A switch of generation of this size would be equivalent to an increase in CO <sub>2</sub> emissions of 0.2MtC, or approximately 0.1 per cent. of current annual UK emissions.</p>

We are in the final stages of agreeing terms of reference and appointing an appropriate person to lead the study and hope it will be under way shortly.

Its most recent assessment of gas import needs for the whole economy is that by 2010 around a third of annual UK demand is likely to be met by imported gas. A variety of potential sources of supply are expected to be available by 2010&mdash;including pipelines from Norway, Belgium, The Netherlands and facilities to receive cargoes of liquefied natural gas which could originate from several producing countries&mdash;but the ultimate sources of that gas will be for the market to determine.</p>

	<p pid="c.793W.2/1">The Government take the recent increases in energy prices very seriously, and particularly their impact on the competitiveness of UK industry. In January this year my Department set up the Gas Prices Working Group with the Energy Intensive Users' Group and Ofgem, with the remit of examining the workings of the gas market and developing ideas for improving its operation. The group has now agreed a list of action points for the short to medium term, such as maximising gas supplies, encouraging demand side response and pursuing energy market liberalisation in the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.793W.2/2">Gas is a substantial component of the UK fuel mix in electricity generation, so the movement in the gas price is probably the largest factor behind electricity price increases. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is also having an impact on electricity prices. We recognise that some business stakeholders have argued for greater simplicity and streamlining of instruments aimed at the business sector in the wake of the EU ETS. This will be an important consideration in the Government's deliberations during the current review of the climate change programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.797W.2/1">Such cost figures are not collated centrally. Responsibility for security measures, and for meeting their costs, rests with the operators. Responsibility for ensuring that nuclear operators provide adequate and robust security is regulated by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security. The costs of this regulation, borne by the industry, can be found in the Director of Civil Nuclear Security's recently published fourth annual report, which is available in the Libraries of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.797W.2/2">The ownership and management arrangements for civil nuclear reactors, as well as the number in operation, have changed significantly since 1975. The arrangements and the organisations involved in assuring and monitoring civil nuclear security have also changed. Importantly, the threat, especially from terrorism, has changed. Security measures and procedures have had to adapt to meet the changing situation.</p>

	<p pid="c.798W.8/2">The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) assumed responsibility for the decommissioning and clean up of the UK's civil nuclear legacy on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> and has responsibility for nuclear sites (20 in all) previously operated by UKAEA and BNFL. The NDA's funding is about &pound;2.2 billion per annum: half of this is from Her Majesty's Treasury and half commercial income derived from continued plant operations (Magnox nuclear power stations, fuel production and nuclear fuel reprocessing at Sellafield). The NDA will ensure transparency in its accounts for 2005&ndash;06 in respect of nuclear clean up, and commercial activities. Information relating to British Energy and British Nuclear Fuels plc is set out in their respective accounts which follow UK GAAP disciplines.</p>

The relative costs of generation from different technologies depends on factors such as discount rates, plant capital and operating costs, fossil fuel prices, carbon prices and decommissioning and waste management costs. The assumptions made for these costs in respect of each technology mean that there is no single number for generation costs for any technology as they are influenced by a range of factors.</p>

	<p pid="c.807W.2/1">Low frequency noise is generally regarded to mean noise in the range of 10 to 200 hertz (HZ). There is no British Standard for measuring low frequency noise and most European countries tend to have their own criterion.</p>
	<p pid="c.807W.2/2">The current accepted assessment methodology for low frequency noise is ETSU-R-97. It is used by planners for guidance and incorporates a robust refinement of the BS4142 (which is a general noise assessment methodology) appropriate to wind farm noise assessment. ETSU-R-97 provides indicative noise levels thought to offer a reasonable degree of protection to wind farm neighbours, without placing unreasonable restrictions on wind farm developers.</p>

	<p pid="c.808W.6/1">The cost to developers of section 106 agreements may vary significantly depending on the type and size of development, its location and local planning policies. The most recent assessment of the value of planning obligations across England was undertaken by Sheffield University in 1999. The study indicated that the average contribution through a planning obligation for a development in the North was &pound;148,000 and in the South was &pound;754,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.808W.6/2">Sheffield University and Halcrow Group are currently carrying out research for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister into the value of planning obligations in England. The study is due to report at the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="c.808W.6/3">No information is held by Government on the overall administrative costs of complying with planning obligations per year. Some information on costs to local authorities is collected as part of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy's annual survey of all local planning authorities, but the coverage of responses is too small to be representative.</p>

	<p pid="c.811W.8/1">Each local authority has discretionary powers to offer membership of the Local Government Pension Scheme to those councillors who have been recommended by the authority's Independent Remuneration Panel. The estimated cost to the taxpayer is a matter for individual authorities and would depend on the take-up of membership it had endorsed. Consequently, no information is held centrally on costs or membership of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.811W.8/2">The guidance which currently applies to allowances and salaries was issued by the Government in 2003, as 'Guidance on Regulation for Local Authority Allowances'. The guidance accompanies the Local Authorities (Members' Allowances) (England) Regulations 2003. The Government have issued no guidance on pensions for councillors.</p>

It must, again, take into account the interests of the community and the effect the order will have on the rights of the relevant proprietor or on third parties.

	<p pid="c.815W.0/1">On current plans the south-east control centre will be operational in 2008&ndash;09. The new centre will form part of a fully resilient national network. The site will be secure. The selection of the site was the result of a procurement process carried out under EU procurement regulations and the availability of suitable labour formed part of the criteria. An assessment was made before going out to tender as to whether there would be a choice of suitable sites, and sites with existing premises were not ruled out of consideration. The decision on the Fareham site was taken by a qualified panel of specialists, and the chair of the SE Regional Management Board was fully briefed on the entire process. Support of particular Fire and Rescue Authorities in the region was not a selection criterion. A new building will be required and an artist's impression of it is on the website: <a href="http://www.firecontrol.odpm.gov.uk/">http://www.firecontrol.odpm.gov.uk/</a></p>
	<p pid="c.815W.0/2">The up front cost of the development will be borne by the private developer and is commercially confidential. The building will be leased and over a 25 year period the net present value of the contract is &pound;22,148,695.</p>

	<p pid="c.816W.5/2">Officials in ODPM provide ongoing advice and support to all local housing authorities, including Birmingham city council, in their work to prevent homelessness. The practice that we encourage all of them to follow is to tackle homelessness at the earliest opportunity, by enabling people to continue to live in their current accommodation where possible or helping them to obtain suitable alternative accommodation. It is not good practice to simply advise people to remain in their accommodation until their landlord obtains a court order for possession and the bailiffs arrive, and we advise against that.</p>

However, officials from ODPM'S homelessness and housing support directorate are due to meet senior officers from Birmingham city council shortly to discuss the policies being pursued by the housing authority and provide further guidance if needed.</p>

The UK supports the principle of such an objective. This proposal, along with other matters covered in proposed new Structural Fund Regulations, is under discussion in the European Council. It is the UK's intention to make as much progress as possible with these discussions during its Presidency. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is working closely with other interested Departments and the Devolved Administrations in supporting the UK's position in these discussions.</p>

	<p pid="c.819W.14/1">Planning guidance on residential parking spaces is contained in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: Housing&quot; (PPG3), published in March 2000. PPG3 advises local authorities that car parking standards that result, on average, in development with more than 1.5 off-street car parking spaces per dwelling are unlikely to reflect the Government's emphasis on securing sustainable residential environments. This does not mean we expect all dwellings in all developments to have 1.5 parking spaces. But we do expect local authorities to anticipate the pattern of parking needs in their area and draw up policies for car parking provision that will deliver the approach set out in PPG3.</p>
	<p pid="c.819W.14/2">Planning Policy Guidance Note 13: Transport&quot; (PPG 13) was published in March 2001. PPG13 notes that reducing the amount of parking in new development (and in the expansion and change of use in existing development) is essential, as part of a package of planning and transport measures, to promote sustainable travel choices. Annex D of PPG13 sets out national maximum parking standards for a range of major developments. Local authorities may adopt more rigorous standards subject to the advice in PPG13.</p>
	<p pid="c.819W.14/3">The Government does not regulate the level of parking charges. The Secretary of State for Transport does, however, give guidance to local authorities outside London with Decriminalised Parking Enforcement powers on the setting of parking charges.

They must take account of the views of local people on planning matters before taking decisions and elected members must justify their decisions subsequently to their electorate.

	<p pid="c.823W.5/1">This information is not available centrally. On the basis of returns completed by local authorities before the start of the current financial year, an estimated &pound;390 million is expected to be claimed in small business rate relief for 2005&ndash;06 (the first year in which the scheme has been operating). Applications for small business rate relief may be made up to six months after the end of the financial year to which the application relates, or six months from notification of an alteration to a rateable value that makes the hereditament eligible for relief.</p>

It is the businesses themselves who decide on the amount of and the arrangements for paying the levy and who vote in a ballot on whether or not a proposed scheme should go ahead. However, many BID proposals exclude smaller properties from the BID levy or offer special terms for small properties.</p>
