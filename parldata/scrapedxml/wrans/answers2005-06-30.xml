However, it is not always possible to confirm infection in any particular animal by post-mortem examination at the slaughterhouse, or by culturing <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> in the laboratory. This is because in the early stages of the disease, it is not always possible to see lesions with the naked eye, and, due to the fastidious nature of the organism, it is not possible to culture from samples in every case.</p>

Member should be aware that there is ongoing litigation between the current owners and occupiers Mrs. Georgina Hawkins and Mr. Kevin Feakins and the Rural Payments Agency and Defra in connection with (1) sums owed by Mr. Feakins to the RPA in respect of the sheep meat clawback scheme; and (2) Defra's activities on the farm during the 2001 foot and mouth disease outbreak.</p>
	<p pid=".1643W.2/3">My officials are fully aware of the concerns of local residents and they have been in correspondence with the Llancloudy Residents Association over the proposals for the removal of farmyard manure and other seized materials from Hill Farm Llancloudy. The current situation is that Defra has agreed to remove these seized materials and to reinstate the land. However, in order to fulfil this undertaking the Department needs to agree a licence with Mr. Feakins and Mrs. Hawkins, as the owners and occupiers of the land, in order to gain access to the land. This licence will also include detailed method statements for the operations required. Defra's preferred access route is along the main farm access drive, a route which would minimise the impact on the majority of Llancloudy residents&mdash;this route has not been agreed by Mr. Feakins and Mrs. Hawkins.</p>
	<p pid=".1643W.2/4">Given the failure to agree access routes, my officials do not believe that an on-site meeting would be helpful, since until the exact access route is agreed, contractors cannot prepare the detailed working protocols and risk assessments that will be required and officials would not be able to address the concerns of residents. However given the understandable concerns of residents, my officials would be pleased to meet with the hon. Member in London, together with a representative of the Llancloudy Residents Association in London to explain the current situation and to outline the steps the Department has taken to agree access and will take to ensure that the impact on residents will be minimised.</p>

	<p pid=".1644W.3/1">The most recent estimate of the Norway rat population in England was a minimum of 5,240,000 individuals. This figure was established by a review that assessed the population and conservation status of all British mammals, published in 1995. The only recent objective national survey of rat presence is within the English House Condition Survey (EHCS). The 1996 survey revealed that 0.23 per cent. of properties had rats indoors and 1.6 per cent. had rats present outside. A report on the rodent element of the 2001 EHCS will be published this summer.</p>

In 2004&ndash;05 expenditure was &pound;265 million and 4,015 key workers benefited from the scheme. &pound;374 million has been allocated for 2005&ndash;06 which has so far helped another 930 key workers since April 2005 and &pound;86 million is allocated for 2006&ndash;07. The KWL target is to help 16,348 key workers by March 7. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently awaiting recommendations from regional housing boards on future funding levels for key workers.</p>

	<p pid=".1656W.3/1">The criteria that the sports councils use to decide whether an activity should be recognised as a sport are derived from their Royal Charters, and ultimately from the Physical Training and Recreation Act 1937. Legal advice has stated that chess does not fall within the meaning of the word &quot;sport&quot; for the purposes of the Royal Charter, or the meaning of &quot;physical training and recreation&quot; in the Act. Recognition of chess would therefore require amendments to the Act.</p>
	<p pid=".1656W.3/2">Sport is now a devolved matter, so a change in the current position would require the unanimous support of both the Devolved Administrations (DAs) and the sports councils, before any progress could be made. It would be necessary to put a case to the DAs and the sports councils for legislative change that would include chess, and if necessary other &quot;mind games&quot;, within the criteria for recognition as a sport. The case put forward must be able to convince them that chess provides the same benefits to the public, such as improved health and fitness, as recognised sports, in order to merit equal status and the financial support that comes with it.</p>

To provide some context for that figure, at the end of May 2005 Jobcentre Plus employed 72,888 FTE staff.</p>
	<p pid=".1663W.5/6" class="indent">There have been several representations to the Secretary of State on this subject. In addition, we are consulting closely with our recognised trade unions on the steps we are taking to meet our efficiency challenge.

	<p pid=".1668W.12/1">The way in which education and training are delivered in prisons, and the content of the learning offered, are changing. From August 2005, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) will in three regions (the North West, North East and South West) take responsibility for delivering an integrated learning and skills service for offenders both in custody and the community, linking it much more explicitly with mainstream provision for post-16 learners. A greater focus on skills will lead to greater employability on release, thereby making a significant contribution to reducing re-offending. The remaining six regions in England will follow in August 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.12/2">The new service has at its heart the principle that education and training for offenders should be more flexible and learner centred. Literacy, language and numeracy will rightly continue to be a high priority for offender learning, but the new service will for the first time bring together the Education Service with vocational training, in the context of a broader curriculum. The key change in the new arrangements is early, intense focus on assessing the offender learner's needs and preparing an individual learning plan that will set out learning needs&mdash;and achievements&mdash;as the individual moves through the criminal justice system, creating a seamless learning journey for offenders across prisons and probation and up to release.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.12/3">The key features of the new learning and skills service are outlined in a document called the &quot;Offender's Learning Journey&quot;, available at <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/offenderlearning">www.dfes.gov.uk/offenderlearning</a> (you have to select the initiatives hyperlink to view the new delivery section.) The &quot;Offender's Learning Journey&quot; specifies the content of the learning and skills service to be supported by the LSC from August 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".1669W.5/1">The Government considers the Home Detention Curfew Scheme (HDC) is working well and has no proposals for change.</p>
	<p pid=".1669W.5/2">The HDC scheme enables prisoners, primarily those serving sentences of between three months and under four years, to return to the community up to 135 days earlier than their normal release date (half-way point of the sentence). Prisoners must have a suitable address and pass a risk assessment before release can be granted. If considered suitable, prisoners are released under licence and are subject to an electronically monitored curfew, normally for 12 hours a day, at an address within England and Wales. If they breach the licence conditions they are liable to be returned to prison to serve the remaining custodial portion of their sentence in custody.</p>
	<p pid=".1669W.5/3">Certain categories of prisoners are statutorily excluded from HDC, including prisoners subject to the registration requirements of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and prisoners serving extended sentences. In addition, prisoners with any history of sexual offending or serving sentences for certain serious offences are presumed unsuitable for release on HDC unless there are exceptional reasons to grant release.</p>

A limited number of aid programmes are managed from the UK, while the majority are managed from offices in the country concerned. DFID Country Offices may be co-located with a British Embassy or High Commission, or may operate from stand-alone premises, depending on local circumstances. Were an Embassy to close in a country where we are already operating, we would review management arrangements. However, our aid programmes are not contingent on the presence of a British Embassy. Examples of countries where DFID operates successfully, but where there is no British Embassy, are Nicaragua and Kyrgyzstan.</p>

They are therefore eligible for the debt relief being provided to HIPC countries that have demonstrated their commitment to poverty reduction. Bolivia, Guyana, Honduras and Nicaragua have all successfully completed the HIPC process. As part of this, their progress in reducing poverty and implementing economic reforms was discussed a number of times at the World Bank and other financial institutions. The Lao PDR is not opting for debt relief at present, so no such discussions have taken place.</p>

Bolivia, Guyana, Honduras and Nicaragua are among 18 countries that would qualify for this assistance immediately. The proposal will be discussed at the World Bank and the IMF Annual Meetings.</p>

	<p pid=".1678W.5/1">The Everything but Arms initiative (EBA) is the EU scheme to give all least developed countries duty and quota free access to the EU market for all products, except armaments. The scheme was introduced in February 2001. Three products, however, were deemed sensitive enough for the EU not to open its borders to them immediately. Full, unrestricted market access for these products&mdash;sugar, rice and bananas&mdash;is being phased in gradually and will be completed in 2009.</p>
	<p pid=".1678W.5/2">There have been several assessments of the effects of the scheme, including by the World Bank who concluded that the impact of EBA has been relatively limited, partly because the vast majority (some 99 per cent.) of EU imports from the LDCs are in products that the EU had already liberalised, and the complete removal of barriers to the key remaining products, rice, sugar and bananas has been delayed. There is a group of the LDCs for whom EU trade preferences on existing exports are not significant since these exports are mainly of products where the normal rate of duty is already zero. Export diversification is the key issue for these countries. For other LDCs, EU preferences have the potential to provide a more substantial impact on trade.</p>
	<p pid=".1678W.5/3">However, the World Bank assessment shows that only 50 per cent. of EU imports from those eligible LDCs, who are not from the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) grouping, actually request preferential access to the EU. The prime reason for this low level of utilisation would appear to be the rules of origin&mdash;how or where a product can be produced in order to qualify for a preference. This is because in many cases, the criteria are set so that in practice an LDC must produce a product entirely within its borders, including any inputs or components, in order to qualify for preferential treatment. This requirement is beyond the production capacity of most LDCs, and indeed does not reflect modern business and production patterns, where components or other inputs such as yarn or fabric are imported from the most competitive sources wherever they may be. The World Bank, and indeed many others, recommends more simple and liberal rules of origin to enhance the impact of EU trade preferences both in terms of improving market access and in stimulating diversification towards a broader range of exports. We have already seen this effect in certain African exports to the US, and some Asian exports to Canada.</p>
	<p pid=".1678W.5/4">The EU is currently reviewing its Rules of Origin, with a view to changing them. Building on the evidence available, the UK will be pressing to ensure that the changes better reflect current business practices and support, rather than hinder, the operation of preference schemes and the economic development these schemes are intended to stimulate.</p>

	<p pid=".1679W.2/2">The most recent assessment of progress towards all the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)s) is a United Nations report published in June 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1679W.2/3">The picture of girl's access to education is not uniform across Africa. As reported in the United Nations Millennium Development Goal Report (2005), Sub-Saharan Africa has made limited progress towards increasing girl's access to education. The most recently available figures from 2001 indicate that 86 girls per 100 boys are enrolled at primary school and 79 girls per hundred boys are enrolled in secondary school. The UN's 2004 chart shows that this region is not on track to meet the equal girls enrolment in primary and secondary school MDG targets by 2015 without dramatically scaled up efforts. However the picture is quite different in Northern Africa, with 93 and 96 girls per 100 boys enrolled in primary and secondary schools respectively and the region on track to meet both these MDG targets.</p>
	<p pid=".1679W.2/4">DFID puts a high priority on expanding primary school enrolment and promoting girls education in Africa.</p>

	<p pid=".1679W.5/1">DFID's recent assessments are that official user fees contribute minimal amounts to the financing of public services. Additionally, official user fees are a significant barrier to poor people's access to basic health services. In the poorest countries, there has been little success implementing fee exemptions and waivers targeted to poor people. Evidence from Uganda and elsewhere suggests that removing official fees boosts access to services. Therefore, DFID strongly supports the removal of official user fees for basic health care.</p>
	<p pid=".1679W.5/2">Other fees and charges such as those for medicines, for transport to clinics, and informal or private charges for service, can be more significant in scale, both as a barrier to access and in terms of the revenue they generate. DFID supports the removal of other fees and charges, and helps countries to identify alternative sources of finance for basic health care.</p>
	<p pid=".1679W.5/3">The G8 summit will discuss financing of health care as part of the Africa agenda. To make improved access to services a reality, we are encouraging the removal of user fees and we are seeking significantly increased resources for health. At Gleneagles we are calling for an extra $50 billion a year in development assistance. DFID has regular policy discussions with the World Bank at both Headquarters and country level. This includes discussions on options for financing of health services&mdash;the World Bank does not have a blanket policy on user fees. We will continue to work with the World Bank, and other partners such as the World Health Organisation, in supporting countries to make progress towards universal access to basic health services.</p>

	<p pid=".1680W.2/2">The financing arrangements of the World Bank Group, Asian Development Bank (AsDB), African Development Bank (AfDB) and Inter-American Development Bank (IaDB) are broadly similar in structure. Capital subscriptions were paid in when the UK joined these institutions, and further amounts are held by the UK, and other shareholders, as &quot;callable&quot; capital&mdash;that is money which the bank can draw upon if necessary. There have been no demands by these institutions on the UK's callable capital in the last five years.</p>
	<p pid=".1680W.2/3">These institutions make loans on different terms. Loans at or near market rates are provided to better-off countries, and are self-financing. In addition, each of these institutions has a concessional lending arm that provides low interest, long-term loans and grants to poorer countries. The funding for these concessional resources is supplemented&mdash;replenished&mdash;by donor governments on roughly three-year cycles. The following table shows the amounts committed by the UK to the replenishments over the last five years. There have been no replenishments for the Inter-American Development Bank during this time.</p>

	<p pid=".1680W.2/20">The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was established in 1991. The UK share of the bank's capital is 8.5 per cent., which is around &euro;1.7 billion. Of this, &euro;446 million is paid-in capital, and the Government are making annual instalments of around &pound;16 million to fulfil this commitment; the total amount will have been paid by 2009. EBRD does not make concessional loans.</p>
	<p pid=".1680W.2/21">After the enlargement of the European Union in 2004, the European Investment Bank's (EIB) capital was increased to &euro;164 billion. The UK has a share of 16.3 per cent., which is &euro;26.6 billion. Of this amount, only 5 per cent. is paid-in capital. In the last five years, there have been increases in the UK's share of the subscribed and paid-in capital but these have been fully paid from the European Investment Bank's Reserves. EIB lending is predominately non-concessional.</p>

Such financing includes country specific trust funds, for example for Afghanistan; funding for research and analysis; and resources for centrally-managed initiatives such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries' Trust Fund, which channels donor resources to assist multilateral organisations provide their share of debt relief to countries.</p>

	<p pid=".1682W.2/1">Latin America's progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been very uneven. Each country has made different degrees of progress towards different targets, and at widely varying speeds.</p>
	<p pid=".1682W.2/2">The region appears to be on track to meet its 2015 targets for education, access to water and sanitation, and reducing hunger. In particular, rapid progress has been made towards reducing the prevalence of underweight children, universalising net enrolment in primary schools, reducing child and infant mortality, and increasing the proportion of the population with access to improved water sources. Insufficient progress has been made, however, on getting all children to actually complete primary school, halting the spread of HIV, and reversing the loss of environmental resources. Mixed progress has been made on income poverty and hunger reduction, the coverage of improved sanitation, and the various indicators of gender equity. While the proportion of the region's population living in slums has fallen slightly, absolute numbers have actually increased. Because of data limitations, it is very difficult to assess progress on improving maternal health.</p>
	<p pid=".1682W.2/3">Even within countries, there tend to be marked differentials between ethnic groups and different geographic regions. Because Latin America has such high levels of inequality, it is important not to let national average figures obscure these pockets of poverty and social exclusion.</p>

The design of the programme has involved extensive dialogue with these Banks as well with non-governmental organisations and other partners.

In Nicaragua, DFID will be supporting greater access of poor people to markets in the eco-tourism sector in a way that is intended to influence both IDB municipal development projects as well as a World Bank competitiveness project in the country.</p>

The Code of Practice for International Recruitment of Healthcare Professionals (available at <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">http://www.dh.gov.uk</a>), prevents the NHS from actively recruiting healthcare professionals from low and middle-income countries unless there is a government-to-government agreement in place.

	<p pid=".1685W.5/1">Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals varies. The world is on track to meet the poverty reduction goal. The number of people in Asia living on less than $1 a day dropped by nearly a quarter of a billion between 1990 and 2001. However progress toward the other seven goals is more varied. Sub Saharan Africa in particular will not meet any of the goals by 2015 if current rates of progress continue. The Commission for Africa chaired by the Prime Minister has set out plans for faster progress including action by African governments, and stronger support by international partners. The UK has made Africa central to our presidency of the G8 this year. We are looking for the Gleneagles G8 summit next week, and the Millennium Review Summit in September, to further strengthen international support to Africa through aid, debt relief and trade.</p>
	<p pid=".1685W.5/2">The recently published United Nations Millennium Development Goals Report is a comprehensive account of progress to date on each of the goals, and how great an effort remains necessary to meet them. It can be found at <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mi/mi_dev_report.htm">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mi/mi_dev_report. htm</a>. DFID also published a report in January 2005 titled The UK's contributions to achieving the Millennium Development Goals'. A copy of the report is available in the House of Commons Library.</p>

	<p pid=".1690W.5/2">The legal basis for the operation of the No Fly Zones over Iraq was the need to avert an immediate and overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe threatened by the then Iraqi Government against the people living on the ground in those zones. This was combined with a need to monitor the effect of UNSCR 688 which demanded that Saddam Hussein cease the repression of his people. RAF aircraft attacked only targets which were an actual or imminent threat to coalition aircraft or were contributing to such a threat, namely air defence related assets. Thus, all the ordnance released was in response to an actual or imminent attack on coalition forces.</p>

	<p pid=".1691W.12/1">On 7 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-10">10 June 2005</phrase>, during the preliminary commissioning of the Primary Circuit Decontamination (PCD) facility, which will be used during the Long Overhaul Period (Refuel) of HMS Victorious at Devonport, two small leakages of water occurred. Some parts of the equipment had previously been used in the overhaul of another nuclear-powered submarine and, as a result, the water contained very low levels of radioactivity, barely above background levels. The water was contained within the dry dock and no radioactivity was released to the environment.</p>
	<p pid=".1691W.12/2">Nuclear safety remains of paramount importance and while these incidents were minor and did not present any hazard to the workforce or to the public, they could have been avoided. For this reason, the Environment Agency served an Enforcement Notice on the nuclear site licensee, Devonport Royal Dockyard Ltd. (who trade as Devonport Management Ltd.), which required the company to review and, where appropriate, improve the arrangements for controlling the release of radioactive waste to the environment. Accordingly, DRDL suspended PCD commissioning activities. These recommenced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-23">23 June 2005</phrase> once the recommendations from the review had been implemented. The PCD equipment is not due to be connected to HMS Victorious for some weeks and there should therefore be no long term impact on her programme.</p>

This may lead to the demolition of some older buildings and their replacement by expanded modern facilities that, wherever possible, will be more in keeping with the rural landscape.

This is essential if the LSC is to ensure that limited resources are used in the most cost effective manner. It is only possible to consider these criteria against detailed proposals. Such proposals have not, as yet been submitted by the college but LSC Lancashire has acknowledged the urgent need for a new building on a new site in Burnley as a priority.

	<p pid=".1697W.0/2">The Government targets additional resource to authorities where there are higher numbers of pupils living in deprived circumstances because these pupils are more likely to have additional educational needs, and they will require higher levels of funding if they are to have equality of opportunity. At national level, the formula for distributing funding for schools to local authorities comprises a basic entitlement for each pupil of the same age, which is the same across the country, plus top-ups reflecting the relative needs of each area, including a top-up for each pupil with additional educational needs. (The other top-ups are for higher area costs in some areas and sparsity in others). In addition, some specific grants such as Excellence in Cities have been directed towards deprived areas.</p>
	<p pid=".1697W.0/3">The funding that individual schools receive in their budget shares is a matter for local authorities through their local funding formulae. Each authority's local formula should direct resources according to the relative needs of the schools in the area and their pupils. Work on the joint HM Treasury/Department for Education and Skills review of the ways in which local education authorities fund schools for the effects of social deprivation started in the autumn of 2004. The collection of evidence from stakeholders and drafting of the report is largely complete and the review will be published when conclusions have been finalised. As stated in the Child Poverty Review document published in July 2004, those conclusions will need to recognise the priority of maintaining stability and predictability in school funding, while ensuring that funds are accurately targeted according to need.</p>
	<p pid=".1697W.0/4">The table sets out the spending figures for the least and most deprived authorities for 1997&ndash;98, 1998&ndash;99, 2002&ndash;03 and 2003&ndash;04. Figures for 2004&ndash;05 are not yet available. The figures reflect the Government's commitment to fund adequately pupils living in deprived circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".1697W.0/5">The figures given include those for 1998&ndash;99 because those figures are more comparable with later years. That is because spending in 1997&ndash;98 reflected the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme: these were returned to local government from 1998&ndash;99. Also, because of local government reorganisation some authorities included in the calculations have only existed in their current form since 1998&ndash;99.</p>

	<p pid=".1700W.2/1">Academies are independent schools and the composition of their governing bodies, therefore, are principally a matter for the governing bodies themselves. Governance is one of the areas in which we wish academies to innovate; the Department, therefore, prescribes the makeup of academy governing bodies as little as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".1700W.2/2">That said, we are keen, where appropriate, for there to be a wide and varied representation on all governing bodies, including representation from both teaching and non-teaching staff. The majority of academies, therefore, do have within their memorandum and articles of governance provision for the election or co-option of staff governors. The principals of academies also sit on the governing body.</p>

	<p pid=".1701W.0/1">The school funding formula distributes resources to authorities on the basis of where pupils are counted on the school roll. The 443 Worcestershire pupils who are attending Gloucestershire schools will therefore attract funding, on a per pupil basis, into Gloucestershire LEA's schools formula spending share (SPSS). Nevertheless, Worcestershire retains some residual responsibility for pupils who reside in their area&mdash;e.g in relation to SEN statementing&mdash;and therefore Worcestershire's LEA formula spending share (LEAFSS) includes an element of funding which is based on pupils' residence.</p>

	<p pid=".1710W.2/44">Revenue expenditure figures on the maintenance and improvement of schools are likely to vary from year to year depending on the unique circumstances of a particular LEA. For example, revenue expenditure will increase in years where there have been adverse weather conditions (e.g. repairing storm damage) and is also likely to vary with the number and age of the school buildings within the LEA. Revenue expenditure will also be affected by the amounts of capital allocated to each school.</p>

We are confident that the individual capital allocations given to local authorities are sufficient for them to achieve the children centres targets we have set for them in the period 2006&ndash;08. The funding has been formulated on the premise that children's centres will grow out of a range of existing provision such as Sure Start local programmes, neighbourhood nurseries and primary schools.</p>

	<p pid=".1731W.2/1">In September 2004, the Secretary of State announced that work would begin to look at the options for implementing a system of post-qualification application to higher education. Officials have been taking this work forward, consulting widely with interested parties and engaging with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Government, of course, respects the autonomy of the HE sector and is absolutely clear that admissions policies are entirely the responsibility of HE institutions. Later this year, we plan to conduct a formal public consultation exercise to seek views on possible reforms to applications procedures.</p>

	<p pid=".1731W.5/1">The independent review of admissions to higher education which was led by Professor Steven Schwartz acknowledged that assessing an applicant's potential for higher education (HE) study, or recognising ability which may not be reflected fully in Level 3 examination results, is a key issue for fair admissions. The steering group's report in September 2004 suggested that a test that is able to predict performance in HE may help to uncover hidden talent. It also acknowledged the potential burden for applicants of up to six sets of admissions requirements and means of assessment. The report therefore recommended a national research study to assess the idea of a national test of potential. We support this as an early task for a new centre of expertise on admissions which the steering group also recommended. The HE sector is discussing the formation of that centre. Whilst we do not believe in tests for tests sake, if there is a genuine need for a national test it would be right to explore the opportunity.</p>

Most recently, Quartet Principals, along with Quartet Special Envoy for Disengagement James Wolfensohn and US Security Co-ordinator General Ward, met in London on <phrase class="date" code="">23 June</phrase> to discuss these issues, prior to further discussion at the G8 Foreign Ministers Meeting.</p>

These are also subject to close discussion with and between the parties, assisted by Mr. Wolfensohn. Compensation for former Palestinian landowners has not been agreed at this stage.</p>

	<p pid=".1738W.9/1">Education and Library Boards' psychology services and behaviour support services offer advice to schools in relation to the management of pupils with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The type of support offered is dependent on the needs of the school or child but can range from advice on writing an individual behaviour plan to placement in a primary or post-primary guidance centre. Most pupils with ADHD have such extremely challenging behaviour that boards maintain statements of special educational need for them and provide funding for additional support to assist the school to meet the pupil's needs.</p>
	<p pid=".1738W.9/2">School staff can also receive advice and training in behaviour management strategies and through specific targeted interventions in the management of pupils with ADHD. These in-service courses are available in some board areas on a whole-school basis on request and through teacher or classroom assistant attendance at courses in teachers' centres.</p>
	<p pid=".1738W.9/3">In 2004, a working group of educational psychologists from across the five Education and Library Boards prepared two information booklets on ADHD which were published by DE&mdash;one a practical guide for parents and carers and the other a practical guide for schools.</p>
	<p pid=".1738W.9/4">The Department for Employment and Learning has put in place a range of initiatives and funding streams designed to assist FE college students with learning difficulties and/or disabilities including those suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. These include the publication of a good practice guide; support for staff development activities for senior management, and financial assistance towards the costs of technical or carer support for learners.</p>

	<p pid=".1739W.2/5" class="indent">You may be aware that, in January 2001, roads service and most district councils entered into a 15-year contract with bus shelter provider Adshel, for the provision of approximately 1500 bus shelters throughout the council areas. The provision and maintenance of these shelters are funded by Adshel through advertising revenue, and are therefore provided at no cost to the Department. The Department has no knowledge of the costs incurred by Adshel in carrying out their contractual commitments.</p>
	<p pid=".1739W.2/6" class="indent">District councils are still permitted to provide additional bus shelters at their own expense, however, Adshel have the sole advertising rights, and Translink is also permitted to erect bus shelters at their own expense under Permitted Development Rights.</p>

	<p pid=".1742W.5/1">As of September 2004, 15.6 per cent. of women of pensionable age were in receipt of a full basic state pension in their own right.

When looking at the position across the UK of people of working age now there is very little difference between the proportions of men and women accruing state pension rights.</p>
	<p pid=".1742W.5/2">Many of the Government's labour market policies such as the national minimum wage, tax credits and new deals have been particularly helpful in supporting women remaining in, or returning to, employment and enabling them to build up pension entitlement.</p>
	<p pid=".1742W.5/3">The Pensions Commission has been looking at specific issues regarding women, and the Government have also commissioned their own report on women and pensions to be published by the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid=".1742W.5/4">In addition to this the Social Security Agency has an active programme, which includes the provision of forecasts and retirement planners to ensure that future pensioners are better informed and educated about their entitlements to state pension. A further process is also in place to ensure that all pensioners with any entitlement to state pension are identified, encouraged and facilitated to take up that entitlement.</p>

	<p pid=".1746W.0/1">This question relates to a matter that is the responsibility of the judiciary. The Lord Chief Justice informs me that; seven Court of Appeal judges have attended the serious sexual offences course.</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.0/2">The serious sexual offences seminar is, however, specifically designed for judges who hear rape trials. It is currently a residential two-day (over three days) event and past programmes have included talks on the following:</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.0/3" class="indent">(1) Research into public attitudes to sexual offending and the views of complainants and victims on the way in which sexual offences proceedings are handled.</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.0/4" class="indent">(2) The policies and practices of the police and Crown Prosecution Service in handling serious sexual offences.</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.0/5" class="indent">(3) Issues of evidential and procedural law and practice which bear on the conduct of trials in such cases.</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.0/6" class="indent">(4) Sentencing issues and the assessment and treatment of sexual offenders in the community and in prison. Also included in the programme is a series of discussions, in small groups, of trial and sentencing issues.</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.0/7">I would remind the hon. Member for Redcar that the Court of Appeal only considers matters of law in relation to sexual offences. It does not hear trials in relation to sexual offences. Therefore, although some Court of Appeal judges have attended the serious sexual offences seminar the Lord Chief Justice in conjunction with the Judicial Studies Board has decided that it is not a compulsory element of their training.</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.0/8">Judges of every rank who sit in crime, including the Court of Appeal, have received training on the provisions of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 as part of a programme of training on the Criminal Justice Reforms that ran between January and March 2005. This was supplemented with written material provided at the time the Act came into force.</p>

	<p pid=".1753W.2/1">The Government aims to work in partnership with the public and private sectors to sustain clinical research for the benefit of patients and the public. In 2002, the pharmaceutical industry competitiveness task force concluded a partnership agreement setting out the ground rules for both contract clinical trials and the non-commercial research collaborations to which industry contributes.</p>
	<p pid=".1753W.2/2">In 2004, the research for patient benefit working party drew attention to the immense contribution of United Kingdom research in the field of biomedical sciences and to the benefit to the national health service, patients and the wider public of encouraging internationally competitive clinical research, sponsored by the industry, and carried out in the NHS. It also recommended action to reverse some damaging trends.</p>
	<p pid=".1753W.2/3">To improve the environment for clinical research, the UK clinical research collaboration was created in 2004. It is a partnership between Government, the voluntary sector, patients, research funders and industry. Its work streams include developing networks within the NHS that will provide a platform for industry-contracted and collaborative research alongside NHS research, in areas identified as being critical to establishing the UK as a world leader in clinical research.</p>

Where an older person has severe mental illness due to a psychotic illness such as schizophrenia, they will require the packages of care set out in the national service framework for mental health, and the same standards should apply as for working age adults. For these people care should be provided within the framework of the care programme approach.

	<p pid=".1761W.11/2">The Department's guidance on functionalised community teams, &quot;Mental Health Policy Implementation Guide (2001)&quot;, explains that such services are commonly for adults aged up to 65 years. This guidance specifies that for crisis resolution teams there should be flexibility in every locality to decide to treat those who fall outside this age group where appropriate. For assertive outreach teams, the same guidance states that the boundaries between different health care services should be flexible to respond to different needs. The &quot;Mental Health Policy Implementation Guide&quot; also makes clear that as long as there is evidence of benefit, assertive outreach can continue indefinitely. The &quot;Mental Health Policy Implementation Guide for Community Mental Health Teams (2002)&quot; requires age limits to be determined in line with locally agreed protocols for transitions from adolescent to adult and adult to older adult services.</p>

While the Department collects data on sickness absence, which includes stress, it is not possible to identify whether the cause of the stress related illness or anxiety was work related. It is not currently possible, therefore, to identify costs. However, the Department's recording systems are currently being developed in a way that will help identify which cases are potentially work-related at the time they are recorded.

	<p pid=".1771W.0/1">UK Trade and Investment provides information on potential agents in two main ways. First, off the shelf lists of companies may be available in the UK, although the details may not have been recently validated. Secondly, our Overseas Market Introduction Service (OMIS) provides bespoke lists that can be validated at the request of the customer. Advice on the best ways of doing business in the market concerned is also included. It is for customers themselves to determine the best agent in the light of their individual needs and circumstances.</p>

	<p pid=".1771W.3/1">Consumers can register with the Mailing Preference Service to have their name and home address removed from lists used by the direct mail industry. On credit cards themselves, the Banking Code provides that customers' names and addresses will not be passed on to any company for marketing purposes unless permission is specifically given by that customer. In addition, since <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-31">31 May 2005</phrase>, all credit card applications must have a separate document detailing the key features of the card. This will enable the consumer to make a more informed decision about the suitability of the product prior to the conclusion of any agreement.</p>
