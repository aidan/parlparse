	<p pid="c.373W.6/1">Payments are determined by the entitlements held by a customer which were based on the land area established and claimed in 2005. Therefore any increase in the size of a field would not change the expenditure unless the customer had sufficient entitlements to activate any claim on the increased area. During 2005 and 2006 the Rural Land Register was subject to a process of validation which in some cases resulted in field sizes changing. Where this impacted on individual claims, a process of reworking is under way, designed, where appropriate, to correct the land area and the number of entitlements established. Increase in land area may result in individual farmers being able to activate more entitlements. Effects on the level of expenditure of single payment scheme payments in 2006-07 cannot be determined until the evaluation of reworked cases, currently under way, is completed.</p>

	<p pid="c.374W.2/1">The annual payments made to English farmers under the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) are based on the total value of the entitlements on which a valid claim is made, with adjustments then made to reflect the application of reductions such as modulation and penalties for breaches of eligibility or cross-compliance rules.</p>
	<p pid="c.374W.2/2">The number of entitlements allocated to English farmers is in turn based on the number of eligible hectares that they declared on their application form under the 2005 SPS. The value of those entitlements under the 2005 scheme was calculated in two parts. First a flat rate per entitlement was established by dividing the total number of entitlements created in each English area into a sum representing 10 per cent. of the available funds. The remaining 90 per cent. of the available funds was then used to fund an individual reference amount for each farmer based on historic subsidy receipts. The value of each entitlement will be adjusted each year until 2012 to allocate a higher percentage of available funds to calculate the flat rate value. By 2012, the entire value of each entitlement will be based on a common flat rate amount in each area.

	<p pid="c.387W.2/1">In 2006, DEFRA conducted a public consultation on proposals for the implementation of Regulation 1/2005 in England (with the devolved Administrations conducting similar consultations in their territories). This was sent to over 1,400 interested organisations, key stakeholders and individuals and published on our website. For competence assessment, DEFRA proposed that assessment for short journeys under eight hours would be by means of a theory test with assessment for journeys over eight hours having an additional practical element for demonstration of animal handling and driving skills. None of the consultation responses necessitated deviation from the broad principles outlined. Consultation findings were sent to those who had responded and posted on our website.</p>
	<p pid="c.387W.2/2">The regulation's provisions relating to competence testing and certification do not come into effect until January 2008 and so it would be premature to conduct an assessment of the regulation at this stage. However, the regulation includes a provision for a Europe-wide review on its impact on the welfare of animals during transport in 2011. Early indications are that this is likely to be brought forward to 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.388W.2/1">The regulatory impact assessment (RIA) published in support of the consultation on the implementation of the nitrates directive in England sets out my Department's assessment of the likely financial and environmental impacts of the proposed action programme measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.388W.2/2">The partial RIA estimates that the likely financial impact on agriculture of implementing the proposed measures would be within the range of &pound;52.8 million to &pound;105.5 million per year. This assumes that the action programme is applied within proposed nitrate vulnerable zones covering 70 per cent. of England, and costs would be higher if the decision is taken to apply the action programme to the whole of England. These costs could be reduced if DEFRA is successful in obtaining a derogation from the 170kgN/ha/yr whole farm limit for livestock manures&mdash;one of the more burdensome requirements of the proposals.</p>

	<p pid="c.391W.2/1">The increase in UK grain prices reflects the rise in global wheat prices following two successive smaller world harvests and increasing demand for cereals for food, feed and fuel purposes. Current high grain prices, combined with policy changes such as the removal of the set-aside requirement for the 2008 harvest, will undoubtedly stimulate production and lead to a moderation of prices, but it may take a number of years to rebuild stocks to levels that markets are comfortable with, and periods of price volatility are likely to occur for the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p pid="c.391W.2/2">In the poultry (and pig) sectors, feed costs, and by implication, total production costs, are largely determined by world prices for cereals, oilseeds and other commodities (recognising that there is some limited scope to reformulate feed in response to relative price movements to reduce costs). The latest set of animal feed statistics contains details of the price of poultry feed up to June 2007 and can be found at:</p>

Places for three-year-olds in the private, voluntary and independent (PVI) sectors were funded directly via Nursery Education Grant (NEG). New three-year-old places created in the maintained sector were funded via SSA.<br/> Between 2003-04 and 2005-06 LAs received funding to provide free nursery education for three and four-year-olds through the under-fives sub-block of their Education Formula Spending Share (EFSS).<br/> From 2006-07 LAs receive funding for all three to 15-year-olds through the DSG.

	<p pid="c.411W.8/1">My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools and Learners has signalled his support for the recommendations contained within the Children's Workforce Development Council's (CWDC) paper on educational psychologists (EPs), which identified a number of options for the future funding and administration arrangements in relation to the initial entry training of EPs.</p>
	<p pid="c.411W.8/2">We have asked the CWDC and the Local Government Association, as the representative body of the local authority employers, to take matters forward in terms of the funding and administration of trainee EP places/courses commencing in September 2008. Further information can be accessed via the CWDC website at:</p>
	<p pid="c.411W.8/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.cwdcouncil.org.uk/educationalpsychology">www.cwdcouncil.org.uk/educationalpsychology</a></p>
	<p pid="c.411W.8/4">The full-time equivalent number of EPs in post in local authorities in England, as at January 2007, was 2,352, with 73 full-time vacancies. EPs are employed by local authorities, and it is for those authorities to determine how many to employ in light of their assessment of local needs and available resources, and to plan for future needs. It is not the role of the Department to undertake any manpower planning or funding assessment for this group of local authority employees.</p>
	<p pid="c.411W.8/5">EPs play an important role in assessing special educational needs and in helping to formulate support arrangements for children with a wide range of needs, including those with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties. The value of their contribution was confirmed in an independent study, conducted by the School of Education, University of Manchester, published by the Department on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-31">31 August 2006</phrase>. A copy of the report, &quot;A Review of the Functions and Contribution of Educational Psychologists in England and Wales in light of Every Child Matters: Change for Children&quot; (Research Report No. 792) was placed in the House of Commons Library, and can also be accessed via the Department's research website:</p>

Local authorities are responsible for allocating the children's centre funding that they receive from my Department to the Sure Start Children's Centres in their area. In 2006-07 this grant included &pound;3,482,237 in ringfenced revenue funding to support five SSLPs in Cumbria. Cumbria county council, like all other local authorities with ringfenced SSLP funding, has the freedom to determine the level of resource for each individual SSLP in its area. The following table shows allocations for the five financial years between 2002 and 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.424W.17/13">Data on the number of families accessing health and support services in Sure Start centres are not collected centrally. Sure Start Whitehaven was originally set up to support 706 children under four and their families, but when it became a Sure Start Children's Centre in 2005 its 'catchment area' was increased to support 900 children under five and their families. Cumbria county council has developed sixteen Sure Start Children's Centres, four of which (including the one based on Sure Start Whitehaven) are in the Copeland area. According to information from Cumbria county council these four centres serve 1,753 children under five and their families.</p>

	<p pid="c.431W.2/1">Land Registry is a trading fund and is required to recover the costs of its operation from fee income, together with a return on average capital employed, currently 3.5 per cent. In 2006-07 Land Registry dealt with 4.38 million official searches in England and Wales. It is not possible to distinguish whether these were on domestic or other types of properties. The estimated cost was &pound;16.25 million, including the return on average capital employed of 3.5 per cent. This gives an average cost of &pound;3.71 per transaction. It is important to note that this information is obtained from sampling exercises and is purely an estimate. Sampling exercises are carried out to inform the required level of Land Registry fees charged to customers. Currently, the fee charged for an Official Search of the Land Register for England and Wales is &pound;3 if the application is made electronically or &pound;6 if made by post or in person. Land Registry does not collect detailed information on resource utilization for non-electronic applications for its statutory land registration services as the administrative cost of doing so would be significant and would have to be passed on to its customers.</p>

We recognise that maintenance arrangements can last for many years and therefore expect the Commission will also encourage parents to re-contact the Information and Support Service at any point if their arrangement breaks down.

The launch commenced with a mailing of basic information to 1.4 million employers. The campaign was designed both to raise awareness of age discrimination legislation, and to provide practical guidance to help employers become more age diverse in their employment practices.</p>

Many of the members and a number of key trade sector organisations worked with us to actively promote the materials through their own employer networks.</p>

	<p pid="c.442W.6/1">The UK has not raised any concerns with the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat on this issue as the Secretariat has no executive powers to take action. This is a matter for Treaty Parties. We have consulted experts from the British Antarctic Survey, whose initial view is that the environmental impacts from the vessel are likely to be minimal. The M/S Explorer used marine gas oil, which is a light non-persistent fuel. The ship sank in open water, some 50 nautical miles from the nearest point of land and any penguin or seabird colonies. There have been reports of fuel leakage, but this has been dissipating quickly and evaporating in the open water. HMS &quot;Endurance&quot; is due to arrive in Antarctica shortly and she will use swath bathymetry to accurately locate the position of the vessel on the seabed and report on any visible signs of pollution.</p>
	<p pid="c.442W.6/2">Tourism and cruise ship safety in Antarctica will be major discussion topics at the next Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in Kiev in June 2008. The UK will continue to engage fully with other Treaty Parties in these discussions and will pursue its proposals for measures to strengthen the contingency plans of cruise ships in the Antarctic.</p>

	<p pid="c.444W.8/1">At the Spring European Council in March 2007, EU leaders agreed that climate change and energy policies must be integrated to enable the EU to become the first high growth, low carbon global economy. This transition is essential to ensure economic, energy and climate security. The Treaty of Lisbon recognises climate change as an important strategic challenge and as a specific objective of EU policy. It provides a new legal base for the EU to act on energy security, liberalising energy markets and promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy, with the specific aim of preserving and improving the environment.</p>

	<p pid="c.449W.6/1">We call on all parties in the Delta to engage in dialogue towards a peaceful solution to the problems of the Delta. Nigerian President Yar'Adua has made resolution of the Delta crisis one of the main priorities for his term in office. Vice President Goodluck Jonathan has been specifically tasked with taking forward dialogue with a range of groups in the Delta and President Yar'Adua has also been personally engaged. In view of this, a Delta summit is intended to be held in early 2008, bringing together federal and state governments, militant groups and representatives from the local community. The UK has offered to support these efforts where we can add value.</p>
	<p pid="c.449W.6/2">Recently, the Government of Nigeria has demonstrated greater readiness to use the Joint Task Force (JTF), a combined military and civilian police force, to provide greater security in the Delta. The JTF was successful in stopping a particularly intense outbreak of gang violence in Port Harcourt in August 2007. We believe that both the increased dialogue and the use of the JTF have contributed to the fact that there has been a very significant reduction in the number of expatriate kidnappings since early October.</p>
	<p pid="c.449W.6/3">However, the risk of violence remains high and Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) travel advice continues to advise against all travel to the Delta States of Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers, including Port Harcouit. It advises British nationals in these States to leave due to the very high risk of kidnapping and other armed attacks. The FCO also advises against all travel to riverine areas of Cross River State and against all but essential travel to Akwa Ibom State for the same reasons.</p>
	<p pid="c.449W.6/4">The FCO remains in close contact about security with international oil companies both through UK Trade and Investment and consular officials in Lagos, and through representatives in London and Abuja.</p>

The FCO holds no further pertinent information. My hon. Friend the then Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs (Mr. Mike O'Brien) met the relatives of Mr. Rennie and Mr. Peters in September 2003 and March 2004. In December 2007, FCO consular officials wrote to the families of both men to update them on developments following the conclusion of the New South Wales coroner's inquest.</p>

We publish the abstracts to contribute to greater openness, public understanding and debate about the use of animals in science and we actively encourage applicants to provide them. However, abstracts are provided on a voluntary basis and the applicants own the copyright. Compliance with this initiative has generally been good and abstracts have been displayed for 83 per cent. of the project licences granted since the beginning of 2006 to December 2007 and there are currently just over 1,110 published abstracts in total. I consider the current voluntary system to be both proportionate and to have achieved its objective and I have no plans to make the provision of abstracts mandatory.</p>

The remaining three police forces are 'live' in at least one site, but still in the process of implementation in their remaining sites. Implementation will be complete in all forces at all sites by mid-2008. The total cost of implementing the electronic custody systems is not available, as these systems have usually been implemented as part of a suite of other systems (including records management, case preparation and crime and intelligence).

	<p pid="c.462W.0/2"><i> </i>I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.462W.0/3">The Government are committed to reducing substance misuse among young people, including that relating to alcohol. Educating young people about the long and short-term effects of alcohol misuse is a vital part of this.</p>
	<p pid="c.462W.0/4">Since 1997, efforts have been made to continually strengthen our approach to alcohol education in schools. The Department has issued several guidance documents to schools on drug (including alcohol) education. This includes 'Circular 4/95: Drug Prevention and Schools' and, in 1998, 'Protecting Young People: Good practice in Drug Education in Schools and the Youth Service'. In 2002, curriculum guidance on drug, alcohol and tobacco education was produced and issued to schools by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. Most recently, in 2004, the Department refreshed all existing guidance for schools by issuing a single document, 'Drugs: Guidance for Schools'. This made clear our intention for pupils to be educated about alcohol and its effects in primary school before drinking patterns become established and for this to be revisited in secondary school. It is important that our approach to alcohol education in schools is robust and, for this reason, next year, my Department will undertake a review into the effectiveness of alcohol education and we will strengthen our approach if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="c.462W.0/5">It is clear, however, that young people need more than drug education in school to inform them about the health harms associated with alcohol misuse. As part of the updated Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy: Safe. Sensible. Social. (2007), the Department for Children, Schools and Families has convened a panel of paediatricians, psychologists and epidemiologists who will produce authoritative, accessible guidance about what is and is not safe and sensible in the light of the latest available evidence from the UK and abroad. This guidance will be issued to young people and their parents to help them make informed decisions about alcohol. Next year, we will also deliver a social marketing campaign in order to foster a culture where it is socially acceptable for young people to choose not to drink and, if they do, to do so later and more safely.</p>

Nationally this means that there are 31 digital mammography sets in the national health service breast screening programme, some are part of equipment evaluations.</p>
	<p pid="c.463W.0/2">The recently published Cancer Reform Strategy recommends that breast screening units should work with the NHS breast screening programme to develop business cases for digital mammography, that primary care trusts will need to give high priority to full implementation, with all units having at least one full-field digital mammography set by 2010. All women under 50 routinely screened should have Direct Digital available for assessment visits by 2010.</p>

Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year. <i> All Diagnoses count of episodes</i> These figures represent a count of all FCE's where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in a HES record. ICD10 Diagnosis code used: Coronary Heart Disease = I20-I25 <i> Assessing growth through time</i> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time. <i> Data Quality</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS Trusts and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i> All Operations count of Episodes</i> These figures represent a count of all FCE's where the procedure was mentioned in any of the 12 (four prior to 2002-03) operation fields in a HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if an operation is mentioned in more than one operation field of the record.

The details of how that diet is provided are for local determination. Work to support trusts in delivering good food and nutritional care is provided via a wide range of mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="c.478W.5/3">The national health service plan stipulated that dieticians should advise and check on nutritional values in hospital food. Nutritional information is available for all recipes in the national dish selector, and this can be used to assess local nutritional levels.

	<p pid="c.478W.5/4">The Food Standards Agency has published (voluntary) nutrient and food based guidance for major institutions. This guidance aims to assist caterers and consumers to achieve the Government's healthy eating recommendations. This advice feeds into the cross Government agenda on diet and food procurement. The Agency has also published example menus to assist caterers in meeting this guidance.</p>

The Human Tissue Act 2004 makes it an offence to give or receive a reward for the supply, or offer of human material for transplantation. Most importantly it makes trafficking in tissue and cells for transplantation liable to a fine, imprisonment or both. All potential living donors are assessed by a Human Tissue Authority (HTA) trained and accredited independent assessor, who is required to specifically look for evidence of coercion, payment and reward. The HTA must also be satisfied that there is no evidence of payment or reward and that consent has been given before it can approve the transplant and will prosecute cases of commercial dealing or trafficking.</p>

	<p pid="c.486W.2/1">We do not hold information centrally on the number of radiotherapy fractions that were delivered by each primary care trust in each of the last three years. The latest national information available is in the National Radiotherapy Advisory Group Report &quot;Radiotherapy: developing a world class service for England&quot; which the Department published in May 2007. The report sets out fractions per linac per year, averaged across a radiotherapy department, in paragraphs 45 and 46. It showed that the median radiotherapy centre gave 7,400 fractions per linac and on average 16 out of 39 centres delivered more than 8,000 fractions per linac. A copy of the report has been placed in the Library.</p>

	<p pid="c.494W.5/1">The Department has been working with a range of key stakeholders to develop a model of 10 proposed managed clinical networks. The national health service plan set out a commitment to introduce new and effective screening programmes for women and children including a new national linked antenatal and neonatal programme for sickle cell and thalassaemia. The programme has now implemented newborn screening and 100 per cent. of newborn babies are now offered screening for sickle cell. Antenatal screening is expected to be fully implemented by spring 2008. The programme is expected to identify approximately 300 screen positive affected babies a year with sickle cell and haemoglobin variants from 559,098 babies across England. The benefits of this specialist care can then be managed in the right place with appropriate resources. The clinical network will build on existing expertise, to allow access to comprehensive care to be available across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.494W.5/2">A working group has been established to oversee the roll-out of the managed clinical networks, and a number of centres have now been identified.</p>

	<p pid="c.501W.3/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.501W.3/2">North Sea oil and gas has made a huge contribution to the British economy over the last three decades but that contribution cannot be encapsulated as a single value in 2007 (or any other) prices. Between 1997 and 2006, the cumulative gross revenue of the UK upstream oil and gas sector, principally from sales of oil and gas produced from the North Sea, amounted to &pound;761 billion in 2006 prices. Over the same period, cumulative operating costs of the sector amounted to &pound;129 billion in 2006 prices. The cumulative total gross operating surplus of the UK upstream oil and gas sector between 1997 and 2006 was thus &pound;632 billion in 2006 prices. The gross operating surplus of the sector is a little less than its gross value added (GVA), data for which go back only to 1985. GVA is the best single measure of a sector's contribution to Gross Domestic Product. Over the period 1997 to 2006, the UK upstream oil and gas sector spent a further &pound;44 billion in 2006 prices on exploration and appraisal and &pound;171 billion on capital expenditure (these and previous data come from the BERR Oil and Gas website&mdash;<a href="http://www.og.dti.gov.uk/information/bb_updates/appendices/Appendix7.htm">http://www.og.dti.gov.uk/information/bb_updates/appendices/Appendix7.htm</a>). It also contributed &pound;233 billion in 2006/07 prices to the Exchequer over the period 1977/78 to 2006/07 (source: BERR Oil and Gas website&mdash;<a href="http://www.og.dti.gov.uk/information/bb_updates/appendices/Appendix8.htm">http://www.og.dti.gov.uk/information/bb_updates/appendices/Appendix8.htm</a>). None of these figures captures the overall net impact the sector has had on the economy.</p>

	<p pid="c.502W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-08">8 January 2008</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="c.502W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what the average household income was in the Cleethorpes constituency in each year since 1997 (176890).</p>
	<p pid="c.502W.2/4" class="indent">Estimates of household income which include income from all sources such as earnings, benefits, pensions, and investment income, are generally based on household surveys. The largest of these is the Family Resources Survey which has an annual sample in the UK of around 28,000 households. This is sufficient to produce estimates of household income at national and regional level, but not for smaller areas. Statistics on earnings by employees are available for local authorities from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) which is an employer based survey.</p>
	<p pid="c.502W.2/5" class="indent">The ONS has published estimates of household income for wards for 2001/02, and using a newer geographical classification&mdash;the medium layer super output areas&mdash;for 2004/05. There are no figures available for other years. The geographical boundaries and data sources used in producing the 2004/05 figures are different to those used for 2001/02 so they are not directly comparable. In particular, they cannot be used to provide an accurate measure of change over this period. Both estimates are based on a statistical model and are classed as experimental statistics&mdash;this means they have been developed in accordance with the principles set out in the National Statistics Code of Practice but have yet to be fully accredited as National Statistics. They are available through the Neighbourhood Statistics section of the ONS website.</p>
	<p pid="c.502W.2/6" class="indent">Table 1 shows mean net equivalised incomes, both before and after housing costs, for Cleethorpes parliamentary constituency in 2001/02, and for the wards that made up the constituency. Table 2 shows just average incomes for Cleethorpes constituency in 2004/05. The estimates for 2004/05 are based on the super output areas which do not correspond to areas which are as easily recognisable 'on the ground' as wards. They are designed to be built up to form larger areas and so Table 2 shows only an average for the constituency as a whole. All of these figures for Cleethorpes and wards within Cleethorpes, either appear in the 'experimental' datasets described above, or have been calculated directly from them.</p>

	<p pid="c.510W.9/1">Goods imported into the United Kingdom from the Channel Islands are subject to import VAT in the same way as goods imported from any country outside the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.9/2">However, under European Community legislation, import VAT is not payable on commercial consignments, if the total value of the goods in the consignment does not exceed &pound;18.</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.9/3">There is no prohibition on the importation of food supplements for personal use within the EC Food Supplement Directive, with the exception within the UK of Kava-Kava containing foodstuffs. Therefore UK Customs must apply the VAT exemption rules until the policy on the import of such goods is changed.</p>
	<p pid="c.510W.9/4">No assessment has been made on specific products imported under the Import VAT Accounting Scheme, but the scheme is very closely monitored taking into account the revenue consequences and the impact on the UK market.</p>
