The Detaining Power is also obliged to facilitate the execution and authentication in due legal form of such documents on behalf of internees, in particular allowing them to consult a lawyer.

	<p pid=".5W.12/1">The costs of the new Armed Forces pension and compensation schemes have been and will continue to be assessed individually. However, there are links between the two schemes, as income payments from the pension and associated early departure schemes are offset against the loss of earnings income payments in the compensation scheme. Both schemes are considered to be broadly cost-neutral when compared with current provision. Benefits will be paid against entitlement from centrally management Government funds.</p>

	<p pid=".6W.2/1">I have been in correspondence with the Royal British Legion about its assessment of the combined effect on recent War Pension claims of the changes planned for the new compensation scheme to time limits and standard of proof. We do not accept the Royal British Legion's analysis, which was based on a sample which was not representative of the full spectrum of claims. Nor do we accept that data for the time lapse between leaving service and making a claim under the War Pensions Scheme (WPS) can be extrapolated to the new scheme. We expect the timing of claims under the new scheme to take account of the time limit.</p>
	<p pid=".6W.2/2">No work has been undertaken to assess how the particular provisions in the new scheme for time limits and standard of proof would have affected the decisions that we have taken on claims under the War Pension Scheme. Rather, our approach has been to consider the future requirement for a compensation scheme from first principles. We have sought to design a scheme which offers fair and proportionate compensation to anyone who, within a sensible timescale, can provide reasonable evidence that they are suffering from a condition due to service. The scheme will allow claims for specified late-onset conditions outside the limit, and will provide for exceptional review and an independent appeals tribunal. An independent review of our proposals commissioned from Watson Wyatt, a firm of actuaries and consultants, has confirmed that this approach is appropriate and reasonable. Copies of this report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses entitled &quot;Armed Forces Compensation Scheme&mdash;A report on the proposals for a revised compensation scheme for members of the Armed Forces&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".6W.5/1">The new scheme will assess compensation by matching an injury accepted as due to service to a tariff description and the corresponding fixed level award. For those injuries lying within tariff levels 1 to 11, where it is assessed that earnings capacity will be significantly affected, there will be an additional Guaranteed Income Stream, paid at graduated levels, up-rated for inflation, and based on salary at service termination. It will be paid for life.</p>

	<p pid=".6W.5/3">The new compensation scheme will be implemented by the Veterans Agency, which has considerable experience of assessing and determining claims for injury, illness or death due to Service. There will be an internal disputes resolution procedure for claimants who are dissatisfied with the decision on their claims. Following this, claimants can appeal to the independent Pensions Appeal Tribunal (who currently support the War Pensions Scheme). For appeals on points of law, a Social Security Commissioner will provide the new second tier of independent appeal, with a final level of appeal to the Court of Appeal.</p>

	<p pid=".7W.2/1">A key principle of the new scheme is a better scaling of compensation to the level of disablement. The War Pensions Scheme provides neither awards that are reasonably proportionate to level of disablement nor significant up-front sums to help people adapt their lives to their new circumstances. However, the new Armed Forces Compensation Scheme for death, injury and ill-health due to Service provides lump sums for pain and suffering that are set out in a 15-level tariff, graduated for level of disablement, with substantial amounts payable, particularly at the higher levels. This also means that money will be available to help people adapt their lives. Where earning capacity is significantly impaired, there will also be a Guaranteed Income Stream (GIS), graduated according to level of impairment. For those with more minor conditions, which are not expected to have a significant impact on earnings capacity, a lump sum for pain and suffering is paid, but no GIS. Details of the compensation scheme, including example tariffs, have been placed in the Library of the House and can be found on the MOD internet site at: <a href="http://www.mod.uk/issues/pensions">www.mod.uk/issues/pensions</a> (A Framework Document For The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme for Injury, Illness and Death Due to Service).</p>

This detail is set in broader context by the publication every two years of the MOD's overarching Defence Investment Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".10W.9/2">In addition, the principal output of the MOD's annual equipment planning round is a set of detailed planning assumptions and financial data about the proposed content and timing of the future equipment programme. This forms part of the internal advice to Ministers on the overall affordability of the defence programme and of individual projects at the time they come forward for approval. It therefore anticipates decisions still to be taken by Ministers. In parts it also contains information which is commercially sensitive. I am therefore withholding the information in accordance with Exemptions 2 and 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.</p>

	<p pid=".11W.0/1">There are no plans to set up a joint Franco-British rapid deployment force. However, as part of the Helsinki Headline Goal, member states agreed to develop rapid response elements available and deployable at very high readiness. The British, French and German governments are proposing that EU member states create Battle Group-sized forces, deployable within 15 days, by 2007. Member states would be able to offer such formations individually&mdash;as is likely to be the case for the United Kingdom&mdash;or on a multi-national basis.</p>

	<p pid=".11W.3/1">Progress is continuing across the 15 Project Groups established under the European Capabilities Action Plan since May 2003, although all are at different stages in their development. In strategic mobility, for example, and in conjunction with NATO, the Project Group is introducing a 'Strategic Air Lift Interim Solution' or SALIS, (in place until A-400M becomes available) and the co-ordinated use of assets by a Strategic Air Lift Co-ordination Centre, co-located with the European Airlift Co-ordination Centre at Eindhoven. There are also important qualitative outputs under development across the Project Groups, for example in systems interoperability, operational doctrine, and training. The Council Conclusions of 17 November 2003 underlined the need to disseminate Project Group objectives, timelines and reporting procedures more widely, and this information will be presented shortly as an integral part of the Single Progress Report compiled once during each Presidency. It is anticipated that a Capability Improvement Chart showing the state-of-play of the Project Groups in a clearly digestible format will accompany the Single Progress Report.</p>

	<p pid=".14W.5/1">The Army, and individual capbadges within the Army, do not recruit as a percentage of liability. The Army is resourced to approximately 94 per cent. of liability in FY 2004&ndash;05; this defines, through a process of detailed manpower forecasting, the level of recruits required each year. The Director of Manning (Army) divides the total requirement of new recruits each year by capbadge and this will be consistent with the Army Board's endorsed manning priorities. The level of funding is set to increase gradually to nearly 99 per cent. of its liability by 2008.</p>
	<p pid=".14W.5/2">In the Royal Navy and the RAF, recruiting targets are set in order to provide a level of input that will sustain manpower levels in the long-term against the projected requirement. Both Services strive to recruit 100 per cent. of their manning target in any one financial year. Royal Navy recruiting targets are variable and not a fixed percentage of the requirement.</p>

Although international experiences make a useful comparison they are unlikely to provide a robust method of estimating what might happen in this country because of cultural differences such as attitudes to litigation.

	<p pid=".35W.16/1">The National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education reported jointly to the Secretaries of State for Culture, Media and Sport and Education and Employment in 1999 via the report &quot;All Our Futures&quot;. The report contained 59 detailed recommendations for action by a range of bodies including Government, schools and higher education institutions.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.16/2">Many of the recommendations in &quot;All Our Futures&quot; are framed quite broadly. However, my Department has worked closely with the Department for Education and Skills, and external partners, to implement all of those which fall to DCMS.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.16/3">Among the key examples are the Creative Partnerships programme, which aims to build long-term, sustainable relationships between creative professionals and schools. With &pound;110 million of funding over four years, the programme, which began in September 2002, has enabled over 110,000 pupils to become involved in over 1,400 projects so far.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.16/4">The &pound;130 million Space for Sport and Arts (SSA) programme is funding the building of nearly 300 facilities in primary schools in the 20 per cent. most deprived wards in the country. 138 SSA projects have now been completed and 84 more have work ongoing.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.16/5">To support new music making opportunities for young people, Youth Music was established in 1999 with &pound;10 million per annum of Lottery funding. It has already reached over one million young people and their wider communities. Alongside this, the Music Standards Fund, also established in 1999, provides &pound;60 million per annum established to protect and expand LEA music services.</p>
	<p pid=".35W.16/6">Another relevant initiative is Artsmark, which seeks to recognise those schools which offer a wide range of arts provision. Nearly 2,000 schools now have awards, including one in five secondary schools nationally.</p>

	<p pid=".38W.2/1">The asset value of the National Stud is set out in the annual report of the Horserace Betting Levy Board, a copy of which is in the Libraries of both Houses. Our preference is to transfer the Stud, without consideration, to a new independent charitable trust with a broad remit which would include training for stud staff; thoroughbred breeding which genuinely and distinctively contributes to the long-term quality of British racing; and a centre displaying the British horse heritage as a whole and providing information about breeding. We will continue to assess the progress being made by the new Board of the Stud, with the support of the Levy Board, towards the point at which such a transfer could appropriately take place, with the proviso that closure of the Stud and sale of the assets remains the fall-back option.</p>

The Helsinki Force Catalogue 2003 and Supplementary Catalogue&mdash;which together list the actual forces and capabilities offered by member, accession and third states&mdash;show that at least 118 of these capability areas have been met. The Helsinki Progress Catalogue 2003 assesses the progress made overall in the delivery of Headline and Capability Goals, and outlines when new capabilities will feed in to the Force Catalogue.

The SMS has been approved by the MOD Ship Safety Management Board. The comprehensive assessment of suitability for charter covers: the flag, as per the Paris Memorandum of Understanding; the ship's age; port state inspection record; classification society; nationality of owners/operators; Marine Superintendent's assessment; and previous record of MOD usage.</p>

The UNMOVIC report of March 2003 stated that the consumption of some Scud and Al Hussein missiles could not be independently verified and there were also unanswered questions about the number of indigenously produced warheads and training engines destroyed by Iraq.

Further work will be guided by the need to ensure that local bus services better meet the needs of local people and communities and make effective use of public subsidy to deliver public aims.

	<p pid=".56W.2/2">The World Bank's &quot;Doing business in 2004&quot; survey of 130 countries ranked the UK in top 10 countries with least regulations, and the New Year survey of EU Business leaders by Handelsblatt ranked the UK No. l for competitiveness. The OECD has found the UK has almost the lowest administration cost and fewer regulations for entrepreneurs than any other EU country, while tax burdens on small businesses are lowest in the UK. A NatWest Survey of 851 UK companies showed a welcome fall in their concerns about red tape. Government policies which have contributed to this include; the following:</p>
	<p pid=".56W.2/3" class="indent">the abolition of automatic fines for late VAT payment for 200,000 SMEs. In 1996&ndash;97 fines totalled &pound;99 million;</p>

	<p pid=".58W.11/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.11/2">The UK Climate Change Programme sets out the policy framework to ensure that the UK meets its Kyoto target, to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 12.5 per cent. below base year levels, and moves towards its domestic goal to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.11/3">The Climate Change Programme, published in November 2000, was developed in close consultation with business, local authorities and a wide range of public and private sector organisations. Responses from all groups identified significant business opportunities for the UK from moving to a more energy efficient, lower carbon economy and less than 5 per cent. of businesses who responded believed that the programme would damage UK's competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.11/4">Many respondents to the consultation on the draft Climate Change Programme noted the need to develop a longer term policy framework that would reduce emissions beyond 2010. The February 2003 Energy White Paper did just this, with its goal to put the UK on a path to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent. by 2050, with real progress by 2020.</p>
	<p pid=".58W.11/5">In developing the Energy White Paper, the Government held a large number of meetings and expert workshops along with a written consultation. There was concern, mostly from companies and trade associations, that competitive advantage should not be compromised by measures to address climate change. However there was also recognition of the advantages that would arise from moving towards a low carbon economy, such as through export opportunities in new renewable technology and engineering expertise, and through opportunities arising from job creation. A summary of the responses, and individual replies from businesses, to the written consultation can be found on the DTI website.</p>

	<p pid=".60W.2/1">Differential voting structures in companies (such as multiple voting rights or non-voting shares) were considered by the independent Company Law Review sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry, which reported in November 2000 on this issue and concluded (&quot;Completing the Structure&quot;, paragraph 5.47):</p>
	<p pid=".60W.2/2" class="indent">We propose that the law should continue to place no restriction on the freedom of companies to have separate classes of shares with different voting (or other) rights.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.2/3">On the basis of the review's findings, my overall approach to such differential voting structures is that, provided they are properly disclosed to the markets and others having dealings with the company, they do enhance freedom and flexibility for companies to structure themselves according to their needs. I shall, however, continue to keep this matter under review.</p>
	<p pid=".60W.2/4">The Company Law Review documents are published on the DTI website at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/cld/review.htm">http://www.dti.gov.uk/cld/review.htm</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".64W.5/2">This June 2003 Communication from the European Commission set out the Commission's view on implementation of the 1996 directive concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) and invited responses to seven questions, among which was one about what support measures should be taken at EU, national, regional or local level to facilitate compliance by installations, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The Government response, submitted to the Commission on 12 September 2003 and available at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/ppc/cipp.htm">http://www.defra. gov.uk/environment/ppc/cipp.htm</a>, pointed out that, in the UK's experience, it is essential for regulators to work closely with operators&mdash;whether or not SMEs&mdash;to explain as precisely as possible what IPPC requires.</p>
	<p pid=".64W.5/3">In the case of the metal finishing industry, the Environment Agency is working with the Surface Engineering Association (SEA) to do that, raising awareness of the requirements and providing draft sector guidance. An Agency Sector Co-ordinator has been appointed to provide advice and support to the industry. Three IPPC Launch Workshops were held in January 2004 for the sector, each including a presentation by the SEA. The agency is supporting the Association's IPPC &quot;club&quot; arrangement under which a series of workshops will be held (led by a consultant and with Agency staff contributing) to help operators write their applications in a common and therefore more efficient approach to IPPC permit application and compliance. Revised IPPC guidance for the sector will be issued by the Environment Agency in mid-February.</p>

	<p pid=".65W.8/1">Capital expenditure on asset replacement by the National Grid Company plc is currently of the order of &pound;120 million per year, approximately one-third of NGC's total annual capital expenditure under its current regulatory price control. The value of the company's network assets is approximately &pound;5 billion, which gives an average replacement rate of 42 years.</p>
	<p pid=".65W.8/2">NGC's asset replacement expenditure is based on a careful assessment of asset condition and not on a simple average asset age approach to replacement rate.</p>

	<p pid=".73W.11/1">Studies <sup>1</sup> of the impact of wind farms on wildlife suggest that there is a small risk of bat strikes from the operation of wind turbines but that this occurs on a very irregular basis due to the good echolocation systems that bats use to navigate.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.11/2">In addition, under the normal planning regime and for consent under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 regime or the Transport and Works Act 1992 wind farm developers are required to consider all environmental aspects of wind energy projects and produce an Environmental Impact Assessment. These assessments are available to the public.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.11/3">The great majority of British bat species do not undertake large scale migrations and so would not be expected to interact with offshore wind farms. The exception to this is Nathusius's pipistrelle which is known to undertake long distance migrations in Europe (including sea crossings), but this is an uncommon species in the UK. The potential for bat interactions with wind turbines is recognised and are being considered in the Strategic Environmental Assessments that will precede any future offshore wind farm licensing rounds.</p>
	<p pid=".73W.11/4">Similarly, bats are listed as a consideration in guidance &quot;Background document on problems and benefits associated with the development of offshore wind farms&quot; issued by the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic (OSPAR document EIHA 03/4/6-E(L)) and thus potential effects on bats would be expected to be assessed in project specific Environmental Impact Assessments for offshore wind farms.</p>

	<p pid=".75W.3/19">To some extent this reflects the occupations that part-time work has historically been concentrated in. The Government are seeking to encourage alternative ways of working for both women and men through initiatives such as the Work-Life Balance campaign, and legislation such as the new law for working parents which enables parents with children under six or disabled children under 18 to request to work flexibly, whilst placing a duty on employers to seriously consider such requests.</p>

	<p pid=".79W.6/1">At the request of the UN Secretary-General, the Security Council agreed to the deployment in June 2003 of an Interim Emergency Multinational Force (Operation Artemis) to Bunia in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The purpose of the operation was to support the UN Mission present in the country and to provide a secure environment under which the interim Administration could function. Operation Artemis was a French-led European Security and Defence Policy force, over which the EU's Political and Security Committee exercised political control and strategic direction. It was deployed for a short period until 15 September 2003 and was a military mission with no civilian police involvement.</p>

	<p pid=".81W.2/1">According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's (UNODC) latest survey, available on the UN website: <a href="http://www.un.org">www.un.org</a>, there was a 30 per cent. decrease in the amount of coca cultivated in Colombia in 2002: 102,071 hectares at the end of 2002, compared with 144,807 hectares at the end of 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.2/2">While cultivation in Colombia decreased in 2002, there was an increase in Peru and Bolivia and farmers have increased productivity through the introduction of higher yielding varieties of coca and by increasing the number of plants planted per hectare.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.2/3">Drug consumption is believed to be rising in Colombia. Latest UN figures for global consumption indicate that the number of people consuming drugs regularly were 200 million worldwide in the period 2000&ndash;01 compared with 185 million worldwide in the period 1998&ndash;2000.</p>

However the low level of cultivation and low production figure in 2001 reflect the Taliban ban on opium cultivation, which did not address the underlying causes of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan and was enforced with a mix of threat and bribery.</p>

It was taken as a last resort. The Iraqi regime's refusal to cooperate left us with no option. Authority to use force against Iraq derived from the combined effect of UNSCRs 678, 687 and 1441; and all of these resolutions were adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which allows the use offeree for the express purpose of restoring international peace and security.</p>

Since then the Coalition Provisional Authority has engaged in a process of consultation with the Governing Council and others on the best way to establish a transitional national administration before full democratic elections are held. The UN Secretary-General sent a technical team to Iraq this month to examine the options for elections. His team's report was due on 21 February. We look forward to receiving its recommendations, to which we will give serious consideration.</p>

	<p pid=".92W.0/1">We and our European Union partners regularly discuss the situation in Serbia and the rest of the Balkans region. The General Affairs and External Relations Council on 26 January noted the results of the recent Serbian parliamentary elections of 28 December 2003. It urged all democratic parties to help form a government committed to reform and further integration with the European Union.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.0/2">While the relationship between Belgrade and the United Nations Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has been difficult, the Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and Head of the Co-ordination Centre for Kosovo and Metohija, Nebojsa Covic, has recently made helpful statements on the Direct Dialogue Working Groups. These talks will cover areas such as environmental issues, energy and missing persons. This is a positive step towards building a stable future for Kosovo.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.0/3">The UK fully supports the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which helps foster reconciliation and stability in the region. Serbia and Montenegro (SaM) made some progress in early 2003, but co-operation has since stalled. We take every opportunity to remind Belgrade that in order to realise her Euro-Atlantic aspirations, SaM must fulfil the international obligation of full and complete co-operation with the ICTY.</p>
	<p pid=".92W.0/4">We believe that SaM could do more to co-operate with the ICTY, particularly by assisting in the arrest and transfer of Bosnian Serb leaders Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic. Through both bilateral and EU initiatives, we continue to put pressure on the SaM Government to transfer all remaining ICTY indictees, including Mladic and Karadzic, and to allow ICTY full access to documents and witnesses.</p>

	<p pid=".94W.8/1">The threat of proliferation of WMD has, in recent years been successfully limited by international arms control and effective multilateral treaties including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC).</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/2">The NPT is the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime, with 188 States Parties. It forbids acquisition or possession of nuclear weapons, except by the five acknowledged nuclear weapons States, who are required to pursue negotiations on nuclear disarmament. The NPT requires non-nuclear weapons Parties to enter into safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in order to verify compliance. The IAEA's safeguards system is being strengthened by the introduction of an Additional Protocol expanding the IAEA's access. The UK is working with EU partners to see this Additional Protocol accepted as an international norm.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/3">The CTBT provides for a global system of monitoring stations, using four complementary technologies, to record data necessary to verify compliance. Its aim is to achieve a total ban of explosive testing of nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/4">The CWC bans the production, acquisition and retention of chemical weapons and requires CW possessors to destroy, under supervision, CW stockpiles and production facilities. CWC implementation is verified by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) through on-site monitoring of CW destruction activity, and regular inspection of relevant industrial facilities. The CWC also provides for any Party with a concern about another's compliance to seek a challenge inspection. The CWC has 159 Parties, most recently including Libya's welcome accession.</p>
	<p pid=".94W.8/5">The BWC has 151 Parties. The Fifth Review Conference of the BWC agreed in November 2002 on a three-year programme of work leading up to the Sixth Review Conference in 2006. This process is designed to strengthen the Convention, which currently has no ability to verify compliance. Assistance with the establishment of national legislation and regulation was provided to two States Parties following the annual Meeting of States Parties in 2003. The UK actively encourages universality of the Convention and urges all States that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the Convention.</p>

I have raised the matter with relevant EU Foreign Minister colleagues on a number of occasions and so have officials on my behalf with their counterparts. The result is that with our strong support, these measures were extended on 19 February for a further year.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.0/2">We also sought and secured an increase in the number of senior ZANU-PF figures subject to the travel ban and assets freeze, from 79 to 95. This includes several additional individuals who bear particular responsibility for the abuses of human rights in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid=".96W.0/3">The 23 February General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC), which I attended, issued a strong statement deploring the failure of the government of Zimbabwe to address the EU's concerns over the deteriorating situation in the country. The GAERC also made clear the EU's intent to continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe, on the basis of need.</p>

	<p pid=".98W.2/1">DFID is not directly involved in funding or implementing this World Bank project. DFID therefore does not have first-hand information on detailed implementation issues concerning external auditing, fiscal accountability, environmental and safety compliance or oil spill response plans.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.2/2">However, DFID is confident that the World Bank's systems for the monitoring and implementation of this project, and for the investigation of any warranted complaints are appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.2/3">Since the project was approved in June 2000, exceptional resources have been allocated by the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation, to monitor and support the project's implementation against Internationally agreed standards. This includes the establishment of the Independent Inspection Panel (IIP) and the External Compliance Monitoring Group (ECMG).</p>
	<p pid=".98W.2/4">In relation to the quality of auditing and fiscal accountability, the World Bank policy identifies two sets of appropriate auditing standards: the International Standards on Auditing published by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and the Auditing Standards published by the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions. Project arrangements provide for regular audits of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline projects accounts, plus independent opinions from the International Advisory Group (IAG) and the External Compliance and Monitoring Group (ECMG), which carries out regular independent supervisions of the technical and environmental aspects of the project, and from the Inspection Panel which may investigate complaints from people who believe they have been negatively affected by a World Bank project.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.2/5">The Chad-Cameroon pipeline is subject to a number of monitoring and supervision controls to ensure quality control, application of environmental regulations, design and implementation adhere to International rules and regulations. The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has strict requirements and specifications, and compliance with these by all parties is spelled out in legally binding agreements. Strong remedies are provided in legal agreements with all parties in case they fail to comply with this obligation. The EMP represents an extensive analysis of the potential environmental and social impacts of the project.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.2/6">The World Bank are being advised by the ECMG in monitoring the implementation of the Environmental Management Plan, and by an International Advisory Group on broader implementation issues, including those that need to be addressed to achieve the project's developmental objectives. Both the ECMG and IAG make regular site visits. These third party reviews supplement the Bank's own monitoring and supervision of the project which includes site visits, internal reporting and continual discussions with the project sponsors.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.2/7">The above measures are additional to on-going monitoring by the Consortium and by the Governments of Chad and Cameroon. The Consortium provides quarterly reports which are publicly available.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.2/8">DFID's interest is as a member of the Executive Board of the World Bank. We do and will continue to take our role on the Executive Board seriously, ensuring that issues identified by the Independent Inspection Panel and External Compliance Monitoring Group are raised, monitored and rectified.</p>
	<p pid=".98W.2/9">The investigation reports mentioned above are publicly available and can be found on <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/afr/ccproj/index.htm">http://www. worldbank.org/afr/ccproj/index.htm</a>.</p>

Maximising the mobilisation of third party capital is the key feature of the reorganisation proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".103W.3/2">CDC's investment policy (set by DFID) obliges it to concentrate its investment in the poorer developing countries where the private sector is generally reluctant to invest. We believe that in practice there is a wide gap between the demand for investment capital in the poorer countries and the amount actually available to them. It is our aim that CDC will help bridge this gap.</p>

	<p pid=".105W.2/1">DFID continuously monitors the effectiveness in reducing poverty, and the value for money, of its direct budget support. Assessing effectiveness means both monitoring the fiduciary risks we take as we use budget support, and also evaluating budget support in terms of its actual effects on poor people.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.2/2">DFID monitors fiduciary risk in order to have a basic indication of whether our budget support is being used effectively. Indicators for monitoring fiduciary risk include:</p>
	<p pid=".105W.2/3" class="indent">whether the objectives for which funds were allocated have been achieved;</p>
	<p pid=".105W.2/4" class="indent">whether reporting is accurate and timely;</p>
	<p pid=".105W.2/5" class="indent">whether actual expenditure matches the agreed budget allocations;</p>
	<p pid=".105W.2/6" class="indent">whether value for money and transparency have been demonstrated in procurement;</p>
	<p pid=".105W.2/7" class="indent">what progress has been made towards improving financial management.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.2/8">In addition to this, a joint donor evaluation of general budget support is under way, which will provide a comprehensive assessment of the effects of budget support on developing countries and their people. DFID has the lead in this process which is co-funded by 15 other donors, through the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.2/9">The evaluation's indicators of effectiveness will include:</p>
	<p pid=".105W.2/10" class="indent">whether there are macroeconomic benefits from budget support (for example: recession avoided, inflation controlled);</p>
	<p pid=".105W.2/11" class="indent">whether the recipient Government has greater control over externally-funded activities and resources;</p>
	<p pid=".105W.2/12" class="indent">whether public expenditure is made more efficient;</p>
	<p pid=".105W.2/13" class="indent">whether public administration is made more effective (due to focus on national budget rather than off-budget financing);</p>
	<p pid=".105W.2/14" class="indent">whether democratic accountability is enhanced.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.2/15">Ultimately the evaluation will assess whether budget support reduces poverty and reduces social exclusion. This assessment will be made using developing countries' own monitoring systems.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.2/16">Full details of the indicators used by the evaluation will be published in April in the document &quot;Joint Evaluation of GBS: Evaluation Framework&quot;. A copy of this document will be placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>

	<p pid=".105W.5/1">During my recent visit to Ethiopia I raised the issue of human rights with Prime Minister Meles and Members of his Government about how respect for human rights&mdash;as enshrined in Ethiopia's own Constitution&mdash;can be improved. The Prime Minister told me of his commitment to improving human rights as enshrined in the constitution and it will be important for the people to see this happen. He nevertheless accepted that there are problems with human rights in Ethiopia. He gave an undertaking to build the capacity of the judiciary and security sectors to help in the securing and protection of constitutional rights for all. Our office in Ethiopia also frequently discusses such issues with the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.5/2">Representations concerning human rights form part of a wider ongoing dialogue with the Government of Ethiopia. This dialogue centres on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)&mdash;signed between DFID and the Government of Ethiopia in 2003&mdash;that sets out undertakings by each side. The improvement of human rights is one such undertaking given by the Government of Ethiopia.</p>
	<p pid=".105W.5/3">We have also ensured that indicators and targets relating to human rights will be linked to our direct budget support in Ethiopia. This will allow us to track the direction of change and inform decisions on future support.</p>

	<p pid=".108W.2/2">The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation and production in Afghanistan. The UNODC is in the process of preparing the 2004 report on behalf of the Afghan government, which will be published in the autumn. According to the UNODC annual survey, the estimated volume of opium production and cultivation in each of the last five years is as follows:</p>

	<p pid=".108W.2/15">The low level of cultivation and low production figure in 2001 reflect the Taliban ban on opium cultivation; the ban did not however address the underlying causes of poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, and was enforced with a mix of threat and bribery.</p>

	<p pid=".108W.8/1">For the three-year period to the end of 2003, positive dialogue between Serbia and the International Community, including the IMF, World Bank, and European Commission led to a programme of reform backed up by substantial assistance programmes from key donors. In 2003, The European Commission allocated some &pound;160 million (UK share of which was about &pound;30 million) and the World Bank had committed nearly &pound;210 million of a three-year allocation of &pound;286 million approved in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".108W.8/2">Although Serbia and Montenegro (SaM) made some progress in co-operating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in early 2003, co-operation has since stalled. We and our partners in the International Community take every opportunity to remind Belgrade that in order to realise her Euro-Atlantic aspirations, SaM must fulfil the international obligation of full and complete co-operation with the ICTY. Through both bilateral and EU initiatives, we continue to put pressure on SaM to arrest and transfer all remaining ICTY indictees, including Serb leaders Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic and to allow ICTY full access to documents and witnesses.</p>
	<p pid=".108W.8/3">We and our European Partners regularly discuss the situation in Serbia. It is unclear how Serbia's relations with international institutions and ICTY will now develop since Serbia has yet to form a government following last December's parliamentary elections. We will continue to liaise closely with EU and other International Community partners, to identify the most effective ways to support and promote both reform and co-operation with ICTY.</p>

New legislation in Brazil banning the carrying of weapons by civilians is another initiative supported by the strategy that has resulted in lasting change.</p>

	<p pid=".110W.2/1">A key element of the UK Government's Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) Strategy is to reduce the availability of SALW through support for weapons stockpile management, collection and destruction programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.2/2">Within the framework of the UN Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons (2001), the UK supports a number of governments including those of developing countries to dispose of small arms stocks, preferably by destruction, that are surplus to national requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.2/3">The UK is supporting the development of five-year National Action Plans in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique and Namibia.

	<p pid=".110W.2/5">The UK has also funded a Brazilian NGO, Viva Rio, which has, as part of its awareness raising campaign, worked with the police and military in organising ceremonial public destructions of firearms.

	<p pid=".110W.5/1">Under the UK Government's Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP), the Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) Strategy (&pound;19.5 million, 2001&ndash;04) seeks to control and reduce the supply, demand and availability of weapons. It does this by supporting policy development and programmes that assist a wide range of international organisations, regional organisations, Governments and NGOs to combat the proliferation and misuse of small arms.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.5/2">The four key areas that the strategy seeks to promote are:</p>
	<p pid=".110W.5/3" class="indent">Policy focused research and analysis to evaluate the impact of programmes and design more effective arms control and reduction policies;</p>
	<p pid=".110W.5/4" class="indent">Building consensus among Governments on the need for increased arms controls;</p>
	<p pid=".110W.5/5" class="indent">Implementing practical projects such as weapons collection, management, and destruction, training of police and customs officers; and</p>
	<p pid=".110W.5/6" class="indent">Integrating small arms controls into wider conflict prevention and poverty reduction programmes.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.5/7">For example, the UK has supported regional and sub regional efforts to combat SALW proliferation, and the development of long-term national programmes. The strategy has also supported work to build regional and international consensus on the need for an international agreement on small arms transfers and trade. This is done within the framework provided by the UN Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons (2001).</p>
	<p pid=".110W.5/8">The UK has contributed to the UN Development Programme's Small Arms and Demobilisation Unit global programme of weapons collection, stockpile management, capacity building and destruction within the context of disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration of ex-combatants and community development. UNDP is active in 45 countries in many parts of Africa, Asia, Europe and Central America.</p>
	<p pid=".110W.5/9">The GCPP has also supported a number of other initiatives including the work of:</p>

	<p pid=".112W.0/1">The key commitments on water and sanitation made at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) were:</p>
	<p pid=".112W.0/2" class="indent">a re-affirmation of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) to halve, by the year 2015, the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water;</p>
	<p pid=".112W.0/3" class="indent">halving by the year 2015 the proportion of people who do not have access to basic sanitation; and</p>
	<p pid=".112W.0/4" class="indent">an agreement to develop integrated water resources management and water efficiency plans by 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.0/5">In May 2003, a Sustainable Development Task Force was established to help ensure effective follow-up of the UK's WSSD commitments, and monitor progress towards sustainable development against the UK's 1999 sustainable development Strategy, &quot;A Better Quality of Life&quot;. The Task Force, chaired by Defra Secretary of State, Margaret Beckett, brings together Ministers from across Whitehall with colleagues from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and some key stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".112W.0/6">The last Task Force meeting, on 4 February 2004, considered DFID's draft Water Action Plan, which describes how DFID intends to take forward its commitments in water and sanitation, and continue to contribute to achieving the MDGs in a way that recognises that such efforts are most effective when they support plans drawn up by developing countries themselves. This will be presented to Parliament shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".117W.5/1">The Government have notified to the Paris Club unrecovered claims of &pound;623 million arising from commercial export contracts with Iraq signed prior to the first Gulf conflict in 1991 insured by the Export Credits Guarantee Department. This amount does not include interest, which it is estimated could bring the figure to around &pound;1.15 billion. The Paris Club deals only with claims arising out of government loans or government-insured commercial credits.</p>
	<p pid=".117W.5/2">The Government believe that Iraq's external debt is unsustainable and that creditors will need to agree a significant reduction through a clear multilateral process in order to restore Iraq to sustainability. That is likely to involve writing off the vast majority of Iraq's external debt.</p>

	<p pid=".117W.8/4" class="indent">The unemployment rate in England and Wales for the period October-December 2003, the latest date for which information is available, was 4.8 per cent.

	<p pid=".117W.8/5" class="indent">The most recent data on unemployment rates by ward are taken from the 2001 Census.

This measure is not directly comparable with the rate using the ILO definition of unemployment above. The average unemployment rate at April 2001 for England and Wales as a whole was 5.2 per cent. on this basis.</p>

However, the European Commission took action on 23 January to ban imports from Thailand of fresh/frozen poultry meat and cooked poultry meat that has not been heat treated to at least 70&deg;C, unless it is accompanied by additional certification confirming that it was from birds slaughtered before 1 January 2004. Poultry meat products which have been cooked to 70&deg;C or more are not considered to be a risk and may still be exported to the EU. The UK took immediate action to implement these measures in domestic law.</p>

	<p pid=".124W.5/1">Government are not taking steps to promote the use of biodegradable plastic bags. The use of degradable plastics that are made from fossil fuel, and specifically designed for disposal with no beneficial recovery potential, runs counter to the Government's aim to increase recycling. In addition, if disposed of in landfill rather than, for example, being composted, biodegradable waste breaks down to release methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas.</p>
	<p pid=".124W.5/2">The Government do support the development of biodegradable plastics from non-fossil sources. The Government-Industry Forum on Non-Food Uses of Crops has concluded that there is an opportunity to produce compostable packaging materials in the UK. Defra is currently drawing up a Non-Food Crops Strategy. A draft is expected to be issued for consultation later in 2004.</p>

TB testing is now being carried out on all farms in an area of South West Cumbria known as the Furness Peninsula, concurrent with a survey of badgers (killed in Road Traffic Accidents) and deer (culled, or found dead, with suspicious lesions) in the same geographical area.

	<p pid=".134W.0/1">Scientists advise that over the last 20 years the fishing rate on cod has been five times that required to promote optimal use of the cod stock, and the fishery captures too many immature fish. On average less than 5 per cent. of each new brood now survives to maturity, and the cod age structure is very restricted. The stock is severely overfished, the biomass of mature fish has shown a prolonged decline, and the number of young cod entering the stock decreased in the mid-1980s.</p>
	<p pid=".134W.0/2">The ICES Advisory Committee on Fishery Management (ACFM) advises that the reduction in recruitment can be at least partly explained by a reduction in the quantity and quality of eggs produced by a reduced spawning stock. There is speculation about the effect of environmental change and species interactions because of increased water temperature, and various contemporaneous changes in other species, but work carried out on these factors does not yet allow them to be quantified. ACFM notes that there may be some changes to the natural mortality of cod, such as a decrease on younger ages, possibly due to reduced cannibalism, and an increase on older ages due to seal predation, but the supporting evidence for these changes is weak.</p>

	<p pid=".135W.2/1">Differences in escape behaviour alone are not significant determinants of fishing mortality. The combination of escape behaviour and net design can be a factor and considerable research has been conducted into net designs which will, for example, reduce fishing mortality of juvenile cod. One option is to separate cod from other species within the trawl and then subject them to a different selection process (e.g. a larger mesh size) when they try to escape. Alternatively, it may be possible to design nets so that some species, including cod, avoid the net completely. Each fishery targeting different ranges of species may require a different complex design with the aim of catching the marketable species and releasing the unwanted species. Research is ongoing in the UK, in collaboration with commercial fishermen.</p>

Their report &quot;Field Work: weighing up the costs and benefits of GM crops&quot; was published on 11 July last year. The Unit concluded that GM crops could offer some cost and convenience advantages to UK farmers, although any economic benefit is likely to be limited in the short-term as only a narrow range of existing GM crops are currently suited to UK conditions, and weak consumer demand may limit take-up. In the longer term it concluded that future developments in GM crops have the potential to offer more wide-ranging benefits, to both farmers and consumers.</p>

This includes the reports of the public debate and science review, the study of the costs and benefits, the Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission's report on co-existence and liability and the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment's advice on the Farm Scale Evaluation research.

	<p pid=".140W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 10 February 2004</p>
	<p pid=".140W.5/2">The Hazardous Waste Forum published its Action Plan in December. The Forum's recommendations centre around four main themes:</p>
	<p pid=".140W.5/3" class="indent">(i) There should be clarity and firm and fair enforcement of regulatory and legislative requirements, particularly with respect to the Landfill Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.5/4" class="indent">(ii) There should be greater awareness raising amongst business and industry to promote waste minimisation and environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.5/5" class="indent">(iii) There needs to be clear information on the likely capacity requirements for treatment and disposal of hazardous waste, and that a task force should be set up to review progress on the provision of this capacity.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.5/6" class="indent">(iv) That for the longer term, work should be put in hand to build on Waste Strategy 2000 to develop policy instruments to encourage waste minimisation and environmentally sound management, to develop better data on hazardous waste arisings and develop targets for hazardous waste reduction, and to address issues concerned with household hazardous waste.</p>
	<p pid=".140W.5/7">Actions are and have been taken with respect to these recommendations. In particular the Government will shortly be announcing the outcome of the consultation on the implementation of the EU Council Decision on Waste Acceptance Criteria under the Landfill Directive. In addition, a treatment and capacity task force has been set up under the chairmanship of the waste industry to get better information on industry plans for treatment and disposal facilities. The consideration and development of further policy instruments is likely to form part of the Forum's work for this year.</p>

	<p pid=".142W.3/1">The last comprehensive report on the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) was presented by TRAFFIC at the 12th Conference of the Parties to CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) in November 2002. This concluded that the illegal trade in ivory is directly correlated to the presence of large-scale, unregulated ivory markets, predominantly found in West and Central Africa, China and Thailand. The report attributed the upward trend in seized ivory since 1998 to the increased demand for ivory consequent upon increased economic prosperity within China.</p>
	<p pid=".142W.3/2">The UK shares TRAFFIC's concerns about the need to regulate domestic ivory markets around the world. Within the UK and the EU as a whole, trade in ivory is strictly regulated through a licensing system. Permits for the sale of ivory are not issued unless it can be shown that the ivory was legally acquired before the current world-wide ban on commercial trade in ivory came into force in 1990.</p>
	<p pid=".142W.3/3">Last year the Government contributed some &pound;60,000 to help ETIS continue its good work in monitoring the illegal trade in ivory and we will be providing an additional &pound;20,000 this year.</p>

	<p pid=".144W.2/6" class="indent">The requirement in the Landfill Directive for all waste to be pre-treated before landfill &mdash;this can both increase and decrease the volume for disposal.</p>
	<p pid=".144W.2/7">Furthermore, the types of any additional facilities that will be required will be site-specific and based on a number of variables such as size of the site and type of contaminate within the soil. The Hazardous Waste Forum task force on treatment and disposal capacity is currently assessing all these interlinking factors, continues to monitor closely the provision of facilities, and will advise on the issues that need to be addressed so that all waste is subject to environmentally sound management and disposal. Overall the Government's policy is to reduce the UK's reliance on landfill, which, as well as its negative environmental impacts, makes little practical use of waste and is a missed opportunity to recover value from waste.</p>

	<p pid=".145W.11/1">Defra's Ministers see secondments and interchange as a key means of complementing the skills and experience of the Civil Service, drawing in expertise from such fields as business, local government and the voluntary sector as well as other Government Departments. This is assisting Defra's commitment to play its part in developing a modern, flexible, outward looking Civil Service that works in partnership with all sectors of society. Interchange is seen as a key tool in meeting this commitment. Defra continues to promote and encourage the interchange of personnel between the Department and a range of other organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.11/2">The term 'secondee' is used within the Civil Service in a more limited sense than the meaning used outside the Civil Service. In the Civil Service a secondee is a person who is 'borrowed' from an organisation outside the Civil Service for a period of between three months and three years (exceptionally five years), without affecting employment status. Great care is taken in setting up any secondment to ensure that conflicts of interest do not arise. During the secondment period the secondee would remain an employee of the parent organisation but would be expected to abide by the Defra staff handbook and the Official Secrets Act. At the end of the secondment the secondee would return to the parent organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".145W.11/3">The duties performed day to day are a matter for the secondee's managers and may include drafting answers to parliamentary questions.</p>

This new programme was explicitly created to provide clear responsibilities and accountabilities, and a strong focus at the centre of government to drive forward implementation in specific areas. The initial direction and implementation arrangements for WIP were overseen by a ministerial group answering jointly to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.</p>

A Steering Committee, representing key interests engaged in waste management, has been established to drive forward the implementation of WIP workstreams. This group also provides strategic advice on the new programme, and reports direct to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Meetings are attended by representatives from several Government Departments. In addition, there are regular meetings with ODPM, DTI and HMT at official level.</p>

	<p pid=".152W.5/1">The European Commission's Action Plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) includes proposals to prevent the import into the EU of illegally logged timber, through the voluntary licensing of timber exports from FLEGT partner countries. Under these voluntary agreements export permits would be granted only if the timber has been harvested in conformity with relevant national legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".152W.5/2">The Government's view is that it is for each producer state to define legality in reference to the national laws and regulations of that state and for them to decide if the management of wildlife should be included in such a definition. It would not be appropriate to make representations to the European Commission concerning the criteria for defining legality. We would however be willing to work with individual countries to address this as a criteria.</p>

	<p pid=".154W.11/1">All Education and Library Boards are organising awareness training for relevant staff at schools and other board properties aimed at providing them with sufficient knowledge to assist safely in asbestos management. This training is expected to be completed by all boards by May 2004. Asbestos management plans, which include details of the procedures to be followed in the management of asbestos, will be provided to schools and other board properties. Registers are also being drawn up as boards complete surveys of properties, which will include details of the location and condition of any asbestos. Individual properties will be provided with a copy of the register relevant to them.</p>

	<p pid=".164W.8/1">The policy rationale for retaining industrial derating in Northern Ireland no longer exists. This view is supported by leading business and economic commentators and by the outcomes of various studies and an extensive consultation exercise in 2002. An assessment of the impact of removal on manufacturers concluded that any increase in costs would be limited and the impact significantly reduced by phasing it out in the manner announced in April 2003. The phase out period will begin on 1 April 2005 and end on 1 April 2011. This means that manufacturers will have been given eight years to adjust and plan for paying full rates which is longer than the timeframe proposed by the former DFP and DETI Assembly Committees. They will have to pay only 15 per cent. of their full rates liability in 2005&ndash;06. This percentage will rise but on a very gradual basis over the next six years. This is a sensible, modernising reform measure that will bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK. There are other more effective ways of supporting businesses than retaining a blanket exemption for which there is no supporting rationale. Proposals for a hardship rate relief scheme for all businesses are being examined and will be published after consultation with Councils and business organisations.</p>

	<p pid=".165W.2/1">The estimated long-term yield from the rating of the manufacturing sector is around &pound;55 million per year. This allows for possible valuation reductions as a result of appeals and is based on around 5,100 properties currently in the Valuation List becoming liable to full rates in 2011. Applying the 15 per cent. rate liability applicable in the first year (2005&ndash;06), the yield in that year is expected to be around &pound;8 million. This additional revenue will be invested through the Reinvestment and Reform Initiative (RRI) to help fund a significant programme of major infrastructure projects in Northern Ireland over the next five years. Projects contained within the Strategic Investment Programme and totalling some &pound;2.7 billion in value have already been announced. Investment in our public service infrastructure is essential for sustained economic growth and development. This scale of planned investment will significantly enhance Northern Ireland's prospects for long-term economic prosperity and future business success. The retention of industrial derating will not achieve these outcomes.</p>

	<p pid=".173W.2/1">There a number of policies, both specific and general, designed to help regenerate under populated residential areas.</p>
	<p pid=".173W.2/2">The Northern Ireland Housing Executive actively seeks to revitalise areas that have experienced population loss and which may also suffer from unfit or vacant housing stock by the use of statutory powers to designate Redevelopment Areas and Urban Regeneration Areas, together with programmes of Renovation Grant activity. The NI Housing Executive is also currently engaged in developing a range of strategies and programmes which seek to facilitate regeneration and sustainable communities such as:</p>
	<p pid=".173W.2/3" class="indent">Empty Homes Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".173W.2/4" class="indent">The Rural Strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".173W.2/5" class="indent">Estate Renewal, Neighbourhood Renewal and Community Development Strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".173W.2/6" class="indent">Living over the shop and town centre living.</p>
	<p pid=".173W.2/7" class="indent">Arterial Routes Studies.</p>
	<p pid=".173W.2/8">Additionally, the Regional Development Strategy for Northern Ireland has the objective of creating sustainable communities and regenerating urban areas. It requires that 60 per cent. of future new build housing be sited within the existing urban footprint. The NI Housing Executive contributes to the Policy Planning Strategy 12 document in respect of Housing Need Assessments that are to be completed as part of each Development Plan. These highlight the housing needs required to achieve sustainable and affordable housing within settlements across Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".173W.2/9">In addition, while not specifically targeting under-populated areas, the Department for Social Development's tools for regeneration clearly impact on such areas, and in particular, Northern Ireland's most disadvantaged communities. The Department's wide range of strategies and programmes such as the Urban Development Programme, Urban Development Grant, Environmental Improvement Schemes, and the recently launched Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy, aim to revitalise areas of slower growth, promote social cohesion, and help build more socially, economically and environmentally sustainable neighbourhoods.</p>

	<p pid=".176W.2/3" class="indent">A review of acute trauma services, which is underway at present.

	<p pid=".176W.2/4" class="indent">The building of two new modular theatres for Musgrave Park Hospital. This has increased theatre capacity, which will improve fracture services, stabilise and reduce waiting lists and facilitate the mix of elective, trauma and out-patient work of consultant orthopaedic surgeons.</p>
	<p pid=".176W.2/5" class="indent">The appointment earlier this year at Green Park Health and Social Services Trust of a waiting list manager and the establishment of a centralised waiting list team.</p>

	<p pid=".176W.5/1">The primary legislation governing compensation for the acquisition of pipeline wayleaves in Northern Ireland is The Water and Sewerage Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1973. The rules for assessing any compensation payable under this Order are contained in the Land Compensation (Northern Ireland) Order 1982. The principal thrust of this legislation and the associated case law decisions has been to ensure that compensation is based on the actual loss in every case.</p>
	<p pid=".176W.5/2">The legal basis of compensation has therefore not changed but each individual case must be looked at on its merits with the aim of establishing what the actual loss is.</p>
	<p pid=".176W.5/3">The Valuation and Lands Agency (VLA) act on behalf of Water Service in the assessment of wayleave compensation. In most cases the compensation amount is agreed between VLA and the landowner or his agent. If agreement is not possible the landowner then has the option of referring the matter to the Lands Tribunal for Northern Ireland.</p>

A total of 258 convictions over the last 10 years for the murder, manslaughter or infanticide of a child under two by its parent have been identified. Of those, a total of 72 relate to persons still serving a custodial sentence. These will be accorded the utmost priority. Currently, some 365 boxes of evidence relating to 52 high priority cases have been recovered from central storage and dispatched to CPS areas for them to conduct an initial review. The remaining high priority cases are being recovered from the areas themselves.</p>

Once that stage has been reached and more information is known on these cases it will be possible for me to write further to you with additional information.</p>

	<p pid=".183W.2/1">Information on the awareness of young people of the Connexions service has been obtained from two recent Department for Education and Skills research studies.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.2/2">In 2002, the Youth Cohort Study found that 51 per cent. of young people were aware of a Connexions service in their area. Of those, slightly more females said they were aware of a Connexions Service in this area (53 per cent. compared to 50 per cent. of males). Just over one-third of non-white respondents claimed awareness (36 per cent.) compared with 53 per cent. of white respondents.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.2/3">In 2003, a customer satisfaction survey of 16,000 young people found that awareness of Connexions was generally high. 92 per cent. of both male and female respondents contacted said they had heard of the service. For minority ethnic groups, awareness levels were 88 per cent. compared with 93 per cent. for white respondents. Young people aged 16&ndash;17 had the highest levels of awareness (94 per cent.), followed by 13 to 15-year-olds (92 per cent.) with those over 18 (89 per cent.) being the least aware of the service.</p>

	<p pid=".185W.2/2" class="indent">1.

Connexions partnerships undertake a comprehensive annual self-assessment of their performance which is based on the document &quot;Connexions Partnerships: A Framework for Inspection&mdash;April 2002&quot;. One of the key criteria addressed is the overall quality of advice given by personal advisers. Areas for improvement are identified and addressed by improvement actions in the following year's business plan. Currently progress against these improvement actions is monitored on a quarterly basis by the Government Office.</p>
	<p pid=".185W.2/4" class="indent">3. The independent element of scrutiny of personal advisers' practice is provided by the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) over a four-yearly cycle. Ofsted make judgements about the partnership, using the seven key questions within the Ofsted inspection framework. Within this framework Key Question 4 assesses the effectiveness of Connexions practice, assessment, support, teaching and guidance and contains a specific quality statement that addresses the quality of impartial information, advice and guidance provided to young people by personal advisers. Following the report of Ofsted's findings, partnerships are required to address any issues arising from the inspection in an action plan. Progress against this action plan is again monitored by the Government Office.</p>

	<p pid=".186W.5/1">Although Connexions Partnerships provide us with the numbers of personal advisers they have recruited, they are not required to provide data on the numbers who have been subject to List 99 and Criminal Records Bureau checks. To do so would serve no purpose as it is a legal requirement for employers to ensure that personal advisers have been subjected to completed List 99 checks before they can come into direct contact with young people. We also require Partnerships to ensure a Criminal Records Bureau check is completed for all Connexions staff working with young people.</p>

	<p pid=".186W.11/1">In October 2002, we published our first strategy for engaging the Voluntary and Community Sector [VCS] in Connexions. We have made considerable progress since then in working with the VCS:</p>

	<p pid=".186W.11/3" class="indent">There has been an increase in the number of personal advisers based within, or coming from, the VCS. Recent figures show that around 13 per cent. of Connexions personal advisers came from the VCS.</p>

	<p pid=".186W.11/5" class="indent">Most partnerships have at least one full-time VCS co-ordinator or development worker.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.11/6" class="indent">A working group, composed of representatives from the VCS, has been working with the Connexions Service National Unit advising on operational issues as they affect the sector, and sharing good practice.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.11/7">An updated strategy, &quot;Involving the Voluntary and Community Sector in Connexions: Strategy and Guidance 2004&ndash;05&quot; will be published later this month. This document was developed jointly with the VCS and is endorsed by the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services.</p>
	<p pid=".186W.11/8">From April 2004, Connexions Partnerships will also be required to work with local VCS partners and other organisations to develop a clear and systematic local strategy for the involvement of the VCS in service design, planning, delivery and evaluation.</p>

	<p pid=".193W.5/1">My Department has an on-going relationship with the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA), with whom we are in discussion on the issue of holiday pricing. ABTA advises that if parents book early, discounts may be made available for holidays out of term time. We also know that some local education authorities work in partnership with local tour operators to offer incentives to parents to take their children on holiday outside term time. Good practice on this issue is available at: <a href="http://www.dfes.gov/schoolattendance">www.dfes.gov/schoolattendance</a> I am currently considering how this good practice could be implemented in all areas.</p>

The average waiting time for payment to learning providers in cases where validation checks have proved complex is some 17 months. This takes into account procedures for obtaining sufficiently robust evidence from both learning providers and learners to ensure the propriety of payments from the public purse and lengthy settlement negotiations.</p>

	<p pid=".196W.3/1">The Education Act 1996 places duties on local education authorities (LEAs) and all LEA-maintained schools to identify, assess and make suitable provision to meet children's special educational needs (SEN), including the SEN of children with profound and multiple learning difficulties. In doing so, maintained schools and LEAs must have regard to the SEN Code of Practice, which gives practical guidance on identifying and meeting children's SEN, covering all areas of need&mdash;communication and interaction; cognition and learning; behaviour, emotional and social development and sensory and physical needs.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.3/2">The Government's new SEN Strategy &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;, launched on 11 February, will build on the improvements to the statutory framework brought about by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act and the SEN Code of Practice, both 2001. Children with Profound and Multiple Learning Disabilities will benefit particularly from the proposals in the Strategy to improve early support for children with special needs from birth, to improve multi-agency working throughout education and in the transition to adult life, and to transform special schools, giving them an important role to play in providing education for children with the most severe and complex needs and sharing their specialist skills and knowledge with mainstream schools to provide children with a range of inclusive experiences.</p>
	<p pid=".196W.3/3">My Department has strengthened the rights of people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities (LDD), including those with profound and multiple learning disabilities, to appropriate post-16 provision through a combination of legislative change and collaborative work with key organisations representing disabled learners. Under Section 13 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has a specific responsibility to help young people and adults with LDD. Although the LSC does not develop policies relating to specific groups of learners, its broad remit means that it can fund a wide range of provision to ensure these learners have access to suitable provision which meets their needs and, where appropriate, the additional support they require to undertake it.</p>

Over the last 10 years, a total of 258 convictions over the last 10 years for the murder, manslaughter or infanticide of a child under two by its parent have been identified. Of those, a total of 72 relate to persons still serving a custodial sentence. These will be accorded the utmost priority. Currently, some 365 boxes of evidence relating to 52 high priority cases have been recovered from central storage and dispatched to CPS areas for them to conduct an initial review. The remaining high priority cases are being recovered from the areas themselves.</p>

These differences of opinion may result in a loss of focus on the welfare of the child. In order to keep the child's safety and welfare as the primary focus of all professional activity, this Guidance refers to the 'fabrication or induction of illness in a child by a carer' rather than using a particular term. If, as a result of a carer's behaviour, there is concern that the child is likely to suffer significant harm, this guidance should be followed. The key issue is not what term to use to describe this type of abuse, but the impact of fabricated or induced illness on the child's health and development, and consideration of how best to safeguard the child's welfare.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".204W.0/1">The following annex lists the schools and academies that, to our knowledge, are being built or are scheduled to be built in the near future.</p>
	<p pid=".204W.0/2">However, as the majority of capital funding is now allocated to local education authorities by formula, so that they can fund locally agreed priorities, the Department does not collect detailed information about all new schools being built within an authority. Therefore additional information on this should be held locally.</p>
	<p pid=".204W.0/3">Overall capital investment is set to rise from &pound;3.8 billion this year to over &pound;5 billion in 2005&ndash;06, compared to under &pound;700 million in 1996&ndash;97. Within the overall funding for 2003&ndash;04, &pound;512 million has been allocated on the basis of demonstrated basic need (new pupil places). However, it is for local education authorities to decide whether or not they need to build a new school in order to accommodate all pupils in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".204W.0/4">The hon. Member will be aware that we have just announced successful projects for the first wave of the Building Schools for the Future programme, which aims to rebuild or renew all secondary schools within a 10&ndash;15 year period.</p>

	<p pid=".205W.5/1">The minimum funding guarantee, which is part of the package of measures to restore stability and certainty to school funding over the next two years announced by the Secretary of State on 29 October, specifically recognises that schools with falling rolls have fixed costs for items such as cleaning, repairs and heating which do not reduce when pupil numbers go down. Such schools are guaranteed a per pupil funding increase in 2004&ndash;05 of more than 4 per cent., which is our guaranteed increase for schools where numbers do not change. In addition, LEAs can have safety nets in their local funding formulae to assist schools with falling rolls, and the mechanism which provides revenue support grant to authorities has one year data lag built into it designed to assist LEAs with overall falling rolls in their schools.</p>

	<p pid=".206W.6/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 12 February 2004</p>
	<p pid=".206W.6/2">The Government are committed to improving the attainment of all 11 to 14-year-olds through the Key Stage 3 National Strategy which is central to our wider plans for transforming secondary education. The strategy aims to improve the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom by investing in teachers' professional development.</p>
	<p pid=".206W.6/3">The strategy is starting to make a significant impact on standards after only one full year of implementation. The 2003 Key Stage 3 test results stand as the best ever on record with improvements in every subject and at every level. OFSTED have also endorsed the positive impact of the strategy and that it has been welcomed by teachers. Our priority is to build on the gains so far by further embedding the strategy, tackling under performance and supporting teachers in tailoring teaching and learning to better meet the needs of pupils and so personalise their learning experience.</p>

	<p pid=".208W.2/1">No central record is kept of the outcomes for all young people with special educational needs (SEN) who attended mainstream or special schools. However, my Department has commissioned a longitudinal study of the post-16 transitions of young people with SEN. Wave one, which took place between January 2000 and September 2001 when the young people in the study were still aged 15&ndash;16, found that more mainstream school pupils with SEN wanted to look for a job at the end of their compulsory schooling than special school pupils (28 per cent. as against 16 per cent.). The results from wave two of the study will be published in the spring and a wave three has been commissioned. These waves will show the development of any differential employment outcomes as between mainstream and special school pupils.</p>
	<p pid=".208W.2/2">The new SEN strategy &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;, launched on 11 February, announced cross-Government action to improve the opportunities for progression beyond school for young people with SEN. A multi-agency group has been established to take this work forward and promoting employment as an aim in planning for the futures of almost all young people with SEN is one of the main objectives of this group. The group's work will take account of the findings of the SEN longitudinal study.</p>

	<p pid=".209W.8/1">Most borrowers who started their course from the 1998/99 academic year will repay income-contingent loans. Loans for those who started their course before 1998/99 are repayable on a mortgage-style basis. There are differences in the repayment terms for the two types of loan.</p>
	<p pid=".209W.8/2">Borrowers enter repayment status in the April following graduation or otherwise upon leaving their course. There were 1,492,000 student loan borrowers in the United Kingdom in repayment status at the end of the end of the financial year 2002&ndash;03. Of these, some 815,000 borrowers had mortgage-style accounts that were up to date with repayments, or income-contingent accounts which are repaid through the tax system.</p>

	<p pid=".209W.8/4">No repayments are collected from income-contingent borrowers whose income falls below &pound;10,000 per annum. Repayments of income-contingent loans are collected through the tax system and are notified to the Student Loans Company after the end of the tax year for reconciliation with their records. Therefore the data on the number of borrowers with income-contingent loans, where repayments have not been deducted because the borrower's income is below the repayment threshold, are not yet available.</p>
	<p pid=".209W.8/5">The income-contingent loan repayment system takes into account whether the borrower is in receipt of disability related benefits, and whether they are covered by the Repayment of Teacher Loans scheme. Loans are cancelled: when the borrower reaches 65 years of age; if the borrower is in receipt of a disability related benefit and is permanently unfit for work; or if the borrower dies.</p>

	<p pid=".225W.5/1">Generally speaking asylum seekers are not allowed to work in the United Kingdom while their claim for asylum is being processed. The Government are aware that some applicants use the asylum system as an alternative route for economic migration and we believe it is vital to discourage this and to send out a message that we will not tolerate abuse of the asylum system.</p>
	<p pid=".225W.5/2">Until 23 July 2002 asylum seekers who had not received an initial decision on their asylum claim within six months of its being lodged could seek exceptional permission to work under the terms of the employment concession. No detailed statistics were kept on the number of asylum seekers given permission to work under the terms of the concession and the type of job they wished to undertake.</p>
	<p pid=".225W.5/3">This concession has now been withdrawn. It is our policy to speed up the length of time asylum seekers are awaiting a decision on their status. The latest published figures show that 81 per cent. <sup>1</sup> <sup>,</sup> <sup>2</sup> of applications received in the period April to June 2003 had initial decisions reached and served within two months <sup>3</sup> , compared with 75 per cent. for the previous quarter. Proposals in the Asylum and Immigration Bill currently before Parliament will simplify and speed up the appeals process. In this context, we feel it is inappropriate for asylum seekers of any occupation to work.</p>

Currently accommodation will be provided to Kurds from the Kurdish Autonomous Zone of Iraq because until recently there was no viable route of return. Now that Kurds from Iraq can leave under the Voluntary Assisted Return and Reintegration Programme the policy of providing accommodation is being reviewed. It is possible for nationals of Zimbabwe and Somalia to make a voluntary return and accommodation will be provided only where they are seeking to return but cannot do so immediately.

	<p pid=".231W.0/3">We have also put in place key principles to guide the Court when determining the seriousness of the offence and the severity of the resulting sentence. The most important of these is that previous convictions (where they are recent and relevant) should be treated as an aggravating factor when determining sentence severity.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.0/4">The courts must treat offences as aggravated, for sentencing purposes, where the victim's race, religion, sexual orientation or disability has been a contributing factor.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.0/5">The Act establishes a new Sentencing Guidelines Council whose role will be to promote consistent sentencing and which will be responsible for issuing guidelines on sentencing for the range of criminal offences.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.0/6">Magistrates will be able to sentence offenders for terms of imprisonment of up to 12 months instead of the current six months maximum.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.0/7">The Act provides a new indeterminate sentence for dangerous offenders, which means such an offender can be kept in custody until the Parole Board assesses him as presenting a risk which is manageable in the community.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.0/8">We are transforming the structure of short prison sentences so that they will be more effective at addressing the needs of offenders. New custodial sentences of less than 12 months will consist of a short 'custodial period' of between two weeks and three months followed by a 'licence period' of at least six months.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.0/9">The Act introduces intermittent custody for low risk offenders where the term of imprisonment is between 28 and 51 weeks duration. Intermittent custody allows for the sentence to be served either during weekdays or weekends, so that offenders can maintain jobs and relationships that contribute to rehabilitation.</p>
	<p pid=".231W.0/10">The generic community sentence will allow sentencers a much greater degree of flexibility in putting together tough community sentences that will be tailored to the needs of offenders at any level of seriousness. Where a court decides to impose a community sentence this can be tailored to fit the individual and may include an order to perform unpaid work or specific activities. It may also include exclusion orders or orders for treatment for drug or alcohol abuse.</p>

	<p pid=".234W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 5 February 2004</p>
	<p pid=".234W.2/2">The Hillingdon judgment mainly concerns the availability of leaving care services for former unaccompanied asylum seeking children who have turned 18. Funding for leaving care services is provided by the Department for Education and Skills. My right hon. friend, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced on 19 November 2003 that an additional &pound;10 million would be made available from 2004&ndash;05 to top up the existing funding for care leavers.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.2/3">The Home Office provides funding for the support of unaccompanied asylum seeking children aged under 18 through an annual grant to local authorities. The unit cost rates for 2003&ndash;04 were announced in a letter from the Director of NASS to local authorities on 15 January. For those aged 16 and 17 the rate is &pound;300 per child per week. This represents a 15 per cent. increase over the previous year. For those aged 15 and under the rate is &pound;670 per child per week, an increase of 17 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".234W.2/4">The arrangements announced on 15 January also allow for authorities who believe they have incurred significant additional costs to seek to have their level of grant considered under special circumstances arrangements. It is not possible to specify the amounts any authority will receive until these processes are complete. I would expect authorities receiving higher numbers of unaccompanied asylum seeking children, for example those with major air or sea ports in their area, to seek additional funding under these arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".235W.2/1">A requirement for carriers to provide copies of travel documents would enable quicker determination of genuine identity, thereby speeding up processing times for asylum claims, which reduces detention and support costs. This would also assist with the redocumentation and removal process for those passengers who subsequently make unfounded asylum claims. The application of such a power should also deter a number of unfounded asylum applicants and illegal entrants from travelling to the UK in the first place. The proposed targeted approach of this power would allow effort to be concentrated on routes and areas of greatest concern. We are discussing with the airlines proposals for a voluntary trial scheme, whose results will help to establish how the new power would be most effective.</p>

In combination, we are strengthening action against illegal working. The Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants) Bill, currently before Parliament, will create a new offence of trafficking for exploitation, including forced labour, with a maximum penalty of 14 years. We intend to strengthen the document checks employers are required to carry out under section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. We have been active tackling issues related to gangmasters and support the objectives set out in the Gangmasters (Licensing) Bill introduced by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1221" name="Jim Sheridan">the hon.

Work supplementary to that for which the permit is issued is also subject to this restriction. Overseas nurses are free to use the services of employment agencies and similar types of business to search for further employment opportunities, but it is for the employer, not the agency, that should apply for the work permit.</p>

	<p pid=".243W.0/1">The national Persistent Offender Scheme that came into effect in April 2003 defines a Core Persistent Offender as &quot;someone who is 18 or over and has been convicted of six or more recordable offences in the last 12 months&quot;. The definition was developed in order to provide an objective test of persistent offending that can be applied across the criminal justice system. However the scheme recognises that there are individuals who do not meet this definition, who may be suspected of being prolific offenders on the basis of local intelligence. Therefore Local Criminal Justice Areas have the flexibility also to apply persistent offender strategies to &quot;Local Persistent Offenders&quot;, identified on the basis of local intelligence and priorities, which could include issues of particular relevance to rural areas.</p>

	<p pid=".243W.3/1">The total number of accidents involving police vehicles in England and Wales is given in the table. The number of police and civilian fatalities arising from police responses to immediate/emergency calls and pursuits are also separately shown.</p>
	<p pid=".243W.3/2">The Government welcome the recognition by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) that they must work to reduce the number of collisions involving police vehicles.</p>
	<p pid=".243W.3/3">Measures already in place include a new police driver training course, launched in December 2000, which introduced a universal standard for driving in England and Wales. An essential element of the course is that officers should recognise the need to give priority to public safety above all other considerations such as attending an incident or apprehending a suspect.</p>
	<p pid=".243W.3/4">Where pursuits are concerned, there is a nationally agreed ACPO Pursuit Code of Practice and it is already police policy to consider continuously the consequences of a pursuit and whether to break it off.</p>
	<p pid=".243W.3/5">ACPO are working closely with the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) to identify how police vehicle collisions might be avoided. Useful information can be expected from the increasing use by forces of Automatic Data Recorders (ADR) and Vehicle Accident Data Recorders (VADR). These operate in a similar way to aircraft black boxes, providing data on such issues as speed, gear changes, breaking, and the use of blue lights.</p>

	<p pid=".248W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 10 February 2004</p>
	<p pid=".248W.2/2">In December 2002 new procedures for reporting self-injury were introduced in prisons in England and Wales. The evidence suggests that much of the increase in reported self-harm in 2003 may result from this rather than an actual increase in the incidence of self-harm.</p>
	<p pid=".248W.2/3">Beyond that, the reasons for any increase in prisoner self-harm may be related to the fact that the prison population includes a large number of prisoners with a combination of psychiatric disorders, alcohol and drug dependency, family background and relationship problems, histories of self-harm and previous abuse, all of which raise their risk of suicide and self-harm. Additionally, the current operating environment is very challenging because an increased prisoner population and movement of prisoners puts a strain on resources and makes it more challenging to prevent suicides and self-harm. Long-term trends suggest that self-inflicted deaths have been increasing since 1988, broadly in line with the increase in prison population.</p>
	<p pid=".248W.2/4">A number of intervention strategies have been introduced into establishments for people who self-harm. These include counselling, support groups, and specialised psychological interventions. A network of establishments has been set up to develop interventions, facilitate evaluation and share good practice, and guidance to staff on managing people who self-harm has been circulated to establishments.</p>

	<p pid=".249W.5/2">All customers, including those leaving prison, may make a Housing Benefit claim up to 13 weeks in advance. Where there is continuous good cause for delay customers may also apply for their Housing Benefit to be backdated. We have no plans to change these arrangements at present.</p>
	<p pid=".249W.5/3">Jobcentre Plus currently assist released prisoners by waiving labour market conditions for the first seven days of their claim and by providing pre-arranged work focused interviews through the Freshstart initiative. As many Housing Benefit applications are linked to claims for Jobseekers Allowance or Income Support, this helps to ensure that Housing Benefit claims are made as early as possible.</p>

	<p pid=".253W.0/1">Arrangements for the issuing of visas are specific to the individual visa issuing Post and are influenced by factors such as the level of demand, and local security situation. Applicants may lodge applications online, in person or by courier service or post. Visa sections may return successful applicants' passports by courier service, or return their endorsed passport to them in person. In the US the visa issuing Posts in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York accept applications made on-line, by post or in person. Visa sections in non-EU or non-Commonwealth countries may operate any one or more of these methods.</p>
	<p pid=".253W.0/2">US Nationals are not visa nationals and are therefore only obliged to apply for entry clearance to the UK in specific categories, as set out in the Immigration Rules or if coming to the UK for longer than six months. Visa nationals, which include certain non-EU and non-Commonwealth citizens, are required to obtain entry clearance to enter the UK for any period or purpose. Whether applying for entry clearance or not, the same conditions, as set out in the Immigration Rules, apply to all non-EU or non-Commonwealth nationals.</p>

	<p pid=".263W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 10 February 2004</p>
	<p pid=".263W.2/2">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced in January 2002 a suspension of removals of failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe. This was in response to concerns about the serious deterioration in the situation in Zimbabwe in the build-up to the presidential election held in March that year. We did not, at that time, regard it as unsafe to return failed asylum seekers to Zimbabwe, but in view of the rapidly changing conditions we considered that it would be appropriate not to enforce returns.</p>
	<p pid=".263W.2/3">The Government's position is, as it has been since January 2002, that each asylum (and human rights) claim made by a Zimbabwean national will be considered on its individual merits in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Each application is considered against the background of the latest available country information including that obtained from and through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>
	<p pid=".263W.2/4">We do of course recognise that conditions in Zimbabwe are such that there are individuals who are able to demonstrate a need for international protection. Where they meet the definition of a refugee in the 1951 convention, asylum is granted. There may also be individuals whose circumstances make them particularly vulnerable and who would engage our obligations under the ECHR. Where this is the case these individuals will be granted humanitarian protection or discretionary leave.</p>
	<p pid=".263W.2/5">In the first nine months of last year, we granted asylum to 755 Zimbabweans and granted other forms of protection to 30 others. These statistics show that we are giving protection to the significant number of people who are found to be in need of it.</p>
	<p pid=".263W.2/6">If an application is refused, there will be a right of appeal to the independent appellate authorities against that decision. Should a claim be refused and any appeal be unsuccessful that means that, for that individual, return to Zimbabwe would be safe. That is why we consider it reasonable to expect an individual in that position to leave voluntarily.</p>
	<p pid=".263W.2/7">However, although it would be safe for failed asylum seekers to return to Zimbabwe, our view at present is that in the wider context of the Government's position on Zimbabwe, it would be inappropriate forcibly to return them at this time. The exceptions we would make to that policy are in cases where a failed asylum seeker had a serious criminal record or their presence in the United Kingdom was not otherwise conducive to the public good. In such circumstances enforced return to Zimbabwe would be considered by Ministers on a case by case basis.</p>
	<p pid=".263W.2/8">The policy remains under continuous review.</p>

	<p pid=".273W.9/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 28 January 2004</p>
	<p pid=".273W.9/2">On 18 September 2003 we announced new investment totalling &pound;65.2 million for dentistry. This consisted of &pound;35 million capital for dental access and quality, &pound;30 million for dental information technology and &pound;200,000 for developing dental leadership. This was on top of revenue funding we announced in August of &pound;9 million for targeted support on dental access and &pound;1 million for organisation development. We subsequently announced on 25 November further revenue funding of &pound;15 million to support access for patients to a modernised national health service dental service, bringing the total of new funding announced this year for dentistry to &pound;90.2 million.</p>
	<p pid=".273W.9/3">The &pound;30 million investment in IT will facilitate integration of dental practices with wider NHS information technology systems and will support local contracting. The IT investment and solutions for dentistry consistent with other NHS information technology initiatives are being taken forward within the national programme for IT.</p>
	<p pid=".273W.9/4">The funding of &pound;200,000 for developing dental leadership is aimed at strategic health authority level to support primary care trusts (PCTs) in delivering the modernisation agenda for dentistry.</p>
	<p pid=".273W.9/5">The organisational development funds of &pound;1 million are being distributed in line with advice from strategic health authorities (SHAs). They are intended to help PCTs, local dental committees and dentists to prepare for the change in the way dental services are commissioned. &pound;0.3 million has been distributed for 2003&ndash;04 and the remaining &pound;0.7 million will be distributed for use in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".273W.9/6">The balance of &pound;59 million is intended to support dental access and quality as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".273W.9/7" class="indent">&pound;9 million is for the NHS dentistry support team that has been set up to work with those areas where it is hardest to find a NHS dentist. These funds are being used in a targeted way to support local action plans for improving access to dentistry. The NHS support team has identified 16 PCTs with specific dental access issues. Funding for these PCTs, which are shown in the list, will take into account the challenge faced by the individual PCTs and the potential benefit of the proposals in the dental action plan that each of the challenged PCTs is developing. Draft plans are now starting to arrive. The team allocated &pound;200,000 in 2003&ndash;04, and will be increasing the pace of allocations early in 2004&ndash;05, based on the plans currently in preparation.</p>
	<p pid=".273W.9/8" class="indent">&pound;35 million capital funds are to enable PCTs to invest in primary care premises and facilities to improve access and quality. These funds will be distributed on a fair-shares basis at SHA level and then on a targeted basis to PCTs on the advice of the SHAs. The fair shares for SHAs are shown in the table. The bulk of the funds will be spent in 2004&ndash;05 to allow SHAs and PCTs to plan for its investment.</p>
	<p pid=".273W.9/9" class="indent">&pound;15 million revenue funding for 2O04&ndash;05 to support access will also be allocated on a fair-shares basis at SHA level and, on the advice of the SHA, on a targeted basis to PCTs. The SHA fair shares allocations of these funds are shown in the table.</p>
	<p pid=".273W.9/10">Guidance for PCTs on commissioning NHS dentistry, including the allocation of &pound;35 million capital and &pound;15 million revenue to support access, quality and choice was issued on 15 January. The guidance makes it clear that access remains a key priority in the run up to the new arrangements for dentistry from April 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".275W.2/1">We are committed to rebuilding and restoring national health service dentistry to improve oral health. The report, &quot;NHS Dentistry: Options for Change&quot;, published in 2002, set out the ideas and principles behind the reform of NHS dentistry. Central to these changes are the aims of:</p>
	<p pid=".275W.2/2" class="indent">local commissioning of services offering care which is responsive to local need;</p>
	<p pid=".275W.2/3" class="indent">moving away from the restrictions of the detailed and inflexible existing fee-for-item system and giving dentists the opportunity to practise more preventive dentistry;</p>
	<p pid=".275W.2/4" class="indent">improving the patient experience;</p>
	<p pid=".275W.2/5" class="indent">improving access to NHS dentistry.</p>
	<p pid=".275W.2/6">New legislation in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 will enable these changes and will underpin a modernised, high-quality primary dental service, properly integrated with the rest of the NHS. The aim is to deliver better access to services; better working lives for dentists and their teams, better oral health and an improved patient experience. From 1 April 2005, primary care trusts (PCTs) will assume a new responsibility for commissioning dental services supported by the &pound;1.2 billion resources currently held centrally.</p>
	<p pid=".275W.2/7">The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act also provides for the replacement of the existing Dental Practice Board by a new special health authority for England and Wales with a wider remit for modernisation and change. This is likely to happen in 2005. In the meantime, shadow arrangements are in place to work in partnership with the existing Dental Practice Board to lead the modernisation process and provide support to PCTs and dentists to ensure a smooth transition to the new arrangements. Discussions are also on-going with the dental profession on the base contract, which will replace the item of service arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".275W.2/8">In Hampshire, each PCT has identified a dental management lead who has been working closely with the strategic health authority dental lead and the Department of Health to prepare dental action plans for the transition to local commissioning of dentistry. In agreement with the Department, arrangements have been made for some dental practices that wish to do so&mdash;including one in Portsmouth&mdash;to act as pilots for future contracting arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".276W.5/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer 29 January 2004</p>
	<p pid=".276W.5/2">I assume that the hon. Member is referring to funding for community equipment services. These are funded in the following manner: all local health and social services have historic funding streams for these services. At the beginning of the initiative to integrate and modernise these services we announced that we were increasing baseline funding to the National Health Service and councils to enable them to participate. We gave the NHS an extra &pound;105 million over the years 2001&ndash;02 to 2003&ndash;04 and made a substantial addition to councils' personal social services allocation (following normal practice, the amount of the latter was not announced). Councils with social services responsibilities are also now receiving even more funding for community equipment through the systems and access capacity grant, starting with &pound;7.6 million this year, with considerable rises due in 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06. In all cases, local service commissioners decide how to use that funding to meet the needs of their local populations and this element of their spending is not monitored centrally.</p>

	<p pid=".283W.3/1">Junior doctors receive a banding supplement reflecting the amount and intensity of their out of hours work. When junior doctors contract for a rotation they are made aware of the bandings of the posts they will be working in. As circumstances change, posts may be adjusted and rebanded and the pay for new entrants to such posts may reduce to a level commensurate with the work undertaken. However, for those already contracted to fill those posts, rotation pay protection (built into the national contract for all doctors in training) applies.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.3/2">National health service trusts are responsible for ensuring that appropriate rotation and salary arrangements are in place for junior doctors, in line with national guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.3/3">Under those arrangements, there is regular monitoring to ensure that rotas are satisfactory, that junior doctors hours are within agreed limits and that safe services are provided.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.3/4">Great Ormond Street has these arrangements in place and policies and procedures under which any concerns can be raised and addressed.</p>

	<p pid=".287W.11/1">The information is not available in the form requested. A survey of psychiatric morbidity among prisoners in England and Wales in 1997, by the Office for National Statistics, showed that 90 per cent. of prisoners have at least one significant mental health problem, including personality disorder, psychosis, neurosis, alcohol misuse and drug dependence. Around 5,000 people in prison at any one time have a severe mental illness though they will not all be acutely ill.</p>
	<p pid=".287W.11/2">Prisons and their national health service primary care trust partners are responsible for assessing the health needs of their populations and developing services, including mental health services to meet those needs. NHS funded prison mental health in reach teams will be providing services in 90 prisons by March 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".291W.2/1">It is not possible to estimate a figure for the number of nurse practitioners required, as ensuring compliance with the working time directive (WTD) requires a range of different approaches in different trusts and services, only some of which will require nurse practitioners to be employed.</p>
	<p pid=".291W.2/2">The 20 WTD pilot projects currently in progress include seven employing nurse practitioners and five more which have developed senior specialist nurse roles. Examples of these are nurses trained as first assistants in surgery, as perioperative surgical practitioners, as specialist mental health nurses, and as pre-admission nurses. These pilots have shown that nurse practitioners and nurses in specialist roles can be extremely effective at both helping a trust to achieve compliant rotas and improving the quality of patient care. In all of these pilots, however, the nurses' roles are combined with changes to medical staff working patterns, and changes to service delivery, which together improve WTD compliance.</p>

	<p pid=".292W.8/1">National action to improve services for people with osteoporosis is being taken forward through the work of the orthopaedic services improvement team, part of the National Health Service Modernisation Agency, and implementation of the national service framework (NSF) for older people. The prevention, treatment, care and support of those at risk of osteoporosis are important components in the delivery of the integrated falls services that the NSF requires to be in place locally by April 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.8/2">In the South West, the responsibility for commissioning services for people with osteoporosis rests with individual primary care trusts. Local programmes are being developed as part of the NSF to improve services for older people and prevent falls, which includes action on osteoporosis. For example, in South Devon an initiative called Osteoporosis South Devon was launched in October 2002 and is a new service for primary and secondary care to identify those at higher risk of osteoporosis.</p>
	<p pid=".292W.8/3">Action is also being taken across the region to prevent the onset of osteoporosis. To this end, a South West regional physical activity group has been set up, which is developing a sport and physical activity plan for the South West.</p>

	<p pid=".294W.2/2">The national programme for information technology is responsible for introducing the National Health Service care record service (NHS CRS), which will lead to the NHS having an integrated, electronic record management service for the first time. The NHS CRS will provide each patient with a single, comprehensive set of electronic medical and care notes. This will enable all authorised clinicians involved with the care of a patient, to see and share health information. Local practices and hospitals will continue to hold detailed local records, but additionally a summary health record will be created containing essential data such as allergies, current treatments or medication.</p>
	<p pid=".294W.2/3">The NHS CRS will also ensure that key data and information is entered only once and then available to multiple users and professionals who are authorised to access. It will support better clinical decision making, remove the need for repeat and potentially harmful tests simply because the previous record is lost or not available and improve the quality of the time spent with the patient.</p>
	<p pid=".294W.2/4">The security and confidentiality of patient information is an absolute priority in the context of electronic records and transmissions. Within the contracts for new applications, systems and services being negotiated with IT suppliers are stringent terms around ensuring security, control, alerts and audit measures, including encryption. We will have a right to terminate the contract of any supplier that fails to deliver the high standards that NHS patients and professionals are entitled to expect.</p>

	<p pid=".295W.2/1">The electronic transmission of prescriptions is one of the core programmes within the national programme for information technology (NPflT) in the national health service in England. The electronic transmission of prescriptions (ETP) programme will enable prescribers to create and transfer prescription data electronically to a patient's community pharmacist and the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA). As well as being more convenient for the patient (for example in relation to repeat prescriptions), this will improve safety by reducing prescription errors and providing better information at the point of prescribing and dispensing. It will also ensure that information about what has been prescribed and dispensed forms part of each person's NHS care record. In addition, ETP will deliver important administrative improvements.</p>
	<p pid=".295W.2/2">The NHS Plan did not contain a specific target in relation to the electronic transmission of prescriptions. We are working towards the timetable for implementation contained in &quot;Delivering 21st Century IT Support in the NHS&quot;. This stated, &quot;the National Prescriptions Service will be 50 per cent. implemented by December 2005 and fully implemented by December 2007&quot;. This work is being taken forward by the NPfIT in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".295W.2/3">Key elements of the electronic transmission of prescriptions system have been procured as part of the recently concluded NHS care records service procurements. Work is now focusing on how community pharmacies can be connected to the system, and how their pharmacy computer systems can be upgraded to comply with the requisite technical specification. It is intended that deployment of the live system will commence in January 2005.</p>

	<p pid=".299W.2/1">It is not possible to assess the resource implications for local government or national health service organisations in relation to the requirement for overview and scrutiny committees to be consulted on changes to national NHS services, since each circumstance will lead to a different set of arrangements. It is right that substantial changes are appropriately consulted upon and that both local government and the NHS treat that consultation as a priority for local people affected by any proposed change. Local government and the NHS locally should set aside funding to ensure that such changes do receive rigorous consultation to ensure local people's interests are taken into consideration.</p>

The Department is making a one-off payment to the Centre for Public Scrutiny to undertake a programme of work to support and enable health scrutiny by local government. Part of the three-year programme will be to put in place an evaluation of health scrutiny, including health service consultations, and to assess the outcomes for local people resulting from the input of overview and scrutiny committees.</p>

	<p pid=".302W.2/1">There are no plans to impose a general restriction on the prescription of unlicensed medicines to children.</p>
	<p pid=".302W.2/2">Most medicines have only been tested for safe and effective use in the adult population and there are comparatively few medicines on the market that are specifically licensed for the treatment of children. This leads to prescribers having no option but to prescribe unlicensed and off-label medications in this patient population.</p>
	<p pid=".302W.2/3">Normally, if a product has not been licensed for use in children because of a lack of clinical trial data and/or clinical experience, the summary of product characteristics contains statements to this effect and use in children is not recommended. However, further restrictions (contraindications) have been introduced with respect to the off-label or unlicensed use of specific medicinal products where there is evidence that the benefit/risk may be unfavourable.</p>
	<p pid=".302W.2/4">The real solution to this problem lies not in restricting paediatric prescribing but in stimulating the development and testing of appropriately formulated medicines for use in the paediatric population. It is expected that the European Commission will adopt a proposal for a Regulation on medicines for paediatric use by the end of April 2004. It will contain a number of incentives and obligations to stimulate the development of medicines for children. In the mean time officials have been asked to develop a UK strategy to deliver, in the short and medium term, improved availability of medicines that are appropriately labelled and appropriately formulated for use in children.</p>

The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors that control for tenure type, council tax band and a number of demographic variables.

This may involve focus group research among representatives of the target audience and clearance by the relevant broadcast standards authorities. The process can also involve Departmental consultation with key stakeholders such as Help The Aged or Age Concern.

	<p pid=".308W.2/2">The Learning and Development provided for casual staff varies according to the job role and work undertaken by the individual. For example, those dealing with customers receive training linked to serving customers, keeping safe, equal opportunities, data protection and interviewing skills. More informal training includes working with, and observing more experienced colleagues and coaching from subject experts and line managers. In addition, many new staff have a buddy or mentor.</p>

	<p pid=".309W.3/1">Jobcentre Plus and The Pension Service are modernising the services we provide to our customers. This modernisation is increasing the number of places where people can get information about work and benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.3/2">Jobcentre Plus is providing improved customer access through telephone contact centres, the internet and new, dedicated caller offices. The creation of new style Jobcentre Plus offices is providing customers with premises where they can make inquiries both about their benefits and about job opportunities in one place.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.3/3">The Pension Service has a network of pension centres, complemented by a local service delivered in partnership with local authorities and voluntary sector organisations. The Pension Service is meeting pensioners in their local communities, holding appointment and drop-in advice surgeries in places that they are familiar with, such as Age Concern and CAB outlets, local libraries and community centres.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.3/4">The purpose of these plans was to provide all the Department's customers in Portsmouth, Southampton and the Isles of Wight; in the South East Region; and in the country as a whole with a modern and efficient service. These services are being targeted where people need them after consultation with local welfare agencies, local authorities, MPs and others. Where necessary duplication of sites is being reduced, helping to ensure that the taxpayer gets value for money. Overall these plans are building on the high quality service already provided by social security offices and Jobcentres by delivering a service tailored to the specific needs of its customers.</p>
	<p pid=".309W.3/5">In determining the location of the new Jobcentre Plus offices a great many factors are taken into account. These factors include, but are not limited to, the population size and spread, the quality, cost and availability of local transport, the distance between offices, concentrations of our key customer groups, areas designated for urban renewal or other regeneration initiatives, employers' needs, labour market characteristics, the availability of suitable office accommodation, the cost of maintenance and disposal, and the availability of staff and ability to relocate existing local staff. In some cases we have found that industrial and demographic change has left our offices situated in less than ideal locations. This modernisation programme provides an opportunity to critically review where we can best locate our offices to deliver services to meet the needs of the local community.</p>

This advice, which we have accepted, recommends that Health and Safety Commission and Executive should instead concentrate their efforts on securing the agreement of social partners to principles and measures that will ensure that workers are properly involved in controlling risks to occupational health and safety. Today HSC is publishing its new strategy and out of this will shortly release a statement on worker involvement setting out these principles and working with social partners to win wider support.

This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus came into existence as a national organisation at the beginning of April 2002. The Benefits Agency and Employment Service ceased to exist at the same time. The new service is being rolled out across the country on a district by district basis. Over 350 integrated Jobcentre Plus offices are now operating across the country. Integrating the whole of the former Employment Service and Benefits Agency's services for people of working age and creating the national network of Jobcentre Plus offices will not be completed until 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/5" class="indent">As each district starts to plan for the introduction of the new integrated Jobcentre Plus, service delivery arrangements are shared with local stakeholders, MPs and others. The service delivery arrangements are shared at the initial proposal stage, amended to take account of comments received where appropriate, then shared again when approval for the plans has been given. This is an integral part of the planning process for the introduction of the Jobcentre Plus service across England, Wales and Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/6" class="indent">District Managers are provided with a list of suggested stakeholders for this initial planning stage. These include; local MPs/MEPs/MSPs/Members of the National Assembly of Wales, local authorities, programme providers/service delivery partners, employers, Citizens Advice Bureaux, and welfare rights organisations. This list is not exhaustive and each District Manager may identify their own local stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/7" class="indent">As part of the consultation process District Managers may also canvass the opinions of their customers and any comments they provide will be used as part of the planning process. Representations districts receive about Jobcentre Plus service delivery plans from our stakeholders can also include those representing unemployed workers and pensioners. Any concerns or issues raised by these groups as a result of the consultation process will be addressed at district level and are fed in to each districts planning before the final decision is made for roll out of Jobcentre Plus in that district.</p>
	<p pid=".313W.5/8" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus managers at all levels maintain close contact with many local and national organisations representing our client base. This enables continuous feedback concerning the services that we provide before, during and after the roll out of the new Jobcentre Plus services.</p>

	<p pid=".314W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the Chief Executive of the Jobcentre Plus, David Anderson. He will write to the hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from David Anderson to Mr. Hancock, dated 13 February 2004</p>
	<p pid=".314W.2/3" class="indent">As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning Jobcentre Plus proposals for the inner city areas of Southampton and Portsmouth. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.2/4" class="indent">Plans are currently being developed to roll out the new integrated Jobcentre Plus service in both Portsmouth and Southampton. Partners and stakeholders were originally consulted about these plans in June and September 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.2/5" class="indent">Presently, options for both cities are being vigorously pursued. While suitable premises have been identified for Portsmouth that will have the capability to deliver the enhanced services to Portsmouth customers; discussions remain commercially sensitive. Therefore, we are unable to give details of the sites under consideration. Commercial considerations also apply to Southampton, where work is ongoing.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.2/6" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is contributing to the wider DWP modernisation and efficiency agenda and the workforce planning levels agreed for Jobcentre Plus form part of this. There are no plans to change substantially the numbers of people who work in Southampton and Portsmouth Jobcentre Plus locations beyond the impact of these plans. Each Region has a share of the total Jobcentre Plus performance target with the allocation of resource budgets within Jobcentre Plus linked to expected workloads and performance targets. The headcount target for each region, and each district in that region, and each office in that district, is based on this.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.2/7" class="indent">The new Jobcentre Plus service will provide a more professional and welcoming environment. When the new Jobcentre Plus offices open, they will be to the design and furnishing standard of this new enhanced Jobcentre Plus model. Existing Jobcentre offices in Portsmouth and Southampton undergo regular quarterly health and safety inspections, where the existing furnishings are reviewed.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.2/8" class="indent">If there are any specific issues you wish to raise about these offices or if you would like to see the new specification in offices which have rolled out the new service, please contact Karen Gamester, the District Manager for Hampshire and Isle of Wight, on 01962 848887, who will be happy to assist.</p>
	<p pid=".314W.2/9" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid=".315W.2/1">The primary aim of New Deal is to help people into employment as soon as possible.

	<p pid=".315W.2/2">New Deal advisers have knowledge of the local labour market and access to a range of resources to assist them in providing appropriate advice and guidance to all New Deal participants. Resources used by advisers include: careers publications, access to the internet, links with training providers and local colleges as well as Connexions/Careers Service. Someone without the relevant qualifications to start a degree or diploma course could, for example be referred to an Access Course, which can be funded under New Deal. People interested in further or higher education would also be given advice on sources of funding such as Career Development Loans, and referred to relevant educational bodies for more detailed advice on course funding.</p>

	<p pid=".315W.5/1">The New Deal is primarily a 'jobs first' programme and its success is measured through the number of people helped into work; so far nearly one million people have been helped into employment through New Deal.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.5/2">Training programmes, and other support available through New Deal, are intended to equip people with the skills needed to compete effectively in the local labour market. Effort is made to tailor courses and other support to meet individuals' requirements but this has to be balanced against the recruitment and skills needs of local employers and the likelihood of the training improving employment prospects. In circumstances where the needs of an individual cannot be met through normal contracts with training providers, one-off courses or training provision can be purchased if this is likely to improve the person's chances of getting quickly into work.</p>
	<p pid=".315W.5/3">It is not the intention of New Deal to place people on training courses that provide them with skills they already have. However, participants on the mandatory New Deal programmes may be expected to attend courses to help address their barriers to work, for example, a two-week Gateway to Work course, which provides jobsearch and motivational support.</p>

	<p pid=".316W.8/2">We are currently in the main phase of our marketing campaign for pension credit and aim to have at least 3 million households in receipt of pension credit by 2006. By June 2004, we will have written to all pensioner households, explaining about the new entitlement. Direct mail is being supported by extensive TV and press advertising. From May we intend to focus campaign activity on those pensioners who are likely to be entitled but who have not responded. The Pension Service local service is playing a key role, particularly in encouraging pensioners who are less likely to take up their entitlement to apply. We continue to work closely with organisations such as Help the Aged and Age Concern, at both national and local level, and with local authorities.</p>

In addition, average pension credit awards are expected to be lower than minimum income guarantee because a savings credit of up to &pound;14.79 (single) or &pound;19.20 (couples) is available for people with modest incomes above the guarantee level who previously received nothing from minimum income guarantee.</p>

	<p pid=".326W.3/1">Since 1980&ndash;81 to 2001&ndash;02, the last year for which we have audited figures, sales of Housing Revenue Account (HRA) dwellings for owner occupation have generated &pound;23.490 billion in receipts for local authorities in England. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not hold records for the amount generated by sales in Southend-on-Sea for the entirety of this period, but from 1998&ndash;99 to 2001&ndash;02 the receipts generated were &pound;9.603 million.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.3/2">Currently, with-debt local authorities, such as Southend-on-Sea, are required to set aside 75 per cent. of the capital receipt arising from the disposal of HRA dwellings for the repayment of their debt. They may use the remaining 25 per cent. to meet capital expenditure. Debt-free local authorities are exempt from the set-aside requirement and may use 100 per cent. of such capital receipts for any capital purpose.</p>
	<p pid=".326W.3/3">The set-aside regime, which effectively provides resources for new capital investment by authorities generally, will cease to be available from 1 April this year, when a new capital finance system is introduced. Pooling is the regime that will replace set-aside. It will apply to debt-free as well as with-debt authorities&mdash;both will be required to pay to the Exchequer 75 per cent. of their receipts from the sale of council housing, to provide resources nationally for further capital investment in housing. They will retain 25 per cent. to meet such capital expenditure as they may decide. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister believe these arrangements are appropriate and currently has no intention of reviewing them further.</p>

	<p pid=".331W.3/1">As part of the consultation on the provisional local government finance settlement 2004&ndash;05, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister received 454 written responses from 275 individual authorities, MPs and others. A further 34 arrived after the close of consultation. Ministers also met delegations from the Local Government Association, the Association of London Government and four groups of local authorities. Parliament has now approved the settlement which provides local authorities with a 5.5 per cent. increase in general grant.</p>

Two metropolitan authorities now have been identified under these processes: Walsall, as the result of a corporate governance review, which found significant weaknesses in its financial processes; and North Tyneside, which scored the lowest possible rating for financial standing in its CPA.</p>

In common with other authorities assessed as poor, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has appointed a lead official to work closely with each authority, and is providing support at the appropriate level to achieve recovery, including thorough advice and help with capacity building.</p>
