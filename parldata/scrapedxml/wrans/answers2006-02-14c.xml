	<p pid="c.1799W.3/1">In November 1999 the CPS having consulted Treasury Counsel decided that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Abu Hamza for offences of kidnap and murder relating to an incident in the Yemen. In 2003 following a submission of further material from the police the CPS again decided that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Abu Hamza for those offences. The CPS did not consult the Attorney-General about this matter.</p>
	<p pid="c.1799W.3/2">In January 2003 police seized tapes connected with Abu Hamza, in April 2003 further tapes were seized. In November 2003 the police submitted a report concerning the tapes to the CPS. CPS advised that further police enquires should be made. In March 2004 the police submitted a further report to the CPS. In May 2004 the police seized further tapes and submitted them to the CPS.</p>
	<p pid="c.1799W.3/3">In October 2004 the CPS decided, having taken advice from Treasury Counsel, that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute Abu Hamza for soliciting to murder, incitement to racial hatred and possessing a document containing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. The evidence came from the tapes seized in May 2004 and one tape from those seized in January 2003. On this occasion the Attorney-General was consulted, agreed with the decision to prosecute and gave his consent to the prosecution of the incitement to racial hatred offence in October 2004.</p>

	<p pid="c.1800W.2/1">The changes made by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 empower a crown prosecutor, acting under guidance issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions, to determine whether, and if so what, criminal charges should be preferred against alleged offenders who have been arrested or reported for an offence by the police.</p>
	<p pid="c.1800W.2/2">The Act considerably enhances the ability of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to influence the efficient progress of casework by ensuring that the right offender is charged with the most appropriate offence.</p>

	<p pid="c.1800W.5/1">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), in partnership with the police, has established 165 witness care units across England and Wales. The units provide a single point of contact for victims and witnesses from point of charge until the conclusion of the case. Dedicated witness care officers ensure that the needs of individual victims and witnesses are identified and met so that they have all the support and information they need to enable them to attend court and to give their best evidence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1800W.5/2">As far as vulnerable and intimidated witnesses are concerned, there is the possibility of the witness meeting the prosecution team to discuss what special measures in court may be appropriate for them at trial. Research has shown that there has not been a high take-up of these meetings and the CPS will use this to encourage areas to hold them where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1800W.5/3">In addition the CPS is currently piloting pre-trial interviews with witnesses in four CPS areas. The purpose of the interview is to assess the reliability of the witness's evidence, assist the prosecutor in understanding complex evidence, and to explain the criminal process and procedures to witnesses.</p>

	<p pid="c.1802W.3/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-29">29 January 2003</phrase> the Court of Appeal overturned Sally Clark's conviction for murdering her two sons. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-19">19 January 2004</phrase> the Court of Appeal issued its judgment allowing the appeal of Angela Cannings against her convictions for murdering two of her children. On the same day the Attorney-General announced he had established a review of all convictions in the previous 10 years (1994&mdash;2004), of a parent, foster parent or carer convicted of the unlawful killing of a baby and/or infant under the age of two. A small number of cases which did not fall strictly within the parameters of the review were also included at the request of defendants or their solicitors.</p>
	<p pid="c.1802W.3/2">At the same time, January 2004, the Attorney-General asked the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to review current cases involving an unexplained infant death, which were still to come to trial.</p>
	<p pid="c.1802W.3/3">A Central Review Team (CRT) of experienced legal practitioners was set up within the CPS, answerable only to the Attorney. The CRT purely reviewed case files on legal merits in the light of the Court of Appeal ruling in Cannings. No pathologist was involved in this legal review work.</p>
	<p pid="c.1802W.3/4">A total of 297 cases were reviewed by the CRT. The papers reviewed included evidence served on the prosecution by the defence, who were in the best position to know about the circumstances of their clients' convictions. None of the cases were reinvestigated (by the police) in the sense that the original investigation was reopened but all the available papers were thoroughly reviewed. A selection was also sent to independent counsel for review.</p>
	<p pid="c.1802W.3/5">The team's work was supervised by an Inter-Departmental Group (IDG). This group considered 34 cases identified by the CRT for possible referral to the defendant. All but six of those cases were accepted for such referral. After careful consideration, the Attorney-General, IDG and counsel decided that the remaining six cases did not give such cause for concern that they needed to be referred to the defendant. Again, no pathologist was involved in this work but the Attorney-General was assisted by an expert in child health and paediatrics.</p>
	<p pid="c.1802W.3/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-21">21 December 2004</phrase>, the Attorney-General published the results of the review of the Infant Death Cases, and together with the then Solicitor-General, made oral statements before Parliament on that day. The report was also placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="c.1802W.3/7">As a result of the review a number of cases were referred to the Court of Appeal. It was at this stage that these cases were subject to the re- examination of evidence by medical professionals, including pathologists.</p>
	<p pid="c.1802W.3/8">In addition, the review of current cases resulted in three prosecutions being stopped without going to trial. This was set out in the original review.</p>
	<p pid="c.1802W.3/9">At the time of publication of the original review in December 2004, the Attorney-General explained that he had deferred final consideration of 89 further cases of so-called Shaken Baby Syndrome. An addendum to the report, dealing with those cases, will be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.1802W.3/10">Neither stage of the review has prevented any person from referring their case to the Court of Appeal or Criminal Cases Review Commission if they wish to do so.</p>

	<p pid="c.1803W.3/1">DFID allocates funds within spending review limits, agreed with Her Majesty's Treasury (HMT). The current spending review (SR04) runs to 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="c.1803W.3/2">Annex 1, table 1 of DFID's 2005 Departmental Report (DR) summarises all Government spending that falls within DFID's responsibility.

Table 4 outlines our bilateral aid expenditure, which includes all forms of direct assistance; expenditure through multilateral institutions; DFID expenditure in support of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and the multilateral debt relief expenditure plans.</p>
	<p pid="c.1803W.3/3">Capital expenditure is shown net in the DR (i.e. expenditure minus receipts). Expected gross expenditure in both 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 is about &pound;46.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1803W.3/4">DFID does not hold specific details of grants in aid to private partners centrally and it is not possible to provide a disaggregation without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

To be endorsed, IDTVs have to conform to a challenging set of energy performance criteria in both standby and on-mode functions. In addition, purchase of an IDTV now will negate the necessity to install a set top box, thus achieving additional energy savings. In its first month, three manufacturers have registered a total of 20 products with the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="c.1813W.8/1">The overall budget for the Rural Development Regulation was agreed as part of the Financial Perspective (2007&ndash;13) negotiations and has been set at &euro;69.75 billion for the whole EU. This is roughly in line with existing expenditure, although with a greater focus in the new member states. Once the mandatory transfer from CAP subsidies to rural development agreed as part of the 2003 reform are taken into account, (also known as compulsory modulation), EU spending on rural development will be higher&mdash;during the 2007&ndash;13 period than it is currently.</p>
	<p pid="c.1813W.8/2">The European Commission has yet to propose the detailed allocation for each member state. For the UK, a key element of the budget deal was securing the flexibility to make use of voluntary modulation or additional transfers of funds from pillar I to pillar II. This will enable us to meet our manifesto commitments on Environmental Stewardship. We will look at all financing arrangements for the successor Rural Development Programme from 2007 with the Treasury and in light of the forthcoming Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

	<p pid="c.1818W.8/1">Under the Single Payment Scheme, the number of set-aside entitlements allocated in each member state in the first year of application of the scheme is determined, in the main, by the average number of hectares under compulsory set-aside under the Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS) during the 2000&ndash;02 reference period. Subject to the exemptions that applied at the time, notably for small producers, that equates to 10 per cent. of the total area claimed under AAPS in each member state in the reference period. Total figures for those member states operating the scheme in 2005 are not yet available, but the amount of payment attached to set-aside entitlements in each member state will vary according to whether the 'historical' or 'flat-rate/hybrid' model of the scheme has been adopted. For those member states still operating AAPS in 2005, set-aside payment figures are again unavailable at this point, but will be determined by the number of applicants applying under the scheme, how much land they put into set-aside and the 63 euros/tonne payment rate.</p>

	<p pid="c.1824W.5/2">The EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan identifies a number of potential partner countries. The European Commission and member states began consultations in 2005 with four of these&mdash;Cameroon, Ghana, Indonesia and Malaysia, with a view to beginning formal negotiations once a mandate had been given by the European Council. That mandate was given in late 2005 and formal negotiations can begin when these partner countries and the EU agree that the preparatory work has been completed. Consultations will begin with other potential partner countries in 2006 drawing on the experience already gained. The time taken to complete negotiations will vary from partner country to partner country. It is anticipated that the first partnership agreement will be signed in 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.1825W.2/3">An initial BUGS project, completed at the end of 2002, involved a three year investigation into the significance of urban gardens in Sheffield as habitats for 'natural' biodiversity, and tested the efficacy of some simple methods for enhancing garden biodiversity. The results confirmed that 'gardens are brilliant for wildlife'. And further details are available on the BUGS website at <a href="http://www.bugs.group.shef.ac.uk/BUGS1/bugs1-index.html">http://www.bugs.group.shef.ac.uk/BUGS1/bugs1-index.html</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1825W.2/4">A second BUGS project is now building on the methods and findings of the first study. This project, which is also supported by Defra, widens the scope of this work to examine the resource that gardens provide for wildlife, and the diversity of plants, across different parts of the UK, and different urban forms. It will run until 2006&ndash;07, and the results will feed into Biodiversity Action Plans for urban areas.</p>

	<p pid="c.1825W.5/1">The Waste Incineration Directive has been transposed into national law and we currently have no grounds on which to change that. I am advised that, as the law currently stands, the burning of waste tallow as fuel remains subject to the requirements of that directive.</p>
	<p pid="c.1825W.5/2">In June 2005, the Government wrote to the European Commission expressing its view that the existing requirements of the Waste Framework Directive (WFD) (75/442/EEC as amended) and the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (96/61/EC) are sufficient to ensure that the burning of waste tallow as fuel is carried out in ways which protect the environment and public and animal health. The Government called for the EU Animal By-Products Regulation (ABPR) and the WID to be amended accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="c.1825W.5/3">In response, the Commission stated that there did not appear to be sufficient justification at present for it to propose an exclusion of the burning of waste tallow from the WID. However, the Commission also confirmed that the WID is not intended to discourage uses of waste as competitive and efficient alternative energy sources, agreed that it is desirable that it does not have such an effect and has initiated further analysis of the issue in the form of a study. This study should help to clarify the wider environmental and economic impacts of the current legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1825W.5/4">I recognise that recent announcements by the European Commission have raised the possibility that this legal position might change in the future. My understanding is that the Commission's study of the environmental impacts of burning tallow has now commenced and will report in the second half of 2006. If the outcome of this study were favourable to the burning of waste tallow as fuel without having to meet the requirements of the WID, then this could lead to a change in the relevant legislation although it is suggested that this is unlikely to occur before 2009. I must also stress that such an outcome is by no means a foregone conclusion.</p>

	<p pid="c.1826W.2/1">The Environment Agency has a statutory duty to manage water resources in England and Wales. It recovers the costs of managing water resources from abstraction licence holders through an abstraction charges scheme that is approved by Ministers. The recovery of its day-to-day costs expended in meeting this duty is, and will continue to be, on a regional basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.1826W.2/2">The Environment Agency is expected to take action against abstraction licences where the abstraction is adversely impacting on conservation sites, and in particular those designated under European legislation. Where it needs to revoke or modify an abstraction licence then compensation is generally payable. The compensation payments form part of the agency's costs of meeting its duties and therefore are costs to be recovered via abstraction charges.</p>
	<p pid="c.1826W.2/3">The Environment Agency has recently consulted on proposals to recover any compensation that may be payable via a national, rather than regional, formula. The Department has received representations, in light of that consultation, from a number of Members of Parliament whose constituencies lie in the north east of England and in particular those served by Northumbrian Water plc. The representations have been made to draw the Department's attention to the concerns of the Consumer Council for Water, the North East Chamber of Commerce and Northumbrian Water about a national approach. Anglian Water has made representations in support of a national approach.</p>
	<p pid="c.1826W.2/4">The Environment Agency has made proposals to the Department to raise its regional Standard Unit Charges, which are the basis of the recovery of day-to-day costs of managing water resources in England and Wales, in 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="c.1826W.2/5">The Environment Agency has not proposed to the Department any changes to the abstraction charges scheme in relation to the recovery of any compensation payments it may need to make. Therefore no decision has been made by Ministers on this element of abstraction charges.</p>

	<p pid="c.1827W.2/1">The Environment Agency is the statutory body with a duty to manage water resources in England and Wales. As part of the agency's management role it has both national and regional water resource strategies which set out the pressures over the next 25 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.1827W.2/2">Water companies have statutory duties to maintain adequate supplies of water. They have 25 year water resource plans which complement the agency strategies and seek to reconcile supply with anticipated demand. This forward planning framework exists to take account of factors such as the water supply and disposal infrastructure required to service significant new housing developments of which the Thames Gateway is an example.</p>
	<p pid="c.1827W.2/3">Although produced voluntarily, every five years, at present these plans will become a statutory requirement under the provisions of the Water Act 2003. The Department is currently consulting on the exercise of the new powers in respect of statutory water resource plans.</p>

	<p pid="c.1827W.8/1">In October, in the run-up to the sixth ministerial meeting in Hong Kong, the EU made an offer on improved market access for agricultural products. Others, such as the US, did so too. An agreed feature of the market access negotiations is that all countries will be permitted to protect sensitive products, by applying less than the agreed reduction rates to the tariffs on these products. The EU suggested that up to 8 per cent. of a country's tariff lines on agricultural products should be deemed sensitive products. The US suggested 1 per cent., so there is a considerable divide here that, because the matter was not discussed or decided at Hong Kong, still needs bridging.</p>
	<p pid="c.1827W.8/2">The EU Commission negotiates on behalf of the EU member states in the WTO negotiations. EU member states have not discussed or seen any list of sensitive products or criteria from the Commission. We would not expect to do so before the number of sensitive products has been agreed. The EU may yet decide to offer a figure lower than 8 per cent. in order to secure a Doha deal, which could then effect the choice of sensitive products. In addition, agreeing the treatment of sensitive products is, of course, as important as agreeing the number.</p>
	<p pid="c.1827W.8/3">It is difficult for any issue within the Doha Trade Round to be viewed in isolation, as any agreement reached will be part of a package. For this reason, the Commission is unlikely to have any fixed criteria, for the designation of sensitive products, that they would wish to share at this present time.</p>

	<p pid="c.1830W.3/4" class="indent">For the 2001 Census, as with previous censuses, the Office for National Statistics followed a policy of enforcing legal proceedings against persons who persistently refused to fulfil their statutory obligation to return a completed census form, and where it had obtained clear and sufficient documentary evidence of such a refusal. The objective is to improve response by prosecution and the threat of prosecution, to support census field staff and to deter non-compliance for any future census.</p>
	<p pid="c.1830W.3/5" class="indent">Interviews under Caution were conducted and voluntary witness statements obtained, as required under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) Code of practice which governs the treatment and questioning of persons who refuse to complete a census form. Particular attention was given to those reported cases where refusals were accompanied by acts of intimidation towards field staff.</p>
	<p pid="c.1830W.3/6" class="indent">This policy will also be followed for non-compliance in the 2011 Census although the precise arrangements for enforcing legal action are yet to be developed.</p>

Alternatively, they can write directly to me or to the Census Director, outlining their concerns. Local Authorities can also use these routes or may choose to channel their views through the Central and Local Government Information Partnership (CLIP) Census Sub Group.

	<p pid="c.1831W.5/4" class="indent">Following the 2001 Census for England and Wales, the Office for National Statistics undertook an extensive programme of work to investigate the reasons for the difference between the 2001 Census and the mid-year population estimates (MYEs) at both national and local levels. This research included a series of Local Authority studies carried out in 2004 which were designed to improve the MYEs in the areas that proved hardest to count in the Census. An extensive review was carried out for 32 local authorities, including Southend-on-Sea, to assess whether there was evidence that the population might have been under- or over-estimated. The results of these studies showed that better estimates of the population could be made in 15 areas and an adjustment was made to the MYEs in these areas. For the great majority of areas, including Southend-on-Sea, it was found that the 2001 Census-based population estimate remains the best estimate of the population. A full report on these Local Authority Studies can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1833W.6/1">The Financial Services Authority (FSA) is responsible for registering credit unions under the Credit Unions Act 1979. It monitors and supervises the manner in which credit unions comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements and rules, taking whatever action it considers appropriate in the event of non-compliance.</p>
	<p pid="c.1833W.6/2">One area of supervision is to ensure that the activities of a credit union are consistent with the objects laid down in their statute. However it is not a function of the FSA to investigate whether or not a credit union achieves its aims or whether it is effective in addressing the needs it was set up to meet. That is for the credit union and its members to assess.</p>

	<p pid="c.1834W.6/1">The growth in the Public Sector Average Earnings Index (AEI) was 4.2 per cent. in the year to November 2005 (single month figure, for Great Britain, seasonally adjusted and excluding bonuses, Source: Office for National Statistics), compared to 3.7 per cent. in the Private Sector and 3.8 per cent. in the Whole Economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.1834W.6/2">In the short-term the public and private sector AEI growth can diverge and they usually do, but in the long-term they tend to be very similar. The average annual growth between March 1997 (the earliest available data) and November 2005 was 4.0 per cent. in the public sector and 4.2 per cent. in the private sector (and 4.1 per cent. in the whole economy).</p>
	<p pid="c.1834W.6/3">Government policy on public sector pay is devolved to individual Departments, while the Treasury maintains a monitoring and co-ordinating role. Government policy on public sector pay remains one of ensuring pay awards are justified, affordable and deliver value for money. Given that it accounts for around a quarter of all public spending, controlling pay is essential to delivering value for money and keeping inflationary pressures in check.</p>
	<p pid="c.1834W.6/4">With this in mind, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has written to the public sector Pay Review Bodies emphasising the importance of basing its pay settlements on the achievement of the inflation target of 2 per cent. Furthermore, to achieve a more co-ordinated approach to pay across the public sector, the Government have now established a new single gateway to scrutinise all significant public sector pay proposals (as announced in the last pre-Budget report). Reporting to myself, the objective of the gateway (Public Sector Pay Committee) is to establish a common set of objectives for pay across government, extending and strengthening existing arrangements. Its aim is to ensure that all new pay structures are evidence-based, represent value for money and are financially sustainable over the long run, including taking account of the pensions implications of new pay decisions.</p>

	<p pid="c.1840W.5/1">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your question regarding the current population of <i>(a)</i> each Essex borough and <i>(b)</i> each ward in Southend West constituency based on (i) the 2001 Census, (ii) electoral rolls, and (iii) health service users; and what projections have been made for the next five years. (50479)</p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/4" class="indent">The tables attached provide the information you have requested. Data for Essex local authorities, including the former Essex authorities of Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock, are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Data for wards in Southend West are shown in table 3.</p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/5" class="indent">ONS publishes annual mid-year population estimates. The latest estimates are for mid-2004 and are given in Table 1. These mid-year population estimates are calculated using a robust methodology and are the best estimates of the resident population in an area. They are based on aged-on 2001 Census data adjusted for births, deaths, and net migration. Further information on the methodology can be found at:</p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/6" class="indent"><a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=575">www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=575</a>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/7" class="indent">Population projections for each local authority in Essex, for mid-2005 to mid-2010, are also given in Table 1. These projections are based on the mid-2003 population estimates and are the latest population projections available. They assume that trends in fertility, mortality and migration at the time of the mid-2003 population estimate will continue into the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/8" class="indent">Electoral rolls provide counts of the number of people registered to vote. The latest available data, on the local/European electorate and the Parliamentary electorate, for local authorities in Essex can be found in the Table 2. These data are for <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-01">1 December 2004</phrase>. It should be noted that the number of people eligible to vote is not the same as the resident population aged 18 and over. There are numerous reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/9" class="indent">The number of people registered with a GP, living in each local authority in Essex, in July 2004, can also be found in the Table 2. It should also be noted that patient register counts differ from estimates of the usually resident population for a number of reasons.</p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/10" class="indent">Patient registers include people who are in the country for at least three months, whereas population estimates are based on a usual residence definition requiring a stay of 12 months or more. The patient registers exclude individuals who are ineligible to be registered with a GP. People may be on a patient register after having left the country and not deregistered with their GP; similarly people may have moved to another area and not re-registered. Some patients may have more than one NHS number e.g. they may have been issued a temporary number for a short period. Again, these factors have a differential impact from place to place.</p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/11" class="indent">Ward data are shown in Table 3; the points set out above also apply to wards. However, there are some further points to note for wards.</p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/12" class="indent">The most recent population estimates for wards are for mid-2002. The closest available geography to current electoral wards, for which population estimates are available, is Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards. This geography was created for outputs from the 2001 Census and is based mainly on 2003 electoral wards. The CAS ward level population estimates have been published with the status of experimental statistics&quot;. Therefore, the estimates, and figures derived from them, should be treated with some care. The margin of confidence for population estimates is proportionately larger at ward level than at local authority level.</p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/13" class="indent">The ONS does not produce projections of population at ward level.</p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/14" class="indent">Table 3 contains CAS ward electorate counts for December 2002 and 2004 as well as patient register figures for July 2002 and July 2004. The 2002 figures are given for comparison with population estimates and 2004 are the latest available data.</p>
	<p pid="c.1840W.5/15" class="indent">Finally, the local government electorate is definitionally closer to the population estimates, however these data are not available at ward level. Hence, the Parliamentary electorate is shown.</p>

	<p pid="c.1843W.2/4" class="indent">Population estimates are calculated using an internationally respected methodology. Further information can be found in the detailed methodology guide 'Making a population estimate in England and Wales'. This is published here: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=575">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=575</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1843W.2/5" class="indent">It is becoming increasingly difficult to estimate the size of the population because of changes in society, which include increased mobility and different living arrangements. The decennial Census provides a benchmark against which national and sub-national population estimates can be assessed. Substantial work has been done on the difference between mid-year population estimates and the 2001 Census. This work is summarised in the final report of the 2004 Local Authority Population Studies, which can be found here: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/LAStudy_FullReport.pdf">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/LAStudy_FullReport.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1843W.2/6" class="indent">These studies confirmed that the 2001 Census had worked well in most areas, including Peterborough, but there were a few cases where the adjustment for under-enumeration was not able to adjust sufficiently for exceptional circumstances. This work, together with revised international migration estimates, accounted for a large proportion of the initial 1.1 million difference between mid year estimates and the Census; reducing the difference to a little over 0.2 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.1843W.2/7" class="indent">In addition, extensive annual quality assurance is undertaken in order to ensure the accuracy of the annual mid-year estimates. Quality assurance starts with detailed checking of the source data used in the components of change (birth, deaths, etc.). Procedures are then in place to ensure that these data sources are correctly processed when deriving the estimates. The calculated national and sub-national estimates, for all 376 local authorities in England and Wales, are then subject to a further set of quality assurance procedures before they are published. These procedures include reviews of sex ratios and age profiles, comparisons of change over time, and comparisons of fertility and mortality rates. Substantial effort has already been undertaken, in recent years, to improve the quality assurance of population estimates.</p>
	<p pid="c.1843W.2/8" class="indent">ONS is also now investing substantially in a project to Improve Migration and Population Statistics (IMPS). (More information on this project can be found at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS">www.statistics.gov.uk/IMPS</a>). The key aims of this project are to reduce the size of the difference between the 2011 Census results and the mid-year estimates and to better understand any difference that does remain. As part of this project, we are developing a data comparator tool to enable us to compare the annual mid-year estimates against a range of administrative sources. This work is ongoing and the results will inform our understanding of the accuracy of the mid-year population estimates. The tool was trialled in the mid-2004 population estimates, which were published in August 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.1843W.2/9" class="indent">Another strand of the IMPS project is a review of the quality assurance procedures that are currently in place for population estimates. One of the aims of this review is to assess what improvements can be made to existing procedures, and determine whether additional quality assurance is required.</p>
	<p pid="c.1843W.2/10" class="indent">ONS also produces population projections for each local authority area. The methodology used in the production of the subnational population projections is an established and recognised methodology. Subnational population projections undergo extensive quality assurance before publication. In addition, local authorities and health authorities are consulted on the first year of migration assumptions used as the baseline trend for migration.</p>
	<p pid="c.1843W.2/11" class="indent">Population estimates and projections are supplied to the ODPM. I understand that ODPM make checks to ensure that the data as provided by the ONS have been correctly entered into their calculations for allocating Formula Grant to local authorities. Otherwise, they do not make any assessment of accuracy of the data supplied, as this responsibility lies with the ONS.</p>

A helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) feasibility study published in 2004, which was commissioned by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Republic of Ireland's Department of Health and Children, concluded that, other than for inter-hospital transfers, there was no clear advantage in helicopter emergency medical services.</p>

DHSSPS is working closely with the Northern Ireland ambulance service and the four Health and Social Services Boards to improve ambulance services in terms of speed and appropriateness of response and clinical quality.</p>

	<p pid="c.1855W.5/1">Education and Library Boards have withdrawn school crossing patrols at 80 primary schools across Northern Ireland in the last 12 months. The decision to withdraw patrols is one that is taken very carefully, and only in cases where a review using the agreed local authority road safety officers' association guidelines has determined that underlying hazards have either declined significantly, or disappeared completely.</p>
	<p pid="c.1855W.5/2">It is not possible to provide information regarding the number of pupils affected by the withdrawal of the crossing patrols as not every pupil attending the schools will have been affected by the change. Some schools have more than one crossing patrol point, or indeed more than one entrance; in other cases, the crossing patrol was not located at the school gates. 44 of the patrols removed were lunchtime patrols which few pupils used.</p>

	<p pid="c.1856W.5/3">This assessment followed Electoral Commission's report Understanding Electoral Registration&quot;, published in September 2005, which estimated that around 3.5 million people in England and Wales were eligible to be on the register at their main residence but were missing from it in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="c.1856W.5/4">My Department is currently working with a number of partners to promote awareness of electoral registration in London where the issue of under-registration is most acute.

	<p pid="c.1860W.2/1">NERC's science budget allocation has doubled since 1997 to &pound;334 million for this year, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining the quality of environmental research in the UK. NERC is currently consulting widely with stakeholders and staff on a proposed restructuring of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH). The aim of the proposal is to ensure the long-term sustainability of CEH and its continued capacity to contribute to environmental research in the UK into the future. These consultations close on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February 2006</phrase>. I am sure that NERC Council will consider carefully all evidence and views on the potential impact of the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="c.1860W.2/2">If, following consultation, NERC decides to proceed with the restructuring, the costs would be met from NERC's science budget allocation, and the Department has indicated that it would be willing to increase NERC's allocation by up to &pound;14.2 million over 2006&ndash;08 so as to support the delivery of its core programmes in these circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="c.1860W.5/1">The Department records total annual liabilities for all early departure schemes, including continuing costs of compensation payments and early severance payments that are not retirements. It does not keep separate records of the costs that relate specifically to enhanced early retirement schemes. This information for eight financial years could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. The estimated cost of enhanced early retirement schemes in 2005&ndash;06 including flexible and compulsory early retirements and approved early retirement schemes (including the Insolvency Service) is &pound;8.1 million. It is expected that the reduction of DTI staff by 1,010 civil servants will lead to cumulative savings of &pound;37.20 million by 2007&ndash;08.

	<p pid="c.1864W.8/1">In spring 2005, the DTI commissioned a detailed report by Global Insight, an energy consultancy, on the operation of the UK gas forward markets. This is available at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/publications/policy/forward_gas_markets.pdf">http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/publications/policy/forward_gas_markets.pdf</a>. The report concluded, among other things, that the UK gas forward market was a functional hedging and trading market, free from major distortions and market abuse, with efficient price-formation outside of short spike periods&quot;. However, the report also said that, whilst the market was functionally liquid, more could be done to boost confidence in it and encourage participation by banks, traders etc. The DTI and Ofgem have therefore been discussing with the Futures and Options Association (FOA) why there is not more participation in the forward market and whether there are any barriers to entry. Following a roundtable with some of its members on <phrase class="date" code="">6 December</phrase>, the FOA has developed a programme of actions to try to improve liquidity.</p>

	<p pid="c.1865W.2/1">The Government takes the problem of rising fuel prices and its targets on the eradication of fuel poverty very seriously. The provision of affordable warmth is a keystone of our energy policy, and one of the four goals set out in the Energy White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="c.1865W.2/2">Tackling fuel poverty is devolved. In Scotland the overall objective for fuel poverty is to ensure that, so far as reasonably practicable, people are not living in fuel poverty by November 2016. The central heating and warm deal programmes improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock for vulnerable people. So far the Scottish Executive has invested over &pound;240 million in these programmes, putting in over 63,000 central heating systems and insulating over 223,000 homes.</p>
	<p pid="c.1865W.2/3">Increases in the cost of heating oil over the past year primarily reflect rises in the international price of crude oil. Through its presidencies of the G8, G7 and EU, the UK promoted international efforts to improve the functioning of the global oil market and tackle market inefficiencies that contribute to oil price volatility.</p>
	<p pid="c.1865W.2/4">Domestically, the Government's policy is not to intervene in commercial price setting because it believes that the consumer is best served by the operation of open competition between companies. The supply of domestic bulk liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is, however, subject to UK competition law under the Competition Act 1998 and is currently under investigation by the Competition Commission. Provisional findings are available at <a href="http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/inquiries/current/gas/">http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/inquiries/current/gas/</a>, with the final report to be published in March.</p>

In April 2005, England's Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) took over responsibility from the Countryside Agency for delivery of rural economic and social regeneration policies, including responsibility for the regeneration of market towns. The RDAs work with local communities and businesses to deliver long term strategic investment plans that will sustain market towns as important rural service centres, geared to the particular needs and characteristics of each region.</p>

	<p pid="c.1867W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1867W.5/2">As announced in Rural Strategy 2004, from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>, Defra has devolved decision-making on delivery of economic and social regeneration policies to the Regional Development Agencies. This includes areas of activity such as those formerly covered by the Countryside Agency's Vital Villages and Market Towns programmes. The transfer of Countryside Agency funding aims to create an integrated rural funding programme and allow RDAs the flexibility to manage their own resources to meet their regional and Defra priorities. Additional resources from the Countryside Agency will also increase the RDAs expertise in innovation, countryside issues, research and rural development.</p>
	<p pid="c.1867W.5/3">This move to devolve funding to the regions through RDAs is part of Central Government's devolving decision-making agenda. RDAs, working in partnership, will decide how to spend their resources to meet national targets and address regional needs. However, Defra is confident that by devolving these responsibilities to the RDAs and increasing their resources, rural delivery will become more responsive to local priorities and better focused on areas and people that need it most.</p>

	<p pid="c.1873W.11/1">Emissions from international flights do not currently count in the national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions, there being no international agreement yet on ways of allocating such emissions. There is, therefore, no agreed definition for UK aviation. In order to provide illustrative figures we have previously provided data based on a number of assumptions&mdash;that the UK takes responsibility for emissions from all departing flights, that all other sectors of the economy reduce their CO <sub>2</sub> emissions in line with the Energy White Paper goal. These figures do not take into account the impact of economic instruments like emissions trading.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.11/2">The Department for Transport provided an illustrative table showing the relative contribution of aviation to UK emissions to the Environmental Audit Committee (published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-07">7 June 2004</phrase> in Aviation: Sustainability and the Government Response&quot;, HC 623). On this basis, aviation would be responsible for 15.2 per cent. of UK CO <sub>2</sub> emissions in 2030 and 21.3 per cent. in 2050. Using a radiative forcing factor of 2.7, aviation would be responsible for 27.6 per cent. in 2030 and 34.3 per cent. in 2050 of the UK's contribution to global warming.</p>
	<p pid="c.1873W.11/3">The Air Transport White Paper sets out the Government's belief that the best way of ensuring aviation contributes towards the goal of climate stabilisation would be through a well-designed emissions trading regime, for which we are pressing at international and European level. We are working through the International Civil Aviation Organisation towards an international emissions trading scheme for aviation&mdash;this is consistent with the request to ICAO from the UN Climate Change Convention for action on aviation emissions. We are also pursuing the inclusion of aviation in the EU emissions trading scheme. The details of how a scheme would work in practice, like the overall cap and the distribution of allowances between member states will be subject to discussion with other member states' governments.</p>

	<p pid="c.1876W.5/1">The European Commission's proposal controlling greenhouse gas emissions from Mobile Air Conditioning systems has been analysed by an inter-departmental project team. The costs and benefits of the proposed legislation has been estimated and compared with other options. The proposal is estimated to save</p>
	<p pid="c.1876W.5/2">14&ndash;17 Megatonnes CO <sub>2</sub> equivalent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2005&ndash;25. Estimated costs are in the range &pound;18&ndash;67 million per annum.</p>
	<p pid="c.1876W.5/3">The proposal was adopted by the European Parliament and Council on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January 2006</phrase> and has not yet been published in the Official Journal. Work has therefore not yet begun on drafting Regulations to implement this Directive in UK law. However the Directive is in essence a type approval standard applying to new vehicles only. It does not apply retrospectively, nor does the Department have any intention of adopting retrospective provisions in implementing UK Regulations. Further to DEFRA's consultation on the Commission's proposal, DfT will conduct a formal consultation exercise on implementing Regulations in due course.</p>
	<p pid="c.1876W.5/4">Article 6 of the Directive does prohibit retrofitting of air conditioning systems with high Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerants to vehicles type approved on or after <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2011</phrase>. Such air conditioning systems may not be retrofitted to any vehicle from <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2017</phrase>. However the Directive does allow continued use of high GWP refrigerants for refilling air conditioning systems which originally used such gases. This ensures that air conditioning systems on existing vehicles may be maintained in working order without necessitating their replacement with systems designed to use lower GWP refrigerants.</p>

Six lines have so far been designated as community rail lines: St. Erth to St. Ives, Liskeard to Looe, St. Budeaux Junction to Gunnislake, Watford Junction to St Albans, Guisborough Junction to Whitby and Barnsley to Huddersfield. Consultation has taken place to designate the lines from Grantham to Skegness and from Ryde Pier Head to Shanklin, and we hope to consult shortly about a number of other lines.

	<p pid="c.1890W.11/1">Over 53,000 United Kingdom Servicemen and women deployed to the Gulf in 1990&ndash;91. We do not know how many UK Gulf veterans are ill or what illnesses they have reported because there is no single database, not least with respect to those who have left the armed forces whose current records the Department does not hold. However, at the end of September 2005, some 2,960 Gulf veterans were in receipt of a war disablement pension and 2,445 veterans had received a gratuity for disablements assessed at under 20 per cent. There will be some overlap between those figures, as some individuals will have received first a gratuity and then, if this disablement has become more severe, a pension. The awards will not necessarily relate to the individual's service in the Gulf and we would expect a substantial proportion to relate to non-Gulf service.</p>
	<p pid="c.1890W.11/2">In some cases veterans' illnesses are due to disorders which are unrelated to service. The majority will be musculo-skeletal conditions relating most commonly to injuries sustained in training, operations or fitness activities. Others are recognised medical conditions such as PTSD, where service links may again be accepted. A third group relates to multi-system, multi-organ, non-specific, medically unexplained symptoms and illnesses which epidemiological evidence shows are not specific to, but are more common among those who served in 1990&ndash;91.</p>
	<p pid="c.1890W.11/3">The pattern of ill health is not unique to UK Gulf veterans, and is repeated among 1990&ndash;91 Gulf veterans from the other coalition countries. Evidence so far suggests that this is unaffected by the specific experiences and exposures of the personnel concerned. Similar symptoms and illness are also reported among personnel who did not deploy. There is no consensus either in the US or the UK as to the causes of the non-specific conditions commonly covered by the umbrella term Gulf War Syndrome&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="c.1896W.2/1">The Licensing Act 2003 was subject to consultation and agreement across Government, including the Department of Health and the Home Office. Licensing reform is part of the Government's Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy which considered the cost of alcohol harm to public services, including health and the police.</p>
	<p pid="c.1896W.2/2">On the specific impact of the implementation of Licensing Act 2003, the Government believes that the removal of artificially fixed closing times will encourage a more orderly and gradual dispersal of customers which, together with the tough new powers for the police, should help reduce the level of violent crime which the police and accident and emergency departments are required to deal with.</p>

	<p pid="c.1898W.2/28">* In producing this analysis, individual records were attributed to parliamentary constituencies (PC's) on the basis of their postcode. Not all records can be correctly allocated to a PC using this method, and some cannot be allocated at all. Past investigation has demonstrated that mis-allocations and non-allocations do not necessarily occur randomly between areas, and at ward level the proportion of records mis-allocated or unallocated can be substantial. At present, it seems likely that a higher than average proportion of the records that cannot be attributed to a ward are in the following areas: Fermanagh district council, Deny district council and parts of Belfast city council.</p>

	<p pid="c.1898W.9/1">Regular discussions on counter narcotics (CN) issues take place between the UK and Afghanistan's neighbouring countries. The aim of these meetings is to work towards improving the capacity of the latter to interdict drugs entering their countries from Afghanistan. These discussions take place in bilateral, multilateral and regional frameworks. There are also a series of inter-regional meetings between Afghanistan and her neighbours to foster CN information and intelligence exchange.</p>
	<p pid="c.1898W.9/2">Results of these discussions are encouraging. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report that seizure rates of opiates in the countries surrounding Afghanistan has increased reflecting improved enforcement activities in the region. Much of this can be attributed to the regular dialogue to improve information/intelligence sharing and donor assistance to strengthen Afghanistan's neighbours borders. The UNODC World Drug Report 2005 reports the countries with the largest total opiates seizures for 2003 (latest available published figures) were Pakistan (34.7 mt) and Iran (26.1 mt)-equivalent to 31 per cent. and 24 per cent. of global opiate seizures respectively.</p>

The task of securing against infiltration by militants will be achieved both by the training and support provided to the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police, and by the presence of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.

The messages Mr. Sawers gave in his private meetings in both Belgrade and Pristina were fully consistent with the Contact Group statement and the Guiding Principles, both of which have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.1906W.8/4">The <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-31">31 January</phrase> statement makes clear that the outcome of the final status should be acceptable to the people of Kosovo. In response to questions from the media, Mr. Sawers noted that independence for Kosovo was an option, and that some might say it was the only sustainable option. The legacy of the Milosevic era in Kosovo&mdash;violence, ethnic cleansing and the conflict in 1999&mdash;had led to the present UN mandate, and the future status process would need to reflect this background. It was incumbent on the Kosovo Albanians to create the conditions under which their aspirations could be met. That meant arrangements in Kosovo that guaranteed minority rights, protected Serb historic and cultural monuments and allowed those displaced from Kosovo to return.</p>

	<p pid="c.1908W.6/1">The UN world summit in September 2005 supported and encouraged the development of rapid deployment arrangements in support of UN peacekeeping. In particular, it welcomed efforts by regional organisations such as the European Union and African Union to develop relevant capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1908W.6/2">The UN Department of peacekeeping operations is currently considering three options to provide timely additional support to UN missions at times of crisis: provision of a rapid deployment capability by regional organisations; provision of a short-term capability by one or more individual countries; and providing co-operation arrangements between UN missions in the same region. The report recommends that all these options be considered in parallel.</p>
	<p pid="c.1908W.6/3">Progress has already been made on two of these recommendations. In the area of regional rapid reaction, the EU and UN are discussing how the EU battle groups could be used in appropriate circumstances in support of UN missions. The EU is currently considering a request from the UN to provide additional support to the UN mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo during elections later this year. The African Union is also taking steps towards establishment of an African stand-by force, supported by the UK and other international partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.1908W.6/4">Progress is also being made on arrangements between UN missions. The Security Council has recently authorised the deployment of a force from the UN mission in Liberia (UNMIL) to support UN forces in Cote d' Ivoire in view of recent events there. Similarly UNMIL is providing a contingency force to support the UN forces providing security for the Sierra Leone special court, should the need arise.</p>
	<p pid="c.1908W.6/5">The UK is playing an active role in both the UN and EU in developing appropriate rapid reaction capabilities in support of UN peacekeeping operations.</p>

	<p pid="c.1909W.2/1">The United Nations stand-by arrangements system (UNSAS) has been introduced by the UN to increase the availability of forces for peacekeeping operations, and to reduce the time taken for their deployment. The system is based on conditional commitments made by UN member states to make available specified military and other resources within agreed response times. The system has taken some time to bed down, but is now proving increasingly useful for the generation of force units and the provision of individuals, including military observers and staff officers, to peacekeeping operations.</p>
	<p pid="c.1909W.2/2">The UN Secretary-General recently reported that force generation for complex peacekeeping missions in Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, Burundi and Haiti have shown that resources pledged are now more adequate to mission needs and that the declarations made by member states under the UNSAS arrangements are more realistic and up to date. However, getting member states to commit forces to rapid deployment as part of the UNSAS process has shown limited success. The UN's Department of peacekeeping operations is examining ways of making it more attractive for member states to commit to rapid deployments as part of UNSAS.</p>

	<p pid="c.1909W.5/1">The establishment of the multinational Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade in 1996 (SHIRBRIG) followed a recommendation from the UN Secretary General that UN member states should consider establishing a rapid deployment force to support UN peacekeeping operations. SHIRBRIG was established by Austria, Canada, Denmark, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden. Fifteen countries now participate in the brigade, with a number of others taking part as observers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1909W.5/2">SHIRBRIG is available to take part in Security Council-mandated operations for a period of up to six months. It is able to provide an initial headquarters and planning capability as part of the start-up of an operation, or to deploy as a whole brigade as part of a UN peacekeeping operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1909W.5/3">SHIRBRIG is made up of three elements: a Steering Committee which makes policy and oversees force generation and deployment; a Planning Element which serves as the nucleus for the force headquarters and plans for individual deployments; and a Brigade Pool of Forces consisting of the troops made available to SHIRBRIG by the participating countries. The Brigade aims to be able to deploy 4,000&ndash;5,000 troops.</p>
	<p pid="c.1909W.5/4">Since its inception, SHIRBRIG has made the following deployments:</p>
	<p pid="c.1909W.5/5" class="indent">In 2000, SHIRBRIG deployed a headquarters, an infantry battalion and a headquarters company to the UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea.</p>
	<p pid="c.1909W.5/6" class="indent">In March 2003, SHIRBRIG provided a planning team to assist the Economic Community of West African States in the planning of a peacekeeping mission in Co(r)te d'Ivoire.</p>
	<p pid="c.1909W.5/7" class="indent">In September 2003, SHIRBRIG deployed 20 members to assist the UN to form the core of the Interim UN headquarters in Liberia.</p>
	<p pid="c.1909W.5/8" class="indent">In 2005, SHIRBRIG's Planning Element provided the core for the Headquarters of the new UN Mission in Sudan.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-02-14c.49599.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2006-02-14c.1917W.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1776" speakername="Jacqui Smith" colnum="1917W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060214/text/60214w33.htm#60214w33.html_spnew4">
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/1">This Government have given an unprecedented high profile to preventing bullying and supporting those who have been bullied. Our anti-bullying work, including the anti-bullying Charter for Action, takes an integrated approach to preventing bullying, to addressing causes of bullying&mdash;for example prejudice&mdash;and to helping those who are bullied.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/2">Since 1999 it has been compulsory for every school to have an anti-bullying policy in place which details how the school will tackle bullying.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/3">We have secured a very broad consensus, with all the teaching professional associations and the Anti Bullying Alliance signing up to our Anti-Bullying Charter for Action. The Charter is a voluntary commitment to creating a school community where bullying is not tolerated. In line with commitments outlined in the White Paper we re-issued the Charter during Anti-Bullying Week 2005 and therefore expect an increase in the number being returned to us via the ABA over the coming months. In 2006 we plan to share examples of where the Charter has been particularly well implemented with other schools, which can learn from this best practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/4">Through our work with the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA), an organisation comprising over 65 leading anti-bullying charities and experts, we provide schools and local authorities with expert help to tackle bullying.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/5">We have put more adults than ever in our schools&mdash;teachers, classroom assistants, learning mentors, Connexions personal advisers, Behaviour and Education Support Teams and police officers&mdash;so that a wide range of people are available to help prevent and tackle bullying.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/6">Further to the White Paper, in 2006 we shall issue guidance on prejudice driven bullying, including racist and homophobic bullying, providing school staff with valuable support in an area they often find challenging. We plan to launch our advice on countering racist bullying online at the end of February.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/7">Anti-bullying week continues to be a successful event with a large number of schools taking part in November 2005's activities through a wide variety of national and local events. There was a considerable amount of positive press coverage and this year over 325,000 wristbands were distributed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/8">Our anti-bullying resource pack for schools Bullying: Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;, updated in 2000 and September 2002 will be revised and re-issued in 2006 to ensure schools have the most up-to-date information available on tackling bullying.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/9">In addition the Department has recently launched the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) curriculum resource&mdash;an intervention to develop children's social, emotional and behavioural skills from Foundation Stage to Year 6. It is available to all primary schools and the evidence from the pilot suggests that it helps reduce bullying and promotes positive behaviour generally. It is an important arm of the Department's longer term policy to promote positive behaviour and attendance. The Department is hoping to build on the work carried out in primary schools by providing a similar whole school curriculum based resource for secondary schools (SEBS). At present the programme is in a very early pilot stage.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/10">Data on bullying is not collected centrally and thus there is no reliable basis for an estimate of how many children have changed schools as a result of being bullied.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/11">The first time the reason for exclusion was collected was in the academic year 2003/04. In that year 150 pupils were permanently excluded and 6,750 were given fixed period exclusions for bullying. This information comes from the Statistical First Release on Permanent and Fixed Period Exclusion from Schools and Exclusion Appeals in England, 2003/04&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/12">Funds for schools to devote to anti-bullying work form part of their overall budgets; they are not ring fenced so we have no information on how much they have devoted to this.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/13">The figures for the anti-bullying strand of the Improving Behaviour and Attendance strategy, which is used centrally to support schools and local authorities in their anti bullying work, are given as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid="c.1917W.5/16"> <th></th> <th>Amount (&pound;)</th> </tr>

			<tr pid="c.1917W.5/19"> <td>2002/03</td> <td>184,000</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="c.1917W.5/22"> <td>2005/06</td> <td>1,145,000</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/25">Figures for earlier years are not available because the anti-bullying strand of behaviour work was not disaggregated.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/26">In 2005/06 the Department has contributed a further &pound;200,000 of funding to CHIPS (ChildLine in Partnership with Schools). The CHIPS scheme encourages young people to set up programmes, with the help of ChildLine and their teachers, to support their peers and to create safe environments in which to learn.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/27">We note that ChildLine and the NSPCC have recently joined forces and we hope to continue working with both in their joint efforts to protect and support those who have been bullied.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/28">We have provided the ABA, with &pound;600,000 of funding for the 2005/06 period.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/29">The Department has committed &pound;200,000 for 2005/06 to Parent Line Plus, a telephone advice line for parents offering guidance on a range of subjects. Between April 2003 and March 2004 21 per cent. of all calls received related to bullying. In conjunction with the DFES and the ABA, the line can also refer parents who have not received satisfactory help at a local level to a one to one advice line.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/30">The Diana Memorial Award for anti-bullying was launched in 2004 and highlights the achievements of young people trying to tackle bullying in their school or community. The Department has shown its continuing support for this initiative by contributing &pound;50,000 of funding for 2005/06.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/31">Our guidance to schools on tackling bullying, Don't Suffer in Silence&quot;, has been externally evaluated by researchers at Goldsmith's College, University of London. The results, though based on a fairly low response rate from schools, show that the schools found that the pack met their expectations and helped in drawing up their anti-bullying policies.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/32">This evaluation included research into the perceived success of the anti bullying strategies and interventions recommended in the guidance. Schools generally reported a high level of satisfaction with the interventions they had used.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/33">The Department commissioned the Thomas Coram Research Unit at the Institute of Education, University of London, to review the research evidence relating to homophobia in schools and to talk to groups with an interest in this area. The Department published their work in its Research Report series in late 2004, number 594, entitled Homophobia, Sexual Orientation and Schools: A Review and Implications for Action&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/34">Training has been provided in each Government Office region through the Make The Difference conferences and through ABA training events and direct ABA work with individual schools. Training is also being provided through dissemination events linked to forthcoming advice on countering prejudice driven bullying.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/35">Through the National Strategies the Department makes high-quality staff training materials on managing behaviour, including bullying, available to all schools. In addition each local authority is also supported by at least one expert Behaviour and Attendance consultant in each local authority.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/36">Through the National Programme for Specialist Leaders of Behaviour and Attendance (NPSL-BA), the Department has developed a programme for training specialist staff who have leadership roles in relation to behaviour and attendance, including anti-bullying.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/37">In addition our resources such as the Charter and Don't Suffer in Silence&quot; offer further support and advice to teachers in this area.</p>
	<p pid="c.1917W.5/38">As anti-bullying training funding is not disaggregated or devolved directly, it is not possible to identify national funds or funds for Leicester.</p>

	<p pid="c.1920W.2/1">The Department does not collect national data on instances of bullying in England and schools. However, there are surveys run by, or supported by, the Department which do give an indication of the extent of bullying in schools in England.</p>
	<p pid="c.1920W.2/2">The Department contributes funds to the Department for Work and Pensions' 'Families and Children Study'. This is an annual survey of a representative sample of families with dependent children in Britain. The study includes questions to parents and children on bullying (either in or out of schools). Reports from this study are published by DWP and are available from <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/facs/facs_publication.asp">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/facs/facs_publication.asp</a></p>

Although data from the first wave of this study are not yet available there are plans to make the data publicly available from the UK Data Archive.</p>

We have accordingly introduced legislation to require a competition to be held wherever a new secondary school is required so that a variety of providers can bring forward proposals and local people have the opportunity to make their views known about a number of options. The White Paper envisages extending this requirement to apply to new primary schools. The Secretary of State has recently made clear that where a local authority believe a community school is the right option for a particular area they will be able to seek the Secretary of State's consent to publish proposals for such a school. The final decision on proposals made by a local authority will be for the independent schools adjudicator.</p>

	<p pid="c.1922W.8/1">Education maintenance allowance (EMA) was subject to a very comprehensive evaluation. It was piloted by following two cohorts of 16-year-olds in 10 areas for four years from 1999/2000. It was rolled out to a further 36 areas in 2000/01, meaning that it was operating in around one third of the country. The evaluation showed an increase in participation of 16-year-olds in full-time education of 3.8 percent pts. This remains our most robust estimate of the impact of EMA on participation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1922W.8/2">EMA was rolled out for 16-year-olds across the remaining two thirds of the country in September 2004. Administrative figures indicate that there was a 1.9 percent. pts increase in 16-year-old participation between 2003/04 and 2004/05, which is almost in line with the increase that would have been expected from the further roll out of EMA. Therefore, while it is not possible to attribute all of the increase to the roll out of EMA we remain confident in the evaluation estimate of 3.8 percent. pts. 3.8 percent. pts of the 16-year-old cohort in 2004/05 represents just over 25,000 young people.</p>

	<p pid="c.1929W.2/1">The Government are committed to improving services for all children and their families, including those with learning disabilities. The Every Child Matters programme, alongside the implementation of the National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity Services and the Government's SEN strategy Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;, supports and promotes early intervention to help families of very young disabled children and special educational needs. In particular, the Government's Early Support Programme has been funded to improve support to parents of disabled children aged 0&ndash;3 and to provide timely interventions at the very earliest stages of disabilities being identified. All local authorities have now been asked to begin using the Early Support approaches and can access the resource materials to help improve services for families with young disabled children. The roll out of Sure Start Children's Centres across the country will also improve the integrated support provided to families with children under five who are disabled or who have special educational needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.1929W.2/2">In the Staffordshire area there are currently three designated Children's Centres. Although none of these are in the Tamworth constituency, the Tamworth Sure Start Local Programme and another early years centre in the constituency are planning to become children's centres in 2006&ndash;07. Across the county, child development centres (which provide specialist health support services to children with disabilities and SEN) are being co-located with children's centres.</p>
	<p pid="c.1929W.2/3">As well as mainstream services, families of children with learning disabilities are entitled to access a range of specialist local authority and health support services, such as the Parent Partnership service and portage services providing home based support to parents. Details about these local services are not collected centrally and to do so would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="c.1931W.5/1">Ministers have had a number of discussions with a range of organisations in recent years about the different levels of funding for school 6th forms and further education (FE) colleges. The organisations we have met include the Association of Colleges, Sixth Form Colleges' Forum, Trade Unions and a very large number of individual colleges. The funding gap between school sixth forms and further education colleges for like-for-like 16&ndash;19 provision is longstanding. The removal of the FE sector from local authority control, efficiency cuts during mid 1990s and increases in schools funding have all contributed to it. When the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) took over responsibility for funding schools sixth forms in April 2002 it became easier to compare the relative funding.</p>
	<p pid="c.1931W.5/2">The LSC as part of their 'agenda for change' proposals commissioned the Learning and Skills Development Agency (LSDA) to review the funding gap between school sixth forms and colleges. The LSDA report was the first attempt to consider all the elements that contribute to the funding gap and while the report showed a convergence in funding rates it estimated the overall size of the gap to be in the region of 13 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1931W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-16">16 November 2005</phrase> the Secretary of State announced our plans for narrowing the funding gap. We recognise that the funding gap will not be easy to close but we have taken some important steps in the funding package we announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-21">21 October 2005</phrase>. We have confirmed that for young people in FE in 2006/07 we will match the Schools' Minimum Funding Guarantee of 3.4 per cent. We estimate that this, together with other measures to correct technical anomalies, will reduce the gap from 13 per cent. to 8 per cent. by 2006/07. From 2008 we will look to bring consistency to the treatment of student retention and achievement across school sixth forms and colleges which we expect to narrow the gap by a further 3 per cent. Beyond that we will work to establish a common funding approach across the two sectors as part of the Learning and Skills Council's 'agenda for change'.</p>

	<p pid="c.1936W.3/2">For 1998&ndash;99, nursery vouchers were abolished and the grant was added to the total distributed through the Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) methodology. The formula used to distribute funding for under 5s was also changed: prior to 1998&ndash;99, funding had been distributed on the basis of population of under 5s living within an authority; for 1998&ndash;99, 65 per cent. of under 5s funding was distributed on the basis of 4-year-old pupil numbers educated in an authority, with the remainder distributed on the basis of population of under 5s living within an authority. An allowance for sparsity was also introduced into the under 5s formula that year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1936W.3/3">For 2001&ndash;02, Nursery Education Grant for 4-year-olds ceased to be paid as a separate grant: this funding was included in the total distributed through the SSA methodology, and distributed at a flat rate according to the numbers of four year olds in Private Voluntary and Independent Providers.</p>
	<p pid="c.1936W.3/4">For 2002&ndash;03, funding for school sixth forms was transferred to the Learning and Skills Council. There were no changes made to the SSA formula that year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1936W.3/5">For 2003&ndash;04, SSAs were replaced by Formula Spending Shares. Funding for schools provision and LEA central functions was separately identified, and new formulae were introduced to distribute funding for under 5s, primary, secondary and high cost pupils, and funding for the Youth Service and LEA central functions. New indicators were introduced to reflect deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1936W.3/6">For 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, the Dedicated Schools Grant was introduced, with the following distribution criteria: every authority receives an initial basic increase of 5 per cent. per pupil in both 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08; beyond this basic increase, the available increase in funding in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 reflects the priority which the government attaches to meeting the costs of greater personalisation of learning, more practical learning options for 14&ndash;16 pupils, workforce reform and the increased entitlement to early years provision from 33 to 38 weeks. In relation to each of these priorities, the sums allocated in 2006&ndash;07 will be consolidated into the authority's baseline for 2007&ndash;08, and any further sums identified for 2007&ndash;08 will be on top of that amount. Full details are available on the Teachernet website at: <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/schoolfunding/2006-07_funding_arrangements/DSG200608/">www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/schoolfunding/2006&ndash;07_funding_arrangements/DSG200608/</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1936W.3/7">Identification of the effect on primary and secondary funding per pupil caused by these formula changes&mdash;as opposed to changes in data or spending totals&mdash;would only be possible at disproportionate cost. The following table shows the adjusted percentage increase in SSA, FSS or Dedicated Schools Grant as applicable for each year since 1997&ndash;98 for Cambridgeshire.</p>

Legislation requires them to ensure that tests do not assess general academic ability or aptitude for any subject other than the subject in question, and are free of racial or gender bias. The School Admissions Code of Practice gives further guidance on what the law permits. And the Schools Adjudicator has upheld objections to admission arrangements where he has found that there is no established test for, or objective assessment against, published criteria.</p>
	<p pid="c.1939W.0/2">The Specialist Schools Trust also provides advice on admissions, which emphasises that tests should not drift into assessing ability or general aptitude, by checking that the ability profile of those selected by aptitude is representative of all applicants, [and] adjusting testing if it is not.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="c.1943W.6/5" class="indent">The requested information is not available and could only be obtained at a disproportionate cost. I can however provide some general information about the position.</p>
	<p pid="c.1943W.6/6" class="indent">The rules governing the payment of attendance allowance and the care component of disability living allowance preclude the payment of these benefits to people in care homes who have been receiving help with their care home costs from public funds for more than four weeks. Such help includes the &pound;145 per week payments that local authorities in Scotland make to people aged 65 or over in care homes under the free personal care arrangements introduced by the Scottish Executive in July 2002.</p>
	<p pid="c.1943W.6/7" class="indent">We estimate that since that date, receipt of those payments has resulted in the withdrawal of attendance allowance or the care component of disability living allowance from some 6,400 care home residents in Scotland. At current benefit rates, we estimate that maximum annual cost of continuing to pay the benefits to those residents would be about &pound;20 million.</p>

All Departments contribute to the information and services for disabled people, which is now written and co-ordinated within the new Office for Disability Issues (ODI). The Directgov website also features sections on Parenting and Education, through which information on benefits and services can also be accessed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1950W.5/4">The Disability and Carers Service (DCS) does not specifically target information at disabled parents; however, they have an outreach programme of local, regional and national events involving dedicated officers visiting representatives from external customer organisations and groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.1950W.5/5">The purpose of the programme is to ensure that a consistent corporate message is communicated to all customer representative groups and organisations, and to provide accurate information on our benefits and services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1950W.5/6">There is no current provision for this Department to provide core funding to external organisations. However, work is under way on a project to research information and advice required by disabled people and review existing cross-Government provision. The ODI will work across Government to develop proposals to improve the provision of information and advice about services to disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="c.1950W.5/7">The information is in the following table.</p>

	<p pid="c.1951W.2/1">The Department for Work and Pensions takes seriously its responsibilities for managing attendance. We have an attendance management policy in place which was commended by the NAO as meeting best practice. The policy includes guidance for line managers on when ill-health retirement should be considered. Ill-health retirement (IHR) is considered when a member of staff has a recognised health condition which is likely to be permanent and which prevents them from carrying out their normal duties. The criteria for IHR are set by the Principle Civil Service Pension Scheme and were considerably tightened when the pension scheme arrangements were last reviewed. Although applications for IHR are made by managers or staff, decisions are made by the PCSPS medical adviser.</p>

	<p pid="c.1958W.6/2">We are determined to tackle all aspects of misuse of air weapons and are further tightening controls through provisions in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill which will increase the age limit for owning an air weapon to 18 and introduce a new offence of firing beyond the boundaries of premises. We believe it is important to control the easy availability of air weapons and there are also provisions in the Bill to restrict the sale of air weapons by way of trade or business to registered firearms dealers approved by the police and to require the transfer of the weapon to be on a face to face basis.</p>

	<p pid="c.1960W.5/1">The information requested is not available.</p>
	<p pid="c.1960W.5/2">The Home Office's public service agreement (PSA) five specifies re-offending targets in terms of a reduction in the re-offending rate, the start point of which is an offender being discharged from a custodial sentence or starting a community sentence.</p>
	<p pid="c.1960W.5/3">Antisocial behaviour orders, which are civil orders not criminal penalties, are not routinely measured. National re-offending rates are published annually to monitor the Home Office's progress against PSA five. The most recent data are published in 'Adult re-offending: results from the 2002 cohort'. Home Office Statistical Bulletin 25/05&quot;. This is available on the Home Office's website: <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/hosbpubs1.html">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/hosbpubs1.html</a>.</p>

	<p pid="c.1962W.0/1">There are differences in the number of antisocial behaviour orders issued in each criminal justice area (coterminous with police force areas). This is because it is up to local agencies to decide on the most appropriate intervention to tackle antisocial behaviour in their area based on their knowledge of what works best locally. The key issue is whether antisocial behaviour is being reduced on the ground, not which measure is used to achieve this.</p>

	<p pid="c.1963W.2/2">The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) and the accompanying codes of practice, provide that an arrested person may be detained without charge for the purposes of investigating an offence for up to 24-hours initially, extended up to 36-hours by an officer of superintendent rank or above. The police may apply to a magistrate to authorise detention without charge for up to a maximum period of 96-hours.</p>
	<p pid="c.1963W.2/3">The detained person may be issued bail at any time during this process to enable the investigation to continue. There is no limit to the number of times the person may be released subject to bail or be detained for further questioning provided that the total period in custody does not exceed the relevant authorised period of detention. When the officer in charge of the investigation considers that there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, he must inform the custody officer without delay and a decision taken on whether the detained person should be charged or referred to the prosecutor for charge.</p>
	<p pid="c.1963W.2/4">In November 2005 the Department for Education Skills published guidance on dealing with allegations of abuse against teachers and other staff, which was developed in co-operation with the Home Office and Crown Prosecution Service. The guidance is intended to provide effective protection for children, but at the same time to support school staff by ensuring that cases are dealt with as fairly and quickly as possible. It includes indicative target timescales for different parts of the process.</p>
	<p pid="c.1963W.2/5">The Government plans to extend this approach to cover people who work with children in other settings. Implementation will be overseen by the Local Safeguarding Children Boards, to be set up in all local authority areas by April 2006. The guidance can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="c.1964W.5/1">There are no plans at this stage to conduct an investigation into the decisions taken in relation to Mr. Hayes' release or his transfer to open conditions. However, I can say that his case is being reviewed by the probation service in line with the processes in place for addressing those cases where an offender has been charged with a serious further offence. This review will take place despite the fact that Mr. Hayes was not charged with a further offence prior to committing suicide.</p>
	<p pid="c.1964W.5/2">It would be inappropriate to address the circumstances leading to Mr. Hayes' transfer to open conditions and his release in 1995. However, it is the case that most lifers normally spend some time in open conditions in preparation for possible release. The process for transferring a lifer to open conditions involves the independent Parole Board considering a comprehensive range risk assessments from a range of prison and other staff covering the lifer's offence, risk factors and progress during sentence. The panel's advice is then considered by the Secretary of State who will take the final decision on the matter. That process was followed in 1993 in relation to Mr. Hayes' transfer to Leyhill open prison.</p>
	<p pid="c.1964W.5/3">The responsibility for Mr. Hayes' release in 1995 was a matter for the independent Parole Board, not the Secretary of State. The main criterion governing the Parole Board's consideration of his case was whether it was necessary for the protection of the public that he should continue to be confined. The panel that considered his case in 1995 clearly took the view that the level of risk of harm was acceptable and directed his release on life licence.</p>

	<p pid="c.1965W.5/2">The UK Government initiated Operation Airbridge in June 2002 with the aim of achieving a significant reduction in cocaine smuggling by couriers by measures such as outward passenger screening. HMRC worked closely with the Jamaican Constabulary Force and the measures taken, together with the introduction of a visa regime have contributed to a substantial reduction in the number of couriers from Jamaica targeting the UK.</p>

I cannot give further details as to do so would prejudice law enforcement objectives and international relations.

	<p pid="c.1977W.8/1">The National Probation Directorate routinely monitors Drug Treatment and Testing Order (DTTO) effectiveness through analysis of key performance data. This indicates that 89 per cent. of offenders on DTTOs are being retained in treatment for at least 12 weeks, which is the minimum treatment period reported by the National Treatment Agency as having some impact on drug use and offending.</p>
	<p pid="c.1977W.8/2">Completion rates for DTTOs have also improved from 28 per cent. in 2003, as reported by the Public Accounts Committee, to 36 per cent. in 2004&ndash;05. An evaluation of DTTO pilots (Hough et al, 2003) found statistically significant reductions in reconviction rates between DTTO completers and non-completers, as well as between all those starting DTTOs and a comparison group. However, it is not known to what extent these results were due to the programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1977W.8/3">The DTTO has gradually been replaced by the Drug Rehabilitation Requirement (DRR) of the community order from April 2005 for offenders aged 18 or over. The DRR is a more flexible order, aimed at a wider target group and treatment is more tailored to individual need.</p>

The estimates are produced annually from the International Passenger Survey (IPS) where a migrant is defined as a person who, on entry to the UK, states an intention to stay for a year or more. Such intentions may not be realised. On average, just over 70 per cent. of the annual inflows from the accession countries in 2004 occurred in the second half of the year. The estimates are subject to error because they are calculated from a sample survey. For this reason, estimates for some of the smaller migrant inflows from some accession countries have been grouped together.</p>

	<p pid="c.1979W.5/1">The training of scenes of crime officers (SOCOs) is controlled by the Central Police Training and Development Authority (Centrex) at the National Training Centre for Scientific Support to Crime Investigation's (NTC). Initial SOCO training is carried out through two routes. The first is a nine-week residential initial crime-scene investigator training course which covers photography, combined trace evidence theory and practice. The second is a three-week volume crime-scene investigator (VCSI) course covering disciplines required to examine burglary and vehicle crime with the principal focus being on DNA and fingerprint evidence. This course is then followed by the conversion VCSI course which will enhance the existing skills of the VCSI to bring them up to the level of a substantive SOCO. SOCO trainees may then join the development crime-scene investigator course which enhances skills used in specialised areas including the investigation of suspicious fires and also firearms and/or explosives incidents.</p>
	<p pid="c.1979W.5/2">On successful completion of this training, SOCOs are usually posted to a police force on a one to two year development programme. Following this on-the-job training period SOCOs may then attend a further two week course, which covers more detailed skills and techniques. The NIC also offer specialist short courses for SOCOs, including fire investigation, forensic archaeology, facial identification techniques and management training. Once fully qualified, SOCOs are usually required to attend a two week NIC refresher course every five years. This aims to review and refresh knowledge and skills, and keep up to date with new developments in scene of crime analysis.</p>
	<p pid="c.1979W.5/3">The Forensic Science Service (FSS), which incorporated the Metropolitan Police Forensic Science Laboratory from <phrase class="date" code="1996-04-01">1 April 1996</phrase>, is the main supplier of forensic science services to police forces in England and Wales. The FSS employ SOCOs, but it is expected that all SOCOs will be fully qualified before joining the organisation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1983W.2/3">Neighbourhood policing cannot be delivered in isolation, and teams will work closely with a wide range of non-police partners to tackle shared community safety issues. How neighbourhood policing teams will engage with particular partners will vary form area to area, depending on local issues and priorities.</p>

The appointment of the trustees and office-holders of the NNWA is a matter for the association's membership. The Home Office has received a number of representations from activists within the neighbourhood watch movement concerning the governance of the association. These are matters for the NNWA's trustees to consider and resolve. I understand that the NNWA board of trustees have put in hand a consultation process with a view to reviewing and updating the association's governance arrangements later this year.

The Metropolitan Police Service's unique capital city functions, such as anti-terrorist, security and protection work and the policing major national events, contribute to the MPS having a higher ratio than other forces.</p>

	<p pid="c.1988W.5/1">Two major changes are being made to police officer pensions from April 2006: a new pension scheme will apply to new entrants after that date; and the method of financing pension payments to former officers will be changed. The new Police Pension Scheme will still provide high-quality pensions for officers but at reduced cost for forces. The value of the pension benefits accruing to a typical member of the new scheme is estimated to be 7 per cent. of pay less than if they were a member of the old scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.1988W.5/2">Under the new pensions financing arrangements announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-29">29 November 2005</phrase> forces will from April 2006 no longer pay the pensions of their retired officers out of their operating account but from a separate pensions account funded by employer and employee contributions and topped-up as necessary by central Government. The main pensions costs falling to forces' operating budgets will henceforth be in the form of new employer contributions to meet the cost of the accruing future pension liabilities of serving officers. Forces will pay employer contributions at a single national rate to cover the costs of pensions accruing to serving officers in both the current and the new Police Pension Schemes. The rate of employer contributions will be revised every three years following an actuarial assessment. As the proportion of officers who are members of the new scheme grows over the years, it is expected that the level of the employer contributions can be reduced.</p>

	<p pid="c.1990W.2/1">In determining whether a prisoner will be granted Home Detention Curfew (HDC) prison governors consider the risk the prisoner poses to the victim or to members of the public, whether the prisoner's pattern of offending behaviour indicates a likelihood of re-offending during the HDC period, whether the prisoner is likely to comply with the conditions of the curfew and whether the proposed released address is suitable. Consideration of victims' concerns is an important part of the HDC suitability assessment process but Governors will not refuse to grant release to a prisoner purely on the basis that the victim objects to the release.</p>

Progress against the plan is reviewed regularly. At the board's request, the Commission's inspectors made a further, unannounced, visit to Oakhill at the end of November, during which they assessed progress against the action plan as well as the overall effectiveness of the centre. Following the visit, the Commission wrote to the board confirming that Oakhill is a safe and secure environment for the children placed there. The operator is reviewing the action plan, in consultation with the board, in order to achieve further improvements; and the board is continuing to monitor the centre's performance closely.</p>

This will provide the opportunity to create many new community hospitals, as we have done with LIFT projects, and to expand services on existing community hospital sites if more appropriate. The details of the timing and the tender process will be published in a separate document in mid-2006.&quot;</p>

From April 2006, PCTs will have devolved responsibility for the commissioning of primary dental services. This means that they will be responsible for commissioning dental services to reflect the needs of their local areas. All dentists currently practising in the general dental services and personal dental services are legally entitled to new contracts. If any dentists choose not to take up the new contract, PCTs will use the funding in their devolved budgets to re-commission services from other dentists.</p>

	<p pid="c.2019W.3/1">The Department has not received any money for provision of information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, either in the form of fees where the cost of processing a request would have exceeded the appropriate limit or in payment for disbursements.</p>
	<p pid="c.2019W.3/2">The Freedom of Information Act allows for public authorities to determine when the cost of processing a request will exceed the appropriate limit, which for central Government are set at &pound;600 and for the wider public sector &pound;450. In this instance the public authority may decide to either approach the applicant to help them refine their request and where possible to bring it under the appropriate limit. Alternatively, public authorities may charge the applicant the cost of processing the request. There is, however, no obligation for Departments to provide information if the cost of processing the request exceeds the appropriate limit.</p>
	<p pid="c.2019W.3/3">Public authorities may also charge for disbursements when handling requests where it is deemed appropriate.

	<p pid="c.2023W.8/1">Through the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme (PPRS), the Department seeks to achieve a balance between reasonable prices for the national health service and a fair return for the industry to enable it to research, develop and market new and improved medicines. The 2005 scheme provides significant support for research and development (R and D) and innovation through improved allowances to a maximum of 28 percent., of NHS sales including greater incentives for innovative medicines and those for children. The scheme allows for flexibility with regard to the circumstances of individual small companies. The scheme also allows freedom of pricing for new innovative medicines at their United Kingdom launch and allows a return on capital of almost 30 percent., before profits have to be repaid or prices reduced.</p>
	<p pid="c.2023W.8/2">The Department provides the NHS with the support and infrastructure it needs to conduct research for the benefit of patients and the wider public, including clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of potential new medicinal products. This infrastructure is open to our partners, including industry. Implementation of the Department's new strategy for research in the NHS published last month, Best Research for Best Health&quot;, will establish the UK as a world class environment for medical research, development and innovation, through a programme of investment and reforms to enable medicines to be developed more quickly and more cheaply.</p>
	<p pid="c.2023W.8/3">The Department has asked the UK Clinical Research Collaboration, which brings together the public, private and voluntary sector, to hold a futures forum to advise Ministers on priority areas for innovation in healthcare. The aim of this is to foster a better common understanding between policy makers and those developing new therapies on the priority areas for future innovation.</p>

	<p pid="c.2029W.2/1">There are around 86 per cent. of all consultants now working to the new contract. The new contract is still available to all and new appointees, after October 2003, are automatically made to the new contract. Therefore, this percentage will continue to increase.</p>
	<p pid="c.2029W.2/2">The new general medical services (GMS) contract is not a contract of employment but a contract for primary medical care services based on a collective provider model of responsibility. General practitioners traditionally fill the role of contractors for provision, however, increasingly non-general practitioners are taking up such roles. Around 60 per cent. of all practitioners operate under GMS contract.</p>
	<p pid="c.2029W.2/3">There are about 5 per cent. of staff who have not been assimilated and therefore are not yet in receipt of agenda for change payment. We cannot ascertain, however, how many of these have not yet agreed a contract of appointment. This figure excludes national health service foundation trusts and special health authorities.</p>
