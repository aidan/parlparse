Road traffic law and The Highway Code apply as much to cyclists as anyone else. Enforcement of the law is a matter for the police. They can prosecute cyclists who ride dangerously, carelessly, ignore traffic signs or signals, cycle on the pavement or commit any other road traffic offence. These offences carry maximum fines between &pound;500 and &pound;2,500. Also, &pound;30 fixed penalty notices can be issued for cycling on the pavement, by police and community wardens.</p>

	<p pid="a.614W.10/1">The Government note that the Committee had some concerns with the Government's decision to accept the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Scheme (PEFC) as giving assurance of legal and sustainable timber sources. The Government's response to the Committee focused on the Committee's recommendation that the Central Point of Expertise on Timber (CPET):</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.10/2" class="indent">should make clear to PEFC that it would be desirable for it clearly and simply to set out the minimum standards it expects all its national members to conform to if it wants continued approval of its scheme.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.10/3">The Government are generally satisfied that PEFC, having made changes to its scheme, now has a set of requirements that, if implemented by the national schemes endorsed by PEFC, will adequately assure compliance with Government contract requirements for legal and sustainable timber. However, this assessment was made prior to the process of implementation by national schemes being complete, and therefore a public commitment was made to assess the adoption of these changes by the national schemes endorsed by PEFC within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
	<p pid="a.614W.10/4">The assessment of changes made is under way but not complete. It has raised concerns with the interpretation some national schemes have made of the PEFC requirement for achieving consensus in the development and revision of standards. In particular, it is not clear that the voting procedures adopted by some of the schemes reviewed would ensure that decisions could be made only in 'the absence of sustained opposition to substantial issues by any important part of the concerned interests'&mdash;the definition of consensus adopted by PEFC. In the light of further discussions with interested parties the Government have decided that these interim findings merit further scrutiny before resolving the probationary status of PEFC. This will be done as part of a review of the five forest certification schemes first assessed by CPET in 2004. In the meantime, the Government are continuing to accept the PEFC scheme as assuring compliance with Government contract requirements for legal and sustainable timber.</p>

	<p pid="a.617W.9/1">RNAS Yeovilton is the Main Operating Base for the Royal Navy's Lynx and Commando Helicopter Forces and, despite the departure of the Sea Harrier in March of this year, is still the UK's largest (by aircraft number) and busiest military airfield.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.9/2">In 2004 the RAF-led Defence Airfield Review (DAR) identified irreducible spare capacity at RNAS Yeovilton which could be exploited. Following publication of the Review's report in May 2004, a number of Working Groups were formed to take the detailed work forward. The issue of spare capacity at RNAS Yeovilton is being considered by the Programme Belvedere Working Group. Programme Belvedere is responsible for the Joint Helicopter Command basing element of DAR and is currently examining options for the basing of all of the Department's current and future battlefield helicopters. No decisions have yet been made, but the effect of any changes on the local community will be taken into consideration as part of the analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.617W.9/3">The Royal Navy has recently announced the relocation of 727 Naval Air Squadron from Plymouth Roborough Airport to RNAS Yeovilton. As part of its task, the squadron provides Air Experience Flying (AEF) opportunities for younger members of the public. A recent review of AEF concluded that the relocation to RNAS Yeovilton will offer a greater selection of AEF to a much wider audience. The relocation will also result in a small increase in employment opportunities in the local area.</p>

We recognise that the emotional support provided by friends and family is of key importance to our injured soldiers, and visit arrangements for their relatives are managed by the welfare officer of the individual's unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.618W.5/3">The Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM), Birmingham, has allocated six rooms in one wing of the hospital for relatives of service personnel who are listed Very Seriously Ill&quot; (VSI) or Seriously Ill&quot; (SI) where relatives can stay whilst visiting a patient. These rooms are provided free. Depending on availability, RCDM also allow families/relatives of non-listed patients to stay in these rooms, but the priority is of course for the relatives of VSI/SI listed patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.618W.5/4">One exception to this is that the University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust do not allow children under 16 to stay in this accommodation. This is in line with the practices of the trust concerning child protection issues, since the accommodation contains communal facilities which are deemed inappropriate for children as they are used by other adults staying in the accommodation. RCDM therefore can also provide a list of local B&amp;B accommodation which has been inspected by Defence Medical Welfare Services. If there is a medical recommendation that relatives of a patient should stay with them, the MOD provides travel and subsistence costs for two relatives for up to seven days, although this can be extended if medical advice recommends it. If patients are not listed as VSI or SI, the individual's regiment can also pay for family travel. Such decisions are made at individual regiment level.</p>

The Secretary of State has not therefore discussed the matter with Cabinet colleagues but DCMS officials have liaised with the DTI to keep them informed of developments.

	<p pid="a.623W.3/1">DFID's focus in Afghanistan has changed from mainly humanitarian assistance in 2002 to an approach now looking to secure long term development.</p>
	<p pid="a.623W.3/2">The UK is playing a major role in supporting the development of legal livelihood opportunities in Afghanistan. In 2005&ndash;06, DFID spent almost &pound;50 million for this purpose. In 2006&ndash;07 the level of spending is expected to continue at similar levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.623W.3/3">DFID is a major supporter to the National Solidarity Programme, which has helped nearly 7,000 villages prioritise their own development needs, and to plan and implement community-led small scale infrastructure projects. The UK is providing &pound;20 million to the Micro-Finance Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan (MISFA) to provide small loans to the rural poor, particularly women. By funding the National Rural Access Programme (NRAP) the UK is helping those currently dependent on illegal production and processing of drugs, to gain productive employment constructing and repairing essential infrastructure such as roads.</p>
	<p pid="a.623W.3/4">These projects are complemented by a &pound;3 million fund to develop and promote alternative livelihood options for rural Afghans currently economically dependent on opium poppy. The fund is helping to identify local, national and international market opportunities for alternative crop varieties. Under our support for alternative agricultural livelihoods, 26,500 Afghan farmers have received important agricultural inputs.</p>

	<p pid="a.625W.8/16">Approximately 13 per cent. of the South African population are at risk from endemic malaria, another 6 per cent. face the risk of epidemic malaria. The provinces of Mpumulanga, Kwa Zulu-Natal and Limpopo suffer the greatest burden of the disease and it is in these provinces where DDT is used, after its reintroduction in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.8/17">The decline in cases in the table starting in 2001 is noticeable, though there are no reports to substantiate the extent to which this effect was due to the re-introduction of DDT. Both the South African Department of Health and the World Health Organisation (WHO) propose that it is a cost-effective prevention strategy for the provinces which provides a prevention service for a population of some 4.2 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.8/18">DDT use was originally stopped in South Africa because of concerns about its environmental impact. It was reintroduced after careful assessment to demonstrate its effective and safe use. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants states that countries should only use DDT for malaria control under guidance from WHO, which South Africa is doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.625W.8/19">DFID supports the WHO managed Southern AfricaMalaria Control Programme, with a grant of &pound;18 million over six years. The project will finish in 2007. WHO has been successful in working with Governments in the region to revise and update their policies concerning all aspects of malaria control, including the safe and effective use of DDT for indoor residual spraying. A significant amount of material can be accessed at <a href="http://www.malaria.org">http://www.malaria.org</a>.zw/</p>

	<p pid="a.627W.2/2">DFID also looks to specialist agencies such as the World Health Organisation to provide international guidance on the choice of antimalarial drugs for malaria treatment programmes. WHO advises that chloroquine is still effective for certain strains of malaria, but when resistance develops artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) should be used, which is more effective and can delay the emergence of resistance.</p>

	<p pid="a.627W.5/1">As highlighted in the recent United Nations (UN) report, Progress for Children: A ReportCard on Nutrition&quot;, several key Millennium Development targets may be missed due to nutritional problems of children in developing countries. DFID shares the concerns of the report and is convinced of the critical importance of hunger and malnutrition to achieving, not only the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for hunger (Goal 1), but also to achieving other MDGs.</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.5/2">Children who are malnourished in their early years never reach their full physical or mental potential, trapping them in poverty. They are less likely to attend school and, when they do, they perform poorly (Goal 2, Education). Women are often disproportionately affected by food shortages as in the family they often eat last and least. Educating girls and ensuring good nutrition empowers women and girls (Goal 3, Gender Equality). Child mortality (Goal 4) is dramatically affected by hunger, and malnutrition is implicated in two thirds of child deaths. A malnourished mother will give birth to a low weight child and is more likely to suffer complications during pregnancy and birth (Goal 5, Maternal Health). Finally, those who are malnourished are more susceptible to disease and are less likely to attend school and be able to afford medicine (Goal 6, Combating Disease).</p>
	<p pid="a.627W.5/3">DFID is working closely with the UN, other development partners and developing country governments to address the affects of malnutrition on the MDGs. DFID continues to respond to humanitarian needs and has committed &pound;40 million to the immediate relief effort in the Horn of Africa and &pound;67 million to the southern Africa crisis. DFID is also putting in place social protection mechanisms or welfare transfers; cash, food or other forms of in-kind transfers. They provide predictable and long-term assistance for the chronically hungry to help people before a crisis develops. This includes a three-year commitment of &pound;70 million to the Productive Safety Nets Programme which got under way in Ethiopia last year and is helping over 7.2 million people fight hunger and malnutrition.</p>

	<p pid="a.628W.2/1">There is no Millennium Development Goal (MDG) which specifically looks at child malnutrition. However, MDG 1 seeks to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger and MDG 4 seeks to reduce child mortality. An indicator associated with MDG 1 is to reduce the proportion of underweight children by half and under MDG 4 there is an indicator to reduce the mortality of under five-year-olds by two thirds.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.2/2">DFID does not make assessments of when individual goals are likely to be reached. However, we draw on data from the United Nations (UN). For both the indicators mentioned, the UN's latest assessment is that across the developing world as a whole, progress is insufficient to meet the targets by 2015&mdash;and in fact both are described as 'lagging far behind'.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.2/3">DFID measures its progress against a set of public service agreement (PSA) targets, which tie in to the MDGs. In our 2005&ndash;08 PSA, DFID has adopted targets for selected countries in Africa and Asia. We have targets to reduce under-five mortality rates for girls and boys by 24 per 1,000 live births in Asia and by eight per 1,000 live births in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.2/4">Progress against the PSA targets is assessed twice-yearly in DFID's autumn performance reports and departmental reports. The most recent analysis of progress against the PSA targets was published in DFID's departmental report 2006. The target for Asia was judged off track as the number of live births per 1,000 has reduced only by four. It is too early too tell whether the target for Africa will be reached by 2008, though a reduction of four per 1,000 live births has been achieved to date. The departmental report also gives details of how DFID is seeking to improve off track targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.628W.2/5">The departmental report 2006 was laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-09">9 May 2006</phrase>. It is available both in hard copy in the Library of the House of Commons and electronically on DFID's website (<a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/departmental-report/default.asp">http://www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/departmental-report/default.asp</a>).</p>

	<p pid="a.629W.2/1">More than one quarter of all children under the age of five in developing countries are underweight. Poor nutrition contributes to half of the 11 million child deaths each year. Improving nutrition is essential in tackling poverty and is a critical factor in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). At international level the UK Government is one of the biggest donors to UNICEF. DFID has worked closely with UNICEF in the development of its health and nutrition strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.2/2">UNICEF's Progress for Children: A Report Card on Nutrition&quot;, states that achieving improved nutrition requires action across sectors. DFID's approach to nutrition at country level has always been that it cannot be dealt with in isolation. DFID's support for better nutrition therefore encompasses improved food security, support for agricultural production, fisheries and market access, better water and sanitation, education and strengthening health services for women and children.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.2/3">Particular strategies are implemented in areas of high HIV prevalence, following natural disasters and during conflict. To be successful, programmes to improve nutritional status must be integrated into wider country led poverty reduction strategies.</p>

	<p pid="a.629W.5/1">There is no international agreement on what constitutes state fragility. A common way of estimating fragility is derived from the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessments (CPIA). CPIA scores divide low-income countries into five categories of performance plus an unranked group. The lowest two categories plus the unranked group are used by DFID and other donors as a list of fragile countries. Our understanding of fragility set out in our January 2005 policy paper 'Why we need to work more effectively in fragile states' is therefore similar to that of the Failed State Index&quot; but not the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.5/2">Our policy on fragile states sets out how we can most effectively tackle the challenges and the underlying causes of weakness. Our approach includes support to early warning systems, analysis to understand the underlying political drivers of fragility and the funding of interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of those states where we work. But aid alone is not enough, and we work with others to help ensure that the international system as a whole works together to reduce fragility and address its causes.</p>
	<p pid="a.629W.5/3">In Africa we are working in the Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe, Somalia and Sierra Leone&mdash;all states identified by the Failed States Index&quot;. In each of these we have tailored our support to best tackle the fragility and support poverty reduction and growth.</p>

	<p pid="a.631W.8/1">In 2004&ndash;05 fraud across the benefit system was estimated to be less that 1 per cent. of total benefit expenditure at around &pound;900 million; which is less than &pound;1 billion for the first time since systematic measurement of fraud began.</p>
	<p pid="a.631W.8/2">We have firm targets to reduce fraud and error in the benefits which are most vulnerable to fraud. The target for reducing fraud and error in income support and jobseeker's allowance for working age people was 33 per cent. by March 2004, and 50 per cent. by March 2006. National Statistics published in December 2005 show that by March 2005, we had reduced fraud and error in income support and jobseeker's allowance by 44 per cent. Looking at fraud alone, this has reduced by more than two thirds compared to the 1998 baseline figure of 10.4 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.631W.8/3">We have set a challenging target to reduce levels of housing benefit fraud and error for working age claimants by 25 per cent. by 2006, and to maintain the 25 per cent. reduction by March 2008 against the 2002&ndash;03 baseline year. National Statistics published in January 2006 shows that by March 2005, housing benefit fraud has fallen by around 30 per cent. over a two-year period. However, over the same period there has been a 40 per cent. increase in customer error. The net effect of this is that fraud and error for working age claimants is now reported to be 2 per cent. above the baseline.</p>
	<p pid="a.631W.8/4">We are also taking steps to reduce customer error. We have an on-going programme of addressing complexity in benefits to make benefit rules easier and simpler for our customers to understand. Our processes and customer handling methods aim to make the claim making process straightforward thus lessening the opportunities for customers to make mistakes or leave out important information.</p>
	<p pid="a.631W.8/5">This shows we are getting results in preventing, detecting and deterring fraud. We have achieved this by a variety of methods. In 2004&ndash;05, through improved data matching, nearly 300,000 data anomalies were identified. The Targeting Fraud campaign has helped to increase public awareness of the problem of fraud. We now have a more appropriate sanctions regime. In 2004&ndash;05, in partnership with local authorities, we imposed nearly 43,000 prosecutions and sanctions&mdash;more than ever before and a fourfold increase since 1998. We have tightened our procedures to root out identity fraud. People are now required to verify their identity before they are allocated a national insurance number or have access to the benefits system. We have maintained the National Benefit Fraud Hotline, and for every &pound;1 spent on its running costs, we identify overpayments of over &pound;9 in defrauded benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.631W.8/6">Despite these good results, we are not complacent and will maintain this hard work. Our efforts in the future will focus on using new technology available to us to stop fraud earlier before it enters the benefit system; increasing our ability to data match to include data from the private sector; exploring the use of new technologies, such as voice risk analysis; the proposed identity card, which will be a useful tool to combat identity and other frauds by verifying identity more effectively; continuing to warn fraudsters and potential fraudsters through the Targeting Benefit Fraud campaign and maintaining the National Benefit Fraud Hotline.</p>

One of the first of those sites is shared with the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service Station at Northland Road on the Foyle West Bank and became operational earlier this month.</p>
	<p pid="a.642W.6/2">Initially, one ambulance from Altnagelvin Station will be assigned to Northland Road during daytime hours seven days per week and on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. In addition, when Altnagelvin has more than one ambulance available and the Northland Road location requires cover, the additional vehicle will be dynamically deployed there. The effectiveness of these arrangements will be reviewed after one month's operation and regularly thereafter.

A progress report was published in December 2004. There are no targets for reducing differentials between Catholics and Protestants in respect of housing allocation. All social housing is allocated on the basis of need.</p>
	<p pid="a.644W.6/2">We remain committed to eliminating the differentials in unemployment rates between the two communities and will take into account recent information and research.

	<p pid="a.655W.2/1">The Review of Public Administration does not require a reduction in the number of schools. Rationalisation of the estate is required because of the reduction in the number of pupils, which is expected to decline further over the coming years. There is no timetable for the reduction in the number of schools in each board area. Where it is proposed to close a school or amalgamate two or more schools, this will follow the normal process, which involves the publication of a development proposal, a two-month consultation period, followed by a decision by the Department for Education.</p>

	<p pid="a.658W.2/1">During 2004&mdash;the most recent year for which verified compliance data are currently available&mdash;seven out of 35 relevant Water Service waste water treatment works did not meet the requirements of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD) as they did not have the required secondary treatment.

	<p pid="a.658W.2/2">Initial assessment of 2005 data indicates an improvement in compliance compared with 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.658W.2/3">Over the three year period to 2007&ndash;08 some &pound;290 million is being invested in upgrading Waste Water Treatment Works (WWTWs) to ensure compliance with EC directive standards. Since the compliance assessment of 2004, the Water Service Capital Works Programme has delivered new WWTWs at Culmore, Omagh, Cookstown and Ballyclare, all of which are now capable of producing UWWTD quality effluent. The new works at Larne was completed in early 2006 and, in addition, Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey are scheduled for completion in mid-2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.658W.2/4">In addition, work has commenced on the new North Coast WWTW to resolve compliance requirements at Portrush, Portstewart and Coleraine. In addition, Water Service is pursuing the use of public private partnership (PPP) investment to complement conventionally funded programmes. Initial PPP programmes for wastewater and sludge treatment, currently estimated at some &pound;122 million, are being taken forward for detailed planning and procurement.</p>

(68145). I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.2/4" class="indent">Water Service recognises that not all of its waste water treatment works are fully compliant with the effluent discharge standards set out in the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. The nine locations which the Commission identified as having failed to meet the Directive requirements to have secondary treatment in place by <phrase class="date" code="2000-12-31">31 December 2000</phrase> are at Bangor, Donaghadee, Carrickfergus, Coleraine, Londonderry, Larne, Newtownabbey, Omagh and Portrush. A major capital investment programme is currently underway across Northern Ireland to address deficiencies in the sewerage infrastructure and to achieve compliance as quickly as possible. Since 2000/01, investment on improvements to waste water treatment works has increased tenfold, from approximately &pound;12 million per year to some &pound;122 million per year in 2005/06. Work has been completed at Londonderry, Omagh and Larne and significant levels of expenditure will continue to be invested as Water Service strives to meet the requirements as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.659W.2/5" class="indent">It is not possible to specify the level of fines that could be imposed by the European Commission on a particular Member State. Such fines take into account the seriousness and duration of the breach of compliance, the ability of the Member State to pay, and the profile of the Member State within the European Union. They may comprise a lump sum and, or, a penalty.</p>

	<p pid="a.663W.5/2">The Home Office has not received any research on the level of alcohol-related crime and antisocial behaviour in Kent since December 2005. From the information collected on recorded crime, it is not possible to identify those offences which are alcohol-related. Such offences are not specifically defined by statute and details of the individual circumstances of offences do not feature in the data series.</p>
	<p pid="a.663W.5/3">Antisocial behaviour is not measured by incident data but through a measure of people's perceptions of antisocial behaviour in their local area using the data from the British Crime Survey (BCS). The size of the sample in the BCS means that we can not provide reliable data for geographical areas smaller than police force areas. Due to changes in the measure of antisocial behaviour used police force area data that are comparable to the national figures are only available for 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="a.663W.5/4">The following table sets out the national figures for the last four years and the comparable figure for Kent police.</p>
	<p pid="a.663W.5/5">Data on the percentage of people perceiving problems with drunk and rowdy behaviour is only produced and reported at the national level; in 2004&ndash;05 22 per cent. of people in England and Wales perceived there to be problems with drunk and rowdy behaviour in their local area. The equivalent figures are not available for police force areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.664W.2/1">The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) Disclosure process does not make a distinction between UK nationals and EU or other nationals where it is considered appropriate to undertake a Disclosure application. For posts in schools, applicants from overseas are subject to the same vetting procedures as UK applicants.</p>
	<p pid="a.664W.2/2">However, where staff are recruited from countries outside the UK, the CRB's checks of the police national computer, local police force intelligence, the Protection of Children Act list and List 99 may not be sufficient, particularly where job applicants are newly arrived or have recently lived abroad. The CRB has an overseas information service to provide help with this. If it is considered that a Disclosure may not represent a complete picture of an individual's non-UK record the overseas information service provides guidance on how to obtain further information from a current list of 21 EU and non-EU countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.665W.0/1">UK internet service providers (ISPs) continue to lead the world in tackling this issue and the majority are committed to taking all steps available to them to prevent users accessing illegal images of child abuse. This is evidenced, for example, by their commitment to and funding of the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) and the reduction in the proportion of illegal sites reported to the IWF that are hosted in the UK from 18 per cent. in 1997 to 0.4 per cent. in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.0/2">Recently, it has become technically feasible for ISPs to block home users' access to websites irrespective of where in the world they are hosted. It is clear from the various meetings that Ministers have had with the ISPs, that the industry has the will to implement solutions to block these websites. Currently, all the 3G mobile network operators block their mobile customers from accessing these sites and the biggest ISPs (who between them provide over 90 per cent. of domestic broadband connections) are either currently blocking or have plans to by the end of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.665W.0/3">We recognise the progress that has been made as a result of the industry's commitment and investment so far. However, 90 per cent. of connections is not enough and we are setting a target that by the end of 2007, all ISPs offering broadband internet connectivity to the UK general public put in place technical measures that prevent their customers accessing websites containing illegal images of child abuse identified by the IWF. For new ISPs or services, we would expect them to put in place measures within nine months of offering the service to the public. If it appears that we are not going to meet our target through co-operation, we will review the options for stopping UK residents accessing websites on the IWF list.</p>

	<p pid="a.669W.8/1">Government Departments and any other agency, including local authorities, with independent prosecuting authority for particular criminal offences are required to notify the police service in the area in which the offence was committed of any intention to prosecute such an offence. The police service enters details of such prosecutions onto the Police National Computer (PNC).

This may be non conviction information or intelligence. Guidance is available as to considerations prior to disclosure of such information.</p>
	<p pid="a.669W.8/3">The Police National Database, to be delivered by the IMPACT Programme, will facilitate the sharing of operational information between forces by giving authorised officers access to a data repository comprising copies of records held in individual force systems.

One of the requirements of registration is that offenders notify to the police a home address and any other address where more than seven days a year are spent, as well as any changes to this information. Moreover, if an offender claims to be homeless or otherwise of 'no fixed abode' then they must provide the address or location of a place in the UK where they can be regularly found. Failure to supply that information, or supplying false information, is an offence punishable by up to five years imprisonment.</p>

	<p pid="a.675W.2/1">We have reduced the period of time that registered sex offenders are allowed to spend overseas without notifying the police. Now, all registered sex offenders are required to notify the police of any foreign travel of three days duration or more. The police will use that information to decide whether it is necessary to take any action to prevent travel. That action can include applying for foreign travel orders, which we introduced in the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The orders can be sought where the police consider that the offender poses a risk of serious sexual harm to children under 16 in an overseas country.</p>
	<p pid="a.675W.2/2">Since 1997, we have been able to prosecute in the British courts those who have offended against children overseas. In brief, if an act is an offence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and constitutes an offence in the country where it was committed, then the offender can be convicted and punished for their crimes in this country on their return.</p>

Guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) is that the registered keeper or person named by the keeper as driver at the time of the alleged offence should be allowed to view photographic evidence on request.

	<p pid="a.682W.9/1">For <i>(a)</i> , sitting magistrates, the Judicial Studies Board has included diversity within the Magistrates' National Training Initiative (MNTI 2) competence framework. This framework contains a number of knowledge and performance elements requiring magistrates to demonstrate an understanding of, among other things, Diversity and fair treatment issues, including the use of non-discriminatory language&quot; and The potential impact of your background and personal prejudices on decision making&quot;. Sitting magistrates are regularly appraised against these competences.</p>
	<p pid="a.682W.9/2">For <i>(b)</i> , new magistrates, they must complete induction training before being allowed to sit. Diversity is a part of this programme. Following induction training, new magistrates undertake mentored sittings to identify any further training needs, using the MNTI 2 competence framework. Any needs so identified are addressed at local level. The new magistrate is first appraised after sitting for 12 to 18 months, and thereafter further training follows as for sitting magistrates.</p>

	<p pid="a.683W.5/1">The Sentencing Guidelines Council promulgates guidelines to enable all criminal courts to approach the sentencing of offenders from a common starting point to promote consistency in sentencing. All courts are required to take the guidelines of the Sentencing Guidelines Council into account when sentencing offenders and have to give reasons for departing from them in any particular case. Discrepancies in sentencing in all criminal courts are therefore minimised through the use of these guidelines. Currently magistrates courts use the Magistrates Courts Sentencing Guidelines issued in 2004 by the Magistrates Association but these are to be replaced by guidelines produced by the Sentencing Guidelines Council. Appealing against sentence to the Crown court is another mechanism for ensuring consistency of sentencing in the magistrates courts. Consistency in sentencing is further promoted through the publication of judgments on appeals to the Court of Appeal from the Crown court.</p>

In particular, NRPB carried out a study for the European Commission (EUR 11523&mdash;a preliminary assessment of the radiological impact of the Chernobyl reactor accident on the population of the European Community) which was published in 1988.

Since this time, NRPB has not carried out any further assessments of possible health effects from the Chernobyl accident. However, the NRPB has commented on other papers in the public domain, for example in the response to the Report of the Committee Examining Radiation Risks of Internal Emitters&quot; which is available on the HPA's website at:</p>

The effect of the Chernobyl accident on thyroid cancers was also considered in a paper and editorial in volume 37 of the European Journal of Cancer in 1991.</p>

This duty is set out in Schedule 3, Part 7, of The National Health Service (General Dental Services Contracts) Regulations 2005 (SI 2005/3361) and in Schedule 3, Part 7 of The National Health Service (Personal Dental Services Agreements) Regulations 2005 (SI2005/3373).

	<p pid="a.695W.6/2">In relation to Herceptin, the national cancer director has made the Secretary of State aware of the reasons why oncologists specialising in breast cancer have found the preliminary findings of recent trials so encouraging. For example:</p>
	<p pid="a.695W.6/3" class="indent">the studies were large trials, involving over 12,000 women, and appeared to have been conducted to a high standard;</p>
	<p pid="a.695W.6/4" class="indent">the findings in relation to disease free survival from all of the studies were remarkably consistent adding to the robustness of the data;</p>
	<p pid="a.695W.6/5" class="indent">both the HERA trial (carried out in Europe) and the combined American trial (NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831) had reported significant benefits in distant recurrence free survival which could be an early surrogate for improved overall survival in breast cancer trials;</p>
	<p pid="a.695W.6/6" class="indent">in general the absolute benefits of adjuvant therapies are small in the early years but increase over time;</p>
	<p pid="a.695W.6/7" class="indent">the benefits of Herceptin are additional to those seen with standard adjuvant therapies;</p>
	<p pid="a.695W.6/8" class="indent">the cardiac side-effects of Herceptin were well recognised and experience suggested that they were manageable and were outweighed by the benefits of Herceptin.</p>
	<p pid="a.695W.6/9">However, he has also made clear that the data is immature and no-one can therefore be certain of the long term benefits or harms of using Herceptin to treat early breast cancer.</p>

	<p pid="a.696W.5/1">Primary care trusts (PCTs) do not make prescribing decisions. It is for individual clinicians, in discussion with a patient, to decide whether or not it is suitable to prescribe a specific drug. PCTs may need to be involved to decide whether to support the clinician's decision and supply the drug at NHS expense. PCTs need to take a range of factors into account, including local factors, when considering the funding of drugs and other treatments.</p>
	<p pid="a.696W.5/2">Guidance has not been issued to primary care trusts in England on the circumstances under which it is acceptable to refuse to prescribe Herceptin to patients with early stage breast cancer. However, the national cancer research institute (NCRI) has produced a United Kingdom clinical guideline on the use of Herceptin for early breast cancer. This provides useful information to those considering prescribing Herceptin for this indication in advance of a decision on licensing and the publication 'National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence' guidance. The NCRI guidance was brought to the attention of PCTs via Issue 300 of the chief executive's bulletin published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-13">13 January 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.697W.5/1">Herceptin is a centrally authorised product across the European Union (EU). This means that, rather than each country's licensing body assessing the safety and efficacy of this drug, it is assessed by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA)&mdash;which has representation from each member state's licensing body. The regulatory indication approved by the EMEA applies to all member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.697W.5/2">Herceptin currently has an EU-wide licence for use treating advanced breast cancer and an application is currently being processed by the EMEA to extend this licence to include the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer. At the end of April, the EMEA's committee for medicinal products for human use recommended that Herceptin be approved for this indication. The next stage in the regulatory process is for the European Commission to evaluate this recommendation with a view to issuing marketing authorisation in the EU. A decision is expected in a few weeks.</p>

However, evidence shows that up to 50 per cent. of prescription medicines for long-term conditions are not being taken as intended, and that adverse reactions to medicines are implicated in 5 to 7 per cent. of hospital admissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.699W.6/2">A number of factors would need to be taken into account in making such an assessment. Through improved compliance, patients may benefit more from their treatment, both in terms of length and quality of life. More medicines may be prescribed, but those that are prescribed would be less likely to be wasted. Better management of a patient's condition may reduce the need for more specialist care, including admission to hospital. The provision of effective medication review processes would also have costs in terms of service delivery, for example through payments under the quality and outcomes framework for general medical services or fees to community pharmacists for medicine usage reviews.</p>

	<p pid="a.700W.5/2">To build this new centre in the most cost-effective way NBS proposes to consolidate some services into the new Filton site from centres in Birmingham, Southampton and Plymouth.

	<p pid="a.700W.5/3">The NBS do not propose to close any centres, including the Birmingham centre. They will continue to provide critical services from Birmingham. For example, the centre will continue to have a local blood bank to meet orders for blood. This will ensure that there is no adverse impact on patients around Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.700W.5/4">The NBS centre in Birmingham will require development, even after these changes, to ensure that those services which remain in Birmingham are provided from buildings which are fit for purpose. A number of options are being considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.705W.5/1">Clinical trials data submitted by the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) for Strattera (atomoxetine) was evaluated at the time of licensing to ensure that it met appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy to support its use in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>
	<p pid="a.705W.5/2">Since the marketing of Strattera, the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee, the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM), and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have kept its safety under close review. As new data have emerged, product information for prescribers and patients has been updated and advice has been issued.</p>
	<p pid="a.705W.5/3">In February 2006, the MHRA led a European review of the risks and benefits of Strattera and sought advice from the CHM and an expert working group whose membership included those with expertise in child and adolescent psychiatry and lay representation. Doctors and patients were informed of the following conclusions of this review:</p>
	<p pid="a.705W.5/4" class="indent">overall the balance of risks and benefits of Strattera in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents remains positive;</p>
	<p pid="a.705W.5/5" class="indent">prescribers should be reminded that Strattera should be initiated only by and under the supervision of a specialist;</p>
	<p pid="a.705W.5/6" class="indent">warnings on the risk of seizures and electrocardiogram QT prolongation (abnormal heart rhythm) should be included in the product information; and</p>
	<p pid="a.705W.5/7" class="indent">the current warnings in the product information about the risk of liver disorders and suicidal thoughts and behaviour accurately reflect the available data.</p>
	<p pid="a.705W.5/8">Full guidance on prescribing and the use of Strattera, including possible side effects, is provided in the product information for prescribers (the Summary of Product Characteristics) and patients (Patient Information Leaflet).</p>
	<p pid="a.705W.5/9">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recently published a technology appraisal on methylphenidate, atomoxetine and dexamfetamine for the treatment of ADHD. During the development of this appraisal NICE was fully informed about the European review and the available data on the safety and efficacy of atomoxetine in the treatment of ADHD.</p>
	<p pid="a.705W.5/10">The MAH was also requested to put in place a risk management plan for Strattera, which includes the conduct of new research to better characterise and further investigate its safety profile.</p>

	<p pid="a.707W.5/1">There was no average length of time in England for which patients requiring dialysis waited for treatment in 2005. The national service framework for renal services notes that because the progression of chronic kidney disease is frequently slow clinicians can often predict the point when the person will need to start renal replacement therapy (RRT), which consists of haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or transplantation.</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.5/2">Professional consensus is that the optimal time required to prepare a patient and their carers for RRT is around one year. This is why good practice suggests that those with established renal failure requiring dialysis have timely and appropriate surgery for vascular or peritoneal dialysis access to improve outcomes, minimise complications and maximise longevity of the access site. However, research shows that a third of people present less than a month before requiring RRT, and the outcomes for this group are less good than for those who present earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.5/3">If someone presents as an emergency or it is not possible to establish mature access before dialysis is required an intravenous catheter can be inserted for dialysis at extremely short notice, usually into a vein deep in the patients neck.</p>

	<p pid="a.707W.8/1">The national service framework for renal services notes that the total number of people receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been taken as a proxy measure for the prevalence of established renal failure (ERF). However it is generally agreed that in addition there will be people in the general population with ERF which has not been diagnosed and whose need for RRT has not been recognised. People who have been identified as requiring dialysis receive it, on an emergency basis if necessary. Research shows that a third of people present less than a month before requiring RRT.</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.8/2">RRT includes transplantation, haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Data on the numbers of people requiring dialysis are not collected or held centrally. Data from the most recent national survey of renal units, commissioned by the Department from the renal registry of the Renal Association, show that in December 2002, 11,789 patients in England were receiving haemodialysis; 4,605 peritoneal dialysis, and 14,104 people had a transplant in the year ending December 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.707W.8/3">For some patients with established renal failure, who are suffering from other, terminal, conditions, haemodialysis may not be an appropriate treatment, as it can add to the distress of these patients without extending life. These patients should be presented with the option of a properly managed palliative care plan.</p>

	<p pid="a.710W.5/4" class="indent">The latest available Welsh ward electorate counts are for December 2005, the electorate counts for the last available 10 years (1996 to 2005) are shown in the attached tables. Table 1 includes wards within the parliamentary constituency of the Vale of Clwyd. Table 2 for the local authority of Denbighshire, includes wards for the whole of the parliamentary constituency of the Vale of Clwyd (as included in Table 1) and also wards which are within part of the parliamentary constituencies of Clwyd South and Clwyd West.</p>
	<p pid="a.710W.5/5" class="indent">The ward electorate counts are for parliamentary electors, including attainers. Local government electorate counts are not available at ward level. Thus the figures in Table 1 and Table 2 do not sum to the combined count of Parliamentary or local electors referred to as 'total electorate', for Vale of Clwyd and Denbighshire in reply to your previous parliamentary question Official Report No. 149, column 450 of <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-11">11 May 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.710W.5/6" class="indent">It should be noted that the number of people eligible to vote is not the same as the resident population aged 18 and over. There are numerous reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors have a differential impact from area to area.</p>

	<p pid="a.718W.2/1">As Deputy Minister for Women and Equality, I sit on the inter-ministerial group for domestic violence (chaired by my hon. Friend Baroness Scotland of Ashtal), which performance-manages the cross-Government National Domestic Violence Delivery Plan by reviewing progress at quarterly meetings. This is the mechanism for improving the services available to children who have been involved in domestic violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.718W.2/2">The Government office for Yorkshire and the Humber ensures that the National Domestic Violence Delivery Plan is disseminated and considered by all regional and local stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.718W.2/3">Currently, services available to children who have been involved in domestic violence (DV) in Kingston upon Hull include:</p>
	<p pid="a.718W.2/4" class="indent">Generic provision, support and access to information is available through the Children's Services Family Resource Centres and the council's internet service.</p>
	<p pid="a.718W.2/5" class="indent">Hull pilot for the early identification of risk indicators of DV in private and public law proceedings is an initiative in a response to Section 120 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002. Its purpose is to alert the court, in cases of DV, at the earliest opportunity in order that an early assessment of risk indicators can be made and developed. The Hull Domestic Abuse Project (DAP) will carry out these assessments. It is the intention to roll the pilot out across the courts in the Humber region.</p>
	<p pid="a.718W.2/6" class="indent">Hull children's fund provides resources for direct work with young children who are resident in the Women's Aid refuge and also on an outreach basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.718W.2/7" class="indent">NSPCC specialist staff are working with young males who have experienced or witnessed DV.</p>
	<p pid="a.718W.2/8" class="indent">The NSPCC, NCH, Barnados and Women's Centres across Hull are also providing support services to affected children.</p>
	<p pid="a.718W.2/9" class="indent">Women's Aid and the women's services also carry out work within the local primary and secondary schools raising awareness and discussing safety issues around DV.</p>
	<p pid="a.718W.2/10" class="indent">Women's Aid provides refuge facilities for families.</p>
	<p pid="a.718W.2/11" class="indent">The Hull DAP also carries out Multi Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARAC's) on a 6 weekly basis. This serves the purpose of identifying high-risk victims and enables the sharing of information within a multi-agency setting to take place in order to give further support.</p>

	<p pid="a.718W.5/1">We believe that the voluntary approach is the best way to achieve lasting change through working alongside the business community, employers, trade unions and the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) to promote equal pay reviews. We supported Opportunity Now's recent Benchmarking Report which contains case studies, advice, action plans and recommendations on how employers can address gender equality and diversity in the workplace, including tackling the gender pay gap. We also support an equal pay panel of experts, led by the TUC.</p>
	<p pid="a.718W.5/2">The Women and Work Commission's independent report 'Shaping a Fairer Future', recently examined the merits of mandatory equal pay reviews in addressing the gender pay gap but did not recommend a regulatory approach.</p>

The duty on the employer to check applies regardless of whether the teacher is working in an independent or maintained school and regardless of whether another employer has already made a check. An employer can fulfil their duty to check by obtaining written confirmation from a supply agency that the agency has made the check.</p>
	<p pid="a.721W.3/4">For a non-teaching position, working with children or vulnerable adults in a registered setting, a CRB check is also required.

	<p pid="a.721W.6/1">The information sharing index will aid more effective prevention and early intervention as a tool to support practitioners to improve outcomes for children, and is therefore a key element of the Every Child Matters programme. The planned timetable for the implementation of the index ensures that it will be delivered in a practical and realistic way. The key elements are:</p>
	<p pid="a.721W.6/2" class="indent">From the summer of 2006, local authorities will begin a readiness assessment process, involving all relevant local partners. This assessment process will ensure that local areas will be ready to receive the index when it is made available to them. At that time, we will also have the results of the data matching trials which will inform our data sourcing and deployment plans and provide better information about the quality of key data sources and the nature of the task, both locally and nationally, to best ensure that the index data will be of good quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.721W.6/3" class="indent">During the summer and autumn of 2006, there will be a public consultation on draft regulations and statutory guidance to be made under section 12 of the Children Act 2004, which will govern the operation of the index.</p>
	<p pid="a.721W.6/4" class="indent">Subject to the will of Parliament, we expect regulations to be in force by early 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.721W.6/5" class="indent">From late spring or early summer of 2007, we will have created initial records for each child in England, drawn from key national data sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.721W.6/6" class="indent">The first index release, which will include those initial records, will be deployed to a first wave of local authorities by the summer of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.721W.6/7" class="indent">The index will be rolled out progressively so that, by the end of 2008, it will be available in all local authorities in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.721W.6/8">We will provide funding and support to local authorities for them to manage local implementation of the index.</p>

	<p pid="a.722W.2/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-08">8 December 2005</phrase>, I announced the Government's plan to implement a fully operational information sharing index in all areas of England by the end of 2008. This will enable practitioners delivering services to children to identify and contact one anothereasily and quickly, so they can share relevant information about children who need services.</p>
	<p pid="a.722W.2/2">The estimated set-up costs are &pound;224 million over the next three years. This includes the costs of adapting existing systems that will supply the data to the index and ensuring that data is accurate; adapting the day-to-day systems used by practitioners so they can access the index from those systems; introducing robust arrangements to ensure security, and training staff to use the index properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.722W.2/3">Estimated operating costs, thereafter, will be &pound;41 million per year. Most of this will pay for the additional staff needed to ensure the ongoing security, accuracy and audit of the index.</p>
	<p pid="a.722W.2/4">To date, approximately &pound;8.5 million has been spent since the start of the feasibility phase of the index project in February 2004.</p>

	<p pid="a.724W.0/1">A list of departmental publications sent automatically to schools between 2002 and 2005 is detailed in the following table. Where a publication has been sent to all primary and all secondary schools it will appear in the table for both primary and secondary schools. The Department does not keep distribution lists of publications sent to all schools prior to 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.724W.0/2">The cost of distribution for publications automatically sent to all schools was c. &pound;300,000 per annum, however, the Department ceased automatically mailings of publications to schools in England on a phased basis between April and December 2004. Discussions with head teachers, and detailed research, showed that schools wanted to be able to choose the printed publications they needed, when they needed them, and to be able to order multiple copies.</p>
	<p pid="a.724W.0/3">The online ordering system enables schools to choose whether to download electronic copies or order the paper based publications they need at the right time for them and in the multiples they require. This system is linked directly to the fulfilment service and an existing telephone ordering line. A fortnightly email service to schools informs them of new and important publications.</p>
	<p pid="a.724W.0/4">This has resulted in schools being able to order a wider variety of publications from the Department, putting schools in direct control of what they receive, when they receive it.</p>

We have an action plan in place to address these disproportionate levels of exclusion, which will also have an impact on Black children and parents affected by the White Paper proposals. This plan includes ensuring that equality issues are embedded in key policy areas; sharing good practice with local authorities and recommending that they take specific actions, such as analysing exclusions data and taking remedial action if appropriate; and targeting individual local authorities, where data shows particularly high disproportionality, with support to reduce it.</p>
	<p pid="a.730W.3/3">The reasons for the existing over-representation of some minority ethnic groups in the exclusions figures are complex. We are currently undertaking a Priority Review to establish the reasons for this disparity and what further can be done to reduce it.</p>

	<p pid="a.731W.2/1">The Department is strengthening financial education as part of our 14&ndash;19 reforms. Financial capability education will be taught more explicitly in the new functional mathematics component of GCSE mathematics. Functional mathematics will also form part of the core of the new 14&ndash;19 specialised Diplomas. These initiatives support existing opportunities in Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE), Citizenship, Business Studies and Careers Education for improving young people's understanding of financial issues. We have worked with QCA to offer schools new units of work to support financial capability education, available at <a href="http://www.qca.org.uk/pshe">www.qca.org.uk/pshe</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.731W.2/2">The Department's Skills for Life&quot; Strategy has provided in excess of &pound;3 million since 2001 to fund a financial literacy programme, which is run on behalf of the Government by the Basic Skills Agency (BSA). We have allocated &pound;60 million a year for the three academic years from September 2005 to support a new focus on enterprise education in all secondary schools in England. We work with the Personal Finance Education Group (PREG) to develop and disseminate resources materials to support teachers in the classroom. The Department is also working closely with the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to ensure that its work supports the educational aspects of the National Strategy for Financial Capability.</p>

	<p pid="a.732W.2/1">Many secondary schools support language learning in primary schools by sharing teacher expertise, resource and use of facilities. In April 2006 the Department provided additional funding of &pound;30,000 to every existing Specialist Language College and suggested a proportion of the funding be used to support the development and delivery of language learning programmes in primary schools. In addition &pound;49.5 million will be distributed among all local authorities during the financial years 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08 to support the implementation of languages at Key Stage 2. The Department suggested part of this funding could be used to develop links between primary and secondary schools to support programmes. In October 2005 the Department launched the Key Stage 2 Framework for Languages which contains guidance for schools on progression of language learning within Key Stage 2 and into Key Stage 3.</p>

	<p pid="a.735W.3/1">In June 2005, the Government responded comprehensively to the Education and Skills Select Committee report.</p>
	<p pid="a.735W.3/2">The Government already had substantial plans to take action on many of the recommendations contained in the Select Committee's report, and many of these would fall into a category 'action taken in response'. Our most recent analysis shows that action is being taken in response to 27 of the recommendations; 18 have been met; and there were four where the Committee's recommendation did not call for any action. For six of the recommendations the necessary action is under way but long-term, making the term 'met' less easy to measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.735W.3/3">The Government made clear in their response that they did not agree with six of the recommendations. We rejected the Committee's assertion (recommendation 6) that no over-arching strategy was in place, although we have since published the Green Paper Reducing Re-Offending Through Skills and Employment&quot; on which we are still consulting; although we agree that offenders with special needs should be supported, we do not necessarily agree that the introduction of special educational needs coordinators and learning support assistants to every adult prison is the right solution (recommendations 11 and 12); we see no case for guaranteeing prisoners an entitlement to learning and skills that is greater than the entitlements available for the general population (recommendation 14); progress made in recent years in improving learning and skills in prisons addresses the Committee's points in recommendation 20; and, although the Government did not believe at the time of their response, that the proposal to equalise pay across all activities was practical, we are consulting on this matter through the Green Paper (recommendation 47).</p>

	<p pid="a.736W.3/2">The number of teachers needed over time will vary from one area to another and schools and local authorities will need to decide how they manage numbers of teacher and support staff posts on the basis of anticipated local needs. In many cases there will be no need for redundancies because natural wastage and reduced numbers of newly-qualified teachers will play an important part in managing staff numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.3/3">To help schools and local authorities who will need to manage the effects of falling rolls we have published a web-based toolkit which offers a range of practical advice and guidance. The toolkit can be found at <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/fallingrolls">www.teachernet.gov.uk/fallingrolls</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.3/4">As far as teachers are concerned, the Department's supply modelling has allowed for falling rolls by reducing the number of teacher training places in 2005/06 for both primary and secondary teaching. However, overall judgments on the number of teachers required also depend on other factors such as those leaving and returning to the profession and this will vary from one area to another. Because of these factors and local variations teacher numbers have continued to rise. On a full time equivalent basis, their numbers rose by 3,500 to 435,400 in England in January 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.739W.0/15">Since 1990, the pattern for entry to teaching has been that about 20 per cent. do not enter in the year after they qualify, this falls substantially in the second year with between 8&ndash;10 per cent. not entering teaching service in the long term; the figures for the 2003 qualifiers are expected to follow this historical pattern and fall to a similar level.</p>

	<p pid="a.740W.3/19">Central Government capital support for investment in schools has increased from under &pound;700 million in 1996&ndash;97 to &pound;5.8 billion this year and will rise further to over &pound;6.3 billion by 2007&ndash;08. Progress is being made year by year in improving the quality of the school building stock. The bulk of schools capital is now allocated by formula to authorities and schools so that they can address their local priorities, including the replacement of decayed temporary accommodation, on which we have set a high priority. Given the high levels of funding, authorities have the opportunity to replace temporary classrooms where they are considered to be unsuitable.</p>
	<p pid="a.740W.3/20">Modern, high quality mobile or demountable classrooms provide a good environment for teaching and learning where there is short term need. They might, for instance, be needed to cope with a short term increase in pupil numbers, or where extensive remodelling or rebuilding of permanent accommodation means providing temporary accommodation on the school site, rather than transporting children elsewhere.</p>

A newmethod of allocating students to subjects was introduced in 2002/03, which means that figures for this and later years are not comparable with those for earlier years. The tables therefore show 1994/95 compared with 2001/02, and 2002/03 compared with later years.</p>

	<p pid="a.744W.2/1">We estimate that around 6,000 EU nationals studying full-time in English institutions, who have not satisfied the existing provisions as migrant workers or self-employed persons, could in principle be eligible to claim maintenance support (consisting of loans and grants) in the 2006/07 academic year as a result of changes we have made following the ECJ ruling in the Bidar case. It is therefore expected that the majority of additional EU nationals who will be eligible to claim maintenance support in 2006/07 would have been eligible even if directive 2004/38 had not come into force. We anticipate the directive will add a small number of people to those who are already eligible to claim maintenance support.</p>

	<p pid="a.746W.5/2">There was overwhelming support from respondents for the Government to issue new, clearer guidance for professionals on when to share information with social services and the police to protect sexually active children from harm and abuse, in line with the recommendation in the Bichard Inquiry Report.</p>
	<p pid="a.746W.5/3">Nine out of 245 respondents to the consultation disagreed or strongly disagreed that the Government should attempt to set out a clearer policy for professionals including the health service and youth workers on when to share information with social services and the police to protect sexually active children from harm and abuse. 23 out of 235 respondents disagreed that there was a case for information (including confidential information) always being shared in some circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.746W.5/4">The guidance contained in 'Working Together' on sharing information about underage sexual activity recognises professionals' need to balance their duty of confidentiality to young people who access sexual services with the need to safeguard sexually active under 16-year-olds. 'Working Together' sets out a framework to help professionals judge when to share information on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.754W.5/2">The impact of the positive and negative subsidy system on housing revenue accounts is redistributive. The balance of individual local authority housing revenue accounts is based on assumptions made by central Government, and means that some accounts are in surplus while others are in deficit. These assumptions bear no relationship to local rents or local authority decisions. The subsidy system allows surpluses in some local authorities housing revenue accounts to be used to support other areas where there are deficits.

	<p pid="a.758W.2/2">Housing debt is funded through the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) subsidy system. Where a local authority transfers its housing to an RSL and the receipt it receives is not sufficient to repay the outstanding debt attributable to the housing, the Office will make a one-off payment where the debt is held with the Public Works Loans Board. The one-off payment is made to discharge the Office's continued liability, through the HRA, to pay subsidy on an authority's housing attributable debt that remains after transfer. Since 1997 the Office has repaid &pound;1.787 billion of local authority debt (including early redemption fees) in this way. There is voted provision of &pound;616 million per year from 2005&ndash;06 to 2007&ndash;08 for overhanging debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.2/3">To date, the Government has paid &pound;9.11 million as gap funding grant. &pound;182 million has been made available over the 2004 Spending Review period for gap funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.758W.2/4">Overhanging debt is capital AME (Annually Managed Expenditure); gap funding is resource DEL (Departmental Expenditure Limit).</p>

	<p pid="a.764W.5/2">Consultation was carried out from October 2005 to January 2006 on the principle of establishing the Home Condition Report register, and the requirement that reports become valid only once they are entered onto it. Provisions for the register will be set out in regulations to be made shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.764W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.8/2">The following table shows both the total capital receipts the disposal of all housing assets and from right-to-buy sales of local authority dwellings in England in the years from 1997&ndash;98 onwards, net of discount and as reported by local authorities. These are capital receipts and not income into the authority's Housing Revenue Account, which is generated by, for instance, rental income.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.8/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not estimate future right-to-buy receipts but does estimate future housing capital receipts. Estimates are subject to a number of volatile factors such as the state of the housing market, lending rates, amounts of disposable income and stock condition, and are kept under constant review.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.8/4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister collects data on total pooled receipts and total amounts set aside by housing authorities. These figures include the amounts arising from right-to-buy sales alongside amounts relating to other housing capital receipts, but the amounts relating to right-to-buy sales are not separately identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.8/5">The amount of income received by local authorities from the sale of housing assets will not be quite equal to their housing capital receipts less the amount they are obliged to set-aside or pool. Rather, the housing capital receipt, such as a right-to-buy receipt, will first be reduced by, for instance, the administration costs associated with the disposal and any other deduction to the capital receipt the authority may make, such as clawing back the cost of improvement to the asset in previous years. It is the value of this reduced capital receipt that is then used as the basis for the calculation of the set-aside or pooling liability.</p>
	<p pid="a.764W.8/6">As can be seen from the following table, since 1997 the Government have consistently invested more in housing than was received in receipts. In 2004&ndash;05 the amount paid to government from all housing receipts (not just right-to-buy) was &pound;1.7 billion. The amount invested in housing was &pound;4.1 billion i.e. almost 2&frac12; times the amount received. The ratio of amount invested to amount received is expected to increase substantially in the future.</p>

To improve this situation the ODPM revised Part E in 2003 and the evidence is that compliance rates are now much higher, in excess of 90 per cent.</p>
