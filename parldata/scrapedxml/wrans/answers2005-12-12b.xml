	<p pid="b.1584W.6/2">The Highways Agency will seek to minimise the impact of the new A120 road improvement on agricultural holdings and farm practices, within a balanced environmental design strategy. The strategy, which is still in development stage, will consider agricultural land take, the severance of individual or associated farm units and the creation of non-viable land parcels, whilst maintaining farm access routes, or providing acceptable alternatives where necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.1584W.9/1">We have no statistics for the number of animals currently requiring re-homing. However the introduction of the welfare offence is not expected to increase overall numbers significantly. We believe that the majority of sanctuaries are run satisfactory, providing a valuable service to animal welfare. However, there is evidence that a minority pose a risk. The Animal Welfare Bill will enable this risk to be addressed through the introduction of secondary legislation. The Regulatory Impact Assessment published in conjunction with the Bill proposes that all sanctuaries should be required to register with local authorities on the basis of a veterinary assessment and be subject to a code of practice by 2009. The regulation of animal sanctuaries under the Animal Welfare Bill will enable reliable data to be built up by local authorities so that high-risk establishments can be identified and inspected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1584W.9/2">We propose to work closely with welfare organisations and representatives of animal sanctuaries in preparing secondary legislation. This consultation will enable us to refine our thinking on key issues such as the criteria for regulating a sanctuary and the guidance which the code will give on rehabilitation and re-homing. The draft regulations and code will be subject to public consultation and there will also be the opportunity for discussion in Parliament.</p>

In 2003, Sheffield Hallam university evaluated the comparative energy, environmental and socio-economic costs and benefits of biodiesel production in the UK. The Central Science Laboratory carried out two studies. The first, in 2002, looked at the prospects and potential impacts of liquid biofuels on UK agriculture, the farmed environment, landscape and rural economy. The second, in 2003, looked at industry support, cost of carbon savings and agricultural implications. Cambridge university is currently carrying out a review of the economics of energy crops, including those used for biofuels. DEFRA also commissions research supporting the sustainable development of arable crops, including oilseed rape.</p>

	<p pid="b.1590W.5/1">The evidence in this area is complex. It is difficult to pinpoint sources of infection for individual herd breakdowns, particularly when infection by wildlife is a possibility, and the regional variation in the incidence of the disease complicates the overall picture. It is, therefore, not possible to put a precise figure on the number of cases of bovine TB (bTB) that can be attributed to cattle-to-cattle transmission (or to any other source of infection). It is clear, however, that &quot;cattle-to-cattle transmission is of critical importance&quot; (Independent Scientific Group on cattle TB, 3rd report, p41) and in low bTB incidence areas there is evidence that it could be responsible for around 80 per cent. or more of cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.1590W.5/2">The evidence from work recently submitted for publication does suggest that cattle-to-cattle transmission is the main cause of TB spread in areas currently free, or relatively free, of cattle TB.</p>
	<p pid="b.1590W.5/3">But the situation is quite different in the high incidence areas of the country where 85 to 90 per cent. of all confirmed breakdowns occur. Some herds in these areas are also infected by purchased cattle, but wildlife is a major source of new herd infection and in some counties it may be a more important source than cattle.</p>

	<p pid="b.1593W.8/1">The UK has two targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In 1997 the UK Government set a national goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. The 2003 Energy White Paper also set out a longer term goal of putting the UK on a path to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by some 60 per cent. by 2050, with real progress by 2020.</p>

	<p pid="b.1595W.15/1">Section 27 of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 came into force on <phrase class="date" code="">7 June</phrase> this year, and provides clarification that chewing gum and smoking-related materials are litter for the purposes of Part 4 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. It has always been the case that Defra considered these items to be litter but the legislation now confirms this for the avoidance of any doubt among practitioners.</p>
	<p pid="b.1595W.15/2">Tackling these forms of litter is particularly important given the huge cost to local authorities of removing gum once it has become impacted, and the findings of the Local Environmental Quality Survey of England (LEQSE) which show that in both 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05 smokers materials were found on 79 per cent. of the sites surveyed and so is one of the most widespread types of litter. Section 27 operates so as to encourage action to be taken by local authorities against these forms of litter through awareness-raising, public campaigns and enforcement action including the use of fixed penalty notices.</p>

	<p pid="b.1596W.5/2">Our policy is that emissions reductions from reduced deforestation should be part of developing countries' participation in climate change agreements. Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica, supported by other countries making up the Coalition of Rainforest Nations, have proposed to the 11th Conference of Parties to the United Nations framework convention on climate change which met in Montreal from <phrase class="date" code="">28 November</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase> this year that reductions below a national baseline could be used as a measure of achievement. This is an interesting proposal, although significant technical issues remain, including on how baselines would in practice be defined and reductions relative to them measured. These questions need to be resolved before this or any other proposal could provide a basis for quantification of emissions saved, and hence valuation in carbon markets. Participation under the Kyoto protocol would be after the first commitment period, for which the rules are already set. We are working with other parties to establish a process to resolve the technical and related policy questions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1601W.11/1">The sites are being assessed against the criteria set out in the landfill protocol, originally developed for the disposal of carcases during the 2001 foot and mouth disease outbreak, and which is being updated as a generic protocol for the disposal of animal carcases from exotic animal disease outbreaks. Sites will be fully engineered landfills and be subject to a Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) permit and thus compliant with the strict requirements of The Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations 2002 (as amended). A pre requisite for obtaining a PPC permit is compliance with the Environment Agency's policy for the protection of groundwater (PPG).</p>
	<p pid="b.1601W.11/2">The protocol requires the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.1601W.11/3" class="indent">A good and robust leachate management system at the site ensuring the control of leachate head and the efficient collection, treatment and disposal of very high organic loading leachate for the next 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1601W.11/4" class="indent">The site monitoring plan demonstrate that there is adequate monitoring of groundwater, surface water and leachate and there are contingency plans in place, should the monitoring indicate a potential problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.1601W.11/5" class="indent">That the gas management infrastructure should be planned to collect gas from the whole of the site and to be installed as soon as possible after final levels have been achieved. Combustion of the collected gas is essential.</p>
	<p pid="b.1601W.11/6" class="indent">A bird deterrent and management plan and an odour and vermin control plan should be in place and its effectiveness reviewed and tailored as appropriate to account for the disposal of animal carcases.</p>
	<p pid="b.1601W.11/7" class="indent">In addition to these environmental and public health criteria, which are assessed by the Environment Agency, the site will also be assessed by the State Veterinary Service for any biosecurity risk and only sites that do not pose a risk of disease spread will be used.</p>

	<p pid="b.1603W.9/1">Figures are available for the estimated total amount of paper and plastic materials consumed within the UK and therefore likely to become waste. No reliable estimates are available on the relative amounts from household and commercial premises. Consumption is defined as UK production plus imports minus exports. The Confederation of Paper Industries estimate that the UK consumed between 12.4 and 12.9 million tonnes of paper and board in each of the last five years. The British Plastics Federation estimate that the total amount of plastics consumed within the UK in 2001 was 4.7 million tonnes and this is expected to steadily increase to 5.3 million tonnes in 2005. All plastics are potentially recyclable, but the extent to which this occurs will depend on economic and logistic factors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1603W.9/2">A packaging study by Valpak, the UK's largest packaging compliance scheme, has estimated that around 75 per cent. of paper packaging waste arises in the commercial and industrial waste streams and 25 per cent. originates from domestic households. Likewise, 36 per cent. of plastic packaging waste arises in the commercial and industrial waste streams and 64 per cent. comes from households.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-12-12b.31618.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-12-12b.1609W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" colnum="1609W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051212/text/51212w07.htm#51212w07.html_spnew7">
	<p pid="b.1609W.2/1">The definition of waste in force in the United Kingdom is the definition in Article 1<i>(a)</i> of the Waste Framework Directive (as amended). Whether or not a substance is discarded as waste, and when waste ceases to be waste, are matters which must be determined on the facts of the case and the interpretation of the law is a matter for the courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued several judgments on the definition of waste which are binding on member states and their &quot;competent authorities&quot;. The composting of waste is classified as a waste recovery operation under the Directive. This means that composting must be carried out under the terms of a waste management licence issued by, or a waste management licensing exemption registered with, the Environment Agency (England and Wales).</p>
	<p pid="b.1609W.2/2">The ECJ has ruled that</p>
	<p pid="b.1609W.2/3" class="indent">&quot;..whether [a substance] is waste, must be determined in the light of all the circumstances, regard being had to the aim of the Directive and the need to ensure that its effectiveness is not undermined.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1609W.2/4">In practice, this means that waste does not cease to be waste until it has undergone a complete recovery operation and has been fully recovered within the meaning of the directive. A complete recovery operation is one which has the effect of transforming waste into a product which is wholly interchangeable with another product and requires no additional regulation or supervision beyond that applicable to the product which it is replacing. Waste has not undergone a complete recovery operation if, after the operation has been carried out, it continues to present a danger typical of waste (e.g. it continues to be contaminated).</p>
	<p pid="b.1609W.2/5">The Environment Agency considers that <i>(a)</i> source-segregated waste which, after composting, meets a recognised and suitable quality standard (e.g. BSI PAS 100) is likely to be fully recovered within the meaning of the directive; and <i>(b)</i> mixed waste which is composted is likely to remain waste until it is used in a further recovery operation (e.g. land treatment resulting in agricultural benefit or ecological improvement subject to control by the Agency under a licence or registered licensing exemption). These considerations are being taken into account in work currently being undertaken by the Environment Agency and the Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP) on the development of a quality protocol for waste composting.</p>
	<p pid="b.1609W.2/6">The Department supports the development of such protocols at national level and advocates their development at a European Union level. A key objective of our doing so is to enable our competent authorities, and those engaged in the recovery of waste, to determine with a high degree of certainty the point at which waste has been fully recovered for the purposes of the Waste Framework Directive and has ceased to be waste. This was reflected in the UK's response of <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-15">15 February 2005</phrase> to the European Commission's questionnaire on possible amendments to the directive linked to the Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste. In its response, the UK identified municipal/household waste which is recovered by means of composting or other biological transformation processes as a priority waste stream in this context. The UK's response is available at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/thematicstrat/questionnaire-ukresponse.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/thematicstrat/questionnaire-ukresponse.pdf</a></p>

	<p pid="b.1611W.2/2">The water supply to Tamworth is artificially fluoridated and there have been no breaches of the health based standard for fluoride of 1.5 mg/l in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1611W.2/3">Although unrelated to the quality of the drinking water supply, there has been recent local concern about the Glascote service reservoir which stores treated water. A nearby residential property is the subject of flooding and, as a consequence, the structural integrity of the reservoir was questioned. South Staffordshire Water plc have inspected and tested the reservoir and there is no evidence of leakage or damage. The flooding problem at the property is now being dealt with by Tamworth borough council.</p>

	<p pid="b.1612W.2/1">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, issued a Security and Emergency Measures Direction in 1998 which sets requirements on water companies in relation to emergency planning and in dealing with water emergencies. In the event of a failure of the piped water supply, water companies are required to give priority to the domestic needs of the sick, the elderly, the disabled, hospitals, schools and other vulnerable sectors of the population. The minimum amount of water to be provided to all domestic customers when such a failure occurs is 10 litres per head per day. Those vulnerable customers who are housebound will be provided with supplies of bottled water. Water companies maintain a list of their vulnerable customers based on information provided by the customers, and in liaison with local authorities, health agencies and other support bodies.</p>

This includes consideration of the impacts schemes may have on both residential and commercial properties.

However, outside London only slightly over 20 per cent. of the local bus network receives revenue subsidy.

	<p pid="b.1623W.5/1">VGA, as the UK vehicle type approval authority, has the responsibility to test and certify vehicles and components to a range of EU Directives and ECE regulations. Part of that certification requires that VGA verifies the &quot;conformity of production&quot; arrangements of the manufacturer to ensure production vehicles and components continue to meet the standards. This is done through an audit of the manufacturer's quality management systems. With the introduction of ISO 9000&mdash;quality management systems&mdash;manufacturers requested VGA to extend the auditing service to include the issue of certificates. Therefore VGA became accredited by UKAS (United Kingdom Accreditation Service) to enable it to issue recognised certificates and be able to offer automotive related organisations management systems certification services on a commercial basis.</p>

Circuits installed with four suppliers BT, Cable &amp; Wireless, Colt and O2 take outgoing calls depending on the destination of the call, the time of day and the tariffs available. These services are supplied under rolling contracts and the tariffs are regularly reviewed. The routing was adjusted earlier this year to take advantage of reduced tariffs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1624W.6/1">When the tsunami struck last December, the Government immediately allocated &pound;75 million for relief and recovery needs. Nearly &pound;67 million of this has been programmed through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross Movement and non-governmental organisations and DFID direct action. Of this figure, all but approximately &pound;800,000 has been disbursed and this is earmarked to cover costs already incurred, and ongoing costs such as secondments of experts to United Nations agencies. Up to &pound;7.5 million has been earmarked for disaster risk reduction initiatives in affected countries. This allocation will be disbursed, against agreed programme activities into 2006. It is now likely that the remaining &pound;500,000 of the &pound;75 million allocated is not required for relief and recovery activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1624W.6/2">DFID has allocated &pound;65 million to meet reconstruction needs in tsunami-affected areas. A total of &pound;41 million of this has been committed. In Indonesia, we have so far programmed &pound;34.3 million, including two contributions to the Multi Donor Trust Fund of &pound;5.6 million and &pound;20 million. A further &pound;5 million has been committed for technical assistance to help ensure timely, accountable and equitable provision of reconstruction assistance and rebuilding of livelihoods. A total of &pound;2.8 million has been committed to Sri Lanka, and to date &pound;1.5 million of this has been programmed to support the capacity of the North East Provincial Council (NEPC) to plan and implement programmes and services. A total of &pound;3 million has been committed to India to support the United Nations Recovery Framework for Post Tsunami Rehabilitation and Reconstruction. The remaining &pound;24 million of the &pound;65 million allocation for reconstruction has not yet been committed.</p>

A number of territories, for example Montserrat and St. Helena, still need significant levels of support to help meet basic needs and promote growth and, in the case of Pitcairn, a need now for budgetary aid to cover essential recurrent expenditure. Declining levels of support, for example in Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, follow increased prosperity and economic growth.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-12-12b.32207.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2005-12-12b.1628W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="1628W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051212/text/51212w13.htm#51212w13.html_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.1628W.2/1">Globally, access to AIDS treatment for children is low, despite the fact that, in the absence of treatment, 50 per cent. of children with HIV will die before their second birthday. In Mozambique and Malawi, for example, 5 per cent. and 7 per cent. of those on treatment are children, whereas equitable access would require coverage of approximately 13 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1628W.2/2">DFID has committed &pound;150 million for support to children affected by AIDS from 2005&ndash;08. This funding will not be put through new instruments. However, this funding is being used to support a range of activities that will promote children's access to prevention and treatment, as well as to protection and care. For example, we are providing &pound;10 million to Medecins Sans Frontieres for anti-retroviral roll out and prevention in South Africa.</p>
	<p pid="b.1628W.2/3">We are also funding research into better medicines and diagnostics for children, such as the &pound;4.8 million trial DFID and the Medical Research Council are co-funding on anti-retroviral treatment for children. An earlier DFID funded trial in Zambia has proven the efficacy of a cheap antibiotic, Cotrimoxazole, in reducing mortality in HIV positive children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1628W.2/4">DFID will continue to ensure the needs of children and other vulnerable groups are addressed as we work towards scaling up to universal access to treatment by 2010, as agreed by the G8 and by the Millennium Review Summit. DFID is supporting UNICEF's Global Campaign on Children and AIDS that sets a target of providing treatment to 80 per cent. of children in need by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.1629W.0/1">Through its contribution of 18 per cent. to the European Commission's (EC) budget, the UK Government provided &pound;5.4 million to Colombia over the three years 2001 to 2003 (the last years for which data is available). The EC supports the search for peace and the targeting of the roots and causes of the conflict. The following four sectors are priorities for EC co-operation with Colombia: social/economic development and poverty reduction; alternative livelihoods for cocoa farmers; public sector administrative and judicial reform; and the support and promotion of human rights. Specific areas of work include: initiatives to promote peace; resettlement of people uprooted by the conflict, support to make export sectors more efficient; reinforcement of the state of law and democracy; the protection of the environment and conservation of natural resources; landmines clearance; and science and technology research.</p>
	<p pid="b.1629W.0/2">Colombia does not benefit from the concessional lending by the World Bank (WB) and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) that is funded by donors such as the UK, given its relatively high income. It does, however, borrow from the WB and IDB on near commercial terms. The UK, therefore, contributes indirectly as a shareholder of these organisations. A table of current projects supported by IDB and WB are as follows.</p>

	<p pid="b.1633W.2/1">DFID officials have met on many occasions with Government officials and civil society organisations to discuss the HIV epidemic in both Swaziland and Lesotho.</p>
	<p pid="b.1633W.2/2">In both countries, DFID is providing support for both prevention and care activities through a programme managed by the Southern Africa Development Community. The project is providing &pound;7.5 million for the sub-region, of which &pound;2 million is being spent in Lesotho and Swaziland respectively. The work focuses upon treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs), behaviour change and the promotion of condom use. DFID has also financed key posts within the Department of Health. In Swaziland, DFID support targets the provision of Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) and in Lesotho it is directed towards monitoring and evaluation through the AIDS secretariat in the Ministry of Health.</p>
	<p pid="b.1633W.2/3">In Lesotho, DFID is providing additional support (&pound;1.7 million 2005&ndash;08) to develop the National AIDS Commission so that the country can develop a more co-ordinated response. This support is combined with assistance to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), to strengthen civil society and with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), to help the Government build work on HIV/AIDS into its economic and development planning.</p>
	<p pid="b.1633W.2/4">Outside of these project activities, we have most frequently discussed issues of HIV and AIDS with officials in the National AIDS Councils of the respective countries. Because the epidemic continues to infect many people, our discussions concentrate on both prevention and care.</p>
	<p pid="b.1633W.2/5">In Somalia, resources from the Global Fund were committed in June 2005. DFID is providing &pound;00,000 to the UNDP to bridge the gap until Global Fund resources come online. DFID support to the UNDP will help to build capacity to the National AIDS Commissions in Somaliland and Puntland, and should benefit the entire population. The funding will also comprise support to Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) and Anti-retroviral (ARV) programmes, which are likely to reach 1,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1633W.2/6">We are also contributing funding to UNAIDS for a 'five country strategy' which runs from 2004&ndash;06. The aim of the programme is to improve co-ordination on HIV and AIDS across all five countries. Approximately &pound;950,000 will go to Somalia which equates to 26 per cent. of the total funding package for this programme.</p>

St. Helena continues to have access to the project for the protection and enhancement of its biodiversity. Work to mitigate the effects on and to further protect the island's biodiversity is also a key component of the project to introduce air access to St. Helena.</p>

The British High Commission in Dhaka closely monitors incidents of religious persecution and intolerance.

	<p pid="b.1645W.6/1">We have consistently demonstrated our support to the victims of human rights violations in Colombia. We have done so through interventions with the Government of Colombia over specific human rights cases, either through the EU or bilaterally; through financial and political support to the Colombia office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) and its activities to improve the human rights situation; and through support to British and Colombian NGOs working in human rights in Colombia, including through projects funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Global Conflict Prevention Pool and the Global Opportunities Fund. Ministers regularly meet representatives of churches, trade unions and other organisations in civil society to address their concerns. We have regularly used high level visits between the UK and Colombia to highlight the importance we and the EU as a whole attach to human rights, especially to the rights of victims of the armed conflict to truth, justice and reparation. The most recent example of this was during the visit to the UK of Vice-President Santos on <phrase class="date" code="">28 November</phrase> when he met my noble Friend, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. We will continue to ensure that human rights are at the heart of our policy, and indeed EU policy, towards the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.1646W.2/1">The human rights situation in Colombia remains grave. While we acknowledge that there has been a reduction in recent years in some human rights abuses, there is still a lot that needs to be done to improve the situation. During the visit to the UK by Vice-President Santos in late November, my noble Friend, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office raised human rights issues with him. We have made it plain to the Government of Colombia that we are willing to work with them to help bring an improvement to the situation in the country, either as a bilateral partner or through our EU membership. We will continue to look for ways to bring about change, working with other partners such as the UN and civil society, to achieve this goal.</p>

However, EC funding is increasingly linked to progress, for example, on action plans, and leaders agreed at the 2005 Barcelona Summit to enhance their efforts in areas such as support for political pluralism and meeting international standards in the conduct of elections.

	<p pid="b.1649W.2/1">Progress towards Euro-Mediterranean free trade has been one of the main achievements of Euro-Mediterranean relations since the Euro-Mediterranean process was launched in 1995. Association Agreements covering free trade have been negotiated with all Southern Mediterranean partners. The liberalisation of trade in goods in the Mediterranean region is now a reality and most industrial goods originating in Southern Mediterranean countries enjoy duty free access to the EU. Conversely, Mediterranean countries are progressively dismantling tariffs on imports of EU industrial goods over a period of 12 years. The adoption in 2003 of a protocol on rules of origin has allowed economic operators to cumulate processing made in different countries of the region in order to obtain preferential treatment for their products more easily. Progress has also been made towards the conclusion of South-South agreements (eg the Agadir free trade agreement between Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco in 2004).</p>
	<p pid="b.1649W.2/2">At the recent Euro-Mediterranean Summit, Partners reiterated their commitment to the creation of a Free Trade Area by 2010 and agreed a set of measures to achieve this goal. This included the imminent launch of regional negotiations on services and investment and on agricultural products.</p>

	<p pid="b.1651W.8/2">Sensitive products are a new concept which form part of the Doha Development Agenda's Framework Agreement. The number and treatment of sensitive products have yet to be decided in the context of the Doha Development Agenda and therefore they have yet to be applied. However, in line with Framework Agreement these sensitive products will be available to all WTO members&mdash;developing and developed&mdash;and will be subject to lesser tariff cuts than non-sensitive products.</p>
	<p pid="b.1651W.8/3">In line with the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries&mdash;based on the fact this is a development Round&mdash;developing countries will also have access to &quot;special products&quot;. These special products are in addition to sensitive products and should be based on criteria of food security, livelihood security and rural development needs. Special products will be eligible for more flexible treatment, which has yet to be agreed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1652W.5/1">The term &quot;rendition&quot; is currently being used to describe informal transfers of individuals in a wide range of circumstances. Whether any particular &quot;rendition&quot; is lawful depends on the facts of each individual case. Where we are requested to assist another State and our assistance would be lawful, we will decide whether or not to assist taking into account all the circumstances. We would not assist in any case if to do so would put us in breach of UK law or our international obligations. In particular, we would not facilitate the transfer of an individual from or through the UK to another State where there were grounds to believe that the person would face a real risk of torture.</p>

	<p pid="b.1652W.5/3">Additional research covering the remainder of the period of office of this Government (i.e. back to May 1997) has been undertaken. This shows there were some renditions via the UK during that period. Specifically, we have identified two definite occasions in 1998 when requests were made by the US. These occasions, for which records have been identified, were for transfer to the US for the person concerned to stand trial there. As the then Home Secretary I agreed these requests.</p>
	<p pid="b.1652W.5/4">Although confirmatory records have yet to be identified, we believe that there may have been one or two other possible cases, also in 1998, which concerned requests by the US but for transfer to a third country. We have information on one such case which is incomplete and does not tell us whether the request was refused. We also have information on a case based on the recollection of officials involved in such matters, without any confirmatory records. The officials' recollection is that the case was refused. It is likely, but not certain, that the two cases are in fact one and the same. I have some recollection of such a case, but, given the passage of time, I cannot be certain. The search for records continues.</p>

We also believe that there should only be a minimal number of sensitive products. The number of sensitive products must be considered in light of the 'treatment' which is agreed for sensitive products and in the context of the tariff reduction formula. Only then is it possible to consider the impact of a certain number of sensitive products.</p>

	<p pid="b.1658W.8/1">It is difficult to give absolutely firm figures of business start-ups. One measure is the number of registrations for VAT but VAT registrations do not capture all start-up activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold. Only 1.8 million out of 4.3 million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1658W.8/2">According to Barclays bank's latest survey of business creation, which includes non-VAT registered firms, there were 428,200 business start-ups in England in 2003 and a further 425,100 in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.1658W.8/3">Barclays data show that there were 5,300 business start-ups in Northamptonshire in 2003 and a further 5,100 in 2004. Data for counties are not available before 2003. Data for Kettering constituency are not provided, since Barclays do not produce sub-county level data at present. Data for 2005 will be available in spring 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.1658W.8/4">DTI figures based solely on VAT registrations for England, Northamptonshire county and Kettering constituency are shown as follows for 1997 to 2004. Data for 2005 will be available in autumn 2006.</p>

In some product sectors, such as toys, there is specific safety legislation, and new General Product Safety Regulations came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-01">1 October 2005</phrase>. Other Departments offer advice on e.g. fire safety in the home, but generally other organisations are better placed to take forward safety campaigning and to provide advice on safety in the home.</p>

	<p pid="b.1662W.2/1">The Government believe that security of energy supply is best delivered by ensuring that market mechanisms provide incentives to energy suppliers to meet demand. This includes financial penalties, which can be very stringent depending on the overall balance of the market, where suppliers fail to balance the amount of electricity supplied by them to the national grid with the amount of electricity used by their customers. Responsibility for deciding how best to meet demand&mdash;for example, by restoring mothballed generating plants or building up coal stocks or back-up fuel for gas-fired power stations&mdash;rests with the electricity supply industry itself.</p>

	<p pid="b.1663W.2/1">The UK's presidency of the EU's Council of Ministers continues until the end of December; progress to date has been made on a number of fronts. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.1663W.2/2">EU Market Liberalisation: The best means we have of ensuring our energy supplies is the development of an open and competitive EU energy market. It is for this reason that I pressed the Competition Commissioner to undertake a competition inquiry into the state of the European Energy Market in electricity and gas (announced in June 2005). The UK has also supported the Commission's report on implementation of the existing directives in electricity and gas. The interim report of the competition inquiry and the 2005 implementation report were both published on <phrase class="date" code="">15 November</phrase>. The UK facilitated substantive discussion of the two reports at the Energy Council on <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>, where, on the basis of presentations by Commissioners Kroes and Piebalgs, the presidency was able to conclude that secure electricity and gas supplies at competitive prices, delivered on open, transparent and competitive markets are crucial to Europe's competitiveness and that full implementation of the second electricity and gas directives was paramount.</p>
	<p pid="b.1663W.2/3">There have also been important steps taken on Energy Efficiency. At the UK's Energy Council on <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>, energy efficiency was recognised as making an important contribution to all three primary energy objectives of competitive markets, security of supply and tackling climate change. Negotiations have been ongoing during the UK presidency on the Energy End-Use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive. We have worked hard to reach a Council position under our presidency and we expect the final agreement of the European Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase>. In addition, we have pushed for more long-term action, facilitating discussion of the Commission's Green Paper on energy efficiency. We also held a successful conference on Energy Efficiency on 2&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="">3 November</phrase> in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.1663W.2/4">The UK has also furthered the EU's relations with external actors during our presidency, with a view to enhancing our security of supply (as per parliamentary answer 2005/2255). The UK held Permanent Partnership Council on Energy with Russia on <phrase class="date" code="">3 October</phrase>, participated in the EU-OPEC dialogue, on behalf of the Council, in Vienna on <phrase class="date" code="">2 December</phrase>; and facilitated the signing of a treaty establishing an Energy Community (with South East Europe), signed on <phrase class="date" code="">25 October</phrase>. The UK has also been working with the Energy Charter Secretariat ahead of their annual conference on <phrase class="date" code="">9 December</phrase>, particularly on the long running negotiations on a Protocol on Energy Transit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1663W.2/5">Finally, the potential for a European Energy policy was discussed at the Hampton Court Heads of State Informal in October. The Commission plans to take this forward through a Green Paper in 2006 and with a view to reporting to the <phrase class="date" code="">2006 December</phrase> European Council. The EU's Security of Energy Supply will be an important feature of this document, on which the UK will continue to work with the Commission.</p>

The latter is funded by DTI and delivered in the north west by the Manufacturing Institute. It offers the region's manufacturing firms free diagnostic visits and support for projects to help boost performance and competitiveness. The North West Development Agency is also proposing to develop an advanced manufacturing centre on the former Michelin site.</p>

	<p pid="b.1672W.0/2">Ofgem's general duties already require them to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development as well as to have regard for the environment when making their decisions. The Secretary of State has also issued social and environmental guidance to Ofgem which allows them to contribute to broader Government policies without compromising the principle of independent regulation. There is therefore no need to amend their statutory duties. Government are committed to providing a framework which allows markets to make long term investment decisions with confidence. Stability and regulatory certainty are an important part of this. Changing the well understood duties of the regulator would inject unwelcome uncertainty in energy markets.</p>

	<p pid="b.1672W.6/2">Any offer of grant under the Bio-energy Capital Grants scheme remains an undertaking of support for an agreed period of time.

	<p pid="b.1673W.8/1">The RDAs proactively share best practice and information on key incentives and initiatives at both senior and operational levels. For example at senior level the chairs of the agencies meet every six weeks to discuss their collective agenda and one of the standing items on the agenda is a best practice slot where two chairs will give presentations on projects from their own RDA. Copies of the presentation are circulated to all RDAs after the meeting, and are available upon request. Chairs also meet with Government Ministers every six weeks and there is a regional showcase item on the agenda. One of the chairs will give a presentation on a key initiative that illustrates the broader theme of the meeting. For example the chair of the East of England development agency recently gave a presentation on higher education provision in the region as part of a wider discussion on the skills agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.1673W.8/2">The RDA directors meet their peers quarterly to discuss issues of mutual interest and best practice. There are six groups covering the following areas; strategy, finance, communications, enterprise, development (regeneration) and skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.1673W.8/3">At operational level there are a number of networks that support the RDA directors, including one, whose purpose is to support best practice in relation to RDA performance management, reporting and evaluation framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.1673W.8/4">In addition, at operational level there are a number of networks that support the RDAs in their lead roles. These groups communicate mainly through e-mail, but will meet occasionally to discuss common issues and share best practice. The areas the groups cover include; planning, transport, sustainable development, diversity, and the voluntary and community sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.1673W.8/5">The RDAs have established the Office of Project Advice and Training jointly with English Partnerships and the Welsh Development Agency which aims to promote best practice in project appraisal, delivery and evaluation. The office has both a technical and strategic role. The technical role is to develop and share best practice in project appraisal, delivery and evaluation, and to disseminate this advice within the agencies and their partners. The strategic role is to influence and advise both Departments and agencies on the implications of new responsibilities and government initiatives based on their technical knowledge and expertise in project processes and agency procedures. This helps avoid duplication of effort, maximises the use of resources and so achieves value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.1673W.8/6">Following the publication of the Egan report all RDAs have established regional centres of excellence which will help RDA staff and regeneration practitioners share and promote best practice in their work. The regional centres will work closely with the National Centre, which is being established in Leeds.</p>
	<p pid="b.1673W.8/7">Best practice is shared among representatives from the RDAs responsible for managing Business Link in the regions at the Business Link Implementation Group. Recommendations from that group are ratified by the Business Link Strategy Board, which is made up of representatives from the RDAs that have a wider responsibility for co-ordinating the delivery of business support in the regions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1675W.9/1">Officials are carrying out a full cost benefit analysis of the scope for further liberalisation of Sunday trading. To assist in this we are inviting independent researchers to carry out a thorough assessment of the effects of liberalising Sunday trading in whole or in part, including the impact on jobs, retailers, the needs of consumers and the impact on economic growth. The Government will then come forward with proposals, after discussions with businesses, consumers, religious groups and employees.</p>

	<p pid="b.1676W.0/1">Since <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, the English Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) have had strategic responsibility for tourism. This has helped to unlock a whole range of benefits for the industry, including clearer business support and links to wider services and resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.1676W.0/2">One NorthEast recently commissioned research by Global Tourism Solutions into the economic impact of tourism in the North East. This showed that in 2004:</p>
	<p pid="b.1676W.0/3" class="indent">tourism in Hartlepool is worth &pound;39 million and supports 900 jobs (Full Time Equivalents);</p>
	<p pid="b.1676W.0/4" class="indent">in Tees Valley, tourism was worth &pound;339 million and supported around 7,000 jobs;</p>
	<p pid="b.1676W.0/5" class="indent">in the North East region, tourism was worth &pound;1.8 billion and supported around 38,000 jobs;</p>
	<p pid="b.1676W.0/6" class="indent">a total of 8.7 million overnight tourists visited the region in 2004, a 3 per cent. increase on the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1676W.0/7">North East England Tourism Strategy, published in January 2005, sets out the region's target to increase tourism by 1.3 million domestic visits and 0.7 million visits per annum by 2010 against the baseline year of 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.1676W.0/8">One NorthEast investment in tourism continues through its capital programme, and activities in regional marketing, business development, strategic planning and project development. For example, it is expected that Tees Valley will benefit from:</p>
	<p pid="b.1676W.0/9" class="indent">&pound;20 million new investment at Durham/Tees Valley airport</p>
	<p pid="b.1676W.0/10" class="indent">Development of the Coastal Arc</p>

	<p pid="b.1676W.0/12" class="indent">Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art, &pound;15 million project (currently under construction)</p>
	<p pid="b.1676W.0/13">One NorthEast is also investing &pound;7 million over the next three years in a strategy to improve the image of North East England, a campaign which was awarded the World Travel Award for the world's best regional marketing campaign.</p>

	<p pid="b.1682W.2/1">British armed forces have used white phosphorus on Operation Telic in Iraq primarily as a smoke screen to provide cover and thus protection for our soldiers, or for target illumination. Its use in Iraq is a tactical decision authorised by commanders on the ground. Although white phosphorus does have a recognised anti-personnel effect, our armed forces go to great lengths to ensure that civilian and non-combatants are not harmed during operations; guidelines issued to British military personnel on its use emphasise that it should not be deployed as an anti-personnel weapon. Information on the number of occasions it has been used by British armed forces in Iraq is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.1689W.6/1">25 local authorities were selected to take part in the Primary National Strategy Behaviour and Attendance pilot on the basis of social deprivation and geographic spread. Steering groups within each authority selected the schools to be involved. Participation was voluntary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689W.6/2">The pilot had four strands: curriculum materials to develop children's social, emotional and behavioural skills; different models of local authority support for schools where behaviour or attendance was a key issue; small group interventions for children needing extra help with social, emotional and behavioural skills; and behaviour and attendance audit and staff training materials. Different schools piloted different combinations of these strands.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689W.6/3">Within the pilot 253 primary schools took part in the piloting of the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) curriculum resource for at least a year. A list of these schools has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689W.6/4">About 100 primary schools tested different models of local authority support. A similar number piloted small group interventions. All primary schools in the pilot authorities were encouraged to trial the audit and training materials.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689W.6/5">The Primary Behaviour and Attendance pilot has been evaluated by London University's Institute of Education. Their report found evidence of positive impacts on behaviour and learning. We therefore decided to make enhanced versions of the SEAL and audit and training materials available to all primary schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1689W.6/6">The SEAL materials became available in June 2005. They provide a structured, whole-curriculum resource together with clear guidance for staff on how to use it. Using the SEAL resource is entirely voluntary, but there has been a high level of demand from schools. Over half of all primary schools have now ordered it.</p>

None have reached this stage yet, but we anticipate the first contract signatures to take place in 2006. There are 17 authorities in pathfinder and wave 1 (2005&ndash;06) of BSF and for this approximately &pound;2.2 billion has been allocated; there are 11 authorities in wave 2 and 11 in wave 3, and again approximately &pound;2.2 billion has been allocated for each wave. It is not possible to be more specific as the allocations to individual authorities were indicative and would weaken the competitive tendering process. If a bidder (or bidders) knows the value of a project when it goes to market, i.e. an allocation of &pound;75 million to build three schools, there is the possibility that they will all price their bid at around this mark, rather than a truly competitive price.</p>

	<p pid="b.1691W.2/1">Building Schools for the Future (BSF) is a long-term strategic programme to renew and rebuild secondary schools in England and to bring about educational transformation over 15 waves of investment starting this year. It would restrict the successful delivery of new school facilities were we to ring-fence funding through BSF for sport, or indeed for any other aspect of a successful school. Existing provision for sports will vary from authority to authority and school to school.</p>
	<p pid="b.1691W.2/2">BSF requires local authorities and schools to have the widest visions of what can be achieved across a group of schools. We set out clear expectations and guidance as to what our aims are in terms of the type of facilities that schools could provide. This includes an expectation that pupils will have access to 21st-century sports facilities, which can be shared with the local community. It is best that local authorities and schools then have the flexibility to achieve this in a way that is most appropriate for their local circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="b.1691W.8/4">The ABA has established regional network partnerships of lead officers from 146 local authorities in the nine Government office regions. These promote best practice and develop innovative and practical approaches to tackle bullying at a strategic level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1691W.8/5">Anti-bullying work has a high profile within the national strategies behaviour strands. There are secondary national strategy behaviour and attendance consultants in every LA working directly with schools to tackle a range of behaviour issues including bullying.</p>

	<p pid="b.1698W.3/1">First we are determined that head teachers have the time and support to provide good leadership to manage their schools. That is why from the start of this school year every head teacher has a contractual entitlement to &quot;dedicated headship time&quot;. Head teachers must have dedicated time to lead their schools, as well as manage them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1698W.3/2">And with the right leadership much school management can be delegated effectively. Through our workforce remodelling agenda we are supporting schools in recruiting very many numbers of administrative and support staff to free school leaders to lead and teachers time to teach. This ensures the best use of resources to improve outcomes for children.</p>
	<p pid="b.1698W.3/3">We are also establishing a new relationship with schools; this will strip away clutter and bureaucracy in schools. Key aspects include the introduction of an improved and streamlined data collection system, more user-friendly communications (ordering publications online when the schools require them rather than when DfES sends them out automatically) and fewer of them; and a Single Plan from which Ofsted and other bodies will draw on information about the school and its performance. This will make the planning process more coherent and less time-consuming.</p>
	<p pid="b.1698W.3/4">We remain determined to make sure our policies have the maximum impact on standards with the minimum burden on head teachers. That is why we have announced in the recent Schools White Paper that the independent Implementation Review Unit, (IRU) will continue to serve until at least 2008. The IRU, which is a group of practising head teachers and senior staff in schools will therefore continue to scrutinise our policies and ensure that we understand the impact of our initiatives on schools and how best to introduce them from a schools perspective.</p>

	<p pid="b.1701W.8/1">There is no statutory presumption concerning parental rights in the Children Act 1989. Instead, the Act requires the court to have the welfare of the child as its paramount consideration in determining any question relating to his or her upbringing. It is clear that, in general, the children of separating parents will benefit from ongoing meaningful relationships with both of their parents, so long as these are safe and in their best interests. However, we believe that the addition to the Children Act 1989 of a statutory presumption focused on parental rights would lead to a move away from the current clear focus on the needs of children and towards focusing on the wishes of parents. We consider such a move to be harmful to the interests of children.</p>

	<p pid="b.1704W.8/1">Following the issue of the grant letter for 2004&ndash;05 we identified the need for additional resources to enable the LSC to deliver what the Department required. The key components of this additional resource were for local infrastructure and development, school sixth forms, learner participation, education maintenance allowance and a technical increase in the administrative budget to cover depreciation and cost of capital (previously carried on the Department's accounts). This increased the LSC's overall funding form the grant letter budget of &pound;8,674 million to a total expenditure of &pound;8,955 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.1713W.0/1">The question of a lifer sentence prisoner's suitability for release cannot be considered until the prisoner has served the minimum period of imprisonment considered necessary for the purposes of retribution and deterrence (the tariff period). Exceptionally, the Secretary of State may release a life sentence prisoner prior to tariff expiry where he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist to justify such action on compassionate grounds. All life sentence prisoners are entitled to have their suitability for release considered by the independent Parole Board on, or shortly before, the expiry of their tariff. They will then be entitled to further reviews of their detention at no more than two yearly intervals thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="b.1713W.0/2">There is no other specific condition imposed on a life sentence prisoner in relation to his or her consideration for release. Once the tariff has been served, the general issue governing release is the level of risk of serious harm that the prisoner may pose to others. The responsibility for assessing such risk and for directing the release of a tariff expired life sentence prisoner is now a matter for the Parole Board. The board is required by statute to satisfy itself that &quot;it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that the prisoner should be confined&quot;, and to direct release when it is so satisfied.</p>
	<p pid="b.1713W.0/3">The Parole Board will take relevant factors into account when making its assessments of risk in individual cases. The various key factors are set out in Directions given by the Secretary of State under section 32 (6) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Copies of the latest Directions are available from the Library.</p>

The average cost per meal per prisoner is based on the understanding that breakfast, lunch and dinner account for approximately 20 per cent., 40 per cent. and 40 per cent. respectively of the daily food cost. Using these figures the average cost per meal per prisoner was: breakfast 37.5p; lunch 73.8p; and, dinner 73.8p. But these percentages may vary from one establishment to another dependant on a variety of issues including seasonal choices of product and the local regime.</p>

Prisons are required to meet the minimum nutritional standards as laid down in Prison Service Order 5000 (Catering Manual) but there is no set financial formula that prisons are required to follow on the cost of each meal.</p>

	<p pid="b.1718W.3/7" class="indent">In order to give an estimate of the number of electors on Census day (<phrase class="date" code="2001-04-29">29 April 2001</phrase>), a weighted average is taken of the <phrase class="date" code="2001-02-01">1 February 2001</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-01">1 December 2001</phrase> electoral data. Data are given for Parliamentary electorate. Data for the local/European electorate, by Parliamentary Constituency are not readily available for 2001.</p>
	<p pid="b.1718W.3/8" class="indent">For the purposes of answering this question, we have assumed that you are interested in the percentage of the population aged 18 and over who are registered to vote. However it should be noted that the percentage of residents who are registered to vote in each Constituency is not a reliable estimate of the registration rate of the eligible population: the resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.1718W.3/9" class="indent">The UK Parliamentary electorate excludes residents of countries other than the UK and the Commonwealth and includes UK citizens resident abroad. In addition not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth. prisoners, etc, are not eligible) and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Also there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This latter is the main reason why in some Constituencies the population aged 18 and over is less than those registered to vote. These factors may have a different impact from place to place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1718W.3/10" class="indent">Furthermore, you should note that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has revised the mid-2001 population estimates since the publication of the 2001 Census results. In September 2003, revisions were made that added approximately 193,000 to the population of England and Wales. This revision primarily related to the addition of a number of young males that were not captured by the Census. In September 2004, ONS made further revisions as a result of concluding studies designed to improve population estimates in the areas that proved hardest to count in the 2001 Census in England and Wales. The results of this work showed that the Census worked well in most areas, but that there were a few cases where it was not able sufficiently to adjust for exceptional circumstances. The analysis showed that there was a need for revisions to the 2001 Census based population estimates of around 107,000 for England and Wales as a whole. The adjustments were included in the new mid-year population estimates for 2001, published in 2004. The census database itself was not revised following the publication of these adjustments. More details on these issues can be found at: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/lastudies">www.statistics.gov.uk/lastudies</a></p>
	<p pid="b.1718W.3/11" class="indent">Any comparison of these data with figures for other years should be made carefully as electoral legislation and other changes (such as EU expansion) can change the size of the electorate.</p>

	<p pid="b.1721W.2/1">The Government have stated on a number of occasions that building sustainable communities means more than building new houses and that additional infrastructure and services will be required in support of a growing population as well as the existing population.</p>
	<p pid="b.1721W.2/2">Infrastructure results vary widely from one area to another and from one development to another, and so it is not possible to apply a general formula to growth plans. In order to underpin the plans for the growth areas, studies were commissioned on the growth areas (e.g. the 2002 Milton Keynes and South Midlands study undertaken by Roger Tym and Partners) and on individual locations within the growth areas (e.g. the 2003 Milton Keynes and Aylesbury Growth Area studies, also prepared by Roger Tym and Partners). These studies have included information on infrastructure requirements and costing and have been made public in order to inform the regional planning documents relevant to the growth areas (e.g. the Milton Keynes South Midlands Sub-Regional Strategy). The sub-regional strategies are now being taken forward at local level and local partners are doing their own work to prioritise and cost the infrastructure associated with growth. The Government are not planning to commission additional studies to estimate infrastructure requirements and costs for each of the growth areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.1721W.2/3">Both housing development and infrastructure investment are on-going activities. The allocation of individual houses and expenditures on infrastructure to &quot;growth&quot; and &quot;background levels&quot; is not a practical option. Nor is it practical or desirable to halt all development until all of the investment contemplated in support of that development is in place. Indeed, infrastructure requirements will change over time, reflecting, for example, the detailed geography of housing and jobs, as well as changes in technology, consumer preferences and service provision. Rather, infrastructure needs to be put in place on a timely basis to support growth in a locality and needs to be planned for on a dynamic basis. We look to local partners, in particular the local delivery vehicles, to construct their business plans accordingly and to work with regional and national bodies in prioritising funding towards timely provision of infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1721W.2/4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has produced variant population projections for the four growth areas. These were done at local authority level and projected forward population projections based on current population trends and likely additional housing due to the area being a growth area. The assumed additional population was based on past trends regarding births, deaths, household formation rates and migration.</p>
	<p pid="b.1721W.2/5">Government looks to regional and local partners to plan dynamically for changing demographics. For example, the Learning and Skills Councils in the Milton Keynes South Midlands sub-region have collaborated on a study on the long-term learning and skills needs of the area. This study embraces a variety of demographic scenarios and recognises the need to take a strategic approach to planning infrastructure which is adaptable to a range of scenarios.</p>

	<p pid="b.1733W.5/2">As stated in Table A2b of &quot;Local Government Financial Statistics England No. 16 2005&quot;, the average band D council tax set by parish and town councils for 2005&ndash;06 has been estimated to be &pound;42. But this is dependent upon an estimate of the taxbase for the area to which the precepts relate which is not robust enough to give a reliable set of figures over time.</p>

While this gives a broad indication of the trend in average precepts, it also reflects an increase in the number of parish and town councils, with about 150 new ones having been created since 1997.</p>

As part of the priorities and Budget process, decisions on the allocation of resources have to be taken in the context of local needs and priorities. Therefore, in this instance, it was decided to allocate these resources elsewhere within the Northern Ireland Block where the need is greatest.</p>

	<p pid="b.1747W.2/1">The chief executive of Roads Service Dr. Malcolm McKibbin has been asked to write to the hon. Lady in response to this question.</p>
	<p pid="b.1747W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Dr. Malcom McKibbin, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-12">12 December 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.1747W.2/3" class="indent">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question regarding what plans he has to initiate an upgrade of the main road from Belfast International Airport to the Ml Moira Junction. I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1747W.2/4" class="indent">The main road from the Belfast International Airport to the Ml is via the A57 Templepatrick Road to Killead Roundabout and then the A26, joining the Ml at the Moira junction. The A26 is one of five Key Transport Corridors in the Province.</p>
	<p pid="b.1747W.2/5" class="indent">The Regional Strategic Transport Network Transport Plan (RSTN TP) announced by the then Minister for Regional Development, John Spellar MP, on 22nd March 2005, presented a range of multi-modal transport initiatives to manage, maintain and develop Northern Ireland's Key Transport Network up to the year 2015.</p>
	<p pid="b.1747W.2/6" class="indent">During preparation of the RSTN TP, the transport links to Belfast International Airport were examined and it was concluded that the three roads radiating from the Killead Roundabout, including the A26, provided good links to the strategic road network, servicing Northern Ireland and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="b.1747W.2/7" class="indent">Nevertheless, three widened single carriageway schemes on the A26 have been included in the Plan to improve safety and provide overtaking opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1747W.2/8" class="indent">Differential Acceleration Lanes have been contructed at the Nutts Corner roundabout at a cost of approximately &pound;800k and a 0.8 kilometre climbing lane has been provided on the south bound section of this route at Carnkilly Road and Furze Road at a cost of &pound;260K. A further climbing lane is planned on the A26 near Glenavy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1747W.2/9" class="indent">It is also proposed to provide part time signals at the junction of the eastbound off-slip from the M1 and the Moira roundabout at a cost of &pound;40k to improve traffic management.</p>
	<p pid="b.1747W.2/10" class="indent">Although the Belfast Metropolitan Transport Plan (BMTP) did not recommend any specific major improvements to the A26/A57, it did recommend that route management strategies be undertaken on all key strategic routes. I can advise that it is planned to commence a route management strategy along the A26 during 2006/07, which will consider what other improvements may be necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.1752W.5/2">ANPRs are also deployed as requested by PSNI to assist in joint exercises with other enforcement authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1752W.8/1">Units to wheel-clamp unlicensed vehicles were introduced in Northern Ireland in 1998 and camera detection units in 2001. Output from the wheel-clamping units is measured in the number of vehicles clamped not prosecutions. Separate recording of prosecutions arising from enforcement action by camera units did not begin until 2003&ndash;04. For vehicle excise duty offences it is the normal policy to offer out of court settlements rather than proceed direct to court. Resulting from camera detections, in 2003&ndash;04 1,695 people paid out of court (OCS) settlements and 217 were prosecuted in court. In 2004&ndash;05, 1,830 paid OCSs and 306 were prosecuted in court.</p>

Nothing can be done to eradicate them or prevent their spread within Lough Neagh.</p>

	<p pid="b.1763W.0/2">Work to review the interaction between study rules and benefits is on-going.</p>
	<p pid="b.1763W.0/3">Ministerial colleagues have already met and discussed through correspondence a wide range of issues relating to the rules on study and housing benefit with representatives from the Foyer Federation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1763W.0/4">Individuals receiving housing benefit can currently study for qualifications below degree level, as long as it is for less than 16 guided learning hours a week. This is not always a significant barrier as many full-time Learning and Skills Council courses are just over 12 guided learning hours a week.</p>
	<p pid="b.1763W.0/5">It is a matter of record that the policy of both this and previous Governments has been to exclude most, but not all, full-time students from entitlement to housing benefit; since 1990 financial support for those students opting to study full time has been seen as the responsibility of the education system, rather than the benefit system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1763W.0/6">One of the outcomes of the recent Social Exclusion Report &quot;Review of Financial Support, Supporting Young People to Achieve&quot; is that from April 2006, if someone is in non-advanced education when they turn 19 they can continue to receive certain benefits, including income support, and therefore housing benefit, and education maintenance allowance until they have completed their current course of study or reach age 20.</p>
	<p pid="b.1763W.0/7">This is clearly an improvement on the previous situation, but it is likely that there will still be some young people who have had to abandon their attempts to catch up on learning because they reach 20 before they have finished their course. Because of this, the Government are committed to keeping this new age limit under review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1763W.0/8">Additionally, we recognise that for some a different approach may be needed. Consequently, from next September as part of the New Deal for Skills we will be piloting in some Jobcentre Plus districts the effect of allowing low skilled jobseekers to take up full-time further education courses as a route into work when a lack of skills is considered to be a significant barrier.</p>

	<p pid="b.1765W.5/4" class="indent">It may be helpful if I explain that, to make a claim in an area operating the new Jobcentre Plus model, the customer calls a contact centre. Contact centre staff ask the customer a series of questions to assess their potential eligibility to Jobcentre Plus benefits. They then arrange to call the customer back to complete the claim form, which is sent to the customer to check and sign. They will also arrange a work focused interview at the customer's local Jobcentre Plus office where this is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.5/5" class="indent">Our aim is to answer 90% of calls made to the contact centre. The most recent information we have is for week ending <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-04">4 November 2005</phrase> when we answered 81.5% of calls.</p>
	<p pid="b.1765W.5/6" class="indent">With regard to the duration of telephone benefit applications, we do not hold information on the average length of telephone calls to gather all the information necessary to complete a claim form. However we do have the average length of the initial call made by the customer. The most recent information shows that this is taking an average of 12 minutes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1767W.2/4" class="indent">Prior to the creation of Jobcentre Plus, the Employment Service embarked on its Modernising Employment Service (MES) programme. Part of this programme was to change RDV (card vacancies) to touch screen kiosks or &quot;Jobpoints&quot;, whilst ensuring that the needs and expectations of individual customers were met. As RDV was the preceding system, I have taken your question to be referring to Jobpoints.</p>
	<p pid="b.1767W.2/5" class="indent">A wide variety of research has been carried out to assess the impact of these changes, and the use of Jobpoints, on local communities and the effectiveness of Jobcentre Plus systems. This includes:</p>
	<p pid="b.1767W.2/6" class="indent">a Jobseeker Direct Customer Satisfaction Survey;</p>
	<p pid="b.1767W.2/7" class="indent">a quantitative telephone survey of over 3,000 Jobcentre Plus customers;</p>
	<p pid="b.1767W.2/8" class="indent">Greater London Enterprise carried out three sweeps of the Qualitative Employer Survey and the Customer Service Centre Case Studies;</p>

	<p pid="b.1767W.2/10" class="indent">Jobcentre Case Study research and analysis of the Jobseeker Surveys;</p>
	<p pid="b.1767W.2/11" class="indent">a follow-up national telephone survey of 3,411 Jobcentre Plus customers to provide representative data on customers' experience of, views on, and satisfaction with, Jobcentre Plus services; and</p>
	<p pid="b.1767W.2/12" class="indent">a Jobcentre Plus National Customer Satisfaction Survey.</p>
	<p pid="b.1767W.2/13" class="indent">Furthermore, an independent evaluation of customers' reactions to these changes, carried out in January 2003, showed that between 31% and 48% of jobseekers reported an increase in the numbers and types of vacancies they looked at, the number of applications made, and their confidence in getting a job.</p>
	<p pid="b.1767W.2/14" class="indent">An analysis of the costs to Jobcentre Plus of introducing Jobpoints was included in the overall MES evaluation in 2003. When set alongside reduced resources for operational delivery during MES implementation, this supported the conclusion that MES enabled improved efficiency, accuracy, flexibility and responsiveness of work processes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1769W.5/6" class="indent">We do not collect information on average call back times specifically for customers speaking the Welsh language. These call backs are made by our Bridgend contact centre, along with those to English language speakers.

	<p pid="b.1769W.5/7" class="indent">We have an internal standard to complete work-focused interviews within 4 days of initial contact with the customer. Twelve of our centres captured data from 273 Local Service Outlets over a sample period from 16th September 2005 to 25th November 2005 on the waiting times for these interviews. This information is in the table.</p>

This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1772W.2/4" class="indent">The Jobcentre Plus programme, called 'Pulling Together', was at the heart of our aim to create and sustain a unified culture within Jobcentre Plus. It was delivered in every Jobcentre Plus site and its objectives were:</p>
	<p pid="b.1772W.2/5" class="indent">Embedding the DWP Values in all teams&mdash;Our Values are, Achieving the Best, Making a Difference, Looking Outwards and Respecting People</p>
	<p pid="b.1772W.2/6" class="indent">Developing leadership skills</p>
	<p pid="b.1772W.2/7" class="indent">Giving our people the tools and support to build the new culture</p>

	<p pid="b.1772W.2/9" class="indent">Sharing good practice so that teams would take forward the best of both legacy agencies</p>
	<p pid="b.1772W.2/10" class="indent">The spirit of Pulling Together was established as being something for local units to implement, with a deliberately 'light touch' from the centre. Fundamental to Pulling Together activity was the development of action plans to address local issues linked to the programme's key objectives. Facilitated planning sessions provided the opportunity for our people to consider issues relating to their transition to Jobcentre Plus. Any issues which could not be resolved locally, were fed up the line for resolution at either regional or national level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1772W.2/11" class="indent">Following the success of the Pulling Together programme we have recently launched our new Culture Change programme, called Working Together which focuses on providing our managers with the support, resilience and tools they need to lead their people through change. It also addresses the cultural issues emerging from our staff survey results.</p>
	<p pid="b.1772W.2/12" class="indent">The annual DWP Staff Attitude Survey provides a key mechanism for our people to comment on a range of important issues. I will arrange for a copy of the 2004 survey and the key actions we took in response, to be placed in the House of Commons Library. This feedback enables us to identify those areas where we can take action to address emerging issues and improve our working environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1772W.2/13" class="indent">These annual surveys provide a good picture of how things are working and changing across our business. We place great importance on the feedback received from our people and are always looking to improve the way we capture this information.</p>

	<p pid="b.1780W.2/1">The winter fuel payment is not means-tested because we want a simple and cost effective payment that ensures all pensioners can turn up their heating in the winter months without worrying about the cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1780W.2/2">The payment was introduced to help pensioners in Great Britain with their fuel bills. We are obliged under European law to continue paying the winter fuel payment to people who qualify for a payment in Great Britain and then move to another European Economic Area country or Switzerland.</p>

	<p pid="b.1803W.2/1">In our proposals sent out on <phrase class="date" code="">28 July</phrase>, we indicated that we were minded to require primary care trusts (PCTs) to reduce their service-provision functions by the end of 2008. Since that document, we have listened to stakeholders. The policy moving forward, in relation to service-provision, is that this will be a matter for PCTs to determine locally, so any move away from direct provision of services will be a decision for the local national health service within the framework set out in the forthcoming White Paper and after local consultation, including professions allied to medicine.</p>
	<p pid="b.1803W.2/2">We will support PCTs who want to do that, but we will not instruct PCTs to do it nor will we impose any timetable. What matters is getting the best services for each community&mdash;and that is what the White Paper will focus on.</p>

	<p pid="b.1806W.2/1">The Hull and East Riding stroke service set up its organised stroke care in December 2000. This includes comprehensive facilities for stroke patients in community settings, including three inner city rehabilitation units working in partnership with private nursing home providers and a social services residential home. These are three, eight bedded units one at Rossmore Nursing Home, one at St. Marys Nursing Home and one at Alderson Resource (Social Services). The service has well established neurotherapists working in the community across the rehabilitation facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1806W.2/2">Work is also underway in the East Riding to develop partnership working further with Social Services to provide day rehabilitation facilities utilising the skills of therapy and health care professionals working together with Social Services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1806W.2/3">A service re-design is currently underway to strengthen community health provision for stroke patients further. Community stroke nurse specialists will work together with a team of stroke support workers to support the nurse consultant in stroke with the continuing physical and clinical requirements of stroke patients in community rehabilitation settings and also to develop more support in nursing and residential homes by providing training and expertise to support staff working in those settings.</p>

	<p pid="b.1810W.2/1">The launch of the foundation programme as the first phase of modernising medical careers (MMC) in August this year saw some senior house officer (SHO) posts converted to SHO equivalent foundation year two posts but this conversion did not affect the overall number of posts available for doctors working at the SHO level.</p>
	<p pid="b.1810W.2/2">The MMC proposals for specialist training have yet to be agreed in detail. The proposals would see the gradual phasing out of the SHO grade to be replaced by structured programmes of training leading to the award of a certificate of completion of training.</p>
	<p pid="b.1810W.2/3">Current SHOs will not be disadvantaged in the new training system and MMC will be working closely with the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board and Medical Royal Colleges to ensure that all are treated fairly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1810W.2/4">We have consulted widely on these proposals and will continue to engage with stakeholders, including the British Medical Association, to manage transition.</p>
	<p pid="b.1810W.2/5">In the September 2004 census, the number of medically qualified SHOs and equivalents was 20,094 in England. This was an increase of 1,882 (10 per cent.) from the previous year and an increase of 5,514 (38 per cent.) since 1997. The census is a count of doctors on particular salary scales or their equivalents, not a count of doctors with a particular job description. These figures therefore include trust doctors, clinical fellows and other such posts.</p>
