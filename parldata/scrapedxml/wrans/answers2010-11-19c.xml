	<p pid="c.960W.5/2">Most of these are collected in recycling bins located across the parliamentary estate. The waste contractor for the House provides a recycling operative on the estate to further separate the waste collected from inside the buildings, since some waste which has been contaminated with other waste cannot be sent for recycling and has to be incinerated instead. This system has increased the quantity of waste sent for recycling and decreased the quantity of waste sent for incineration. Separate compactors for paper for recycling and other waste for incineration are provided in both Peers' Inner Court and Commissioner's Yard.</p>

	<p pid="c.961W.10/1">The Government are committed to ensuring that the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) becomes a passenger champion. We are discussing how best to take this forward with the ORR. We also fully recognise the importance of the work of the ORR in relation to freight. Holding Network Rail to account with regard to the quality of service it provides to freight operators is a key part of the remit of the ORR. In assessing the best options for reform of the rail industry and its regulatory structure, the Government will pay proper regard to the impact of any change on efforts to create the right climate for a successful rail freight industry.</p>

While the network helped schools to increase participation rates in the areas targeted by the previous Government, the fact remains that the proportion of pupils playing competitive sport regularly has remained disappointingly low. Only around two in every five pupils play competitive sport regularly within their own school, and only one in five plays regularly against others schools. In removing the many PE and sport targets and requirements placed on schools by the previous Government, we are freeing them to take decisions about the competitive sport that they offer in the best interests of the pupils and parents they serve.</p>

	<p pid="c.981W.0/1">Universities in the UK are autonomous and develop their own strategies for competing in the global student market, and are extremely competent at doing so. The world-class reputation that the HE sector enjoys means that the UK attracts more students to study here than any country other than the US. The Government works with and supports the British Council overseas to promote the UK as a study destination.</p>
	<p pid="c.981W.0/2">But Government's most important role is in helping to ensure the HE sector maintains the reputation for excellence around the world which makes a UK degree such a valuable commodity. The changes to HE funding and student finance the Government announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-03">3 November</phrase> are intended to do just that.</p>
	<p pid="c.981W.0/3">Despite enormous pressure on public spending, the overall level of funding for science and research programmes has been protected in cash terms in a ring-fenced budget. The Government's key aims in funding science and research are to support research excellence and international competitiveness, to make best use of our science base and ensure the UK remains an attractive place to conduct research.</p>

The series of more than 500 measurements made by the regulator Ofcom (and its predecessor the Radiocommunications Agency) has consistently shown the public exposure around base stations to be well below the guideline levels.

	<p pid="c.987W.2/1">The Government have set out plans to reform higher education student finance in England which will offer a more generous package of financial support for low income students living in England wishing to attend university in 2012/13. No full-time student will need to contribute to their tuition costs up-front and students from families with incomes of &#163;25,000 or less will be entitled to a more generous full maintenance grant of &#163;3,250 a year. Students starting part-time courses in 2012/13 will be entitled to an up-front loan to meet their tuition costs so long as they are studying at an intensity of at least 33% of a full time course.</p>
	<p pid="c.987W.2/2">Universities or colleges wishing to charge students more than &#163;6,000 a year, up to a ceiling of &#163;9,000, will be expected to draw up an access agreement with the Office for Fair Access in order to widen participation in higher education.

Students will only be expected to contribute when they have completed their learning and are earning over &#163;21,000. Repayments will be 9% of income above &#163;21,000 and all outstanding repayments will be written off after 30 years. The result will be that around a quarter of graduates on the lowest incomes will pay less than they would under the current system.</p>

There will also be increases in maintenance loans which will mean that most students should have more support for living costs than they do now.</p>
	<p pid="c.987W.8/4">The Government have been working alongside UCAS, Universities UK and SPA (Supporting Professionalism in Admissions) to ensure that all students who have applied for deferred entry in 2012/13 or are thinking about doing so, know how these changes will affect them. Higher education institutions have been advised to ask students already holding offers for 2012/13 if they wish to be considered for entry in 2011/12 rather than 2012/13.</p>

	<p pid="c.990W.6/1">Ensuring good health and safety in the workplace remains vitally important. In the current economic climate, it is appropriate both that HSE should deliver its fair share of the required savings, and that those businesses who create health and safety risks should share more of the cost. Equally, it is important that burdens on low-risk businesses are reduced. We shall be working with HSE to develop such mechanisms over the coming months. It remains for HSE to decide what interventions-including enforcement-will best deliver its policy and operational objectives.</p>

	<p pid="c.991W.8/1">Changes to the Access to Work programme made by the previous Government are designed to improve take-up among under-represented groups, including people working for small employers, people with mental health conditions and people with learning difficulties. In February 2010 Access to Work officials held a series of focus groups across the country with a number of key external stakeholders, including disability charities, business groups and ethnic minority groups with regard to plans to refocus the Access to Work programme. All parties in attendance valued the service that Access to Work provides but agreed that the programme should be more flexible, and more available to those who are in need of most help and that larger employers could contribute more. These changes were announced in the White Paper 'Building Britain's Recovery' published in December 2009.</p>
	<p pid="c.991W.8/2">The operation of Access to Work is kept under regular review to ensure that the programme is delivered effectively. Access to Work guidance has for many years specified that funding cannot be provided for standard equipment that an employer would need to provide for any employee to do their job. We have in the past allowed Access to Work advisers to form local judgments about what should be regarded as standard equipment and this has led to inconsistent decisions. A revised list of equipment has therefore been included in the Access to Work guidance in order to assist advisers in making operational decisions on each case under consideration for funding and ensure consistency across the country. This list will be updated from time to time to ensure it reflects latest developments. The list of examples provided is not exhaustive and advisers have the discretion to identify other types of equipment as standard for a particular industry or occupation.</p>
	<p pid="c.991W.8/3">The coalition agreement set out our commitment to Access to Work, including plans to reform the programme so disabled people can apply for jobs with funding already secured for any adaptations and equipment they will need and I expect to make an announcement about this shortly.</p>

	<p pid="c.995W.2/2">Statutory adoption pay enables adopters to take a period of leave from work when a new child joins the family. It is paid by employers to employees who satisfy qualifying conditions based on length of employment and a minimum level of earnings. There are around 4,000 adoptions each year and only a very small number do not qualify. Local authorities can consider making payments equivalent to maternity allowance for adopters who are ineligible for statutory adoption pay. Because of this it is not economic to create a specific allowance within the benefit system for this small group.</p>

	<p pid="c.995W.8/2">Paying benefit fortnightly is intended to give customers more personal responsibility for their finances. Fortnightly payments more closely mirror monthly salary payments than weekly payments, and align better with utility bills, which are generally paid monthly. Fortnightly payments also help to simplify customers' movement between different benefits, as jobseeker's allowance is paid fortnightly.</p>
	<p pid="c.995W.8/3">Customers can receive weekly payments in exceptional circumstances-if the customer has a mental health condition and has found it difficult to budget on a fortnightly basis, for example, or if they have had debt counselling to help them manage significant financial problems. However, weekly payments are generally intended to be on a temporary basis, and most customers should be helped to move towards fortnightly payments.</p>

	<p pid="c.996W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what mechanisms are in place to ensure those released from prison can obtain benefits promptly. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.996W.2/4" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has a network of Employment and Benefit Advisers who are based in all of the prisons where the service is needed. As well as supporting customers in identifying and preparing for employment opportunities, they also ensure that before their release, customers receive up to date information about the benefits to which they may be entitled.</p>
	<p pid="c.996W.2/5" class="indent">In addition to this, all prisoners due to be released who wish to claim Jobseeker's Allowance are able to use the Freshstart process. Freshstart involves pre-arranging a New Jobseeker Interview to claim Jobseeker's Allowance at the prisoner's home Jobcentre Plus office for as soon as possible after they are released. The customer normally has an appointment with a Jobcentre Plus Adviser within three days of leaving prison. This process helps to speed up the receipt of benefit and aims to ensure that the offender engages with the Jobcentre at the earliest opportunity to allow them to gain appropriate support.</p>
	<p pid="c.996W.2/6" class="indent">Offenders who wish to claim Employment and Support Allowance, are signposted by the Employment and Benefit Adviser to the office of their choice. It is important to note that unlike Jobseeker's Allowance, other benefits do not normally require a face to face interview before benefit can be paid.</p>
	<p pid="c.996W.2/7" class="indent">In addition, those serving shorter term sentences can also take advantage of the Rapid Reclaim Process. This service is available if a prisoner reclaims benefits within 26 weeks of their last claim and their circumstances have not changed. This process is simpler and shorter.</p>

To date UK aid has helped approximately 900,000 people access health care services, 620,000 people access clean drinking water and 420,000 people benefit from shelter kits.

	<p pid="c.1004W.2/2"><i> </i>My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary received a letter on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-12">12 November 2010</phrase> from a number of individuals calling for the family of Jimmy Mubenga to be granted indefinite leave to remain and for an inquiry into the process for removing non-compliant detainees from the UK. The contents of the letter are under consideration and a response will be sent to the authors of the letter in due course.</p>
	<p pid="c.1004W.2/3">I am not able to comment on the immigration status of the Mubenga family in public or the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Mubenga given the investigations which are underway by the police and prisons and probation ombudsman. However, both the UK Border Agency and G4S are co-operating fully with both investigations.</p>

The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has issued a number of reports on Iran, all making clear that Iran has shown no sign of suspending its enrichment related activities as required by six UN Security Council resolutions. The figures in his September 2010 report showed Iran had produced 2803 kg of low enriched uranium since the start of operations in February 2007, and that Iran had also produced a total of 22 kg of uranium enriched to nearly 20%, a significant step towards weapons grade enrichment.</p>
