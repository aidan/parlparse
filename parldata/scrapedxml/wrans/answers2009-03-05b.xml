	<p pid="b.1718W.6/1">The Bloody Sunday Inquiry does not directly employ staff. The inquiry has engaged a number of people on loan or secondment from Government Departments/agencies to undertake specific posts and roles. A number of other people have been issued with Northern Ireland Office fixed-term contracts to work with the inquiry. Given the duration of the inquiry, detailed monthly breakdowns could not be obtained without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1718W.6/2">Over its lifespan, the number of staff in the inquiry peaked at 38 during hearings in April 2003. Posts included the secretary and deputy secretary to the inquiry, five inquiry solicitors, one costs solicitor, one assistant solicitor, one press officer, one assistant press officer, three legal assistants, two researchers, six witness liaison, one finance assistant, one archivist, two personal assistants and 12 administrative support staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.1718W.6/3">The inquiry has since reduced its complement to eight staff, including the secretary to the inquiry (part-time), costs solicitor (and acting inquiry solicitor), deputy secretary, finance assistant, personal assistant to the chairman, legal assistant to the tribunal, archivist and an administrative officer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1718W.6/4">The inquiry also holds contracts with employment agencies for the provision of temporary staff for administration services. These have not been included in this response, as their employer is the temporary staff agency.</p>

	<p pid="b.1719W.5/2">Her Department published its latest Quarterly Economy Review on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-06">6 February 2009</phrase>. It indicated that Northern Ireland, in common with other UK regions, is facing very significant economic pressures and will not be sheltered from the impacts of the downturn. The review revealed that 2009 will see continuing falls in output and employment in the region. The Minister also highlighted that the structure of the economy&mdash;with its large public sector and small financial services sector&mdash;should help ensure that Northern Ireland is, broadly speaking, no worse affected than other UK regions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1719W.5/3">I concur with this assessment. The Government have put in place a raft of targeted and co-ordinated measures to underpin the financial sector, stimulate growth, increase employment and provide real help now. Northern Ireland will benefit from many of these measures and I will continue to represent the interests of Northern Ireland at the National Economic Council and consult with Northern Ireland Ministers to establish how we can best work together for the benefit of the Northern Ireland economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1733W.3/10">The amount spent on salaries reflects the increase in the number of civil servants (full-time equivalents (FTEs)) working in the GOE, from 34.8 FTEs in February 2007 to 69.4 FTEs in February 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.1733W.3/11">This planned increase in staffing (a) reflects the wider role the GOE has taken on during this period&mdash;GOE is now the only organisation overseeing the entire Olympic project, integrating the work of multiple delivery bodies, and ensuring the games is delivered within the &pound;9.3 billion public sector funding provision; (b) is a planned response to the expected growth in work to deliver the Government's commitments and guarantees, as 2012 approaches; and (c) is consistent with GOE's staffing and resource plan for 2008-09 to 2010-11, which was agreed early in 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.1743W.15/1">The international community and international agencies responded generously and quickly to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and so far, donors have provided $336 million in humanitarian assistance. The UK Government swiftly allocated &pound;26.8 million to address immediate humanitarian needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1743W.15/2">At the recent conference on reconstruction in Gaza, held in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Egyptians concluded that $4.5 billion had been pledged, but it remains unclear exactly how much of this is new money. The UK announced &pound;30 million for early recovery in Gaza to help rebuild damaged hospitals, schools and homes. Our pledge includes a new &pound;20 million provision, and &pound;10 million from the support announced in January.</p>
	<p pid="b.1743W.15/3">The humanitarian situation in Gaza will remain dire for some time to come. Limited access for humanitarian supplies and staff remains a key challenge, and access will also be critical for the longer-term recovery effort. The UK Government take the issue of humanitarian access extremely seriously and we have been working closely with all our international partners to get progress on this issue.</p>

Projects are identified with overseas governments and/or by the UK Government Departments which are party to the Fund. To date we are financing or have in development 83 projects, some of which are still subject to approval. As this amounts to a large volume of material, I have placed a list of the projects in the Libraries of the House. We do not keep records of the numbers of individuals who are assisted through each project.</p>

	<p pid="b.1756W.14/1">The &pound;200 million Government Mortgage Rescue Scheme has been operational across the country since <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-01">1 January 2009</phrase>. Under the scheme's financial structure, funding is not allocated directly to local authorities. Instead, it is drawn down by participating registered social landlord (RSL) providers after negotiations have take place with a household's lender and once a debt management plan has been agreed, the property has been visited and a decision has been taken on the most appropriate form of rescue. In addition, all English local authorities receive a homelessness grant, which forms part of their strategic responsibility to tackle and prevent homelessness effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1756W.14/2">The scheme is targeted at vulnerable households who fall within one of three priority need categories and who would be owed a duty by a local authority to secure accommodation under the homelessness legislation (section 189(l)(a)-(c) of the Housing Act 1996) if they became homeless.</p>
	<p pid="b.1756W.14/3">The three priority need categories are that the homeowner must be:</p>
	<p pid="b.1756W.14/4" class="indent">1. a person with whom dependent children reside or might reasonably be expected to reside;</p>
	<p pid="b.1756W.14/5" class="indent">2. a pregnant woman or a person with whom she resides or might reasonably be expected to reside; or</p>
	<p pid="b.1756W.14/6" class="indent">3. a person who is vulnerable as a result of old age, mental illness or handicap or physical disability or other special reason, or with whom such a person resides or might reasonably be expected to reside.</p>
	<p pid="b.1756W.14/7">An informal telephone survey of 60 local authorities was conducted by officials at Communities and Local Government on <phrase class="date" code="2009-02-18">18 February 2009</phrase>. This showed that over 500 applications had been made, resulting in approximately 180 cases meeting the eligibility criteria. Formal monitoring arrangements for all local authorities will be in place this month.</p>
	<p pid="b.1756W.14/8">We expect the Homeowners Mortgage Support Scheme to be open for business with the first lenders in April now that the Banking Act, which is the legislative vehicle we have used to enable us to do this, has gained Royal Assent and the scheme design has been confirmed. The draft Master Guarantee is currently being agreed with lenders. This is a lender-led scheme so we do not expect local authorities to play a direct role in its delivery. The full eligibility criteria are available at:</p>

As calculating average costs and having them agreed in Brussels is a lengthy process, the UK makes payments based on estimates until the process is complete. Until average costs for previous years are formally agreed and current bilateral discussions are completed, it is not possible to establish whether any previous payments the UK has made, represent overpayments.</p>

Part of the bilateral discussions have been about effectively managing demographic changes. For example, due to changes in working history, far more people have an entitlement to an Irish pension.

	<p pid="b.1768W.2/1">Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services consist of both qualified staff and trainees, the latter are required to attend state of the art training in the delivery of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and are supervised by experienced psychological therapists with expertise in this therapy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1768W.2/2">Current clinical psychology training courses are required to provide training in two evidence-based psychological therapies, one of which must be CBT. However, clinical psychologists trained in the past may not be sufficiently competent to deliver CBT to the standards required of IAPT. Therefore, before staff are employed in Improving Access to Psychological Therapy services and regardless of their professional background their previous training and experience is assessed to ensure that they are competent to provide cognitive behavioural therapy and supervise trainees; these assessments are reviewed by regional clinical leads.</p>

	<p pid="b.1768W.2/4">The IAPT programme has been proactive in recruiting newly qualified clinical psychologists as trainees therapists within IAPT services and 10 per cent. of high intensity trainees were clinical psychology graduates in 2008.</p>

New IAPT services collect the IAPT minimum data set which includes clinical outcomes measures and enables services manage patient care and monitor the flow of patients through services. The programme is currently developing a national data standard to enable the national collation of this data by 2011.</p>

This includes the contract for Southampton NHS Treatment Centre at the Royal Southampton Hospital and the Lymington part of the scheme which was withdrawn as a result of the revalidation process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1769W.6/2">It is not possible to separate the costs for the Southampton contract itself, but legal costs for the entire scheme included advice on the procurement process, contract drafting and extensive negotiation with bidders.

	<p pid="b.1771W.7/2">Tackling antisocial behaviour has been a top priority for this Government since 1997. Under leadership of the Home Office Departments across Government (including the Ministry of Justice, the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and the Department for Communities and Local Government) are working together to combat it. Over the past 10 years we have introduced a wide range of tools and powers to tackle antisocial behaviour which are being used by practitioners to bring relief to communities across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1771W.7/3">Last year we announced new initiatives for tackling ASB focusing on early intervention. These included the publication of a definitive guide for ASB practitioners and the establishment of a new action squad to help police and local agencies make full use of all the tools and powers available to tackle antisocial behaviour. We also introduced premises closure orders to allow police forces and local authorities to take action on premises which cause significant and persistent disorder or serious nuisance to the community. Strengthening the supportive and preventative tools is very important and from February this year we have introduced mandatory one-year review of antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) and extended the use of individual support orders (ISOs) for young people. The NAO report on Tackling Antisocial Behaviour in 2006 confirmed that our approach works. It found that 65 per cent. of people desisted from ASB after one intervention and nine out of 10 had desisted after three interventions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1772W.5/1">We have made no overall assessment. It is a matter for the individual judgment of police officers and police community support officers whether they issue such notices under the guidance and instructions issued by their chief officers taking account of the Police Operational Guidance for Penalty Notices for Disorder issued by the Home Office in March 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.1772W.5/2">The &quot;Diary of a Police Officer&quot; was a study undertaken by PA Consulting in 2001 and published as Police Research Paper 149 in November 2001. Calculations based on the &quot;Diary of a Police Officer&quot; indicate that the time saved in issuing a PND compared to arrest and case preparation is about 7.6 hours for each PND issued in custody. A PND issued on the street would save 9.9 hours for each PND.</p>

	<p pid="b.1775W.8/1">The Government's National Domestic Violence Delivery Plan provides the framework to tackle domestic violence. The plan ensures agencies work together to identify, track and risk assess domestic violence cases and better share information so that more offenders are brought to justice, victims are protected and better supported; and further violence is prevented.</p>
	<p pid="b.1775W.8/2">One of the key outcomes in our National Domestic Violence Reduction Delivery Plan is to reduce the prevalence of domestic violence, particularly in high incidence areas and/or communities. We are revisiting our delivery plan to ensure a greater focus on prevention. An example would be exploring how to change attitudes and behaviours of key audiences.</p>
	<p pid="b.1775W.8/3">One initiative which is currently being promoted through the school curriculum provides scope for education on addressing the underlying causes of violence and abuse relationships. One example is SEAL (social and emotional aspects of learning), which helps children develop their capacity to empathise, show respect and form positive relationships with other people. This can be expected to apply to any form of violent behaviour and thus prevent future incidences of domestic violence.</p>

The development of the strategy was informed by formal consultation of the public and experts in issues relating to drug misuse. The consultation document Drugs: Our Community, Your Say was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-25">25 July 2007</phrase>, and the consultation period closed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-19">19 October 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1777W.2/2">The Home Office received 1,001 formal written responses to the questions in the full consultation document and the shorter consultation leaflet. Responses were received from a wide range of bodies, including primary care trusts, mental health trusts, treatment services, and voluntary and community sector organisations, such as the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA). A full list of organisations providing formal responses to the consultation is included as an appendix in the consultation report, which is available to download at:</p>

	<p pid="b.1781W.3/2"><i> </i>The Government are committed to ensuring that policing is transparent and responsive and are taking a number of steps to achieve this. Key to ensuring the operation of policing meets this ambition is the Policing Pledge, which has now been implemented in all 43 forces. The pledge sets out a national standard on what the public can expect from the police, underpinned in each area by a set of local priorities, agreed by people in each neighbourhood. The views of local people must also be considered in the drawing up of local policing priorities. These priorities must be contained in the three year policing plan that each police authority is required to produce annually, explaining how they intend the force to realise their objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1781W.3/3">To bring more transparency to the administration of policing, this work will be supported by the new, more independent role or Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), which will mean that information on the way policing is administered will be available to the public in a readily accessible way for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1781W.3/4">The Policing and Crime Bill seeks to improve both transparency and responsiveness in the operation and administration of policing by placing a new duty on police authorities to consider the views of the public in the exercise of their functions. It will also ask HMIC to consider the extent to which this duty has been met when they inspect a police authority.</p>

These figures include those also held in custody for some but not the whole period of the proceedings. Data for 2008 will be available later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.1798W.2/1">The first &pound;6,000 of capital (&pound;10,000 for those in care homes) is fully disregarded in the income related benefits: income support, jobseekers allowance (income based), employment support allowance (income based) pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1798W.2/2">The formula for calculating the amount of notional income assumed from capital in the income related benefits is not intended to represent any rate of return that could be obtained from investing capital. It provides a simple method of calculating the weekly contribution that people with capital in excess of the level of the disregard are expected to make from their resources to help meet their normal living costs. As there is no link with actual market rates, the tariff income rates within the income related benefits remained unaltered throughout the period of rising interest rates, just as they have done more recently, when interest rates have been lower.</p>
	<p pid="b.1798W.2/3">On the introduction of income support in 1988, there was a capital disregard of &pound;3,000 and an upper capital limit of &pound;6,000. Notional income was assumed on capital between these amounts at a rate of &pound;1 for each &pound;250 or part of &pound;250. The rate of tariff income applied to capital in pension credit, which was introduced in 2003, is half the rate of tariff income applied to capital in income support, at &pound;1 for each &pound;500 or part of &pound;500. Upon the introduction of pension credit the rate of tariff income applied to capital housing benefit and council tax benefit for those people who have attained the qualifying age for pension credit was also changed to come into line with that which is applied to pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="b.1799W.2/3">From October, the flexible new deal will start to replace the current suite of new deal programmes, from which point flexible new deal providers will be responsible for deciding how best to help those jobseekers who wish to become self-employed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1799W.2/4">The Government want to do as much as they can to help people through this economic downturn. From April, further help will be available to all those who have been out of work and claiming jobseeker's allowance for six months or more. Working with Business Link in England and through the devolved Administrations, the Government will provide access to short, focused courses on self employment for a wide range of customers. For those who are successful in moving into self-employment, financial support will be offered during the first few months of trading while customers get their businesses going.</p>

	<p pid="b.1799W.5/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question requesting that a copy of the procedures to be followed by job advisers in helping people with autistic spectrum disorder into work, be placed in the Library. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1799W.5/4" class="indent">There is no single set of procedures to be followed by advisers which are solely focused on helping people with autistic spectrum disorder into work. Jobcentre Plus policy is to develop our people in the skills required to manage a range of behaviours demonstrated by customers, covering a variety of health conditions. This approach ensures that they are equipped to deal with a diverse set of circumstances whilst treating customers as individuals. Skilled employment advisers look at the interaction between the person, the job and an individual's ability. Advisers ensure that job goals relate to the person's abilities and that relevant solutions are identified in order to overcome any barriers a customer might face in a particular job.</p>
	<p pid="b.1799W.5/5" class="indent">The learning programme for Jobcentre Plus advisers focuses on raising awareness of the customer's personal circumstances and the impact on their ability to move into a sustainable job. Jobcentre Plus also recognises that disabilities and health conditions can affect individuals in different ways. Guidance for advisers includes background information on a number of conditions, including Autistic Spectrum Disorder, the implications for interviews and how to use questioning techniques in order to support customers. Disability Employment Advisers, who focus on customers needing more extensive support, receive further levels of skills training appropriate to their customers, including skills practice in interviewing an autistic person to ensure key learning points are communicated in an effective way.</p>
	<p pid="b.1799W.5/6" class="indent">I have placed in the Library copies of the autism guide notes for advisers and those for Disability Employment Advisers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1799W.5/7" class="indent">The Department for Work and Pensions is a Gold member of the Employers Forum on Disability and will be fully engaged with a forthcoming autism telephone tutorial being held by the Forum on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April 2009</phrase>. Jobcentre Plus staff will be encouraged to access this event and it will be publicised on the Jobcentre Plus intranet site, so that full advantage of this learning opportunity is taken. This will help develop an even greater understanding of autism and the issues related to employment. I will also ensure that any developments which come from the question and answer sessions are made available to advisers.</p>

These are issues that fall within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1800W.2/5" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus is able to access a combination of Government and European Social Funding to offer training for people who find themselves unemployed. I am pleased to tell you that our Regional Minister, Rosie Winterton, recently announced that across Yorkshire and the Humber, Rapid Response Service funding can now be offered to any individual losing their job due to redundancy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1800W.2/6" class="indent">In East Riding of Yorkshire, Jobcentre Plus Advisers are able to refer customers to a range of training provision delivered by our providers Working Links, In Training, A4E and East Riding College. They offer short duration training, mixing accredited and non-accredited provision that is relevant to the local labour market. Qualifications available include health and hygiene certificates, safety passports, fork lift driving licences, manual handling certificates, SIA licences to allow people to work in the security industry as well as help with literacy and numeracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1800W.2/7" class="indent">The same provision helps individuals with the soft skills that employers look for such as self presentation and team work. Our approach reflects what local employers tell us they look for in their recruitment, through Sector Skills Councils and other representative organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1800W.2/8" class="indent">In addition, the Learning Skills Council (LSC) fully funds any first level 2 qualification and many level 3 qualifications. These are delivered through a mixture of Further Education Colleges, private sector and community based providers and can be delivered full time or part time to best suit the individual.</p>
	<p pid="b.1800W.2/9" class="indent">People who become unemployed, or those under threat of redundancy, can get impartial information, advice and guidance about qualifications and training they need to move into their chosen career from the LSC funded Next Step service. This is actively promoted by Jobcentre Plus advisers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1802W.12/1">While the Government believe they continue to do all that is reasonably practicable to reduce fuel poverty by the target dates, we recognise that the current mix of fuel poverty measures is unlikely to eradicate fuel poverty among the vulnerable by 2010. Driven by the effect of higher energy prices on fuel poverty numbers and by the Government's more ambitious aims for reducing carbon emissions, we are undertaking a review of fuel poverty policies and objectives. Initial findings of this review are expected in the summer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1804W.9/1">One of the six largest energy suppliers has already reduced its prices, and a further four have announced that they will do so from the end of March. Recent high prices have been driven mainly by unprecedentedly high wholesale costs for both gas and electricity, which make up around 60 per cent. of the cost of an average domestic bill. Ofgem's estimations of the suppliers' purchasing strategies show that the supply companies' costs peaked towards the end of 2008 and, on the basis of current forward wholesale prices, are expected to decline throughout 2009. Ofgem are now reporting on a quarterly basis on the link between wholesale and retail energy prices as it is vitally important that energy suppliers pass further savings on to their customers.</p>

The review was commissioned to identify gaps in the evidence base and help inform policy development in this area, and as such no evaluation of it has been commissioned. However, the review's conclusions are being discussed with stakeholders.</p>

	<p pid="b.1806W.11/2">The Low Carbon Buildings Programme (LCBP) Phase 1 provides grants to householders to install renewable and low carbon technologies. It aims to run through to June 2010 for new applications and the current forecast for grant commitment is:</p>

		<tbody>
			<tr pid="b.1806W.11/5"> <td></td> <td><i> &pound;</i></td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.1806W.11/6"> <td>2009-10</td> <td>4,590,000</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="b.1806W.11/7"> <td>2010-11</td> <td>3,165,000</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid="b.1806W.11/10">The largest energy efficiency programme in the household sector is carbon emission reduction targets (CERT), which runs from 2008-11 and which is paid for by energy suppliers, not Government. We estimate that, over 2008-11, energy suppliers will pay around &pound;3.2 billion for this programme although they may reach their carbon saving target at lower cost than expected. In addition, the decent homes programme supports social housing in England only and around &pound;250 million was spent on energy efficiency in social housing during EC2 (2005-08) and the CERT calculations are based on the assumption that this level of commitment will continue until 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.1806W.11/11">In terms of the warm front scheme, the funding for the current period (2008-11) is set at &pound;959 million. Current estimates suggest that the scheme will complete approximately 266,000 heating jobs and 210,000 insulation jobs in this period. It is not possible to provide projections relating to spend after this time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1806W.11/12">The policy landscape for energy saving after 2011-12 is not yet fixed. The Government recently released the heat and energy saving strategy for consultation, which outlines the various options and some of these are based on continued commitments from energy suppliers.</p>

A broad estimate of the eventual steady state impact, taking account of the likely taxpayer response to such a change and assuming that the annual exempt amount would continue to exist under this kind of reform, is additional receipts in the order of &pound;200 million a year by comparison with the current capital gains tax (CGT) regime. This estimate should be viewed with caution, as the comparison point is the new 18 per cent. rate of CGT for which data are not yet available.</p>

The child element of child tax credit will increase by &pound;75 above indexation from April 2009, bringing forward the &pound;25 increase originally planned for April 2010 and building on the Government's original commitment to a &pound;50 increase.

As a result, HMRC statistics do not have figures for taxes and duties collected on beer and other alcoholic drinks sold in public houses.

	<p pid="b.1815W.3/1">The Government deplore the activities of so-called vulture funds. We have taken a leading role in efforts to stop these funds profiting from the debts owed by poor countries. We continue to keep all options for tackling this problem under consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.1815W.3/2">Our action has focused on measures we believe will have the most impact in tackling this issue: preventing debts falling into the hands of vulture funds and helping countries to defend themselves in cases already under way.</p>
	<p pid="b.1815W.3/3">To prevent debts falling into the hands of vulture funds in the first place, we have supported the World Bank's debt reduction facility. This facility helps countries buy back their commercial debts at a vastly reduced price, cancelling debt outright and preventing it being enforced before a court. More than $9 billion of poor countries' debts have already been cancelled in this way. Following improvements to the facility, DFID has recently committed more funds&mdash;up to &pound;10 million&mdash;to future commercial debt buy-back operations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1815W.3/4">To help countries defend themselves in existing cases, we have supported the establishment of an African legal support facility to which DFID will contribute &pound;5 million. We believe this will help ensure countries have access to high quality legal advice and expertise, which can be valuable in reducing the impact of litigation. For example, in the case of Zambia, where DFID helped to pay its legal fees when it was targeted by a vulture fund, the court reduced Zambia's liability by around $40 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.1822W.2/1">At the outset of the programme the target was 78 weeks. To date, the average time taken by local authorities to procure their private sector partners to deliver their Building Schools for the Future projects is 102 weeks. This timing compares favourably to other PFI deals in the education and other sectors and is typical of procurement using European Union competitive dialogue or negotiated procedure processes for major procurements. Following a review of BSF procurement (completed in May 2008) we have introduced changes that aim to further significantly streamline the procurement process. As a result, the target procurement time will fall to 74 weeks for authorities just entering the programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1822W.2/2">During the procurement period, local authorities engage with the private sector bidders and work towards the selection of a partner through competitive bid evaluation. The bidding costs during this part of the process are borne by the private sector, with the public sector incurring costs associated with the project management of the procurement. These costs can vary significantly depending on a number of project-specific factors, including the size of the project.</p>

	<p pid="b.1822W.5/1">Data published by the Department as SFR 23/2008: &quot;Children looked after in England (including adoption and care leavers) year ending <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>&quot;, show 47,600 children aged between five and 19 as being looked after by local authorities as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>. The source of this publication is the SSDA903, which does not collect information on whether a child is part of their school's gifted and talented cohort. Information on gifted and talented pupils is, however, collected in the School Census which also collects information on whether a child is in care whilst at their school.</p>
	<p pid="b.1822W.5/2">The most recent census data relate to January 2008. The census shows 34,390 pupils aged five to 19 attending primary, secondary and special schools who are classed as being in care as at January 2008. The School Census does not cover all looked after children; information is not collected for pupils in alternative provision, including pupil referral units, FE colleges, voluntary provision and those not in education or training. These differences in coverage will explain the different counts to an extent, but it is possible that the School Census undercounts the number of looked after children in primary, secondary and special schools.</p>
	<p pid="b.1822W.5/3">The information available is shown in the following table. Information on gifted and talented pupils was first collected for primary and secondary schools in 2007 therefore information for the last five years is not available.</p>

	<p pid="b.1824W.8/1">Information for the full period from 1997 is not available as the maximum time for the retention of records relating to contracts for services of the type supplied by Capgemini is six years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1824W.8/2">The Department and its predecessor, the Department for Education and Skills, have placed three major centrally negotiated contracts with Capgemini. The first of these, a Business Services Framework Agreement dating from November 2001, covered five service categories together with the transition of services from a previous supplier. These services were applications support and maintenance, applications development, information systems support, hosting and consultancy, and business transformation. Work orders were used to commission specific pieces of work in these categories from Capgemini.</p>
	<p pid="b.1824W.8/3">Following expiry of this contract on <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-30">30 September 2008</phrase>, a second contract was placed for the period to <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March 2011</phrase>. This contract, also requiring individual work orders, covers the same range of services but will be used primarily for applications support and maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1824W.8/4">The third contract is for the build and testing of ContactPoint and its continuing support and hosting. The support and hosting element expires no later than 2014. Details of expenditure on this contract have been given in response to PQ259398, <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-04">4 March 2009</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-03-04.1676"><i> Official Report</i>, column 1676W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1824W.8/5">Additionally since March 2006 three consultancy contracts were awarded by the Department to Capgemini. Two of these were for advice for the Corporate Service Transformation Programme, and one was for expert advisers to work with low-performing schools. Information on other contracts is not held centrally and to gather the information retrospectively would exceed the disproportionate cost threshold.</p>

	<p pid="b.1831W.2/1">The leaflet for parents on talking to their teenage children about sex and relationships strongly encourages them to share their values with their children and that clearly includes their views about what's right and wrong. However, the leaflet also draws on research summarised in &quot;The Nature of Adolescence&quot; (John Coleman and Leo Hendry, 1999) which shows that the most effective way of communicating with teenagers is to encourage discussion rather than simply telling them what to think. Teenagers whose parents have an authoritative rather than authoritarian style are less likely to be involved in risky behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.1831W.2/2">The leaflet highlights the important role that parents&mdash;fathers and mothers&mdash;have in: helping their daughters and sons resist pressure to have early sex; to understand their feelings and the feelings of others; and to take responsibility for preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) if and when they do choose to become sexually active.</p>
	<p pid="b.1831W.2/3">The leaflet was drafted by DCSF officials in conjunction with colleagues at Parentline Plus. The content was informed by research into parents' views and experiences of talking to their teenage children. There was no formal public consultation on the leaflet before it was published. The leaflet will be available in pharmacies from early March 2009. The total cost of design, print and production of the leaflet was &pound;14,427. A copy of the leaflet will be placed in the House Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="b.1833W.3/1">We do not collect programme specific data about the reduction of surplus places linked directly to capital investment through either Building Schools for the Future or the Primary Capital Programme. We have nevertheless made clear in relation to both programmes that all local authorities should look for opportunities to remove excessive numbers of surplus places; particularly where these are linked to poor standards. Maintaining surplus places can represent a poor use of resources&mdash;resources that can be used more effectively to support schools in raising standards and delivering better outcomes for children. That said, it is accepted that in order to preserve access for young children, there may be more empty places in schools in rural areas than in urban areas.</p>

By 2010-11, the total per pupil funding for the state sector will rise to &pound;6,550. This means that between 2005-06 and 2010-11, we will have raised maintained sector funding by &pound;1,000 per pupil in real terms and will have closed the gap with the private sector 2005-06 figure by 30 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1834W.5/1">Many Building Schools for the Future (BSF) bidders already submit proposals for provision of apprenticeships and other training programmes in such areas as construction, technical building services, facilities management and ICT etc., but to date there has been no formal requirement for local authorities to include such proposals in their service specifications. From June 2009 these requirements will become formalised for new projects only and be assessed by Partnerships for Schools and the local authority through the procurement process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1834W.5/2">The pre-Budget report in November announced that Government Departments and their agencies committed that whenever they let a new construction contract they will consider making it a requirement that successful contractors have apprentices as a proportion of the project work force. This commitment will apply to the strategic, centrally-managed BSF programme. In relation to devolved capital programmes and Primary Capital Programme projects not delivered through BSF, we want to see local authorities taking forward the skills procurement agenda using their contract management and planning powers in construction and other service areas including facilities management and ICT. In addition to the letting of new contracts, local authorities can also work with existing contractors and encourage them to provide training and apprenticeships training opportunities for their work force. To support the implementation of the skills procurement agenda, DIUS officials are working with OGC to develop and disseminate guidance on how skills requirements can be included in the procurement processes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1836W.8/1">The 228 independent schools catering wholly or mainly for pupils with special educational needs which opened between <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-08-31">31 August 2008</phrase> are listed alphabetically below in local authority order.</p>
	<p pid="b.1836W.8/2">The Education Act 2002 amended the definition of an independent school to include institutions providing full time education for one or more pupils with a statement of special educational needs or a looked after child. This resulted in a number of children's homes which provide education on the premises registering as independent schools.</p>

	<p pid="b.1841W.5/1">Opening hours are a matter for local decision, taking account of the range of needs and resources to meet these. From April 2009 this Government are allocating over &pound;1 billion a year to local authorities to support services in Sure Start Children's Centres. And Sure Start Children's Centres have changed the way many parents access essential services during their children's early years by delivering them closer to where families live and in ways that suit families needs. Centres offering integrated early learning and day care facilities as part of their services are required to be open 10 hours a day, five days a week and 48 weeks a year. They also have flexibility to open at other times. Other centres have more flexible opening hours but all centres will aim to provide services at times that suit the communities' needs &mdash; which can mean opening in the evenings and at weekends. Some centres have, for example, found that the best time to offer activities for fathers and their children is on Saturday morning. Guidance on opening times can be found in Chapter 3 of 'Sure Start Children's Centres Planning and Performance Management Guidance' (2006).</p>

	<p pid="b.1842W.2/2">Modern languages remains a priority subject within initial teacher training and eligible trainees on PGCE courses leading to qualified teacher status can currently receive the maximum &pound;9,000 training bursary and a &pound;2,500 golden hello in the second year of teaching. The subject also has a proportionately higher profile in the Training and Development Agency for Schools advertising and marketing activities. This includes specialised direct marketing materials being sent to all those who register an interest in teaching the subject.
