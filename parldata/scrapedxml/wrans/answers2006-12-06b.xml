	<p pid="b.408W.9/1">I have not provided specific guidance to the CPS on this issue, and neither has the Attorney-General.</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.9/2">As the Crown Prosecution Service is now responsible for advising the police on cases for possible prosecution and deciding whether to charge in all but the most minor of cases, cases involving false rape allegations will be referred to prosecutors for a charging decision. Potential charges are wasting police time and perverting the course of justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.9/3">All cases must be reviewed in accordance with the code for Crown Prosecutors. Application of the code means that a case is prosecuted when there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that the prosecution is in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.408W.9/4">Specific guidance on public justice offences is published jointly by the CPS and the Association of Chief Police Officers. The guidance provides that it is likely that a charge of perverting the course of justice will be appropriate when the making of a false allegation wrongfully exposes another person to the risk of arrest, imprisonment pending trial, and possible wrongful conviction and sentence.</p>

	<p pid="b.410W.2/1">The Department completes the annual Office of Government Commerce (OGC) value for money return, and has done so since the Department was created in May 2002. This uses methodologies published by OGC to measure value for money gains across the whole procurement function. Information about specific value for money exercises for individual projects is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.2/2">The Department follows Government procurement policy and OGC published guidance on best practice in procurement of goods and services. Procurement will mostly be by competitive tender with the contract being awarded to the supplier offering best overall value for money. In the case of consultancy and professional advisers the Department also makes use of pre-completed framework agreements negotiated centrally by OGC Buying Solutions on behalf of central Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.410W.2/3">The internal audit programme regularly includes audits that check compliance with procurement policies and procedures.</p>

	<p pid="b.416W.5/1">Traffic Authorities have a wide range of measures at their disposal to achieve appropriate vehicle speeds and they are best placed to decide the most suitable approach at a particular location. Vehicle activated signs and safety cameras are used to tackle different speeding problems. Vehicle activated signs are generally used to tackle inappropriate speed and have proven particularly effective when used to warn drivers of approaching hazards on rural roads. Safety cameras are effective in tackling excessive speed (i.e. over the posted speed limit).</p>

	<p pid="b.416W.11/1">The section of proprietary low noise surfacing asphalt incorporating approximately 5 per cent. reprocessed waste tyres was laid on a county road by Surrey county council in 1998. However, it failed prematurely and had to be replaced. A further trial, just under one mile long, was subsequently laid on the A244 Hersham bypass in June 1999, also by Surrey county council. For two years its performance was monitored as part of the Highways Agency's research programme. Following its satisfactory performance, a more heavily trafficked trial site on a short length of the A34 trunk road was offered by the Highways Agency, but the company that supplied the surfacing decided not to proceed.</p>

	<p pid="b.420W.5/1">Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act (1990) places a duty on local authorities (LAs) in England to identify contaminated land in their area, and to ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken. Where land has been identified as contaminated, the LA will try to find the person who caused, or knowingly permitted, the presence of the substances causing the problem. If found, they will be required to carry out any necessary remedial works. Where the person responsible cannot be found, for example because a company is no longer in existence, the landowner may be the appropriate person, subject to detailed rules in the Act and the statutory guidance. The guidance (DEFRA Circular 01/2006) is available on the DEFRA website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.420W.5/3">The regime allows for voluntary remediation, and also for the relevant LA to carry out remediation on behalf of those considered liable and to recover the cost. As a last resort, the LA can serve a remediation notice requiring work to be done, subject to a right of appeal. Failure to comply with a remediation notice is a criminal offence.</p>

Since November 2005, 17 mink have been examined for the fluke with four cases confirmed as being infected.</p>

	<p pid="b.425W.3/1">The Human Animal, Infections and Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group which includes representatives from the Health Protection Agency, the Department of Health, DEFRA, the Veterinary Laboratories Agency and the devolved Administrations, conducted a risk assessment for the zoonotic potential of this parasite in July 2005. They concluded that the possibility of pathogenicity to humans cannot be excluded but human exposure has not yet been identified. The fluke may only be transmitted to humans through the consumption of raw infected fish from rivers. However, the species which harbour this parasite in endemic countries are unlikely to be consumed by humans. There is no record of Pseudamphistomum truncatum in any fish species in the UK despite regular parasite examination of wild fish populations.</p>
	<p pid="b.425W.3/2">The veterinary pathologist who reported the disease in the UK, and is conducting the long-term health monitoring programs for otters, published a letter in the Veterinary Record in January 2006 which informed veterinarians of the potential risk to cats and dogs which feed on raw fish products.</p>
	<p pid="b.425W.3/3">The fluke is widespread in Eastern Europe and Russia and has been reported in otters and foxes in Germany and France and in mink in Spain. Low numbers of human cases have been reported in Russia and these are associated with consumption of raw fish. Cases in cats and dogs have occurred in the aforementioned countries and in Italy. The pathogencity of the disease is not fully understood but the health of all species including humans only seems to be compromised following severe infections of a chronic nature.</p>

	<p pid="b.427W.0/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.427W.0/2">A UK nuclear operator's liability for third party property damage and personal injury caused by a nuclear accident is generally limited to &pound;140 million. The limit is set in the Nuclear Installations Act 1965, as amended. The Act gives effect to the UK's international legal obligations under the Paris Convention on third party nuclear liability and the Brussels Supplementary Convention. The Paris Convention sets a minimum liability limit for nuclear operators. In the event of a nuclear accident for which a UK operator was liable the UK operator would be obliged, as the law stands, to pay compensation very greatly in excess of the Convention minimum and significantly in excess of the OECD recommended minimum. The operator is strictly liable, which means that it would not be necessary for a person seeking compensation for property damage or personal injury to prove negligence. Other requirements and conditions apply under the Act and the Conventions. For example, the operators of licensed nuclear sites in the UK are required to maintain insurance or other financial security covering their liability. The Paris and Brussels Conventions have recently been amended, but the amendments are not in force. Amongst other things, these amendments will, generally speaking, increase the amount of compensation an operator must provide to at least &euro;700 million per incident. In that context, therefore, the liability limit of UK operators is under review. Work to implement these changes into UK law is being taken forward together with other contracting parties to the Conventions.</p>

A decision can only be reached once all the outstanding issues have been resolved to an extent which will allow the National Assembly for Wales to make a decision on the licence application.</p>

	<p pid="b.430W.2/1">As part of its proposals for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, the European Commission has published an action plan on improving environmental integration in fisheries management. The plan indicates that the European Community intends to follow the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's (FAO) International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries. The UK is fully supportive of this initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.2/2">Little is known about the effects of discarding of fish at sea on seabird populations. For some species it has been shown to have a positive effect by improving foraging possibilities and thus enhancing their populations. Birdlife International, however, concluded that the overall elimination of discards was more important in environmental terms than the short-term beneficial effects their continuation might have for seabirds.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.2/3">In 2000, the UK was instrumental in establishing of the closure of the &quot;wee Bankie&quot; grounds&mdash;off the coast of eastern Scotland and North East England&mdash;to sandeel fishing to protect breeding seabird populations. We have continued to support the closure in the interim.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.2/4">Outside EU waters, but still relevant to Community vessels fishing further afield, there are sea bird by-catch mitigation measures in place under Regional Fisheries Management Organisations. These include the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and the Commission for the Conservation of the Arctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) also has some measures in place. However, these could be more comprehensive. With this in mind, the Government are proposing a study which will assess the impact on sea birds of the Atlantic tuna fishery. The outcome of this research will inform further appropriate conservation management measures.</p>

	<p pid="b.430W.5/1">Under the internationally agreed methodology, greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping are excluded from the national greenhouse gas inventory. They are reported separately as a memo item and, if included, would represent less than 1 per cent. of the UK total CO2 emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.5/2">The UK's approach to the regulation of shipping is to apply international standards to ships flying its flag and to ships entering its ports or operating in UK waters. Work on reducing maritime emissions is co-ordinated by the International Maritime Organisation. At the last Maritime Environment Protection Committee meeting in October 2006, the UK made a significant contribution to difficult negotiations on the adoption of Interim Guidelines for Voluntary Ship CO2 Emission Indexing for Use in Trials (as well as Guidelines for On-board Exhaust Gas Sulphur Oxide Cleaning Systems). Ships under the United Kingdom flag are being encouraged to participate in these trials, which will help identify a ship's greenhouse gas index where the information obtained may be used in the context of reducing CO2 emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.430W.5/3">The UK has also continued to push for the consideration of measures to reduce harmful emissions of a wider range of greenhouse gases, including Nitrogen oxides, and has strongly advocated emissions trading as the most effective tool.</p>

	<p pid="b.437W.9/1">The majority of these changes to the Departmental Expenditure Limit relate to the Department's fixed asset management project which is part of the Defence Resource Management Programme to 'simplify and improve' financial processes across the Department. The changes reflect the centralisation of fixed asset management under four single balance sheet owners (SBSOs) Defence Estates (DE), Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO), Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) and the Defence Communications Services Agency (DCSA), which is part of the DLO. This resulted in net increases to the Defence Logistics Organisation and Defence Estates, offset by reductions in the other TLBs. There will be further adjustments in the Spring Supplementary Estimates.</p>

	<p pid="b.451W.8/2">The Government's waste policy prioritises prevention, reuse and recycling over the recovery of energy from residual wastes. But where prevention, reuse and recycling are not practical, recovering energy from waste could displace fossil generation and contribute to our energy policy and climate change goals as a secure source of low carbon energy. DEFRA have indicated energy from residual waste could provide some 6 TWh by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.451W.8/3">DTI commissioned Ilex Energy Consultants to look at the potential contribution from energy from waste during the Review of the Renewables Obligation in 2005 and the reports are available at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file21117.pdf">http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file21117.pdf</a> and <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file22325.pdf">http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file22325.pdf</a>. Following the Review eligibility for energy from waste was extended to include good quality CHP projects and dedicated biomass projects from which at least 90 per cent. of the energy produced came from biomass.</p>

	<p pid="b.455W.3/2">The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) strongly recommends the use of approved, audible carbon monoxide (CO) detectors in all homes that use gas appliances. Such detectors should not be regarded as a substitute for competent maintenance and annual safety checks of gas equipment by a CORGI-registered installer. These primary safeguards are required by law in rented accommodation.</p>

	<p pid="b.455W.3/4">There is a range of penalties that the courts can impose if a landlord is guilty of an offence. Magistrates courts can impose a fine of up to &pound;5,000 on summary conviction. The Crown Court can impose an unlimited fine. If death results from CO poisoning, the Crown Prosecution Service can decide to bring manslaughter charges for which life imprisonment is the maximum penalty.</p>

	<p pid="b.477W.6/1">We follow events closely in Bolivia through our embassy in La Paz and with our EU partners. We welcomed the democratic election of the Government of President Morales last December, and recognise the clear mandate for change this signalled. Bolivia faces many challenges as it approaches this process of change and we are aware of opposition within Bolivia to some of Morales' policies. It is important that political and economic reforms fully respect the democratic process. We hope that all parties will work together, maintaining an open and constructive dialogue, to ensure the future prosperity of Bolivia within a democratic system. We are not aware of significant constraints on media freedom or the freedom of assembly in Bolivia. We will continue to monitor the situation. Where we have specific concerns about political freedom, media freedom and freedom of assembly, we will make representations to the Bolivian Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.477W.6/2">We also monitor developments in Venezuela. We continue to encourage the Venezuelan Government, both bilaterally and through the EU, to ensure that the right to political freedom and freedom of assembly is fully respected. The Bolivarian Constitution protects the right of those working in the public sector to such freedoms, free from pressure to support a particular party or person. Embracing political pluralism, also enshrined in the Constitution, is the best path to full protection of political freedom. While the Venezuelan media generally has the freedom to act without undue interference, a number of international organisations have expressed concern recently about the law on social responsibility in radio and television. Some elements of the law were undoubtedly necessary, but we share concerns that the law also gives the state greater powers to control the Venezuelan media. We also have concerns relating to the draft international co-operation law, which governs the activities of non-governmental organisations, and have made representations to the Venezuelan Government, with our EU colleagues.</p>

	<p pid="b.479W.2/1">Both polling days in the Democratic Republic of Congo were generally well conducted under the guidance of the Independent Electoral Commission (CEI) with significant international support. Reports from Congolese and international observer missions, such as the Carter Centre and the European Union, identified some isolated technical problems and irregularities in the process. These irregularities included inflation of turnout and discrepancies between votes cast and scores published in some constituencies. However, their reports indicate that both presidential candidates benefited and that these irregularities had no significant effect on overall results. We share the observer missions' belief that the results published by the CEI and endorsed by the Supreme Court of Justice on <phrase class="date" code="">27 November</phrase> are credible and reflect the will of the Congolese people.</p>

	<p pid="b.488W.11/1">FA 2002, the Loan Relationships and Derivative Contracts legislation incorporating Foreign Exchange, refocused the rules for taxing complex financial transactions to enable them to reflect and respond better to a dynamic and evolving market. At the same time, tax and accounting measures of profits were aligned and structural weaknesses that had given scope for avoidance were addressed. At the time we estimated that avoidance by corporations using schemes involving financial instruments amounted to an Exchequer loss of around &pound;350 million per annum. Given the wide-ranging remit of the FA 2002 changes, we have not been able to isolate the contribution of these rules to the overall increase in CT in the intervening years.</p>

	<p pid="b.492W.15/3">We do not centrally record the number of child care places available in children's centres. Centres in the most disadvantaged areas cannot be designated without integrated early learning and child care for children under the age of five, but local authorities decide how many places can be sustained in a given area. However, we are implementing more sophisticated tracking systems for the second phase of the programme (2006-08) that will provide a clearer picture of services delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.492W.15/4">There are currently no Early Years Professionals although some people are currently receiving the training. However, for a children's centre to be designated it must employ a qualified teacher who spends half their working hours at the centre. The qualified teacher's role is to lead the planning, development and delivery of the curriculum and lead on the observation and assessment of young children's progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.492W.15/5">No assessment to date has been made of the effectiveness of Sure Start Children's Centres which are still in the early stages of roll out and it is too early to assess what impact they are having. However, some children's centres have been developed from earlier Sure Start funded settings such as Sure Start Local Programmes and evaluation of these programmes is under way. Lessons from this research are being used to inform the development of Sure Start Children's Centres including the recently published &quot;Revised Sure Start Children's Centres Practice Guidance&quot; and &quot;Planning and Performance Management Guidance&quot; for local authorities and Sure Start Children's Centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.492W.15/6">We are giving further consideration to how we can best assess the effectiveness of children's centres in the longer-term.</p>

At least 144 local authorities have or are in the process of appointing a Director of Children's Services with responsibility for bringing together education and children's social services.

	<p pid="b.494W.2/1">The Early Support Programme operates in 45 Pathfinder local authority areas across the country, and in 2006-07 the principles of the programme are being extended to other local authorities across the country. An independent evaluation of the programme in the Pathfinder areas was carried out in 2006 by a team from the University of Manchester and the University of Central Lancashire. The evaluation found that across the Pathfinder areas, the programme has improved the planning and delivery of services to disabled children and their families, particularly through stronger joint working across those agencies involved in providing care and support for these children. It also highlighted the key challenges that many Pathfinder areas still face in successfully integrating services for disabled children around the needs of the child. As with all pathfinder projects, best practice from the programme will form the basis for extending and embedding the principles of Early Support across the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.499W.12/1">Aid for Trade aims to enable people in developing countries to trade their way out of poverty. It can be extremely effective. For example, DFID is providing &pound;3 million to Lesotho for tax reforms that have already resulted in a 204 per cent. increase in revenue collection. UK policy is to work for substantial, monitorable increases in global Aid for Trade. In December 2005 donors committed to increasing spending to $4 billion by 2010, and agreed recommendations on how to do so effectively at the World Trade Organisation in October 2006. We will continue to work for full implementation of these commitments.</p>

DFID supports reform in the Federal Ministry of Education, works with the World Bank to deliver Education Sector Programmes in three States and provides &pound;26 million through UNICEF for a Girls Education Project in six northern States with the highest differences in the number of girls and boys in school.

Prior to the conference the Government announced plans to withdraw 'dumb' cluster munitions from service by the middle of the next decade and called on others to do likewise. We succeeded in getting agreement to urgent expert discussions on the humanitarian impact of these weapons&mdash;an essential step toward negotiating a legally binding instrument on their use. No such agreement was possible on Anti-vehicle Mines. The UK therefore announced that it will, over time, introduce measures to reduce the humanitarian impact of these mines.</p>

WHO is a key partner in the Right to Sight, and has established specific disease control programmes such as the Global Elimination of Trachoma. UNICEF works to prevent measles and Vitamin A deficiency, both of which can cause blindness.</p>

	<p pid="b.503W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.5/2">The United Kingdom has consistently supported the valuable work of the Hague Conference, a long established international organisation whose purpose is to work to unify the rules of private international law.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.5/3">Under the Conference's original statute only states were entitled to become parties to it. This did not cause any significant problems in practice or affect the position of the European Community itself in negotiations under Community law. However, the adoption of measures of Community law in the area of private international law led to increased co-operation between the member states of the Community in relation to the work of the Conference. The exclusion of the Community as a formal party to the Conference was therefore becoming increasingly anomalous.</p>
	<p pid="b.503W.5/4">In the light of these considerations and the desirability of supporting the full and constructive participation of the Community in the work of the Conference, the Government decided the United Kingdom should opt in under our Protocol on Title IV measures to a proposal that the Community should support amendments to the statute allowing the Community to become a party to the Conference. A package of amendments to give effect to this proposal has now been ratified by the necessary two-thirds majority of the state parties to the Conference, including the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.504W.2/1">During the planning phase for the current board member and chair recruitment, the previous skills and competencies by which the existing Boards were recruited have been extensively rewritten with a view to making them more relevant to an environment of Public Value Partnerships and a mixed economy. It was against these skills and competencies that all candidates were assessed and ultimately short listed.</p>
	<p pid="b.504W.2/2">The revised competencies focus on skills acquired within public, private and not for profit organisations&mdash;people management, financial management, strategic management, operational management and corporate management.</p>
	<p pid="b.504W.2/3">All successful board chairs have been invited to attend a two day induction event on corporate governance on the 6 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-07">7 December 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.504W.2/4">A number of day long training sessions on key issues affecting the work of the board chairs will be delivered on a monthly basis from February 2007. These events will include topics such as financial and resource management, performance management, public promotion of probation, public protection, budget management, etc. A major theme will be the transition from board to trust status and how probation will operate in this new environment. Chief Officers who are ex-officio members of boards are the accountable officers in terms of budgets and also have responsibility for all operational matters including public protection. The new board chairs have a key ambassadorial role for their board and this will be developed in the programme outlined above.</p>
	<p pid="b.504W.2/5">There are plans to organise an induction seminar and ongoing training events for new board members. This will be arranged in early-mid 2007. There will also be induction exercises at the local board and regional level</p>

	<p pid="b.510W.5/2"><i> :</i> It was changes to the law introduced by the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 which encouraged a particular focus on the possibility of a device that could derive a reliable indication whether a person had a drug in his body from a sample of sweat or saliva. Work to develop a specification for such a device has been part of this focus, but it is not possible to give a precise date for when it began. Consideration of how best to test for the presence of drugs in a driver had been under way for some time before that at both the Home Office Scientific Development Branch and the Forensic Science Service and broader work continues alongside the development of a specification.</p>
	<p pid="b.510W.5/3">The development has involved outside academic experts and consultation with industry and other interested parties. The most recent consultation took place in summer this year. A specification will issue as soon as the results of this consultation and any further consultation that might be necessary has been fully taken into account. No specific date has been set for the completion of the work, as this will depend on the outcome of the consultation. There would be no value in a specification that did not meet all the appropriate requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.510W.5/4">The work has also had regard to relevant research, particularly the joint European/USA ROSITA-II study. The findings are available at <a href="http://www.rosita.org">www.rosita.org</a>. A wide range of problems was found with the different devices tested, both in their accuracy and sensitivity and in their operational use. The specific conclusion was that</p>

	<p pid="b.511W.2/1">The following arrangements are in place between the UK and each EU member state:</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.2/2">An EU Council Decision (CD) on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record (2005/876/JHA) was adopted on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-21">21 November 2005</phrase>. This CD allows member states to exchange information as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.2/3" class="indent">'Own Initiative notifications'&mdash;Where a national of another member state is convicted, the convicting member state must inform the member state of nationality without delay of that conviction.</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.2/4" class="indent">'Requests for information'&mdash;Requests may be made for information held on the criminal record of another member state in the following circumstances;</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.2/5" class="indent">(a) For use in criminal proceedings</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.2/6" class="indent">(b) From a judicial authority outside the context of criminal proceedings</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.2/7" class="indent">(c) A request made by the person concerned</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.2/8">Responses must be made within 10 working days (extensions are allowed where information is required to clarify the identification of the person concerned).</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.2/9">Requests, responses and the use of data given in response can only be made in accordance with national laws of the states concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.2/10">The UK Central Authority required to carry out these functions was established in May 2006. A Framework Decision (FD) is currently under negotiation which also aims to introduce a common format and an electronic mechanism to facilitate the exchange of information.</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.2/11">The CD allows the UK to make requests for information for employment vetting. The CRB are undertaking a feasibility study into how many other member states are willing and/or able to share data with the UK for that purpose. The CRB are writing to other member states to establish this information.</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.2/12">The CD and FD deal only with criminal conviction information. There are no plans at present to exchange non-conviction information between EU member states. It is prudent to establish the principal of exchanging conviction data with other member states before exploring the issue of exchanging non-conviction and 'soft' intelligence, and while bilateral discussions with other countries are at an early stage there are some positive indications on which we hope to build.</p>
	<p pid="b.511W.2/13">Under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, criminal records information obtained by the CRB will be passed to the new Independent Barring Board in cases where a discretionary decision is required. It may also be possible for the board to request information from other EU member states in accordance with the CD and FD.</p>

	<p pid="b.518W.0/1">Departments have delegated authority to determine their own pay and grading arrangements below the senior civil service that are tailored to meet their business needs. Detailed information on bonus payments for civil service staff below the SCS is not held centrally and could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost. For information on bonus payments made by individual Departments to their staff I refer the hon. Member to the answers provided by Departments in response to questions from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.518W.0/2">The pay arrangements for the senior civil service are managed within a central framework set out by the Cabinet Office. Within that framework, Departments, agencies and the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales are encouraged to make full use of the flexibility available to them to tailor the arrangements to suit their particular operational and business needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.518W.0/3">The Cabinet Office issues guidance each year, in the light of the Government's response to the recommendations of the independent Senior Salaries Review Body, setting out the parameters within which performance related pay awards for the senior civil service are to be made for that year. In the SCS bonuses are used as the main way of rewarding in year delivery of objectives. The bonus pot was introduced in 2002 and since then we have recommended, and the SSRB have supported, increases in the size of the bonus pot as a proportion of the total pay bill so that by 2006 it stood at 6.5 per cent, of the overall pay bill<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.518W.0/4">We intend to increase the size of the bonus to 10 per cent. of the pay bill, to reinforce our commitment to improved service delivery performance through meaningful incentives that have to be re-earned each year and to allow greater differentiation in the awards to reflect the heterogeneity of individual achievement, particularly between the strongest and weakest deliverers. The table provides estimates of total expenditure on bonuses within the SCS from 2002.</p>

Under the delegated arrangements, comprehensive information on grading structures in individual departments is not held centrally and could only be collected at disproportionate cost. Similarly, it is for each department to determine what bargaining arrangements are appropriate for their own organisation and their executive agencies. Cabinet Office records indicate that there are about 80 bargaining units currently operating across the civil service and there were about 100 in 2002. Cabinet Office has no records for the other years requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.518W.3/2">Pay for senior civil servants is not delegated to departments and is not subject to collective bargaining. The number of SCS pay bands was reduced from nine to four in 2001; this remains the current position.</p>

	<p pid="b.521W.3/1">All members of the senior civil service (SCS) are considered for a bonus on top of their regular salary. In line with Cabinet Office guidance bonuses are awarded to between 60 per cent. and 75 per cent. of SCS members. Awards are made by relatively assessing individuals in relation to others in the same SCS pay band. In determining performance-related bonus payments, the following criteria were used to award bonuses this year:</p>
	<p pid="b.521W.3/2" class="indent">Performance against agreed priority business objectives or targets;</p>
	<p pid="b.521W.3/3" class="indent">Total delivery record over the year;</p>

	<p pid="b.521W.3/6">Below SCS, the Department for Work and Pensions currently operates two separate bonus schemes, which may be paid on top of regular salary: These are the individual performance bonus scheme and the special bonus scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.521W.3/7">Individual Performance Bonus: All staff have the potential to earn an individual performance bonus, based on the performance level they receive through our performance management system. Individual performance is relatively assessed at the end of the performance year. There are 4 performance levels. In 2006 people who achieved one of the top 3 levels received a bonus, determined by their grade and performance level.</p>
	<p pid="b.521W.3/8">Special Bonus: The special bonus scheme enables line managers to award a one-off bonus to recognise and reward exceptional personal or team achievement. Detailed criteria are determined by local managers. Awards may be cash or vouchers but the amounts that can be awarded are modest because the total expenditure over the year is limited to 0.25 per cent. of the manager's staffing budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.521W.3/9">All bonuses are non-consolidated and so they are not added into salary and are not pensionable.</p>

	<p pid="b.525W.8/1">The level of housing benefit fraud and error in Great Britain has been continuously measured since 2002-03. The latest estimates are for the year from October 2004 to September 2005. The percentage of expenditure overpaid due to fraud is estimated to have dropped by 38 per cent. since 2002-03. Estimates of both the percentage and amount of housing benefit expenditure overpaid due to fraud in England are presented in the following table. When comparing levels of fraud in different years it is more appropriate to look at percentages, as the amount overpaid is also affected by changes in rents and caseload.</p>

	<p pid="b.530W.2/1">The administration of Jobcentre Plus is a matter for the chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, Lesley Strathie. I have asked her to provide the hon. Member with the information requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.530W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Leslie Strathie:</p>
	<p pid="b.530W.2/3" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking which Jobcentre Plus Offices were closed in each of the last four years, and in each case whether prior to closure the office was open full-time or part-time. This is something, which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.530W.2/4" class="indent">I enclose a list of the offices that were closed and have indicated in each case whether the office was open full-time or part-time prior to closure. I have placed a copy in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.530W.2/5" class="indent">Firstly, as part of the rollout of the new Jobcentre Plus network we have rationalised our estate. We inherited around 1500 offices from the former Employment Service and Benefits Agency, several of which were unsuitable for the new processes, or were in the wrong place or in a poor state of repair. Often, the former agencies had offices situated at either end of the High Street and, in some instances, neither was suitable for conversion to Jobcentre Plus so we closed one or both of them. In each District we undertook detailed service delivery planning exercises in consultation with local stakeholders, identifying the sites which we would convert to the new standard and those, which needed to close. We also explained how, particularly in more rural locations, we would offer outreach services (&quot;flexible service delivery&quot;).</p>
	<p pid="b.530W.2/6" class="indent">Secondly, as a result of our programme to centralise benefit processing we have identified sites which will no longer be viable once processing work has been taken away from them.</p>
	<p pid="b.530W.2/7" class="indent">Thirdly, we have been looking very closely at the need for public-facing sites in a number of locations. The increased availability of new channels means that Jobcentre Plus customers can access services directly by telephone or Internet rather than needing to call into one of our offices. Reducing expenditure on our office network is part of our wider strategy for focusing resources more effectively on frontline advisory services to help our customers move into work.</p>
	<p pid="b.530W.2/8" class="indent">The list of closures should also be set against the 837 offices that we have rolled out to date under our restructuring programme, plus over 150 locations where we have installed flexible service delivery arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.530W.2/9" class="indent">I would emphasise that the closure of any of our offices involves consultation with local stakeholders, including MPs, and putting in place suitable alternative arrangements for delivering services to our customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.530W.2/10" class="indent">I hope this is helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.536W.3/2">The 2002 statutory paternity pay regulatory impact assessment (RIA) estimated the annual amount of statutory paternity pay reclaimable from the Exchequer at around &pound;57 million. This assumed 70 per cent. of the total number eligible to receive statutory paid paternity leave would take it up.</p>
	<p pid="b.536W.3/3">The Maternity and Paternity Rights and Benefits Survey 2005 found around 80 per cent. of the 415,000 eligible fathers surveyed had used at least some of their statutory entitlement, suggesting a higher take-up rate than estimated in the RIA. Although the take-up has been higher than originally estimated, not all fathers take their full entitlement to two weeks paid paternity leave. Therefore we anticipate that the costs of statutory paternity pay are around the level presented in the RIA.</p>

	<p pid="b.538W.5/1">There is now clear evidence showing the benefits of breast cancer screening on a population basis for women aged 50 to 70. The evidence for inviting women aged over 70 on a population basis is not so clear.</p>
	<p pid="b.538W.5/2">That is why research has been commissioned on behalf of the advisory committee on breast cancer screening (ACBCS) to bring more clarity to this area. A final report of the research is due shortly, and based on this the ACBCS will advise on a way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.538W.5/3">Women aged over 70 can self-refer for free three-yearly screening and women who have already participated in the programme should be informed of this right after the age of 70.</p>
	<p pid="b.538W.5/4">The availability of screening for older women is widely publicised. In particular, we have collaborated with Age Concern to produce the leaflet, 'Over 70? You are still entitled to breast screening'. The leaflet is widely available in general practitioner surgeries, health centres, breast screening units and Age Concern outlets and as with 'Breast Screening&mdash;The Facts' it allows women aged over 70 to make an informed choice on whether to be screened or not.</p>
	<p pid="b.538W.5/5">We are aware that there are a growing number of women becoming eligible for breast screening, as women born in the post-war baby boom reach their 50th birthdays and we expect this increase to peak in 2015, resulting in a 20 per cent. increase in women aged 50 to 70 in England between 2005 and 2025.</p>
	<p pid="b.538W.5/6">Breast screening capacity in the National Health Service needs to increase to meet this demographic challenge, and the cancer programme board are considering what action may be taken in this area. It is for primary care trusts and cancer networks, in collaboration with local stakeholders, to decide how local services are organised and patients supported.</p>

	<p pid="b.542W.8/1">The proportion of community pharmacies overall providing additional agreed hours for example, in the evening or at weekends declined from 45.5 per cent. in 2004-05 to 31.9 per cent. in 2005-06.</p>
	<p pid="b.542W.8/2">This continues a trend seen in previous years although the change between 2004-05 and 2005-06 is more marked. However, this change may be offset by 1,432 new out of hours services provided by pharmacy contractors as a local enhanced service for the first time in 2005-06. Some of these new services may have replaced previous agreements for additional hours.</p>
	<p pid="b.542W.8/3">The change may also be attributed to the increase in a community pharmacy's minimum contracted hours from 30 to 40 hours per week from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> and to those contractors who have opened pharmacies for at least 100 hours per week under reforms to the control of entry system introduced from April 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.542W.8/4">Tables will be placed in the Library showing the number of community pharmacies in England receiving payment for additional agreed hours as at <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March 2006</phrase> by primary care trust (PCT) area.</p>
	<p pid="b.542W.8/5">These tables update information at national level contained in table 12 of the statistical bulletin &quot;General Pharmaceutical Services in England and Wales 1996-97 to 2005-06&quot;, first published by the Information Centre in November 2006. These data are compiled from annual returns from primary care trusts and have not previously been published by PCT.</p>
	<p pid="b.542W.8/6">In compiling these data, it is apparent that PCTs have interpreted the information requirements differently. Some PCTs stated the total number of community pharmacies providing both types of additional agreed hours services, while other PCTs stated the number of community pharmacies providing any such additional service. Caution should therefore be exercised in comparing individual PCT data. This consistency issue refers only to the final column in each of the tables being placed in the Library. However, this does not affect the information set out in table 12 of the statistical bulletin relating to the numbers of pharmacies receiving payment for agreed additional hours which is considered to be accurate.</p>
	<p pid="b.542W.8/7">Information requested on additional agreed hours each PCT has agreed with community pharmacies is not held centrally.</p>

Where providers attract patients through choice and other primary care-generated referrals, primary care trusts (PCTs) are expected to meet these commitments. If provider activity exceeds the planned levels by more than an agreed margin, PCTs should work with practices and service providers to take appropriate action to ensure services are provided within current waiting time standards, having full regard to clinical priorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.555W.8/1">No, the choice of scan initiative is not a target.</p>
	<p pid="b.555W.8/2">The national health service is working to the December 2008 referral-to-treatment target of 18 weeks. Intermediate stage-of-treatment milestones have been set such that diagnostic waits should be less than: -</p>
	<p pid="b.555W.8/3" class="indent">26 weeks by March 2006 for MRI and CT scans;</p>
	<p pid="b.555W.8/4" class="indent">13 weeks by March 2007 for all diagnostic tests; and</p>
	<p pid="b.555W.8/5" class="indent">six weeks by March 2008 for all diagnostic tests.</p>
	<p pid="b.555W.8/6">The choice of scan initiative is designed to support delivery of these milestones by offering patients who do not have an appointment scheduled within a maximum time the choice of a scan at another provider within the maximum time. Phase 1: 26 weeks&mdash;applied to MRI and CT tests from November 2005. Phase 2: 20 weeks&mdash;has applied to all diagnostic imaging tests (including MRI, CT, ultrasound and DEXA) since April 2006. Phase 3: 13 weeks&mdash;will apply to all diagnostic imaging tests from April 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.555W.8/7">The Department collects no specific data on choice of scan but the new national diagnostics data collection which started in January 2006, and associated census collections, show how waiting times for diagnostic tests are falling for example:</p>
	<p pid="b.555W.8/8" class="indent">the number of waits of over 13 weeks for diagnostic imaging tests were 36,000 in September 2006 down from 68,000 in January 2006; and</p>
	<p pid="b.555W.8/9" class="indent">the number of waits of over 26 weeks for diagnostic imaging tests were 4,900 in September 2006 down from 16,700 in January 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.570W.2/1">Reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are collected by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and Commission for Human Medicines (CHM) through the spontaneous reporting scheme, the Yellow Card scheme. Approximately 19,000 reports of suspected ADRs are sent to the MHRA/CHM through this scheme each year. It is not possible to estimate from the Yellow Card scheme the number of people who suffer adverse drug reactions with a fatal outcome since the scheme is associated with an unknown level of under-reporting.</p>
	<p pid="b.570W.2/2">Table 1 shows the total number of suspected adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports received via the Yellow Card scheme in the United Kingdom in each of the past seven years, and the number associated with a fatal outcome.</p>

	<p pid="b.570W.2/16">It is important to note that a report of an adverse drug reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease being treated.</p>
	<p pid="b.570W.2/17">A study funded by the MHRA and published in the British Medical Journal on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-02">2 July 2004</phrase>, was conducted in two large hospitals in Merseyside in order to ascertain the current burden of ADRs in the NHS. The study found that of 18,820 patients aged over 16 years admitted to hospital over a six month period, there were 1225 admissions judged to be related to an ADR, giving a prevalence of 6.5 per cent. Of these 1225, the ADR was judged to lead directly to the admission in 80 per cent, of cases. Adverse drug reactions were considered responsible for the death of 0.15 per cent, of all the patients admitted.</p>
