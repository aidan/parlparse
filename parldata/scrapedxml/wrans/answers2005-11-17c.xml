	<p pid="c.1368W.5/1">The Government considers that where there is a need for wildlife management then the proper use of snares is one of a range of control methods. Used according to best practice, snares can be an effective and practical means of wildlife management and are needed where other forms of pest control are ineffective or impractical. In these circumstances snares restrain rather than kill and may prove to be more humane than other methods. If snares were to be banned entirely it may encourage the use of more dangerous and illegal alternatives such as poisons.</p>
	<p pid="c.1368W.5/2">The Government is also committed to working to improve the legal use of snares. Following an informal consultation on snares and traps and their use carried out in 2003 Defra convened an independent snares working group chaired by the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare. The working group was given a remit of producing a good practice guide and advising Defra on next steps on improving the use of snares. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-18">18 October</phrase> we published the working group's report together with the Defra Snares Action Plan and the Defra Code of Good Practice on the use of Snares in Fox and Rabbit Control in England.

	<p pid="c.1369W.2/2">The most recent assessment of the economic value of beekeeping in England was undertaken by ADAS Consulting Ltd in 2001. The report can be found on the bee health pages of the Defra website at <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/hort/bees/econ-eval.htm">www.defra.gov.uk/hort/bees/econ-eval.htm</a>. It estimated the value of pollination by bees of commercial crops at around &pound;118 million p.a., with agricultural crops (oilseed rape) accounting for &pound;11 million and horticulture (beans, top and soft fruit) for &pound;107 million of this total respectively. The researchers excluded protected cropping, such as glasshouse-grown tomatoes, as honey bees are rarely used for pollination of these crops.</p>

	<p pid="c.1375W.2/1">It is estimated that 736 million litres of mineral water were consumed in the UK in the 12 month period starting in April 2003. This estimate is based upon records of consumer purchases from the Expenditure and Food Survey.</p>
	<p pid="c.1375W.2/2">DEFRA does not collect statistics which distinguish between sparkling and still waters or the way water is packaged. However, figures published by Mintel in its Bottled Water Report of June 2003 indicate that 75 per cent. of bottled water in 2003 was still and 25 per cent. sparkling. In addition, 79 per cent. was packaged in plastic bottles, 20 per cent. in glass bottles and 1 per cent. in cans.</p>

	<p pid="c.1376W.3/1">The evidence we have on the incidence of serious offences committed under the Cattle Identification Regulations 1998 (as amended) concerning cattle passports is that it is low.</p>
	<p pid="c.1376W.3/2">In order to ensure a high level of compliance with the Regulations, 10 per cent. of cattle farms are inspected annually by the Rural Payments Agency. In England, around 6,000 farms and around 960,000 animals are examined for their compliance with tagging, passport, database registration and record-keeping rules. The results show a continuing improvement in compliance with the rules-there were 4 per cent. fewer errors made in 2004&ndash;05 than in the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="c.1376W.3/3">Local Authorities also undertake enforcement activities covering cattle, including unannounced inspections on farms, at livestock markets and during transport (by undertaking spot roadside stops). At slaughterhouses, the Meat Hygiene Service undertake checks on identification of cattle to ensure that only properly identified and traceable cattle enter the human food chain.</p>
	<p pid="c.1376W.3/4">Inspections are carried out on the basis of risk, with higher risk activities being inspected most. When non-compliance with the cattle identification rules is found, appropriate enforcement action is taken. This can range from advice, warning letters and restrictions on movements through to full prosecution resulting in prison sentences or fines. So far in 2005, 19 convictions have been obtained.</p>
	<p pid="c.1376W.3/5">Education is as important as enforcement, and this year the Rural Payments Agency has sent two statements to all registered cattle keepers of their Cattle Tracing System (CTS) database records to encourage them to keep their records accurate and up-to-date. In April 2005, they issued clear and comprehensive guidance to all keepers in their Cattle Keeper's Handbook&quot;. The response to the CTS statements has been encouragingly high, all the more so for being voluntary, and taken together with the improvements shown in inspections, indicates to us that the cattle industry is keen overall to ensure that their animals are fully traceable and that compliance is good.</p>

The majority of these requests have now been processed, and RPA has recently outsourced 85 per cent. of the outstanding mapping requests to a trusted third party.

	<p pid="c.1386W.5/1">The Government and its agencies are providing funding for a number of key projects and activities to maintain the population of water voles. These include:</p>
	<p pid="c.1386W.5/2" class="indent">English Nature, Environment Agency, People's Trust For Endangered Species, and Royal Holloway, University of London have identified 13 sites in England that contain sustainable populations of water voles. These sites have been designated as national key sites and are managed sympathetically for the voles and contribute to a national monitoring scheme for the species. The project partners are also encouraging the sympathetic management of the countryside around these sites to allow the populations to expand.</p>
	<p pid="c.1386W.5/3" class="indent">The Wiltshire Wildlife Trust, English Nature, Environment Agency, and Mammals Trust UK are studying the practicality and cost-effectiveness of mink control at a catchment scale in north Wiltshire. This project has involved a wide range of collaborators and volunteers to control mink and monitor water vole populations in three selected river catchments.</p>
	<p pid="c.1386W.5/4" class="indent">The Environment Agency, English Nature, and Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, University of Oxford are producing an expanded and updated version of the Water Vole Conservation Handbook, which was first published in 1998. The new edition will contain a wealth of new material from case studies and will provide good practice guidance on the management of land where water voles are present.</p>
	<p pid="c.1386W.5/5">It is difficult to estimate the number of water voles with any great degree of accuracy, but the current best estimates are 875,000 in the UK, with 486,000 in England. A more comprehensive national monitoring scheme is currently being planned as part of the Tracking Mammals Partnership.</p>

	<p pid="c.1387W.2/1">The term wildfowl&quot; relates to all species of ducks and geese, and also swans (three species in England in winter). Only certain ducks and geese may be hunted. There are no specific regulations governing the release of native wildfowl into the wild. Only Mallard are released for the purposes of wildfowling. Mallard are native to England and they would not be covered by the provisions of section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 which prohibits releases of species of birds not ordinarily resident in or a visitor to the European territory of any member state.</p>

	<p pid="c.1388W.5/1">Information provided by bus operators shows that 46 per cent. of full-size buses running on local routes are wheelchair accessible. This equates to 21,300 vehicles from a fleet size of 46,300 full size buses. The number of accessible buses is much greater in larger towns and cities, and in the case of London is virtually 100 per cent. PSV Accessibility Regulations require all large buses used on local or scheduled services to be wheelchair accessible by <phrase class="date" code="2017-01-01">1 January 2017</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.1389W.2/3">For example, the Highways Agency operate a large winter maintenance fleet and due to the harsh environment in which they operate have a disproportionately high running cost. Mileage data has not been provided for the salt loaders or for the snow blowers.

	<p pid="c.1395W.6/2">The UK, as lead nation on counter narcotics (CN), remains committed to supporting the Afghan Government in the implementation of their comprehensive 2005 CN Implementation Plan and in updating their National Drug Control Strategy. We continue to work with the Afghan Government and others to increase activity in all areas of their strategy. As well as co-ordinating the activity of international partners, we are providing substantial financial and practical support&mdash;more than &pound;270 million over the next three years. I refer to the reply I gave <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1429" name="Nick Gibb">the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb)</phrase> on the counter narcotics programme in Afghanistan on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-06">6 June 2005</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-06-06.235"><i>Official Report,</i> column 235W</phrase>, which includes support to Nangarhar.</p>
	<p pid="c.1395W.6/3">In August, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) announced provisional cultivation figures for 2004&ndash;05 from their annual poppy survey, which showed that cultivation had dropped by 21 per cent. to 104,000 hectares in Afghanistan. Nangarhar saw the greatest decrease, with opium poppy cultivation dropping by 96 per cent. to 1,093 hectares. Success can be partly attributed to an effective Government of Afghanistan communications campaign in late 2004&ndash;05, which we supported, alongside Governor-led eradication initiatives and a market adjustment to high levels of cultivation in 2004. UNODC are due to publish their final report in the next few weeks, but these figures are unlikely to change.</p>

	<p pid="c.1396W.0/1">DFID relies on statistics compiled by other organisations rather than its own assessment of internally displaced persons in Colombia and those seeking refuge in neighbouring countries. It is difficult to establish totally accurate statistics in each year since 2001.</p>
	<p pid="c.1396W.0/2">According to the Colombian Government, an estimated 1,148,000 people were internally displaced over the period 2000&ndash;03. The Colombian non-government organisation (NGO), Consultancy for Human Rights and Development (CODHES) reports 1,247,000 internally displaced persons over the same period. CODHES reported some 287,500 displacements in 2004, and have reported increasing numbers in the first six months of 2005. According to Government figures, the total number of internally displaced people (IDPs) in Colombia is 1.6 million as of June 2005. Unofficial estimates suggest the actual number could be over 3,400,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.1396W.0/3">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that there are currently 280,000 displaced Colombians in Ecuador (30,000 refugee and asylum seekers), 101,500 in Panama (1,500 refugee and asylum seekers) and 274,000 in Venezuela (4,000 refugee and asylum seekers).</p>

	<p pid="c.1397W.0/1">The World Food Programme's (WFP) early intervention in tsunami-affected countries is considered to have contributed significantly to the improvement of the humanitarian situation. The scale of the disaster posed particular challenges in terms of assessment of food needs. In the early stages of the response, the WFP adopted an appropriately broad approach to food distribution.</p>
	<p pid="c.1397W.0/2">As host to the common logistics services, the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) and United Nations Joint Logistics Service (UNJLC), the WFP also played an important role in underpinning the UN's logistical operation. Early inefficiencies with the UNHAS operation were eventually ironed out, and the UNJLC is considered to have performed adequately in a complex operating environment. On behalf of the Government of Indonesia, other agencies and non-government organisations (NGO)s, the WFP launched an unprecedented non-food logistical operation to deliver 600,000 metric tonnes of reconstruction supplies to Aceh and Nias, being funded from the multi-donor trust fund for Aceh and North Sumatra.</p>
	<p pid="c.1397W.0/3">DFID support to the WFP (including UNHAS and UNJLC) in the tsunami response amounted to &pound;3.5 million in Indonesia and Sri Lanka, with the further contribution of five helicopters and a fuel farm to support operations in Indonesia.</p>
	<p pid="c.1397W.0/4">Following the South Asia earthquake, the World Food Programme deployed to the field quickly and has since been distributing food to the affected population through a variety of channels. Although they face challenges including extensive logistics and access constraints, the WFP's ongoing food distributions, in support of the Government of Pakistan activities in this sector, are an important humanitarian intervention for the affected population.</p>
	<p pid="c.1397W.0/5">The WFP is also host to the common services, the UNHAS and the UN Joint Logistics Centre (UNJLC), and is providing a special operation for common logistics services including portable storage units and common trucking for the International Community.</p>
	<p pid="c.1397W.0/6">To date, DFID has provided financial and in-kind support to the WFP common services operation totalling &pound;3.1 million to date. In addition, the UK Government have deployed three RAF Chinook helicopters in support of the UNHAS operation.</p>

	<p pid="c.1397W.3/1">Good building codes exist in Pakistan. The challenge is how these are carried through into practice. DFID has also funded research into building codes and post-earthquake reconstruction recommendations. DFID incorporates work on building codes and building code implementation within a broader approach to Disaster Risk Reduction, which seeks to reduce the vulnerability and increase the disaster preparedness of poor people and Governments. In Pakistan, DFID is an invited member of the Steering Group helping to advise the Pakistan Government's Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA). This includes encouraging appropriate design for reconstructing public buildings in affected areas and improving the knowledge of building codes for engineers, contractors and planners involved in post-earthquake reconstruction.</p>
	<p pid="c.1397W.3/2">Buildings can only be made earthquake-resistant, not earthquake-proof, even with very significant expenditure. Good implementation consists of appropriate design and construction based on the seismic risk.</p>

	<p pid="c.1400W.0/1">The conflict in Nepal has had very serious consequences for large numbers of children in Nepal, exacerbated by the extreme poverty of many children and their families. Children have been killed, injured or subject to rape and other sexual abuse by both parties to the conflict, and have been forcibly recruited by the Maoists to provide logistical support, including for frontline military operations. There is frequent disruption by the Maoists of schools in many parts of the country, notably through abductions of children and teachers. Widespread poverty and lack of legal employment opportunities in Nepal continues to result in many girls being trafficked to India.</p>
	<p pid="c.1400W.0/2">DFID's knowledge of the impact of the conflict on children draws extensively on reports by groups such as Watchlist on Children and Armed Conflict (to which DFID has provided funding) and human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch.</p>
	<p pid="c.1400W.0/3">DFID is providing &pound;20 million over the period 2004&ndash;09 towards the Government of Nepal's national primary education programme and &pound;50 million over the period 2004&ndash;10 towards its national health programmes, which have specific targets relating to reducing infant and child mortality. Despite the conflict, both these Government programmes provide essential services and have wide reach throughout the country,</p>
	<p pid="c.1400W.0/4">including areas controlled by the Maoists.</p>
	<p pid="c.1400W.0/5">DFID provided &pound;720,000 to Save the Children between 2003 and 2005 for a programme in Nepal for children affected by armed conflict. The programme helped establish protection committees and child protection officers in those districts most impacted by the conflict. It also created information systems to monitor child movements, provided direct support to 10,000 separated and vulnerable children and support for the repair and maintenance of schools and health posts.</p>
	<p pid="c.1400W.0/6">Through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, to which DFID contributes, the British Government are providing &pound;800,000 in the current financial year 2005&ndash;06 to the Nepal Mission of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. This mission aims to curb all human rights abuses in the country including those committed against children.</p>

DFID supports programmes that integrate consideration of environmental issues (including the impact of population growth) within planning for overall development and poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="c.1400W.3/2">For example, DFID has supported an Integrated Lake Management project in Uganda, which recently helped the Government to decentralise natural resource management and empower local communities to co-manage these resources, improving the livelihoods of the poor around these lakes. In Kenya, DFID is helping the National Environmental Management Authority to effectively implement environmental regulations which will help to mitigate negative impact of human development and expansion around the country's lakes.</p>

	<p pid="c.1406W.2/1">The Government believe that the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 on schools, hospitals, and similar venues will be positive. The organisers of private performances at such venues do not require licences under the present licensing framework, and will not do so under the new regime introduced by the 2003 Act. Public entertainment licences are required in respect of performances for which the general public may buy tickets, under both the old and new regimes. The new regime introduces much greater flexibility and accountability in the application processes for public entertainment and other forms of licence.</p>

Favourable weather conditions resulted, however, in an increase in the opium yield per acre from 32 kg in 2004 to 39 kg in 2005.

Others with a lower level of disablement may have received a gratuity award, but we do not have available figures for these. Not all the injuries or medical conditions claimed relate to service in the Gulf but our statistics do not enable us to distinguish the origin of the disablement. Veterans may also qualify for financial assistance through armed forces occupational pension schemes in addition to the normal social security benefits. Information on the numbers of veterans in receipt of benefits under the occupational schemes are not recorded.</p>
	<p pid="c.1417W.8/2">127 1990&ndash;91 Gulf veterans, with addresses in Northern Ireland have attended the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (GVMAP), based at St. Thomas's Hospital, London. GVMAP patients with mental health issues are referred to specialised centres, including those administered by Combat Stress. Approximately 25 per cent. of the 53,462 veterans who deployed to the Gulf in 1990&ndash;91 are still serving and their medical care is the responsibility of the Defence Medical Services. The Department may under the provisions of the War Pension Scheme defray expenses in respect of medical treatment that is not provided free of charge under other United Kingdom legislation. Information is not available on the number of payments made under this provision in Northern Ireland.</p>

In accordance with Health and Safety requirements, offenders on unpaid work projects are regularly required to wear suitable protective clothing and some badging of equipment and protective clothing is currently being introduced.</p>

	<p pid="c.1425W.5/1">There are a number of EU countries where terrorist suspects can be detained, without trial, for four years. In France, for example, a suspect can be detained for up to four years if the crime in question carries a sentence of over 10 years, and this includes many terrorism-related offences. In Germany there is no maximum detention period, although the grounds for detention must be reviewed at least every six months. In Spain there is an initial detention period of up to two years, renewable for a further two if the crime carries a sentence of six or more years and the investigating magistrate fears a risk of absconding.</p>

	<p pid="c.1429W.11/1">A wide range of powers are available to limit disruption caused by juveniles after 9 pm, these include powers given to the police to designate an area where there is persistent antisocial behaviour and a problem with groups causing intimidation. In these areas the police, in agreement with the local authority, have a power to disperse groups where their presence or behaviour has resulted, or is likely to result, in a member of the public being intimidated, alarmed or distressed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1429W.11/2">The groups can then be excluded from a specified area for up to 24 hours antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) can also be used as an effective means of curbing disruptive behaviour in local neighbourhoods. ASBOs contain prohibitions which place restrictions on the behaviour of individuals. These prohibitions may include a curfew which ensures young people are in their homes by a given time.</p>
	<p pid="c.1429W.11/3">In situations where groups of young people are causing disruption, targeting ringleaders with ASBOs may be a useful way of dispersing the group. acceptable behaviour contracts, which are voluntary agreements, may also be used to ensure young people are not causing disruption in their neighbourhoods.</p>

	<p pid="c.1432W.8/2">The Government are committed to a major programme of police reform, to help build safer and stronger communities. This will help to drive performance in every force and includes: building a more responsive, citizen-focused police service with neighbourhood policing at its heart&mdash;reshaping the national policing landscape to ensure effective policing at district, force and national level&mdash;further modernising the police work force.</p>
	<p pid="c.1432W.8/3">This is building on the significant progress that has already been made: overall crime is down by 35 per cent. since 1997 and the chance of being a victim of crime is at a 20-year low&mdash;police numbers are at an all time high. We now have over 141,000 police officers, 71,000 police staff and 6,300 community support officers&mdash;investment in policing has increased by over a quarter since 1997. We have also sought to instil a strong performance culture. This is taking hold delivering real and sustainable improvements. In terms of West Midlands Police's local performance and how this is enhanced, as for any force this is principally a matter for the chief officer team and the police authority. The Home Office has recently published assessments for every force in the country. West Midlands Police received a Good&quot; and Improved&quot; grading in the local policing domain.</p>
	<p pid="c.1432W.8/4">The Government's work with all 43 forces to develop neighbourhood policing, initially within pathfinder areas, will enhance the quality of local policing. In West Midlands, the pathfinder is North Sandwell Operational Command Unit.</p>
	<p pid="c.1432W.8/5">The development of neighbourhood policing within the pathfinder will inform the development of neighbourhood policing across the force. Following the report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of the Constabulary on improving protective services, I have also asked police forces and police authorities to develop options for restructuring forces and to submit their final reports, including their final options, to the Home Office by <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-23">23 December 2005</phrase>. Larger, more strategic forces will support neighbourhood policing as they will have the resilience to prevent the abstraction of neighbourhood policing teams to major incidents.</p>

The key intervention currently being introduced across public and private prisons is the new care-planning system for at-risk prisoners: ACCT (Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork). ACCT aims to improve the quality of care by introducing flexible care understanding at-risk prisoners.</p>

	<p pid="c.1436W.3/1">Information is not available for the full period requested. Data collected prior to <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> is unreliable, and is not directly comparable with the more accurate figures collected since that time. The figures presented in the table show full-time equivalent (FTE) figures at the close of each quarter from <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1436W.3/2">The starters and leavers data in the table does not capture movements/promotions between grades. For example, the vast majority of new probation officers are trainee probation officers who are appointed at the successful completion of their training. Because these trainees are already employed by the National Probation Service (NPS) at the time of their appointment to a probation officer post, this is not recorded as a 'new start' and does not appear in the starters figures.</p>
	<p pid="c.1436W.3/3">This gives the appearance that the number of leavers in the probation officer category continuously exceeds the number of starters. This is not an accurate representation, as probation officer numbers continue to grow in the NPS. The comparison of starters and leavers figures (in order to gauge net growth/loss in staff numbers) is only representative when comparing the overall total figures in each period.</p>

	<p pid="c.1437W.5/1">The available information from the Home Office Court Proceedings database on the number of restraining orders made under section 5 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 up to 2004 is contained in table one.</p>
	<p pid="c.1437W.5/2">The available information from the Department for Constitutional Affairs County Court Statistics Module Database on the estimated number of injunctions granted under section 3 of the Act, 1998 to 2005, is contained in table two. (The number is estimated because there is no specific reference to section three of the Act within the dataset.) It is not possible to identify those orders or injunctions that were intended to prevent contact with a partner or spouse, as information about the purpose of such orders and injunctions is not centrally collected. Both restraining orders made under section 5 of the Act and civil injunctions granted under section three are civil orders.</p>
	<p pid="c.1437W.5/3">Both orders are preventative rather than punitive and are intended to give protection to victims. In determining whether a restraining order is necessary, the criminal court will apply a civil standard of proof. If a civil court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that harassment has taken place or is anticipated, then it may grant an injunction.</p>

That would create 500 posts in South Wales and reduce the number of comparable posts, in London and the South East, by around 620 as well as reducing administration support posts in prison establishments across the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.1439W.2/3">By the end of 2004&ndash;05, a further 320 posts had been created in Sheffield (70 posts) and the regions more widely (250 posts), avoiding post creation in London and the South East in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. During 2005&ndash;06, the Home Office will continue to review scope to relocate posts away from London and the South East in support of the Government's policy following Sir Michael Lyon's review.</p>

He naturally made clear that this should not be on a party political basis. Chief Constables responded to this in a number of different ways ranging from taking no action to setting out their views. The Government believe that it is entirely proper for the Police Service&mdash;who are tasked with protecting our security&mdash;to make the case for new powers which they have sought and which they feel are necessary to protect the nation, as they did over a period of time with this proposal.</p>

A central aim of the dry run is to meet the property industry's needs for assurance that the process will operate effectively in the best interests of consumers. The form of assurance required varies between different parts of the industry, and we are in discussion with a wide range of stakeholders about their assurance requirements and how these can best be met. The outcome of these discussions will determine the final detail of the dry run.</p>
	<p pid="c.1444W.8/2">The first phase of this assurance process is already under way, with an ever growing number of estate agents, conveyancers and others providing home information packs on a voluntary basis. We are monitoring these activities through feedback from pack providers and home buyers and sellers. We envisage that by the second half of 2006 all the components of the statutory home information pack will be available. This will provide the opportunity for systems, processes and procedures to be fully tested and fine-tuned during the period leading up to implementation. This will involve a continuous process of testing and feedback across the whole industry. Feedback from industry and consumers will be monitored and assessed continually and will inform the making of any necessary changes to the process at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="c.1462W.0/1">Every adult in England can access a free, integrated information and advice service comprising the national learndirect&quot; telephone and on-line advice service and local nextstep&quot; information and advice services, with no limit on the number of inquiries or advice sessions. Within the universal offer provided by learndirect&quot; and nextstep&quot;, priority has been given since August 2004 to those adults who do not have a qualification at level 2, since they are more likely to lack the skills foundation for employability and lifelong learning, and are less likely to get a secure, well paid job. Graduates may additionally receive continued career support from their former institutions or from other higher education institutions in their area, although the decision to offer this service, with or without charge, is a matter for individual institutions.</p>
	<p pid="c.1462W.0/2">The White Paper Skills: getting on in business, getting on at work&quot; set out a long-term ambition: that everyone should be able to get help if and when they want it to take stock of where they are in their lives and their careers; to review where they would like to get to; and assess what steps they can take to get there. To help determine how best to achieve this goal we are jointly conducting a review with the Department for Work and Pensions, the DTI, the LSC, Ufi learndirect&quot;, Jobcentre Plus, and the Sector Skills Development Agency which will be concluded by the end of 2006. The review will be informed by extending the learndirect&quot; telephone service on a trial basis from January 2006 to provide more intensive personal guidance. Adults throughout England seeking to progress in their careers; wanting to gain the skills for jobs typically requiring a Level 3 qualification; and returning to work from career breaks, will benefit from the new service.</p>

As this is an operational matter Mark Haysom, the LSC's chief executive has written to the hon. Member with further information. A copy of his reply has been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1465W.2/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom to Mr. Stephen O'Brien, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-17">17 November 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1465W.2/3" class="indent">I write in response to your recent Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills in which you asked what the budget for the branding and advertising programme for the Learning and Skills Council Local Partnership teams will be. I trust the following will answer your question.</p>
	<p pid="c.1465W.2/4" class="indent">The Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) re-organisation is designed to make the organisation smaller, more dynamic, and to improve significantly what it achieves on the ground. This should help ensure consistent standards nationwide in terms of quality and relevance of provision for local communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1465W.2/5" class="indent">One of the LSC's marketing and communication aims is to simplify and align branding, marketing and communications activity through our partners so making it easier for young people, adults and employers to understand the benefits of learning and access relevant opportunities to progress in life, in work and in business&mdash;the local partnership teams are an important link to make this happen but not to specifically procure marketing services.</p>
	<p pid="c.1465W.2/6" class="indent">The 148 local partnership teams the LSC will employ will be responsible for developing strategic relationships with colleges, schools and training providers. From a branding and advertising perspective (defined as a marketing, communications and branding strategy in the LSC), it will be important that these locally based teams work within the agreed national and regional marketing, communications and branding strategy, not to specifically deliver additional services relating to marketing and communications themselves. There will not be a specific allocation (from the LSC's marketing and communications budget) deployed to the local partnership teams.</p>

	<p pid="c.1466W.2/1">A range of independent academic research has shown that there is a link between skills and economic performance and that the UK's relatively poor skills profile contributes to our productivity gap with other countries. Research has also identified a range of benefits from raising qualification levels for the individual, the employer, the economy and society.</p>
	<p pid="c.1466W.2/2">Those adults not qualified to at least level 2 are at a greater disadvantage in the labour market in terms of both their earnings and their employment chances. Individuals' attitudes towards learning and participation in learning improve once they reach level 2.</p>
	<p pid="c.1466W.2/3">The key evidence supporting the focus on raising adults to at least a level 2 is set out in the Government's recent Skills White Papers; Skills: getting on in business, getting on at work&quot; and 21st Century Skills, Realising Our Potential&quot; and the Skills Strategy Progress Report; Skills Strategy&mdash;Technical Supplement on Underlying data and Evidence&quot;, copies of which will be placed in the House Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="c.1466W.8/1">The Skills White Paper, 21st Century Skills: Realising Our Potential&quot;, invited Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) to lead the establishment of Regional Skills Partnerships (RSPs). These bring together the RDA, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) and Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) with other regional partners to plan and co-ordinate the provision of skills and business support that reflects the priorities of the Regional Economic Strategy. Each partner has their own distinctive role. RDAs are responsible for economic development and are the keepers of the Regional Economic Strategy of which skills are a part. Sector Skills Councils provide information on the skills needs of employers, and the Learning and Skills Council uses that information to inform decisions on the supply of training provision. The LSC's recent announcement to strengthen their regional centres will enable them co-ordinate work more effectively with RDAs, Sector Skills Councils and Regional Skills Partnerships.</p>

	<p pid="c.1467W.8/1">The Union Learning Fund is a source of funding to help trade unions boost their capacity as learning organisations and use their influence with employers, employees and learning providers to encourage greater take-up of learning in the workplace. It is not used to provide funding for courses. It enables trade unions and their union learning representatives to provide advice, guidance and support to workers to help them access existing learning opportunities to improve their skill levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.1467W.8/2">Earlier evaluations of the Union Learning Fund (copies of which are in the House of Commons Library) indicate that trade unions have been successful in engaging non-traditional learners including older males, people from minority ethnic groups and shift workers. An estimated 80 per cent. of those helped to access a learning opportunity had qualifications below NVQ level 2 or equivalent.</p>
	<p pid="c.1467W.8/3">A further evaluation of the Union Learning Fund is currently under way to assess the impact of the fund on trade unions, employers and individual learners. It will include a large scale survey of learners which will provide information on the different types and levels of courses that individuals have accessed as a result of support from the Union Learning Fund. The final report is due to be published next summer and a copy will be placed in the House Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="c.1468W.6/1">The Department for Work and Pensions works in collaboration with its PFI Estates Partners, Land Securities Trillium, to install energy efficiency measures across the estate. Examples of projects undertaken are the installation of energy saving devices for white goods and vending machines, improved pipe work insulation and Passive Infrared Detectors for hot-water points. Energy efficiency is also integral to the replacement of equipment at the end of its life cycle, and we are examining the potential for early replacement for obviously inefficient equipment. Improved meter reading systems are also being implemented to provide up to date information to facilitate better energy management. In addition, 60 per cent. of our electricity is now generated from either renewable or Combined Heat and Power sources. Together, these initiatives have reduced the estate's carbon emissions by 30 per cent. over the past seven years.</p>

	<p pid="c.1474W.5/1">The Government's strategy for tackling poverty is set out in Opportunity for All (published by DWP annually) and the Child Poverty Review (July 2004). This Department makes important contributions to the strategy in relation to providing work for those who can and support for those who cannot.</p>
	<p pid="c.1474W.5/2">Since 1997 we have delivered macroeconomic stability, invested in active labour market policies, developed tax and benefit reforms to ensure work pays, and invested in skills. This has helped deliver a more flexible labour market in which as many people as possible have the opportunity to move in to work. We believe that, for most people, work is the best route out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="c.1474W.5/3">The number of people in employment is higher than ever before and the number of people on working age benefits is declining. This is due to our management of the economy and our successful and cost effective labour market policies delivered through Jobcentre Plus and the new deal.</p>
	<p pid="c.1474W.5/4">We have invested, in conjunction with Department for Education and Skills, over &pound;17 billion on early years and child care provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.1474W.5/5">Together with HM Revenues and Customs, who administer tax credits and child benefit, we have significantly increased financial support for children. As a result of the Government's reforms of the tax and benefit system since 1997, by October 2005, in real terms families with children will be on average &pound;1,400 a year better off, while those in the poorest fifth will be on average &pound;3,200 per year better off.</p>
	<p pid="c.1474W.5/6">The Child Support Reforms in March 2003 introduced the Child Maintenance Premium (CMP). This is where parents with care receiving income support or income based jobseeker's allowance can keep up to &pound;10 a week of the maintenance paid for their children, without it affecting their benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.1474W.5/7">The investment in financial support for families combined with continued progress against employment targets, means that the Government are broadly on track to meet the PSA target to reduce child poverty by a quarter by 2004&ndash;5.</p>

	<p pid="c.1478W.5/1">Pension credit has helped to reduce the number of pensioners living in absolute low income, with 1.3 million female pensioners lifted above absolute low income since 1997. Two-thirds of the 3.3 million people benefiting from pension credit are women. Future women pensioners will also benefit from the introduction of state second pension, with 6 million more women building up additional state pension than did under SERPS.</p>
	<p pid="c.1478W.5/2">The introduction of Home Responsibilities Protection in 1978, together with women's increased labour market activity, mean that women are building up better pension records. In 2005, 30 per cent. of women reaching state pension age are entitled to a full basic state pension. Without any policy changes, this will rise to 50 per cent. by 2010 and over 80 per cent. by 2025. By 2025, women and men will have similar basic state pension entitlements. The average entitlement will be over 90 per cent. of a full basic state pension for both men and women.</p>
	<p pid="c.1478W.5/3">Women's increased labour market activity also means that more women are generating their own income, which can be invested in a private pension. Future women pensioners will retire with higher state and private pension incomes in their own right. However, the main driver in the difference between women's and men's retirement incomes is the difference in women's and men's private pension provision.</p>
	<p pid="c.1478W.5/4">The report Women and pensions: The evidence&quot;, published by the Department on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-02">2 November 2005</phrase>, examines the evolution of women's pensions and explores the reasons for the differences between men's and women's pension entitlements. The issue of women's pensions is central to the National Pensions Debate and the report provides a firm basis on which to build consensus on the way forward to achieve fair outcomes for women. The report also raises further questions for consideration alongside the work of the Pensions Commission.</p>

	<p pid="c.1480W.5/1">Since 1997, in the Stoke-on-Trent, North constituency, the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance has fallen by 24 per cent. and long term unemployment by 78 per cent. The New Deal has helped 2,010 people in to work, including 810 in Burslem.</p>
	<p pid="c.1480W.5/2">Jobcentre Plus is an active member of the North Staffordshire Regeneration Zone working groups. The Regeneration Zone arrangement in Staffordshire is one of the delivery mechanisms funded by the regional development agency (RDA), Advantage West Midlands (AWM), through its Regional Economic Strategy. We have contributed to the Zone Implementation Plan (ZIP) on areas such as tackling worklessness, upskilling and work force development.</p>
	<p pid="c.1480W.5/3">A range of projects, instigated by the Regeneration Zone and actively supported by Jobcentre Plus, have been designed to have a positive impact on the economic regeneration of the Burslem area:</p>
	<p pid="c.1480W.5/4" class="indent">Construction College, Burslem: This is due to open soon as a centre of excellence for construction skills. Jobcentre Plus will look to utilise the facilities to train unemployed adults in construction skills to enable them to take advantage of the new jobs arising out of the Housing Market Renewal funding, much of which is in the Burslem area;</p>
	<p pid="c.1480W.5/5" class="indent">CATU project: This is part funded by the Regeneration Zone and supported by Jobcentre Plus. This project is in place to help redundant workers, mainly from the pottery industry, back to work. The project management work closely with Jobcentre Plus to ensure redundant workers receive full support;</p>
	<p pid="c.1480W.5/6" class="indent">Early Entry to Work Based Learning: This is designed to help recently redundant workers to start up in business, supported by Jobcentre Plus and is available to residents in the Burslem area;</p>
	<p pid="c.1480W.5/7" class="indent">Enterprise Centre phase 2 in Burslem: This is a project funded by the Regeneration Zone and supported by Jobcentre Plus to encourage Small and Medium Employer (SME) development in Burslem.</p>
	<p pid="c.1480W.5/8">LAA (Local Area Agreements): Jobcentre Plus is currently working closely with the Regeneration Zone on submitting Growth Initiative proposals around projects to help disadvantaged groups across the city of Stoke on Trent, including Burslem. This will include ideas similar to and based on the Working Neighbourhoods Project operated by Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.1480W.5/9">Neighbourhood Renewal: Jobcentre Plus has also contributed to and worked closely with a number of initiatives across Stoke on Trent that are also active in Burslem and funded by Neighbourhood Renewal monies etc. These include:</p>
	<p pid="c.1480W.5/10" class="indent">LEAP (Learning and Employment Action Plan) project: This is an initiative to support and train workless groups across the city of Stoke on Trent, concentrating in deprived wards such as Burslem, using mentors etc. to help individuals who have been out of work for many years back into the labour market. Jobcentre Plus worked on the design and is giving ongoing support to the project;</p>
	<p pid="c.1480W.5/11" class="indent">STACE (Skills, Training and Community Employment): Jobcentre Plus helped to design and develop this project that looks to help the hardest to help groups, such as clients claiming incapacity benefit, back into work. This project is a project across the city of Stoke on Trent;</p>
	<p pid="c.1480W.5/12" class="indent">Housing Market Renewal in Burslem: Jobcentre Plus is an active member of various construction skills steering groups that have a particular focus on the disadvantaged and are looking to upskill the local work force. This then enables them to take advantage of the growth in construction employment that will arise from Housing Market Renewal. As Burslem is seen as a Heritage Area, the majority of the Regeneration Zone activity relates to capital projects which will improve the area and thus encourage more inward investment that will bring employment to the area.</p>
	<p pid="c.1480W.5/13">Connexions: There is currently an adviser based within Burslem Jobcentre at least one day each week offering help to customers with interview skills and the construction of CVs. Additionally, the Environmental Task Force option is available to New Deal customers. This is primarily placement work carrying out, for example, general repairs to canals, labouring and reclamation work. The provider is called Groundwork.</p>

	<p pid="c.1482W.2/7" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus has put measures in place to address this decline in performance. This includes temporary adjustments to the claim taking process and the movement of resources to improve the rate of initial telephone contact and customer service.</p>

	<p pid="c.1482W.6/1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has not carried out such an assessment. It would be extremely difficult and resource intensive to attempt an assessment of the origin of arms and other equipment used in the commission of human rights abuses.</p>
	<p pid="c.1482W.6/2">In order to minimise the risk that any export might be used for internal repression, we rigorously judge each export licence application against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. Where there was a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression or human rights abuses, the FCO would recommend to the Department of Trade and Industry (as the Licensing Authority) that the application be refused.</p>

And on European security and defence policy/policing missions, our presidency has seen three new missions become operational, including the first in Asia and Aceh.

	<p pid="c.1490W.2/1">Funding for the Instrument for Nuclear Assistance will need to be agreed as part of the overall funding package agreed for the EU's next financial perspective. The UK, along with five other member states (Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden), believes that the Union's priorities can be funded by a budget stabilised at one per cent. of EU Gross National Income (GNI). The instrument will be funded out of the external actions &quot; heading of the EC budget. We would prefer to see no growth under this heading. We will want funding for the instrument for nuclear assistance to be consistent with this, but also to provide sufficient resources to allow the commission to make a significant contribution towards achieving the EU's nuclear non-proliferation objectives, including those related to the Global Partnership.</p>

	<p pid="c.1501W.5/1">The draft Budget provides that, by 2008, total Government spending in NI will exceed &pound;16 billion, a jump of more than 50 per cent. since 1997. Public expenditure in NI is by far the highest figure for any region of the UK and is 29 per cent. higher than the UK average.</p>
	<p pid="c.1501W.5/2">Notwithstanding this, there are many pressures on the Northern Ireland Budget and the roads' programme must compete for funding along with other spending programmes, The draft Priorities and Budget 2006&ndash;08 is presently out for consultation. It allocated additional resources for Health and for Education and this inevitably had some implications for other programmes including roads maintenance. It is expected that the revised Budget will be announced in December 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.1501W.5/3">The Regional Transportation Strategy (2002&ndash;12) identified strategic transportation investment priorities and considered potential funding sources arid affordability of planned initiatives over the 10-year period. It was explained in the RTS that the level of public expenditure funding for the strategy would be determined through the normal budgetary process, which will take account of the needs of other departments and decisions on priorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.1501W.5/4">I should explain that Roads Service's maintenance budgets are not allocated at the outset of the financial year on a district council basis. Therefore, it is not possible to give an initial budget for structural maintenance in each district council area as requested. A breakdown of structural maintenance expenditure by district council is set out as follows for 2003&ndash;04 and 2004&ndash;05. It should be noted that these figures are based on the expenditure in the previous two financial years and that they include the contribution made by the Roads Service in-house contractor.</p>
	<p pid="c.1501W.5/5">The structural maintenance budget for the 2005&ndash;06 year is currently &pound;60.5 million, however a breakdown of this amount at the district council level cannot be provided at this stage.</p>

Among the options being considered is the centralisation of those services where quality and/or cost improvements would result.

This would save approximately 2.5 million tonnes of carbon per year if the equivalent amount of energy were generated from gas. Current assessments suggest that as much as 7 per cent. of electricity could be generated from onshore and offshore wind by 2010.</p>

	<p pid="c.1514W.8/2">The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician, who has been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.1514W.8/3" class="letterfrom">Letter from Karen Dunnell to Mr. David Amess, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-17">17 November 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.1514W.8/4" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions asking how many <i>(a)</i> males and <i>(b)</i> females have been (i) charged and (ii) convicted in England and Wales of offences under section 4 of the Statistics of Trade Act 1947 in each year since 1984 (28271), and if I will make a statement on the operation of the Statistics of Trade Act 1947. (28272).</p>
	<p pid="c.1514W.8/5" class="indent">To address your first question, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) carries out its functions under the provision of the Statistics of Trade Act 1947. Penalties are provided under section 4, that can be imposed by a Magistrates' Court in the event of failure to comply with our legal request. This response relates to summons and convictions relating to surveys conducted by ONS under the 1947 Act, and excludes any other government departments. Our understanding is that we are the main users of the 1947 Act, and to our knowledge few other government departments impose penalties under section 4, Legal action is taken against businesses who fail to comply rather than individuals and so therefore a gender breakdown is not appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.1514W.8/6" class="indent">The attached table shows the figures for the period requested. I have provided the information on the basis of the number in receipt of a summons and those that then go on to be convicted. The difference is those that have been withdrawn due to their willingness to comply. Only those who remain unwilling to comply will be heard in the Magistrates' Court and ultimately convicted.</p>
	<p pid="c.1514W.8/7" class="indent">To address your second question; again, I must make it clear that the policy only relates to ONS' operation of the 1947 Act. ONS has signed up to an 'enforcement concordat' which is regulated by the Cabinet Office. Under this agreement ONS have given an undertaking to 'carry out our duties in a fair, equitable and consistent manner'.</p>
	<p pid="c.1514W.8/8" class="indent">We recognise that most businesses want to comply with the law. We will, therefore take care to help businesses and others meet their legal obligations without unnecessary expense, while taking firm action, including prosecution where appropriate, against those who flout the law.</p>
	<p pid="c.1514W.8/9" class="indent">All businesses are provided with information regarding their statutory obligation to complete ONS questionnaires and they are advised on the consequences of non-compliance. We believe in, prevention being better than the cure and our role in enforcing compliance actively involves working with businesses, especially small and medium sized businesses, to advise on, and assist with compliance. We will discuss general issues, specific compliance failures or problems, with anyone experiencing difficulties, and continue to offer assistance after the receipt of the summons in order to gain compliance and prevent prosecution.</p>

	<p pid="c.1515W.2/1">The two roof programme is a ground breaking change programme to rationalise its central London estate and transform the way we use our workspace. This core element of the DTI's Efficiency Programme offers a new and radical approach to workspace utilisation and will allow the Department to reduce its accommodation by approximately 30 per cent. Starting in 1 Victoria Street, the accommodation is being remodelled as part of a wider change programme to support team based desking in a flexible, open plan working environment on the basis of providing on average eight desks for every 10 people to be accommodated. This has enabled us to increase the capacity of our main HQ building from 1,680 under the original, traditional approach to approximately 2,400 now and to release other buildings on the estate for reuse or disposal. This change programme will now be applied to the rest of our London accommodation.</p>
