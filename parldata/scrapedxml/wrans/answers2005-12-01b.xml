	<p pid="b.649W.15/2">Following a veterinary risk assessment and discussions with stakeholders, a precautionary approach to gatherings which involve the sale of birds was taken as these increase the risk of dissemination of infection and present a high risk. This is because when ownership changes hands, birds will be spread over a wider area in comparison to gatherings where birds are merely exhibited and returned to the premises of origin. Therefore sales from exhibitions, shows, fairs or other gatherings are not allowed. Recording sales would not help to prevent the spread of avian influenza in the event of a disease outbreak.</p>
	<p pid="b.649W.15/3">We are able to licence gatherings if following a veterinary risk assessment, they can be classified as presenting a low risk of transmission of avian influenza.</p>

	<p pid="b.651W.8/1">I understand the Environment Agency has spent &pound;394,000 out of a budget for preparatory work of &pound;444,000. These figures include an allowance for agency internal staff costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.651W.8/2">The preparatory stage should be completed in April 2006 after which the Regional Flood Defence Committee will consider the appropriate way forward for future flood risk management. The agency will then undertake wider consultation on options with the intention of reaching agreement for the future management of the estuary, identifying necessary future works and possible funding routes to implement these.</p>
	<p pid="b.651W.8/3">Existing flood defences are reaching the end of their life and are increasingly ineffective against sea level rise. The Environment Agency spends between &pound;30,000 and &pound;50,000 per annum maintaining the defences in this area and ensuring that the river can adequately discharge into the sea.</p>

	<p pid="b.651W.11/1">I am always keen to see how Government policy and funding can contribute constructively to effective flood risk management in practice. I visited Shrewsbury in 2000 with the Prime Minister and on other occasions. I am interested in the flood risk problems there and in finding solutions to them as far as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.651W.11/2">I understand the Environment Agency recently invested &pound;3.5 million as part of an overall &pound;6 million flood risk management improvement project in Shrewsbury, is considering carefully the case for further investment which is however problematic in some areas, and has explained the position to people affected by flood risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.651W.11/3">The agency has distributed its draft fluvial severn strategy to a broad range of consultees, including Members of Parliament for the affected areas, for comment prior to finalisation in 2006. This considers a number of options for all flood prone areas along the River Severn and, together with the agency's River Severn catchment flood management plan, will provide the agency with a framework for the management of flood risk. Given all avenues either have been or are being explored and the limited scope for further works in the immediate future, I see little point in raising people's hopes by another Ministerial visit at this time.</p>

	<p pid="b.654W.8/1">The UK is taking a range of steps to reduce the amount of illegal timber entering the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.654W.8/2">The European Commission published its Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan in May 2003. This describes a package of measures to tackle illegal logging, including proposals that the EU enters into partnership agreements with timber producing countries to establish a licensing system designed to identify products and license them for export to the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.654W.8/3">The UK is delighted that the proposal for a licensing system received political agreement at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-24">24 October 2005</phrase>, under the UK's Presidency of the European Union. This will be adopted in December 2005. The UK, with other EU partners, is already discussing possible agreements with timber producing countries, including Ghana and Malaysia. It is hoped that these agreements will be finalised soon. This will mean that the amount of illegal timber entering the United Kingdom from these countries will reduce.</p>
	<p pid="b.654W.8/4">The FLEGT Action Plan also proposes that the Commission look at other options to tackle illegal logging, including using Government procurement and introducing legislation to prevent the importation of illegally logged timber at a member state or EU level. Government awaits the European Commission's report, which will allow us to take this work forward, including the options for action at the UK level.</p>

It is disappointing that, for the eleventh year in succession, the European Court of Auditors has been unable to give a positive statement of assurance on the EC Budget for 2004. It is encouraging, however, that there have been noticeable improvements since 2003 with pre-accession expenditure once again being cleared, as it was in 2002, and, for the first time, certain areas of agricultural expenditure also gaining clearance. This has meant that around 35 percent. of EC Budget expenditure was cleared in 2004 compared with only 6 percent. in 2003. The council, led by the UK presidency, has for the first time taken action, agreeing conclusions on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-08">8 November 2005</phrase> that will contribute to bringing about a step change in financial management and control.</p>

	<p pid="b.665W.5/1">There are no plans to allocate dedicated funding for science cities from the science budget. However, existing funding streams for science and innovation can potentially support science cities, including the Higher Education Innovation Fund, worth &pound;100 million per annum, supporting universities' collaboration with business; and the Science Research Infrastructure Fund, which provides capital funding of &pound;500 million per annum to renew university infrastructure. These funding streams already require universities to develop their implementation strategies in light of regional priorities. In addition, the Regional Development Agencies, who lead on the development of science cities, have their own science and innovation funding programmes, from which science cities can be supported. The Government will continue to work with the RDAs to consider how local, regional and national policies can best work together to support science cities.</p>

	<p pid="b.667W.3/2">The UK is working to reduce the importation of illegally logged wood through domestic, EU and international action. This action includes, at the domestic level, implementing a progressive timber procurement policy where central Government seeks to procure timber and timber products that are legal and sustainable. This is having an impact on the wider UK timber market.</p>
	<p pid="b.667W.3/3">At the EU level, the UK was delighted that the EU Forestry Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) dossier received political agreement at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-24">24 October 2005</phrase>, under the UK's presidency of the European Union. This will allow the EU to enter into agreements with developing countries that export timber. These agreements will provide assistance to tackle illegal logging and back this assistance with a licensing scheme where the EU commits to only import timber licensed as being legal from those countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.667W.3/4">At the international level, the UK, with other EU partners, is in discussion with a range of timber producing countries, including the Russian Federation, Ghana and Malaysia about action they could take to tackle illegal logging. The UK is also working with other major timber consuming countries. This included getting G8 countries to commit to a range of actions to tackle illegal logging at the G8 Environment and Development ministerial on 17&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-03-18">18 March 2005</phrase>, part of the UK's G8 presidency.</p>

	<p pid="b.667W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="b.667W.6/2">The European Commission published its Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan in May 2003. This describes a package of measures to tackle illegal logging, including proposals that the EU enters into partnership agreements with timber producing countries to establish a licensing system designed to identify products and license them for export to the EU.</p>
	<p pid="b.667W.6/3">The UK is delighted that the proposal for a licensing system received political agreement at the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-24">24 October 2005</phrase>, under the UK's presidency of the European Union. Government believes that as a first step to address illegal logging, it is necessary to build consensus with producing countries and make sure that we do not discriminate against legitimate trade. The EU FLEGT licensing scheme, with its innovative approach of bilateral trade agreements and development assistance for improving forest governance, will achieve this in the first instance.</p>
	<p pid="b.667W.6/4">The FLEGT Action Plan also proposes that the Commission look at other options to tackle illegal logging, including using Government procurement and introducing legislation to prevent the importation of illegally logged timber at a Member State or EU level. Government awaits this European Commission's report, which will allow us to take this work forward, including the options for action at the UK level.</p>

	<p pid="b.670W.15/1">Mr Cunningham's statement as reported in the media was part of a presentation given by him on licensing reform on behalf of the Department to a regional conference, hosted by the British Institute of Innkeeping for its members, at Cheltenham Racecourse on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-29">29 October 2002</phrase>. Mr Cunningham's comments then about the reform of licensing law were an explanation of current Government policy. His comments about &quot;nanny staters&quot; were not a statement of policy. They were a personal observation made in response to a debate within the industry about, in particular, the merits of transferring the control of alcohol licensing from the licensing justices to local authorities. Mr Cunningham made the observation that if the industry allowed such an issue to divide them or to dilute their support for licensing reform, then opponents of reform could be expected to exploit that division. In referring generally to opponents of reform, Mr. Cunningham had used the expression &quot;nanny staters&quot; in his speaking notes which were subsequently handed to representatives of the trade press attending and he subsequently apologised for this use of injudicious language. Mr Cunningham did not refer to any Members of Parliament or any other individuals during the course of the conference.</p>

It emphasises that applications for premises licences should normally be made by businesses with planning consent; should not be a re-run of the planning application; and should not cut across decisions taken by the local authority planning committee or following appeals against decisions taken by that committee. The Guidance also notes that the giving of a temporary event notice does not relieve the premises users from any requirements under planning law for appropriate planning permission where it is required. The enforcement of planning law is a matter for individual local authorities.</p>

However, there are some difficulties arising from an on-going legal action brought against the command by the GSPSA concerning a disputed backdated pay claim; the case is currently subject to action in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.687W.2/1">The UK does not earmark its contributions to multilateral institutions for the purpose of direct budgetary support. However, our general contributions to the European Commission, the World Bank and regional development banks are used, among other things, to finance policy based lending where resources are transferred directly to the developing country's budget. This quick-disbursing assistance is used to support policy reforms and institutional changes, either at the macro-level or in a sector or sub-sector. It helps countries implement their poverty reduction strategies and promote economic growth.</p>

	<p pid="b.687W.5/1">As president of the G8 and the EU, the UK is showing leadership in the global fight against AIDS through a strong commitment to prevention and treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.5/2">Gleneagles secured an important agreement</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.5/3" class="indent">&quot;to develop and implement a package for HIV prevention, treatment and care, with the aim of as close as possible to universal access to treatment for all those who need it by 2010&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.5/4">The universal access commitment was also agreed at the Millennium Summit in September. The UK convened a follow-up meeting, bringing together officials from the G8, developing countries, civil society, together with the Joint United Nations Programme for AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Health Organisation (WHO), the World Bank and UNICEF to start mapping out how to deliver against the commitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.5/5">The UNAIDS have now set up a Global Steering Committee (GSC), co-chaired by the UK and UNAIDS. The GSC will meet for the first time in Washington DC on 9&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2006-01-10">10 January 2006</phrase> and is expected to report to the High level UN General Assembly Special Session in mid 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.5/6">The UK also hosted the third and final Replenishment Conference for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria on 5 and <phrase class="date" code="">6 September</phrase>. The UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, chaired the Conference. My right hon. Friend, Hilary Benn was able to confirm the UK's earlier announcement of a doubling of our support for the Global Fund in 2006 and 2007 to &pound;100 million in each of these two years. The UK's pledge amounted to 10 per cent. of the US$3.7 billion pledged to the Global Fund for the two-year period by international donors, far exceeding our 'fair share'. The amount pledged by 29 donors represents more than half of the Global Fund's total resource needs for the two-year period.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.5/7">The conference included a session on the global architecture within which the Global Fund operates. These discussions built on the 'Three Ones' principles and the UK co-hosted 'Making the Money Work' meeting, which had established a Global Task Team (GTT) to improve AIDS co-ordination among multilateral and international donors. As a result of the GTT, the UK expects fundamental improvements in how the UN and international donors such as the Global Fund work together to support countries develop and lead effective responses to AIDS. To support this work, the UK doubled our contributions to the UNAIDS for the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.687W.5/8">EU Ministers, meeting in London on <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase> under the UK presidency, also confirmed their commitment to increased prevention by issuing a statement on a vision for an AIDS free generation, the first pan-European pledge of its kind. The statement backs efforts to give people around the world better access to condoms and effective information. It advocates a comprehensive and evidenced based approach to HIV prevention including sexual and reproductive health information and services, harm reduction programmes for injecting drug users and reliable access to sexual and reproductive health commodities.</p>

Those displaced are dependent on food aid and other humanitarian assistance. Mortality rates in the camps are high. 63 per cent. of the population in the North live below the poverty line, compared to 38 per cent. in Uganda as a whole. Although the conflict is characterised by low levels of engagement, there is a constant threat of child abduction and people live in fear of their lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.692W.2/2">In our discussions with the Government of Uganda, the UK emphasises the importance of adequate protection for civilians in the North and meeting humanitarian needs. We are providing substantial assistance to help address the humanitarian situation. In 2004&ndash;05 we made available &pound;11 million to improve access to food and essential social services. So far in 2005&ndash;06, we have already committed &pound;3 million to the World Food Programme (WFP) and are currently conducting a further assessment of need with the intention of providing additional resources to WFP and other humanitarian agencies in the next few months. As a result of recent LRA attacks, many humanitarian agencies have been forced to curtail their movement outside major towns. The WFP, however, continues to deliver essential emergency food aid as normal under heavy military escort.</p>

	<p pid="b.698W.8/1">The total hospitality budget for the Northern Ireland Ministers, for 2005&ndash;06, is &pound;17,000. This figure includes alcohol, food and other related costs. The Minister's staff in attendance budget is not included as it forms part of the total staffing budget and we cannot identify the service specifically for Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="b.698W.8/2">The NIO provides for ministerial hospitality where the function is in the direct interests of the Northern Ireland Office. The level of hospitality must be defined, and a broad outline of cost and numbers attending must be provided on all occasions before authorisation. Expenditure should be kept as low as possible, compatible with the occasion and the standing of the guests.</p>

	<p pid="b.699W.0/2">Care should be exercised in contrasting corporation tax rates with those, for example, in the Republic of Ireland. Comparing the headline rate fails to take account of differences in tax allowances. For example, the C.D. Howe Institute estimate the effective corporate tax rate to be 21.7 per cent. in the United Kingdom, compared to 13.7 per cent. for the Republic of Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.699W.0/3">However, in relation to the attraction of foreign direct investment, corporation tax is only one element in the decision-making process. Invest Northern Ireland tailors its marketing efforts towards foreign direct investment projects where Northern Ireland is likely to have the most competitive solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.699W.0/4">If corporation tax is the main deciding factor or driving force behind a project, it becomes considerably more difficult for Northern Ireland to secure such projects.</p>

In addition, prisoners may be required to undergo drugs and alcohol testing before leaving and on return to prison. They may also be required to report during release to the Probation Service, who are fully informed regarding home leave conditions. Prisoners may also be required to attend a &quot;checkpoint&quot; meeting with staff during home leave and keep a diary.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.2/3">Certain prisoners, including life sentence prisoners, may be accompanied on periods of home leave particularly during the early stages. Where they are permitted overnight stays, there will be hostel supervision.</p>
	<p pid="b.703W.2/4">Young offenders are required to meet their Probation Officer during home leave. A member of Opportunity Youth may also call unannounced at the home address to check that conditions of temporary release, such as no alcohol, are being adhered to. Young Offenders not subject to custody probation orders are required to report to a local police station during home leave.</p>

A sessional ticket cost is, therefore, calculated on the basis that pupils will avail of the Translink service both to and from home on each school day.</p>

	<p pid="b.712W.5/1">The Department is taking action in several areas to improve the treatment of all breast cancers, including inflammatory breast cancer.</p>
	<p pid="b.712W.5/2">Five of the newer breast cancer drugs have already been appraised by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) for use in the national health service. It is estimated that around 7,500 women could benefit from these new drugs a year;</p>
	<p pid="b.712W.5/3">A number of other breast cancer drugs are currently being considered by NICE including hormonal therapies which are commonly used for inflammatory breast cancer;</p>
	<p pid="b.712W.5/4">Service guidance to all professionals on breast cancer was published by NICE in August 2002. The document aims to help shape and improve the delivery of healthcare for women with breast cancer;</p>
	<p pid="b.712W.5/5">NICE is also developing guidelines on the clinical management of breast cancer. This will help clinicians give the optimal care and treatment to breast cancer patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.712W.5/6">Cancer is a top Government priority. In the NHS cancer plan, published September 2000, the Department confirmed its commitment to increasing investment in cancer research. The Government's total expenditure on cancer research was estimated to be &pound;190 million in 2000&ndash;01. By 2004&ndash;05, it will be spending an additional &pound;20 million a year on the NHS infrastructure for cancer research.</p>
	<p pid="b.712W.5/7">We are already putting record amounts of new investment into the NHS&mdash;between 2003 and 2008 NHS expenditure in England will increase on average by 7.5 per cent. each year. It is for primary care trusts (PCTs) to decide how best to spend these resources taking into account local circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.712W.5/8">PCTs have many competing priorities but cancer is a national and local priority. Every PCT will have a sizeable number of people in their area who will be diagnosed with the disease, live with the disease and who die from the disease each year. PCTs will need to ensure they allocate sufficient resource to meet their local contribution to tackling cancer care or other areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.713W.2/1">To improve the accuracy of mammography screening we have upgraded the national health service breast screening programme (NHSBSP) by offering two-view mammography, two x-rays of each breast, at all screening rounds. Over 95 per cent. of breast screening units have now implemented two-views, resulting in a 31 per cent. increase in the number of cancers detected annually since April 2001, when roll out began.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.2/2">The quality assurance process ensures that the high quality standards of the NHSBSP are not only maintained, but continue to rise year on year. As part of this continuous improvement to the service, the NHSBSP, with the Department and Cancer Research UK funding, is about to begin a major study looking at the use of computer aided reading of mammograms in addition to a human reader. This study is expected to report in two years time.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.2/3">The Department is also funding, along with the Medical Research Council and Cancer Research UK, the UK Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research randomised controlled trial of the effect on breast cancer mortality of annual mammographic screening of women starting at age 40, the age trial. The main aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of annual mammographic screening of women starting at ages 40 to 41 on mortality from breast cancer, thus giving a definitive answer to the outstanding question of whether population screening below 50 is beneficial or not. As the trial is primarily looking at mortality benefits, full results are not expected before spring 2006.</p>

	<p pid="b.727W.5/2">Information on the amount spent by the national health service on treating conditions for which obesity is a contributory factor is not held centrally. However, the National Audit Office report, &quot;Tackling Obesity in England&quot;, published in 2001, estimated that the direct cost to the NHS of treating obesity and its consequences in 1998 was &pound;480 million. As part of its inquiry into obesity, the Health Select Committee estimated that in 2002 the direct cost to the NHS was between &pound;990 million and &pound;1,225 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.727W.8/1">This issue was debated extensively during the passage of the Human Tissue Act 2004. The Government have looked at the evidence but believes a system of presumed consent to organ donation to be contrary to the fundamental premise of the 2004 Act, which is that consent must be the basis for the donation of human organs after death. Nor do they believe that it would be effective in increasing the number of organs available for transplantation.</p>

	<p pid="b.727W.11/1">Action to improve donation rates includes providing more than &pound;10 million since 2001 to UK Transplant to run hospital-based schemes such as live donor co-ordinators and non-heartbeating schemes, to increase the number of donors; and around &pound;150,000 in section 64 funding each year to a number of charities to promote the organ donor register and to promote organ donation more widely. UK Transplant's recent year-long campaign to mark the 10th anniversary of the organ donor register resulted in one million additional registrations. Currently, almost 13 million people have registered, agreeing to help others after their death.</p>

	<p pid="b.729W.6/6" class="indent">a series of focus groups and interviews are being conducted with a sample of men from the population survey to gather more in-depth information on their views on PSA testing, and to explore how best to assist informed decision-making on this topic.</p>

It was commissioned by the Department and the other United Kingdom health departments to highlight the risks and dangers associated with exposure to sunlight and to offer information and advice. SunSmart's activities include raising public and professional awareness of the dangers of skin cancer and excess sunlight through media briefings, support for health promotion activities, and through the SunSmart website. This year, SunSmart has particularly campaigned on raising awareness of the dangers of skin cancer amongst children and young people and has helped schools in developing their own sun protection policies through school guidelines produced by SunSmart.</p>

These major reforms will bring the regime into line with other sectors of the common agricultural policy which have already been through reform. They will produce significant economic benefits and put the EU in a stronger position ahead of the World Trade Organisation negotiations in Hong Kong in December. The reforms will also benefit producers in some of the world's poorest countries, which have had to compete with dumped EU sugar exports. This will open up new opportunities for them on world and regional markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.733W.0/2">We recognise the negative short-term impacts that the EU reforms will have on some African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) sugar producers with preferential access to the EU market. However, a smaller price cut and longer adjustment period than originally proposed will give the ACP a better opportunity to adjust to the reforms. The EU will also provide transitional assistance to help them improve their efficiency in the sugar sector where feasible or diversify into more profitable sectors.</p>

	<p pid="b.738W.12/1">The UK continues to regard the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and has played an active role over the past five years of the treaty review cycle. We have promoted strengthening of the treaty and have addressed the challenges it faces, by implementing the decisions of past review conferences, and taking forward work in the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers' Group. We played an active role in the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1540 and continue to do so in the 1540 Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.12/2">The UK takes part in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), which contributes to fulfilling the requirement of UNSCR 1540 to take co-operative action to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, their means of delivery and related materials. The UK secured important counter-proliferation amendments to the Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts at Sea.</p>
	<p pid="b.738W.12/3">The UK has been active on specific country issues. Working with the US, the UK was able to convince Libya in December 2003 to abandon its weapons of mass destruction programmes, which led to the uncovering and dismantlement of the international proliferation network run by AQ Khan and his associates. With France and Germany, supported by the office of the EU high representative, we have been working for two years to reach a long term arrangement which will give the international community objective guarantees regarding the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme. While not directly involved in the 6 Party Talks on North Korea's nuclear programme, the UK has regularly expressed its support for the process as the best available means to reach a solution based on negotiation.</p>

	<p pid="b.743W.2/1">A UK national must be resident at an address within an electoral area to be included in the relevant register of electors. Residence is not defined in law but it has been ruled by the courts to entail a considerable degree of permanence. In practice, Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) normally require someone to be resident at an address for four to six months of the year in order for them to be included in the electoral register. Provided the mobile home was permanently sited in a particular location for at least six months of each year and the elector could satisfy the ERO responsible for the electoral area where it was sited that he or she was resident in that mobile home during that period it is likely that the elector would be included in the relevant electoral registers and would therefore be entitled to vote there in any general or local election.</p>

Lancashire is the first force to use the scheme across their police force. The evaluation report from these Early Implementation Areas is due to be published in early 2006 but initial indications suggest that overall use of the scheme is positive. Victim satisfaction with the scheme is reportedly high and practitioners in the areas see benefit in rolling the scheme out more widely.</p>

Delivery of the programme is still in its early stages. The agency is scheduled to be fully operational from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase> subject to legislation. Its purpose is to drive improvements in policing. I have yet to determine the exact staffing levels, but these will be considerably lower than the current functions it will replace.

The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) launched in 2004 new Guidance for the Management of Police Pursuits to help achieve this. There is continuing work to ensure that the correct training is provided, that there are adequate management controls, and that robust risk assessments are in place to ensure that safety is maintained at all times.

	<p pid="b.767W.5/1">The main responsibility for promoting the Quality Mark to schools rests with the Basic Skills Agency's partner local authorities. Most local authorities (LAs) make the link between the Quality Mark and the school improvement agenda and self evaluation requirements. Some LAs use working for the Quality Mark award as part of the exit strategy from a period of additional support provided through the Primary National Strategy Leadership Programme or Intensifying Support Project. Local authorities also advertise the award through their own networks and communications with schools, including head teacher meetings and governor conferences. Many authorities also ensure that all their advisers are aware of the Quality Mark award and can suggest it to schools that they think will benefit when they are on school visits. The Agency publishes termly in &quot;The Times Educational Supplement&quot; the names of the schools who have gained the award and also produces print and website information about the Quality Mark.</p>

Of the &pound;218 million provided to Ufi in 2004/05, &pound;107.2 million went to learndirect centres and &pound;27.8 million went to hubs. Since August 2004, the Department has given the Learning and Skills Council responsibility for funding Ufi's infrastructure and learndirect provision in England. Each year the LSC and Ufi reach agreement on the targets to be achieved, the funding to be paid, the methodology for use of the funds and the values which Ufi will use for the funding it passes to hub operators and learndirect centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.769W.2/2">On governance, in 1999, the Department established a company structure which Ufi then cleared with the Charity Commissioners. This led to the setting up of Ufi Charitable Trust (a company limited by guarantee registered as a charity) and Ufi Ltd. (a trading subsidiary, limited by shares wholly owned by the parent company). The Department and Ufi agreed the hub and centre structure for the delivery of learndirect learning as this was considered the appropriate structure at that time for ensuring that learndirect provision was responsive to local and regional skills need. The hubs and learning centres are a mix of private companies and other organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.771W.5/1">Local authorities already have a range of powers to enable them to intervene when a school is judged by Ofsted to be failing. These include appointing additional governors, appointing an interim executive board and removing the school's delegated budget. We intend to create an addition power to enable local authorities to force a weak school to join a federation with a stronger school. We also intend to strengthen local authorities' existing powers to issue warning notices to schools that are badly under-performing, but which have not yet failed an inspection&mdash;we want local authorities to intervene early to ensure a school's weaknesses are addressed at an earlier stage to prevent formal school failure. If a school failed satisfactorily to comply with the warning notice, the local authority would be able to use the powers of intervention described above.</p>
	<p pid="b.771W.5/2">We are also proposing a new duty on local authorities to consider radical options to secure school improvement at an early stage; and to reconsider action if the school fails to make adequate progress. We have already reduced the numbers of schools in special measures by over half since 1998, and significantly reduced the average time a school spends in special measures. We now need to ensure local authorities take swifter and more decisive action to address school failure so that all children can achieve their full potential.</p>

The level thresholds are published each year on the QCA website. The exact number of marks varies from year to year according to the difficulty of the subject papers. The national curriculum tests have evolved over the years to reflect the curriculum, for example in 1998 mental maths was included in the key stage maths test.</p>

In preparation for the transfer the LSC has appointed in each of its 9 regions and at the national office, dedicated senior postholders with recent experience in the offender learning sector. These Learning and Skills Advisors work closely with the Heads of Learning and Skills employed in every prison in England.</p>

	<p pid="b.778W.14/1">Strengthening the skills of the workforce that delivers public services is central to the Government's public service reforms. This was recognised by the Learning and Skills Council in December 2004 in its Annual Statement of Priorities for 2005&ndash;06. This was reinforced in &quot;Priorities for Success&quot;, issued in October this year, which sets out its funding priorities for the next two years. The detailed rationale behind these funding priorities is a matter for the LSC and Mark Haysom, the Council's chief executive, has written to the hon. Member setting out the detail. A copy of his letter has been placed in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.778W.14/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Mark Haysom to Mr. Stephen O'Brien, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-30">30 November 2005</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.778W.14/3" class="indent">Improving the Skills of Workers Delivering Public Services</p>
	<p pid="b.778W.14/4" class="indent">I am writing in response to your recent Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, asking what criteria were used in making the decision explicitly to include improving the skills of workers delivering public services in the Learning and Skills Council's Priorities for Success; and whether this excludes workers delivering private services.</p>
	<p pid="b.778W.14/5" class="indent">The LSC's Annual Statement of Priorities identifies the key actions to be taken by the LSC in creating a more highly skilled and productive workforce. In 2004, one in five establishments (20%) reported that they employed staff that they considered not fully proficient and over 1.5 million workers are considered to be not fully proficient by their employers, representing 7% cent of the total workforce in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.778W.14/6" class="indent">This continues to be one of the biggest challenges for employers, and the actions within the Annual Statement of Priorities are aimed at addressing these issues in all businesses, whether private, public or voluntary. Our work with the public services sector includes workers employed directly in the sector and employees of private organisations sub contracted to the sector, for example in cleaning and catering.</p>
	<p pid="b.778W.14/7" class="indent">Improving the skills of workers delivering public services is a separate priority within the Annual Statement because the challenges they face are substantial in comparison with other sectors. In addition, the impact of better investment in skills on the improved delivery of services to the public, and of better targeted joint investment from the public purse are correspondingly significant.</p>
	<p pid="b.778W.14/8" class="indent">Our work with the sector on skills needs has identified that whilst the public sector workforce contains more Level 2 and above qualified workers than the private sector, 21% of employees are still without a first full Level 2. Based on 2003/04 Labour Force Survey data, over a million public service workers across a range of sub sectors have therefore not reached the minimum threshold for employability.</p>
	<p pid="b.778W.14/9" class="indent">In addition, a NIACE Skills for Life survey identified that 72% of healthcare staff have numeracy skills below Level 2 and 56% have literacy skills below Level 2. Skills for Life therefore remain a key barrier to upskilling the sector workforce and increasing the number of people with employability skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.778W.14/10" class="indent">Finally the LSC intends to enable the sector to attract and retain apprentices and new entrants in the workforce. The sector is characterised by an aged and aging demographic profile that does not match the profile of the communities that it serves. Currently, however, levels of participation in Apprenticeships are low compared to other sectors, with less than 10% of all Apprentices readily identifiable as working in public services.</p>
	<p pid="b.778W.14/11" class="indent">It is our intention, working across Government, to secure a joint investment plan for meeting skills needs in the sector. We will progress this work in conjunction with our range of activities detailed in the Annual Statement of Priorities that support employers and employees in any business, including the roll out of the National Employer Training Programme (NETP) which will better equip us to meet the skills needs of all employers by offering them real choice and flexibility in the training available to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.778W.14/12" class="indent">I hope that this information is helpful, and demonstrates the LSC's commitment to both targeted action with public services and to our broader work to address the skills needs of employees in all sectors.</p>

	<p pid="b.780W.5/1">The Department for Education and Skills' commitment not to discriminate unfairly on any grounds is set out clearly in our recently revised equality and diversity policy, which recognises that everyone should have an equal opportunity to meet their aspirations, realise their full potential and improve their life chances.</p>
	<p pid="b.780W.5/2">This means that equality and diversity is the responsibility of everyone in the Department and is an ever evolving commitment mainstreamed within the normal course of business. It is therefore not possible to identify the number of Race Equality Impact Assessments (REIAs) which have been undertaken within specified periods as this information is not held centrally and it would involve disproportionate cost to collect.</p>
	<p pid="b.780W.5/3">Under the Race Relations Amendment Act we as a Department are required to publish a triennial Race Equality Scheme and an associated annual action plan. The Race Equality Scheme was published in May 2005 and annex 1 of the publication details a summary of impact assessments.</p>
	<p pid="b.780W.5/4">We continue to be proactive in this area by working with our major programme boards to build a stronger evidence based strategy to address race equality challenges and to ensure that all staff continue to be aware of their responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="b.781W.2/1">The proportion of <i>(a)</i> capital and <i>(b)</i> revenue investment, in schools which have received private sector investment in the last five years, which is accounted for by private sector investment of each type, is set out as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.781W.2/2">Except as noted, virtually all capital investment in schools over the period 2000&ndash;01 to 2005&ndash;06 is estimated to be publicly funded. While no records are kept centrally on local initiatives to generate private sector funding, these are believed to be small scale. Regarding the Academy programme, where the first school opened in 2002, private sector sponsors contribute up to around &pound;2 million towards an average cost of &pound;25 million. Sponsors of Voluntary Aided Schools contribute 10 per cent. towards capital costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.781W.2/3">The proportion of revenue funding from private sources to all maintained schools and academies for the period 2000&ndash;01 to 2005&ndash;06 has been relatively constant. Accordingly, although data collection in its current form only commenced in 2002&ndash;03, and figures have yet to be compiled for the current year, it is most likely that private funding will be less than 3 per cent. throughout this period. This is made up of income provided to the schools from foundation, diocese or other trust funds, business sponsorship, fund-raising activities, and voluntary contributions from parents.</p>

	<p pid="b.781W.5/1">The recently published Schools White Paper recognises the value of school nursing and notes that school nurses can play a critical role in supporting schools to promote good health. School nurses are already active partners in helping schools achieve Healthy School status. We have recently produced a new guide for schools detailing the criteria for Healthy School status. The guide recognises the importance of schools involving professionals from appropriate external agencies such as school nurses to support and improve personal, social and health education (PHSE) delivery. DfES is also supporting with Department of Health, the PSHE certificate for both teachers and school and community nurses.</p>
	<p pid="b.781W.5/2">In addition, officials from my Department have been working closely with the Department of Health on work to increase the capacity of school nurses both in terms of numbers and the development of their child-centred public health role in line with the Choosing Health commitments.

	<p pid="b.784W.0/1">Specialist schools are bound by the School Admissions Code of Practice. Under legislation there is provision for schools with a specialism to select up to 10 per cent. of students by aptitude in the relevant subjects. Modern foreign languages, performing or visual arts (including music), physical education, design and technology and information technology are prescribed subjects for this purpose. The Government informed the Education Select Committee in November 2004 that regulations would be amended to prohibit new selection in design and technology and information technology while allowing schools already using such selection to continue to do so. A consultation on these proposed regulations closed on <phrase class="date" code="">18 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.784W.0/2">We believe relatively few specialists select by aptitude&mdash;our figures suggest that less than 6 per cent. of schools that were specialist in summer 2001 did so.</p>
