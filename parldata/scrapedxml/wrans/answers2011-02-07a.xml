	<p pid="a.8W.2/1">It is not possible to supply information about Prison Service spending on transporting prisoners to hospitals in London, without it being at a disproportionate cost. This is because the cost of transporting prisoners to hospital is not calculated discretely but forms part of wider costs for hospital escorts and bedwatches which are divided between the relevant prison and the relevant primary care trust. These costs consist of both the actual vehicle cost (a taxi, ambulance or prison vehicle) and staffing costs (staffing levels for escorts to hospital are determined based on the risk posed by the prisoner).</p>

	<p pid="a.11W.5/1">The Department makes a regular assessment of participation in sport and active recreation using the Taking Part and Sport England's Active People surveys. The Taking Part survey provides national and regional estimates of sport participation, while Active People provides local level estimates.</p>
	<p pid="a.11W.5/2">The Taking Part survey is a continuous face-to-face survey of adults and children in England. It has been run since 2005 and collects data on many aspects of leisure, culture and sport in England. Findings from the 2009-10 survey were published in August 2010. The report includes detailed analysis of sports participation since 2005, participation by individual sport, region, ethnic group, socio-economic group, sex and age. The full report, along with various other outputs from the Taking Part survey can be found on the DCMS website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.11W.5/6">This survey includes participation by individual sport compared with results from the previous two Active People surveys; this provides detail on participation increases and decreases.</p>
	<p pid="a.11W.5/7">Prior to the 2005-06 Active People and Taking Part surveys the Office for National Statistics carried out the General Household Survey questions on sport (in 2002 and 1996).</p>

	<p pid="a.14W.4/1">The Scotland Office has not produced its own study into spoilt ballot papers at Scottish elections as any such study is the responsibility of the Electoral Commission. The Electoral Commission normally produces a report after each set of elections and these reports may include information on spoilt ballot papers. Following the May 2007 elections, the Electoral Commission commissioned Ron Gould to carry out an independent external review of those elections. The Gould report, 'Scottish Elections 2007: The independent review of the Scottish Parliamentary and local government elections <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-03">3 May 2007</phrase>', did include an analysis of spoilt ballot at the May 2007 elections.

It is clear that sanctions are having an impact. Iran is finding it increasingly difficult to acquire access to goods of proliferation concern and is also finding it hard to access international finance, restricting its ability to fund its nuclear programme. We believe these sanctions and other pressures brought Iran back into talks with the EU 3+3 but its disappointing failure to engage on the substance of international concerns mean that pressure will now need to increase.</p>

	<p pid="a.23W.0/1">Although we no longer assess that there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza we have long been clear that the status quo is a tragedy, unsustainable and counterproductive. It hurts the people of Gaza, holds their future hostage, and undermines work to drive reconstruction, development and economic empowerment. At the same time the blockade empowers Hamas through the tunnel economy and damages Israel's long-term security through its corrosive impact on a generation of young Palestinians.</p>
	<p pid="a.23W.0/2">While we welcomed an increase in the quantity and variety of goods entering Gaza more needs to be done to speed up the approvals process for dual-use items so that UN reconstruction projects can get underway. Israel's announcement on exports was also welcome. It is now important that we see real progress on the ground. We will be working with Israel to help it achieve its stated aim of reaching pre-2007 levels of exports this year.</p>

We have received no credible reports that al-Qaeda is operating in Gaza, though clearly there are other extremist groups present in Gaza in addition to Hamas, including those involved in rocket attacks against Israel. We have underlined the need for all groups, including Hamas, to end rocket attacks on Israel.</p>

	<p pid="a.28W.6/1">The United Kingdom Border Agency employed 8,115 frontline officers in 2009-10. As of December 2010, the staffing figures for 2010-11 show that we employ 7,954 frontline officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.28W.6/2">All frontline UK Border Agency staff are deployed to tackle a range of risks at the border and most work on a multi functional basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.28W.6/3">Deployment decisions are based on an assessment of the risk. Officers are also supported in their anti-smuggling activities, including those for products of animal origin (POAO), by detector dogs and x-ray technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.28W.6/4">The agency works closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to ensure that our POAO border targeting is responsive to the changing threats that our borders may face.</p>

	<p pid="a.29W.0/1">The Secretary of State for the Home Department reports to Parliament on the exercise of her powers under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 on a quarterly basis, and additionally on an ad hoc basis if required. The most recent report, published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-16">16 December 2010</phrase>, sets out that at <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-10">10 December 2010</phrase>, the most recent date covered by the report, there were eight control orders in force, all of which were in respect of British citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.0/2">48 individuals have ever been subject to a control order; 20 British nationals and 28 foreign nationals. 10 of the foreign nationals were subject to a control order only until the necessary arrangements were in place to begin deportation proceedings, nine of these 10 had previously been subject to immigration detention under Part 4 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.0/3">No derogating control order has ever been applied for or made.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.0/4">All of the individuals currently subject to a control order, and most of those who have ever been subject to a control order, are also subject to a court-imposed anonymity order. This prevents the publication of information that would identify, or would tend to identify, an individual as being subject to a control order. I am therefore not able to confirm how many of the 28 foreign nationals were returned to their country of origin subsequent to their control order being made. Nor can we confirm the number of individuals of each nationality other than British.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.0/5">Section 3(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 provides that (other than in cases of urgency) the Secretary of State must make an application to the High Court for permission to make a non-derogating control order, which the court may give:</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.0/6" class="indent">'unless it determines that the decision (of the Home Secretary that there are grounds to make that order) is obviously flawed'.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.0/7">I have taken 'applications' and 'requests' for a control order to refer to such applications to the court. I am not able to confirm how many such applications the Secretary of State has made for permission to make a control order, or how many of these have been granted, as this information has not been collated.</p>
	<p pid="a.29W.0/8">I have taken 'provisional orders' to mean orders that were made for a contingency but not served. The quarterly reports to Parliament confirm the making and revocation, expiry or quashing of control orders, and now routinely note where an order has been made and not served. I refer the right hon.

I am not therefore able to confirm the numbers of contingency control orders that have been made or the dates on which they were made.</p>

	<p pid="a.32W.2/1">Under section 14 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (PTA) my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is required to report to Parliament on a quarterly basis on the exercise of the control order powers during that period. This quarterly update includes the number of appeals lodged under the PTA and the outcome of court judgments in relation to control orders.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/2">Every time a control order is imposed by the Secretary of State, the individual concerned is entitled to an automatic review by the High Court. Section 3(10) of the PTA provides that at such a hearing the court must review (a) the Secretary of State's decision that the requirements for making an order were met and (b) her decision on the imposition of each of the obligations in the order. The individual may request the discontinuance of these proceedings, but otherwise the hearing under section 3(10) of the PTA will proceed. This means that individuals who have been subject to more than one control order may have had more than one court review under section 3(10) of the PTA, and as a result some individuals are included more than once in the following figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/3">11 control orders have been upheld by the Court at the review under section 3(10) of the PTA and 14 have been quashed or revoked. Of the 14 that have been quashed or revoked, four were found to have been properly imposed but no longer necessary at the time of the hearing.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/4">The combined total number of orders upheld, quashed and revoked (25) is lower than the total number of individuals subject to control orders (48 as of <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-10">10 December 2010</phrase>, the last date covered by the most recent written ministerial statement published on control orders) for a number of reasons. These include the fact the figure (25) does not include cases where the section 3(10) hearing has yet to be heard, cases where the controlled individual either discontinued their proceedings or absconded from the control order before the hearing took place or cases where the Secretary of State conceded that she could not make sufficient disclosure to comply with her obligations under article 6 and so revoked the control order.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/5">The judgments of these reviews under section 3(10) of the PTA have frequently been subject to appeal to the higher courts by both the individual subject to the control order and the Secretary of State. The numbers given refer only to the final outcome of a review, so, for example, if a control order was upheld by the High Court but revoked on appeal, it is recorded as having been revoked. Where a High Court decision has been made and that decision is subject to an appeal (which has yet to be heard), the decision of the High Court is reflected in the figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/6">The figures recorded above also exclude those cases where the original decision has been overturned and the case has been remitted to the High Court to be heard again and this hearing has yet to take place. The Secretary of State has revoked a small number of historical control orders rather than make damaging disclosure required under article 6 (right to a fair trial), and these have not been included as having been upheld or rejected by the courts because the reviews were not completed. (The figures also exclude interim procedural hearings that have taken place, such as case management and disclosure hearings-at which no substantive decision on the control order was made).</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/7">Section 10 of the PTA makes provision for an individual to appeal against (a) the renewal of a control order, (b) a modification to an obligation in a control order made without the individual's consent, (c) the decision to refuse an individual's request for the modification of an obligation and (d) the decision to refuse an individual's request for the revocation of a control order.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/8">As reported in the quarterly written ministerial statements, 77 appeals have been lodged under section 10 of the PTA since it came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-11">11 March 2005</phrase>. Some individuals have submitted more than one appeal under section 10 which means that the total number of appeals lodged does not match the total number of individuals who have ever been subject to a control order (48). These appeals were in many cases heard at the same time as the review under section 3(10) of the PTA and the outcome recorded in a single judgment; in other cases several section 10 appeals have been heard together where they have related to the same individual. For this reason, it is not possible to provide separate figures for the outcome of each section 10 appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/9">As set out above, the PTA makes provision for the automatic review of a control order by the High Court, and for appeals against various control order decisions. Exceptionally, two individuals made applications for judicial review against modifications to their control order (rather than pursuing an appeal under section 10 of the PTA). Both were refused permission to bring a Judicial Review.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/10">UKHL 28, an individual subject to a control order must be given sufficient information about the allegations against him for him to give effective instructions to the special advocate.</p>
	<p pid="a.32W.2/11">The Home Office does not hold figures for the number of hearings relating to control orders that were held in (a) open and (b) closed as movement from open into closed and back again is often fluid and can depend on issues that arise during the course of a hearing, or even a single session.</p>

	<p pid="a.34W.2/1">The obligations a person subject to a control order is required to adhere to can change throughout the life of the control order and are tailored to the circumstances of the individual case at the time they are in place. In order to protect individuals' court-imposed anonymity and for reasons of national security we cannot provide full details of obligations in each case. I refer the right hon. Member to Lord Carlile of Berriew's annual reports on the operation of the control order powers dated:</p>

	<p pid="a.34W.2/7">These reports, copies of which can be found in the House Library, contain a significant amount of anonymised information about the obligations to which controlled individuals have been subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.2/8">Further information on obligations in individual cases may be found in open court judgments in respect of the cases. Most open judgments can be found on:</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.2/9" class="indent"><a href="http://www.bailii.org">www.bailii.org</a></p>
	<p pid="a.34W.2/10">Of the 48 individuals ever made subject to a control order, 43 have been subject to a curfew for some or all of the time their order was in force. The longest curfews ever imposed were 18 hours per day; these were put in place before the courts judged in 2006 and 2007 that curfews of this length amounted to a deprivation of liberty. The longest curfew that can currently be imposed under a non-derogating control order is 16 hours per day. Where curfews have been imposed, not all of them have been or are of that length. The curfew imposed in any case depends on the particular risk posed by the individual concerned. Some individuals have had curfews of only two or three hours per day imposed. Most curfews have been or are between these two extremes.</p>

Since clarifying the number of those who have subsequently been charged would-together with information already in the public domain about individuals who have been charged with such offences-tend to breach the court-imposed anonymity order, it is not possible to provide this information.</p>

	<p pid="a.36W.8/1">As made clear in the 'Policing in the 21st Century: Reconnecting Police and the People' consultation document, the Secretary of State for the Home Department has made accountability and transparency key considerations in determining the future role of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).</p>
	<p pid="a.36W.8/2">ACPO itself recognises that it is has to improve these areas, which includes it being more open about its activities and how it is using the public money it receives in the most efficient way possible. This is vitally important for ACPO as its role evolves in relation to providing the professional leadership of the police service. To that end the Government are working constructively with ACPO to agree the most appropriate structure for it to succeed.</p>

	<p pid="a.36W.11/1">Immigration Act powers of detention are not time limited. However, detention must be kept to the minimum period reasonably necessary for the purpose for which it was authorised and must not be unduly prolonged. The length of those periods will vary between individual cases depending on their particular circumstances. Where a person seeks to frustrate their removal from the UK their detention may be prolonged as a consequence; the courts have upheld this position.</p>

A copy has been placed in the House Library and is available on the Home Office website. The review found that pre-charge police bail was unlikely to be a substitute for extended pre-charge detention. While the review considered that there could be merit in granting bail to terrorist suspects before charge, there would be risks for public safety in releasing terrorist suspects when the nature and extent of their involvement in terrorism was still being investigated. We are not, therefore, intending to enable bail to be granted to terrorist suspects before charge.</p>

While donors have increased aid for trade support substantially over the last five years, what is needed now is a stronger focus on achieving results on the ground. The Government's trade policy unit will be supporting WTO and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to prepare for the Global Aid for Trade Review in July 2011.

The latest data on performance, to the end of November, are publicly available on the data.gov.uk website:</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/3" class="indent"><a href="http://data.gov.uk/departmental-performance-co2-emissions-reduction-date">http://data.gov.uk/departmental-performance-co2-emissions-reduction-date</a></p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/4">Performance data are reported monthly, within four weeks of the month end. The next data release (to the end of December 2010) will be available by the end of January 2011, and similarly published on the data.gov.uk website.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/5">Details on the reduction projects the Department for Transport is implementing or considering for implementation is also available on the data.gov.uk website:</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/6" class="indent"><a href="http://data.gov.uk/departmental-performance-co2-emissions-reduction-date">http://data.gov.uk/departmental-performance-co2-emissions-reduction-date</a></p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/7">This work programme will lead to reductions in our emissions from electricity, gas and fuel oil used on our office estate over the target period.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.8/8">In addition to those initiatives listed the Department is looking at ways of maximising the shutdown of its offices over the upcoming bank holiday weekends. This follows a similar exercise undertaken over the Christmas period which resulted in a saving of 31% (43 tonnes of CO2) over a similar period in December in the Department's offices at Marsham street. We also continue to work with our facilities management providers to identify any further opportunities to make carbon savings within the target window. It is also our intention to use Climate Week to trial different ways of controlling the heating and cooling of our main buildings, to demonstrate what savings can be made if we change the way buildings are operated. Any additional initiatives will concentrate primarily on behavioural change due to the close proximity of the target end date.</p>

Latest figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) show that almost two thirds of the student population are mature students. This Government are introducing reforms to the system of higher education (HE) funding aimed at producing a more sustainable environment to support access for those who can most benefit from all ages and backgrounds. We will provide up-front funding for tuition costs to those eligible first-time undergraduates who can secure a university place-both young people and mature students. For the first time, we are making loans available to eligible part-time students, living in England. Our National Scholarship Programme will be open to disadvantaged students with potential, irrespective of age.</p>

	<p pid="a.78W.2/1">All analysis presented to date includes the 20% council tax benefit taper when looking at marginal deduction rates in the current tax and benefit system. It also includes council tax support within the universal credit and is subject to the single overall taper of 65% when calculating marginal deduction rates under universal credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.78W.2/2">The Government's announcement that they would give local authorities more say on the administration of council tax benefit will have implications for universal credit. As stated in the recent White Paper, &quot;Universal Credit: Welfare That Works&quot;, the Government will work closely with local government and the devolved Administrations to develop the details of the proposal and to ensure that this reform does not undermine the positive impact of universal credit on work incentives.</p>

	<p pid="a.80W.2/1">Employment and support allowance (ESA) was introduced in October 2008. Eligibility for ESA is determined by the Work Capability Assessment (WCA).</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.2/2">Between October 2008 and May 2010 (the latest data available), 3,220 or 46% of people who made an application for ESA in the Fife local authority area were found fit for work at the initial WCA.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.2/3">There have been 890 appeals concluded from people who started their claim for ESA in Fife between October 2008 and November 2009 (the latest data available). These are cases that have been found fit for work at initial WCA, have appealed this decision and had their appeal heard by the Tribunals Service. Of those appeals that have been heard, 390 found in favour of the appellant, meaning their entitlement to ESA was reinstated.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.2/4">Information on the number of appeals that have been initiated but not yet concluded is not available.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.2/5">Due to the time it takes for appeals to be submitted to the Tribunals Service and heard, it is likely there are more appeals that have not yet been heard, so the number of appeals is likely to change as more up to date information becomes available. The data presented above come from benefit claims data held by the Department for Work and Pensions, functional assessment data from Atos Healthcare and appeals data from the Tribunals Service. All figures have been rounded to the nearest 10.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.2/6">The Department regularly publishes official statistics on ESA and the WCA. The latest report was published in January 2011 and can be found on the internet at the following link:</p>

Constituencies used are for the Westminster Parliament of May 2010.  3. Percentage population figures have been calculated using General Register Office for Scotland population estimates as at 2008 for working age claimants, i.e. males aged 16 to 64 and females aged 16 to 59.  4. State pension age: The age at which women reach state pension age will gradually increase from 60 to 65 between April 2010 and April 2020. This will introduce a small increase to the number of working age benefit recipients and a small reduction to the number of pension age recipients. As percentages were required this table has been prepared using males aged 16 to 64 and females aged 16 to 59 and will therefore not match published figures.  5. Statistical group is a hierarchical variable. A person who fits into more than one category will appear only in the top-most one for which they are eligible. For example a claimant of disability living allowance and jobseeker's allowance would appear in &quot;Job seeker&quot;, not in &quot;Disabled&quot;.  6. Lone parents are defined as claimants on income support with child under 16 and no partner. Lone parent obligations were introduced from 24 November 2008 affecting the age of the youngest child.  7. From November 2008 the &quot;incapacity benefits group&quot; includes employment and support allowance (ESA). ESA replaced incapacity benefit and income support paid on the grounds of incapacity for new claims from 27 October 2008. Prior to this the &quot;incapacity benefits group&quot; referred to claimants of incapacity benefit (including credits only) or severe disablement allowance including people claiming IS on the grounds of incapacity.  8. Caseload figures used for AA, CA and DLA include those cases with entitlement but where payment is currently suspended (for example, because of an extended stay in hospital or an overlapping benefit).  9. The key benefits which are currently included in the working-age client group data are: Bereavement benefit Carer's allowance Disability living allowance Incapacity benefit Severe disablement allowance Income support (including pension credit for males aged 60 to 64) Jobseeker's allowance Widow's benefit.  <i> Source:</i>  DWP Information Directorate 100% WPLS.

	<p pid="a.86W.11/2">There are always a number of 'live' appeals in the first tier tribunal-social security and child support (SSCS) progressing through the stages of receipt, decision and promulgation. This total level of work in hand cannot be described as a backlog.</p>
	<p pid="a.86W.11/3">As the volume of SSCS receipts has increased significantly and rapidly beyond original forecasts, the capacity of the Tribunals Service to deal with them has also increased in response; the number of employment support allowance and incapacity benefit cases disposed of in the second quarter of 2010-11 were more than double those cleared in the equivalent period the preceding year.</p>
	<p pid="a.86W.11/4">In September 2010, in respect of employment support allowance and incapacity benefit appeals, capacity increases made within SSCS, meant that around a third of the work in hand was in excess of normal levels. As the Tribunals Service capacity continues to increase, it expects to return to normal levels of work in hand for employment support allowance and incapacity benefit cases by summer 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.87W.2/1">Employment and support allowance (ESA) was introduced in October 2008. A key factor in determining eligibility for ESA is the work capability assessment (WCA). The WCA is carried out by health care professionals employed by Atos Healthcare. A report of the WCA is then sent to Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="a.87W.2/2">Jobcentre Plus decision makers (JCP DMs) have to consider all the available information before making a decision on benefit entitlement. Any additional evidence provided by a customer's GP or consultant is important and is fully considered as part of this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.87W.2/3">The Department therefore holds information on both the recommendation made by Atos Healthcare at assessment and separate information on the JCP DM's final decision. We can determine where the decision differs but not why the decision was changed or whether a case was returned for reconsideration. Where the final JCP DM decision differs to the original Atos recommendation we refer to the decision being a result of &quot;at reconsideration&quot; which may or not involve a return of the case to Atos.</p>
	<p pid="a.87W.2/4">The number of people for whom Atos recommended they be placed in the Work Related Activity Group (WRAG) and the Support Group (SG) and additional people who were placed in the WRAG or SG based on the JCP DM decision is presented in the following table. Please note that the impact of appeals is not included.</p>

As such, a major priority for the Government is to improve the quality of information available to potential students, so that more informed choices on course and university can be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.12/2">Last year the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) commissioned detailed research to identify the key pieces of information which students say they find useful. This has directly informed the development of the proposed Key Information Set (KIS).</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.12/3">The introduction of the KIS is a significant step forward. It will provide a standard set of 17 items of information for each course, to be made available on university websites. However, I see this as just the start of a process to radically increase the quality of information available to students, to present it in much more innovative ways, and to encourage new providers into the student information market.</p>
	<p pid="a.90W.12/4">HEFCE are currently holding a public consultation on the content of the KIS. Final recommendations will be made by the Higher Education Public Information Steering Group in spring 2011, and a further statement will be made in the Higher Education White Paper.</p>

	<p pid="a.92W.3/1">Entry to university is and should be competitive. Universities offer places on the basis of merit. Inevitably, not all applicants will gain a place. Many of these applicants will, however, be successful in subsequent years. A strong demand for places was expected this year so universities will be able to recruit the same number of new students in 2011 as in 2010. In addition, this Government have already expanded the alternatives to university, by providing 50,000 new places on apprenticeships, for which there is rising employer demand. Our reforms will also make part-time university study more accessible.</p>

Demand is being raised among school leavers through road shows, the children's and adults' careers information services, the STEM ambassadors programme, and the development of new qualifications.

	<p pid="a.93W.9/1">Student loans in England are only available to those who meet the relevant residence requirements. The Student Loans Company (SLC) applies the same mechanisms to all borrowers who move overseas after leaving their course.</p>
	<p pid="a.93W.9/2">When borrowers move abroad, whether temporarily or because they live in another country, they must give the SLC information about their location and earnings. SLC will determine whether the borrower should be making repayments and if so, gives them a monthly repayment schedule under the terms of the contract of the loan. The SLC will convert the income into pound sterling and tell the borrower the amount they will need to pay each month in pound sterling.</p>
	<p pid="a.93W.9/3">Where borrowers move overseas and do not notify the SLC, they may be charged penalties which will be added to the outstanding loan amount. They may also have to pay the costs of any trace agents employed by SLC. In some circumstances, they may have to repay the full outstanding amount in a single payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.93W.9/4">Effective collection of student loans across the EU is underpinned by EC regulation 44/2001, which allows the SLC to obtain judgments in UK courts which can be enforced by courts in other EU countries. Borrowers who choose to disregard their obligation will be pursued by SLC and where appropriate, court orders will be sought.</p>

I am keen that the reasons for the high heating oil prices and supply issues this winter are thoroughly investigated by an independent authority. I wrote to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in to ask it to bring forward its competition and consumer study into off-grid energy. I also asked the OFT if the study could explore the longer term consumer issues such as lifetime payback, consumer standards and labelling for alternative energy sources or supplies. Such a study would provide an independent assessment of the off-grid market and establish what further action may be necessary to ensure it works properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.9/3">I welcome the independent assessment of the off-grid market to be made by the OFT, and we look forward to seeing its conclusions in advance of next winter so the lessons from this winter can be learned and any necessary changes made.</p>

Additional policies to be implemented by the Government, such as the Green Deal, support for the world's first commercial scale CCS demonstration, and the roll-out of smart meters and a smart grid will build on this progress. Further information on the actions to take forward these policies can be found in DECC's business plan (published November 2010).</p>

In the short term those staff directly employed by the national health service will be covered by the Government's pay policy for all public sector workers, with a pay freeze proposed for two years from 2011-12 for those earning more than &#163;21,000. In the longer term, the Government believes that pay decisions should be led by health care employers rather than imposed by the Government and that, in the future, all individual employers will have the right to determine pay for their own staff, as is the case now with foundation trusts.</p>

In doing so, they will continue to be informed by relevant independent pay review bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.104W.8/7">Staff employed by independent contractors are subject to local pay and conditions as determined by the contractor. It is a matter for the contractor to determine if a contract is offered in line with model recommendations or a separately negotiated pay agreement is made.</p>

	<p pid="a.107W.8/1">The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition and the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment assessed the effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and other long chain omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) on infant health, specifically on early human growth and cognitive function. They concluded that evidence to support a relationship between intake of infant formula supplemented with DHA and other LC n-3 PUFA and cognitive function and behavioural development in healthy full term infants is unclear. A further research study commissioned by the Food Standards Agency in 2004 also reported similar findings that are consistent with these conclusions. The Department has not specifically assessed the effect of DHA in breast milk on cognitive function and development of healthy infants.</p>

	<p pid="a.112W.11/2">Reflecting the commitments in the vision, the Department has committed to various actions. The Department is planning to issue directions to councils later this year, to strengthen legislation requiring councils to make direct payments in respect of the person securing provision of a relevant service, where the conditions are satisfied, and with the person's consent.

	<p pid="a.121W.2/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles unemployment statistics for local areas from the Annual Population Survey following International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.121W.2/5" class="indent">Table 1 shows the levels and proportions of young people aged 16-24 years who were unemployed and resident in each government office region. Data has been provided for the most recent APS period, July 2009 to June 2010. APS proportions have been calculated using 16-24 economically active population.</p>
	<p pid="a.121W.2/6" class="indent">As with any sample survey, estimates from the APS are subject to a margin of uncertainty.</p>

JSA proportions have been calculated using 16-24 resident population.</p>
