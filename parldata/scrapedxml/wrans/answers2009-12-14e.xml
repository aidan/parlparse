	<p pid="e.637W.2/2">We are challenging the industry and local government to raise part of the money required for each of these stations themselves to help us maximise the impact of the &#163;50 million. At this stage it is not possible to anticipate the proportion of funding that will come from Network Rail, industry and local government either at Stockport or at any of the other priority stations. However, we are expecting third party funding to be a key feature of those schemes that are taken forward. We realise that seeking additional funding in the current economic climate may be difficult, but this is crucial in maximising the benefit of the schemes.</p>

The Government's 'Buy Sustainable: Quick Wins' procurement standards state that HFCs should only be used where other safe, technically feasible, cost-effective and more environmentally acceptable alternatives do not exist. All central Government Departments are required to comply with these procurement standards. Support for delivery and compliance with Quick Wins by central Government Departments is overseen by the Centre of Expertise in Sustainable Procurement in the Office of Government Commerce.</p>
	<p pid="e.651W.6/2">Data are not collected centrally on HFC use or emissions but the Government are currently reviewing the targets for the sustainable operations on the Government estate, and are considering expanding the scope of the climate change targets to include the six key greenhouse gases, including HFCs, in departmental carbon budget allocations for estate and operations from 2012 onwards.</p>

	<p pid="e.652W.2/1">The point at which scrap metal is recycled and ceases to be waste has been set by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in cases C-444/00 (Mayer Parry) and C-457/02 (Niselli). The practical effect of these judgments is that scrap metal does not cease to be waste until it is reprocessed into products such as ingots, sheets or coils of steel. It is not legally feasible for DEFRA to adopt criteria which purport to set the end-of-waste point for scrap metal at a point earlier than that set by the ECJ. However, the European Commission has announced its intention to bring forward EU-wide end-of-waste criteria for ferrous, aluminium and copper scrap metal using the powers available to the Commission under article 6 of the revised Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC). UK officials have participated in the working groups established by the Commission to develop the technical aspects of proposals for ferrous and aluminium scrap.</p>

	<p pid="e.671W.3/2">On the subject of playing fields, I would like to outline current protections. Since 1998, any proposed sale of school playing fields by a local authority has required permission from the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families. Additionally, local authorities are required to consult Sport England where planning applications affect land used as a playing field in the preceding five years. In April this year these protections were strengthened further by reducing the size of land in question from 0.4 hectares to 0.2 hectares.</p>

A sale is only allowed if the playing field in question is genuinely surplus to schools needs and any community groups that may happen to use them. Also, all of the proceeds of sale must be used to improve school sports provision in the first instance. Only when it has been demonstrated that no sports facilities are needed can the proceeds be used for other educational facilities.</p>

	<p pid="e.673W.8/1">Following the Bercow review of services for children and young people with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN), the Government published &quot;Better Communication: An action plan to improve services for children and young people with SLCN&quot;, backed by &#163;12 million investment.</p>
	<p pid="e.673W.8/2">As part of the action plan, the Department of Children, Schools and Families and the Department of Health have chosen 16 local areas to become SLCN commissioning pathfinders. The 16 pilot areas have been chosen to identify good practice in providing support for children with SLCN through the joint working of organisations such as primary care trusts and local authorities. This will be used to develop a national framework to improve the way services are delivered for children across the country.</p>

As communication champion, Jean Gross will raise awareness of the importance of communication, share good practice and lead delivery of a national year.</p>

These grants aim to support delivery and provision of services.</p>

	<p pid="e.676W.11/7">The National Safeguarding Delivery Unit (NSDU) was established in response to the recommendations made in Lord Laming's &quot;The Protection of Children in England: A Progress Report (2009)&quot; to provide a strong, co-ordinated strategic lead across four Departments (DCSF, MOJ, HO and DH). As part of its programme of activity, the unit is taking forward work to help embed good information sharing practice.</p>
	<p pid="e.676W.11/8">The Department has also developed a set of tools to make it easier for practitioners to work together and share information appropriately. These include ContactPoint, which is an online directory that provides a quick way for authorised practitioners to find out who else is working with the same child, the Common Assessment Framework (CAF) to help practitioners assess children and young people's additional needs, develop a common understanding of those needs and how to work together to meet them, and National eCAF, which is currently in development and will be a secure IT system for storing and accessing information captured through the CAF.</p>

Data are therefore available on Ofsted's judgment of how schools are performing in fulfilling that duty and many faith schools are included in those receiving good or outstanding. The judgment relates to the contribution an individual school is making given its local context. Schools are not held accountable for the level of cohesion in a local area which will be influenced by a large number of factors.</p>

	<p pid="e.686W.8/1">A total of &#163;41.2 million over a three-year period has been made available to all local authorities as part of the Every Child a Talker programme. This includes up to &#163;50,000 per year for each local authority (and slightly more for areas where it is more expensive to recruit and retain staff) to employ an early language consultant.</p>
	<p pid="e.686W.8/2">The rest of the funding-the majority-is for staff in early years settings to access training and professional development. There is no local authority spending data yet available for the period covering ECaT since its launch in September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="e.686W.8/3">None of the &#163;41.2 million was allocated to National Strategies. Their role in supporting LAs to implement the ECaT programme is part of their ongoing contract with the Department.</p>
	<p pid="e.686W.8/4">We do not have details of the number of children who have received support through ECaT as the programme is aimed at improving practitioners' understanding of early language development so that they can focus on raising the speaking and listening skills of children in settings where there is the greatest need. Over 3,500 practitioners will receive training and support through the programme.</p>
	<p pid="e.686W.8/5">The programme has been widely welcomed by participating local authorities, who have recruited early language consultants and are working with targeted settings. Because of the age of the children expected to benefit from the programme, we do not expect to see a significant impact on Early Years Foundation Stage Profile results until 2010. However, it is encouraging to see significant improvements in the 2009 results of many of the local authorities involved in the first wave of the programme.</p>

However, in 'Next Steps for Early Learning and Childcare' (January 2009) we committed to ensuring that parents will have the choice to &quot;stretch&quot; the free entitlement over more than 38 weeks, enabling them to take fewer hours per week over more weeks of the year. This will support parents to cover holidays, keep costs constant and help them to budget more consistently. Over 48 weeks, a &quot;stretched&quot; entitlement would equate to just under 12 hours a week.</p>

	<p pid="e.718W.5/2">We would prefer not to detain families with children and would rather that they left the UK voluntarily where the Courts have upheld a decision of the UK Border Agency that they must leave the country. However, where they fail to leave after having been given every opportunity and incentive to do so, the Agency has no other option but to detain them to enforce their departure. We believe that it is in the children's best interests to remain with their parents and they are therefore detained as a family group just a few days before their flight. However, detention is sometimes prolonged because of last minute applications to the Court as an attempt to frustrate their removal.</p>

	<p pid="e.729W.5/2">The Cabinet Office guidance requires that senior civil service objectives should include:</p>
	<p pid="e.729W.5/3" class="indent">Business delivery objectives-that define business outcomes for the specific post, reflecting business priorities and value for money commitments for the year ahead, linked to delivery targets and the Agency's PSAs.</p>

	<p pid="e.729W.5/5" class="indent">Capability objectives-to ensure that individuals, the Department and civil service have the right capability to deliver business outcomes now and in the future, including improvement of people performance management: managing talent, managing attendance and promoting well-being; and addressing poor performance. Capability targets are drawn from unit and Directorate business plans and, if appropriate, the Home Office's PSAs.</p>
	<p pid="e.729W.5/6" class="indent">Personal development objectives-to emphasise the importance of continuous personal development and an individual's growth in competence against the leadership and broader Professional Skills for Government frameworks.

They are:<br/> Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6)<br/> Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br/> Alcoholic liver disease (K70)<br/> Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br/> Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br/> Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br/> Chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced) (K86.0)<br/> Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br/> Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br/> Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br/> Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br/> Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br/> Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br/> Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-specific primary or secondary diagnosis These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-specific diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-specific diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br/> <i> Ungrossed data</i><br/> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br/> <i> Finished admission episodes</i><br/> A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. It should be noted that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> <i> Primary diagnosis</i><br/> The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br/> <i> Secondary diagnosis</i><br/> As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br/> <i> Data quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br/> Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br/> Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br/> <i> Assignment of Episodes to Years</i><br/> Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="e.736W.5/1">From the outset, the development of the autism strategy for adults has been underpinned by the two principles of co-production and inclusivity. The public consultation on the strategy was designed to ensure that people with Autistic Spectrum Condition, their families and carers could identify the barriers to access and their key priorities for change in public services.</p>
	<p pid="e.736W.5/2">The consultation which included regional events, on-line discussion forums and targeted engagement, aimed at hard-to-reach groups, received over 1,000 responses. These responses will set the direction of travel for the Autism Strategy.</p>
	<p pid="e.736W.5/3">The strategy will continue to benefit from the work of its external reference group comprising service users, family carers and the voluntary sector providers as well as professionals who design, develop and provide services.</p>
	<p pid="e.736W.5/4">There will be a further national consultation on the health and social care guidance, mandated by the legislation, which will accompany the strategy and is scheduled for publication in December 2012. We are equally committed to involving service users, carers and the voluntary sector in the production of the guidance.</p>

	<p pid="e.744W.3/2">A formative evaluation of implementation in the first 10 FNP sites is being conducted by Birkbeck college, university of London. This will conclude by 2011 and will include an assessment of costs. A report of findings from the second year was published on the Department for Children, Schools and Families research website in September this year, and this suggested that the cost of FNP per client for those completing the programme is around &#163;4,500 over two and a half years.</p>
	<p pid="e.744W.3/3">The FNP is also being evaluated through a randomised controlled trial, led by the South East Wales Trials Unit at the School of Medicine, Cardiff university. This will test the impact of the FNP compared with other services on pregnancy and birth outcomes, on child health and development and on parental life course; and it will also assess costs, through an economic evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="e.744W.3/4">The FNP programme gives us a real opportunity to transform the life chances of some of our most vulnerable children. It has been shown in the United States to have strong and consistent short and long-term benefits for children and parents. Early learning in England suggests that the FNP can be delivered well by our skilled family nurses, the programme is highly valued by clients, that fathers engage with it well, and that early impacts look promising.</p>
	<p pid="e.744W.3/5">We will be testing FNP in 50 sites across England by January 2010 and over 3,000 clients have enrolled on FNP to date. The Child Health Strategy, published in February 2009, said the Government wished to expand to 70 pilot sites by April 2011. This would allow capacity to deliver FNP to at least 7,000 families. The Child Health Strategy also said that if the research findings are positive we would like to see FNP offered to the most vulnerable first time young mothers across England over the next decade.</p>

			<tr pid="e.749W.8/13"> <td colspan="3"><i> Notes</i>:<br/> 1.<i>  Finished admission episodes</i><br/> A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 2. <i> Cause code</i><br/> A supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. Only the first external cause code which is coded within the episode is counted in hospital episode statistics (HES). The codes used to define knife wound are:<br/> W26-Contact with knife, sword or dagger<br/> X99-Assault by sharp object<br/> This code identifies assault by ANY sharp object and therefore includes but is not limited to assault with a knife.<br/> 3. <i> Hospital Provider</i><br/> A provider code is a unique code that identifies an organisation acting as a health care provider (e.g. NHS trust or primary care trust (PCT)). Hospital providers can also include Treatment Centres (TC). Normally, if data are tabulated by health care provider, the figure for an NHS trust gives the activity of all the sites as one aggregated figure. Some NHS trusts have not registered their TC as a separate site, and it is therefore not possible to identify their activity separately.<br/> The parliamentary question asks for information on the following hospitals<br/> the Royal Sussex Hospital, Brighton;<br/> the Eastbourne District General Hospital, Eastbourne; and<br/> the Princess Royal Hospital.<br/> Data for the individual hospital sites are not available. However:<br/> The Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton and the Princess Royal Hospital, Haywards Heath form part of the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust for which we have provided data.<br/> The Eastbourne District General Hospital, Eastbourne is part of East Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust for which we have provided data.<br/> Due to organisational changes (both splits and mergers) data prior to 2002-03 are not comparable with that for later years at a trust level. For this reason we have not provided these figures as no meaningful time series is available.<br/> 4. <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.<br/> 5. <i> Data quality</i><br/> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br/> <i> Source:</i><br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="e.754W.5/1">Service users have been involved in developing Payment by Results (PbR) for mental health at an early stage. A study by the University of Huddersfield, &quot;Exploring the Impact of a Clinical Decision Support Tool from the Perspective of Service Users &amp; Carers&quot; (available at <a href="http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/5092">http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/5092</a>), used focus groups to identify what service users thought of an early iteration of the mental health currency work. The study highlighted service users desire to be involved in the care planning process that is linked to mental health PbR. We therefore expect, as mental health PbR is implemented, that service users will be very involved in the identification and agreement of local care packages and pathways to meet their own needs as part of care planning. User representatives will also be consulted on key aspects of the further development of the approach to PbR for mental health.</p>

	<p pid="e.763W.2/1">The number of individuals estimated to be self-funders or those with unmet need is taken from the Personal Social Services Research Unit's micro-simulation model for older people. An extra 25 per cent. was added to both the volume and the estimated cost from their model to bring it closer into line with alternative estimates of the numbers of severely disabled older people purchasing private home care. This seemed prudent in view of the inevitable uncertainty about the impact of free care on demand and the consequent risk of under-estimating costs.</p>
	<p pid="e.763W.2/2">Residential care switchers were estimated by using a simple model of the likely flows into and out of a steady state stock of individuals in residential care. It is assumed that not all individuals entering care homes under the current system will either choose or be eligible to receive personal care at home under the new system (i.e. because their needs may be too great). We do not know exactly what proportion of these individuals will choose to receive their care at home rather than enter residential care, but for illustrative purposes we have assumed a figure of 10 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="e.763W.2/3">Informal care switchers were estimated by removing the 'living alone' variable from the logistic regression equation used to predict individuals' level of need for formal care and re-running the model to estimate the additional volume of individuals who would be classified as critical under Fair Access to Care Services if everybody hypothetical lived alone. We do not know what proportion of these individuals would actually have their informal care arrangements withdrawn in order to qualify for free personal care, but for illustrative purposes we have assumed a figure of five per cent.</p>

	<p pid="e.764W.5/1">The supply-side failures referred to in paragraph 5.25 are the under-provision of insurance coverage and higher prices for those who do take out insurance. Insurance companies wishing to offer insurance for personal care will make an assessment of likelihood that people will require such services and offer a product at a price based on the average probability of need.</p>
	<p pid="e.764W.5/2">People who view themselves as being at a low risk of needing personal care will not be attracted by an insurance product at an average price and would only buy one at a low price. Those who see themselves as high risk will see an insurance product offered at a price based on the average probability as good value for money and are likely to purchase it.</p>
	<p pid="e.764W.5/3">As a result, insurance companies are aware that an average priced policy will adversely select high risk customers and so do not offer it. They may offer products at a higher price to reflect the higher risk of customers they do attract. In an extreme case, this could result in complete market collapse as the remaining customers respond to higher prices by deciding not to purchase insurance. In response, insurance companies raise prices further and eventually there are no purchasers left.</p>
	<p pid="e.764W.5/4">In addition, insurance companies and individuals may make a different assessment of the risk of a person needing personal care, owing to their having less information about a person's risk than the individual themselves.</p>
	<p pid="e.764W.5/5">Insurance companies may respond to the problem by attempting to gather information about customers to set individually tailored prices to their products. Gathering information is costly and insurance companies pass this on through higher premiums. This can be compounded if the pool of customers taking insurance becomes smaller as insurance companies have to spread their fixed costs over a small number of people, further raising the price that customers have to pay.</p>

In the absence of firm data on this, we have assumed that the average cost of an assessment is &#163;200 and that 135,000 extra individuals will be assessed per year, giving an overall cost estimate of &#163;27 million per year, as shown in Table 2 of the impact assessment.

	<p pid="e.765W.5/1">Paragraph 5.25 of the impact assessment discusses the lack of a private insurance market for personal care services and the reasons why this may be the case. One of the reasons for this may be that individuals believe that the welfare state acts as a safety net for them and so they do not need to make provision for themselves. The Government have not attempted to quantify this specifically.</p>

	<p pid="e.777W.8/2" class="indent">&quot;Gravely concerned about the situation in Gaza, the Council urges the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1860 and the full respect of international humanitarian law. In this context, the continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive. It has devastated the private sector economy and damaged the natural environment, notably water and other natural resources. The EU again reiterates its calls for an immediate, sustained and unconditional opening of crossings for the flow of humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza. In this context, the Council calls for the full implementation of the Agreement on Movement and Access. While extremists stand to gain from the current situation, the civilian population, half of which are under the age of 18, suffers. Fully recognising Israel's legitimate security needs, the Council continues to call for a complete stop to all violence and arms smuggling into Gaza. The Council calls on those holding the abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit to release him without delay.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="e.781W.0/2">My response to your previous question on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-11">11 November 2009</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-11-11.779"><i> Official Report</i><i> ,</i> columns 779-80W</phrase>, explained how 46 per cent. of completed work capability assessments for employment and support allowance claimants were completed within 13 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="e.781W.0/3">The previous reply also stated that the latest reliable cohort of employment and support allowance claims were for claims starting in April 2009. We use this cohort to estimate Atos-advice timings of the assessment process:</p>
	<p pid="e.781W.0/4" class="indent">There were 8,900 (34 per cent.) completed between three and four months.</p>
	<p pid="e.781W.0/5" class="indent">An additional 3,800 (15 per cent.) were completed between four and five months.</p>
	<p pid="e.781W.0/6" class="indent">An additional 1,300 (5 per cent.) were completed between five and six months.</p>
	<p pid="e.781W.0/7" class="indent">None were completed after six months.</p>
	<p pid="e.781W.0/8" class="indentitalic"> Note:</p>
	<p pid="e.781W.0/9" class="indent">Figures are rounded to the nearest 100 and percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number.</p>
	<p pid="e.781W.0/10">Customers are able to backdate their claims to before they first contacted Jobcentre Plus, for incapacity benefit this was for an average of two weeks, and it is expected that this will be the same for employment and support allowance. Therefore, the figures above show the actual time between when the claim was made and the completed work capability assessment taking place, and not the true time that Jobcentre Plus and Atos have to work on cases which may be shorter.</p>
	<p pid="e.781W.0/11">A more accurate reflection of the amount of cases that pass through the process would be determined by taking into account factors, such as, the time taken to return paperwork, whether their condition can be assessed on paper based evidence alone, whether further medical evidence is required or requested and whether a customer actually attends their initial appointment or it has to be re-scheduled. This information is not currently available but we will continue to undertake analysis of performance as the employment and support allowance regime beds in.</p>

	<p pid="e.782W.2/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions asking what training in autism awareness personal advisers at Jobcentre Plus receive and when her Department plans to extend autism awareness training to all Disability Employment Advisers at Jobcentre Plus. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="e.782W.2/5" class="indent">Personal Advisers at Jobcentre Plus receive training that includes a general awareness of disability and disability issues. Additionally, this provides an understanding of the specialist roles so that staff are aware of the links with Disability Employment Advisers.</p>
	<p pid="e.782W.2/6" class="indent">Jobcentre Plus policy is to develop its advisers in the skills required to manage a range of customers and to respect their individual needs, covering a variety of health conditions. The learning programme for Jobcentre Plus advisers focuses on raising awareness of customers' personal circumstances and the impact this may have on their ability to move into sustainable employment. Advisers are signposted to guide notes which include background information on a number of conditions, including Autistic Spectrum Condition, the implications for interviews and how to use questioning techniques in order to support customers.</p>
	<p pid="e.782W.2/7" class="indent">Disability Employment Advisers, who focus on customers needing more extensive support, receive further levels of skills training appropriate to their customers, including skills practice in interviewing customers with Autistic Spectrum Condition. In addition, advisers including Disability Employment Advisers can seek help from their Work Psychologist colleagues to assist them in supporting customers where appropriate. All Jobcentres have access to Disability Employment Adviser services, either by being located within the Jobcentre or for example in more rural areas access to peripatetic Disability Employment Advisers who provide services across a number of locations.</p>
	<p pid="e.782W.2/8" class="indent">I can advise you that all Disability Employment Advisers currently receive autism awareness as part of the standard training programme that they receive when they take on this role. I can also confirm that autism awareness will continue to be included in training for any future Disability Employment Advisers.</p>

	<p pid="e.787W.6/1">The disability premium applies only to working age benefits, but disabled pensioners can have an additional amount for severe disability taken into account in their claim for pension credit or housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="e.787W.6/2">Premiums are additional amounts which are taken into account in the means test for pension credit and housing benefit, but are not paid directly as a discrete amount. They do not necessarily increase benefit entitlement by the full value of the premium, and the impact will depend on the pensioner's income and other circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="e.787W.6/3">However, it is possible to estimate how much pension credit expenditure is due to the severe disability premium by looking at how much less would be spent if the premium was removed, all other things being equal, and these estimates are provided in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="e.787W.6/4">Housing benefit is more complex, as entitlement is usually dependent on the amount and type of pension credit that is in payment. In particular, the use of the premium in a pension credit award can lead to a larger housing benefit entitlement, without the premium being used in the housing benefit assessment. National Statistics on housing benefit do not currently provide the necessary information needed in order to produce an estimate of the expenditure involved.</p>

	<p pid="e.790W.0/1">At the regional events which took place on Saturdays throughout October in London, Cardiff, Sheffield, Gateshead and Edinburgh invited members of the public received an incentive payment of &#163;75 per person. A total of 457 people attended the regional events. At the reconvened events in November in Gateshead and Birmingham (for which more travelling time was required for most delegates) invited members of the public received an incentive payment of &#163;85 per person. A total of 225 people attended the reconvened events. When carrying out general population research it is usual for research companies to make incentive payments as a means to ensure that the research includes not only active individuals who like to engage in these discussions but also to encourage less engaged individuals to take part. Incentive payments are especially important in the case of events of this nature, as participants will often be expected to travel long distances to attend and will also be expected to reconvene as part of the next stages in the deliberative events process.</p>

	<p pid="e.790W.6/1">A prisoner who makes threats to anyone may be charged under the prison or young offender institution rules with using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour. The charge will be dealt with at an adjudication hearing by a prison governor, or in more serious cases by an independent adjudicator (district judge). If the charge is proved the governor may impose any of the punishments set out in the rules, ranging from a caution, forfeiture of privileges, stoppage of earning, or cellular confinement. An independent adjudicator may impose any of these punishments, plus up to 42 additional days in custody.</p>
	<p pid="e.790W.6/2">The Offender Management Caseload Statistics (OMCS), available on the Ministry of Justice website at:</p>
	<p pid="e.790W.6/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/offender-management-caseload-statistics-2008-2.pdf">www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/offender-management-caseload-statistics-2008-2.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="e.790W.6/4">show that in 2008, 16,048 offences of threatening, abusive, or insulting words or behaviour were punished following guilty findings at adjudications. The OMCS do not show the number of these offences that were directed at prison officers (as opposed to other members of staff, other prisoners, or visitors), nor how many charges were not proven or not proceeded with.</p>
	<p pid="e.790W.6/5">Any threats by prisoners towards prison staff should be recorded on a Security Information Report (SIR). In the period January to August 2009, 15,232 SIRs were submitted an connection with threats to staff and others, but these records do not show how many of these incidents related to threats to prison officers, other staff, or visitors.</p>
	<p pid="e.790W.6/6">Alternatively to, or in addition to the prison disciplinary system, prisoners' behaviour is taken into account when their privilege level under the Incentives and Earned Privileges (IEP) scheme is reviewed. A pattern of bad behaviour, such as making threats, or a particularly serious single incident, is likely to lead to a loss of privileges under the scheme. No figures are available on the number of prisoners whose privilege level has been reduced as a consequence of making threats.</p>

	<p pid="e.791W.2/1">With the exception of some advocates on Very High Cost (Crime) Cases, the Legal Services Commission (LSC) does not directly contract with advocates for the provision of advocacy services in the Crown court. The LSC is currently consulting on changes to the way that it procures advocacy services for high cost criminal cases. Currently there are sufficient advocates of appropriate quality to meet the needs of the Criminal Defence Service.</p>
	<p pid="e.791W.2/2">Solicitor advocates must pass through an appropriate accreditation scheme before they are able to appear in the Crown court. The aim of this is to ensure that they achieve an equivalent level of skills to barristers. It is also the case that solicitor advocates and barristers-whether employed or self-employed-are under a professional obligation only to take on cases for which they are suitably experienced and qualified.</p>
	<p pid="e.791W.2/3">In commissioning defence and other services, the LSC needs to be able to rely on suitable standards and accreditation to provide assurance as to the quality and value for money of the services it is buying. MOJ and the LSC have spent three years working with the professional bodies, the senior judiciary and the Crown Prosecution Service to develop a quality assurance scheme for all advocates as recognition of the significant change in those now permitted to partake in advocacy. In the longer term, the Quality Assurance of Advocates scheme (QAA) which is currently being developed may become a contractual requirement for all advocates wishing to undertake publicly funded advocacy.</p>
	<p pid="e.791W.2/4">Advocates, whether solicitor advocates or barristers, are not involved in advising clients during investigations prior to charge. If a litigator advises his client to remain silent during interview, then that is a matter of professional judgment at that time with no bearing on any decision to instruct an in-house advocate or independent counsel if the client is subsequently charged.</p>

Both are consistent with the Treasury guidance on &quot;Managing Public Money&quot;, at:</p>

	<p pid="e.793W.5/5">The Ministry's policy on in-house hospitality prohibits the supply of any alcohol to Ministry of Justice personnel who are paid from departmental funds. When providing hospitality to external parties, then discretion can be exercised, e.g. a modest amount of wine with a meal, but expenditure should be modest and appropriate to the circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="e.793W.5/6">Expenditure on alcohol and entertainment are not specifically identified within the Ministry's accounting systems as they form part of a wider &quot;entertainment and hospitality&quot; classification. To identify specific amounts relating to alcohol and entertainment would involve examining every individual transaction within this wider category, which would incur disproportionate costs. Expenditure in 2008-09 on this wider category of expenditure was &#163;315,000 for the Ministry and its Executive agencies, excluding the 42 local probation boards and trusts.</p>

	<p pid="e.794W.0/1">The Department's telecoms services are provided through contracts with external service providers. The majority of these services are managed within individual business areas and detailed management information is not collated centrally.</p>
	<p pid="e.794W.0/2">Following de-regulation of the telecoms industry, many Telecommunications Companies offer call packages which have inclusive calls, though in most cases 0800/0845 number are not covered. This means that charges paid by the caller to prefix 08 numbers are set by each phone company individually, with charges varying accordingly, especially when the call originates from a UK mobile or non-UK number.</p>
	<p pid="e.794W.0/3">From the records held centrally, the Department operates 52 0845 numbers and 25 0800 telephone numbers to provide a range of services. There is no record of any 0870 numbers being used for public access to services.</p>
	<p pid="e.794W.0/4">Some prefix 08 numbers could also be considered to be sponsored by the Department, as it pays for some of the cost to the caller. However, the amount would differ depending on the relevant tariffs in a caller's specific call plan.</p>
	<p pid="e.794W.0/5">In 2008-09, call volumes to 18 0845 numbers used by Her Majesty's Courts Service Bulk Payment Centre totalled 789,000.</p>

	<p pid="e.794W.0/7">As part of providing a cost-effective service to its users, the Department considers ways to make service users aware of the possibility that cheaper call options could be available. For instance, Her Majesty's Courts Service Bulk Payment Centre publish alternative exchange numbers for 18 0845 numbers on their web pages. This allows customers to choose which number to call, depending on their call plan. Charges vary, especially when the call originates from a UK mobile or non-UK number.</p>

	<p pid="e.796W.6/1">Applications for civil legal aid help and advice are made to individual providers. Existing data collection arrangements record the number of instances of advice provided, rather than the number of applications made.</p>
	<p pid="e.796W.6/2">Applications for civil legal aid representation are submitted to the Legal Services Commission (LSC). The LSC collects data on the number of civil legal aid representation applications submitted to providers located within (i) Hazel Grove constituency and (ii) each local authority in the north-west and this is broken down for each of the past five financial years (see Table 1). A proportion of these applications will come from individuals resident outside (i) Hazel Grove constituency and (ii) local authority areas in the north-west.</p>
	<p pid="e.796W.6/3">Data on applications for criminal legal aid are not recorded in the same way as applications for civil legal aid representation. Instead, they rely on a separate 'online' application process. This does not allow applications for criminal legal aid to be identified on the basis of postcode information. Therefore, it is not possible to provide details of criminal legal aid applications submitted from residents in the Hazel Grove constituency area, nor from those residents in each local authority area in the north-west.</p>
	<p pid="e.796W.6/4">However, following the introduction of means testing in October 2006, the Legal Services Commission can identify the number of criminal legal aid applications submitted to the neighbouring Stockport magistrates court (see Table 2). These applications will include those submitted from defendants charged with an indictable only offence and facing trial before Manchester Minshull street Crown court. A proportion of these applications will have come from individuals resident in the Hazel Grove constituency area.</p>
	<p pid="e.796W.6/5">Table 2 also provides the total number of applications submitted to all 42 magistrates courts covered by the north-west region of Her Majesty's Courts Service (HMCS). An analysis of these data by individual court would be provided only at disproportionate cost. As with the data for Stockport magistrates court, the applications will include a proportion from individuals who are resident outside the north-west region.</p>

	<p pid="e.803W.2/1">Data are not available centrally on specific numbers of under-18s directed to do training as part of their sentence. Shoplifting is categorised as a separate offence and this and other sentencing data are published by the Ministry of Justice annually:</p>

	<p pid="e.803W.2/3">Young offenders aged under 18 years may be directed to undertake a range of reparative and rehabilitative programmes as part of their sentences. In addition a young offender can be required to attend a specified place of education as part of a sentence for example if given a youth rehabilitation order with an education requirement.</p>
	<p pid="e.803W.2/4">Through the national youth justice indicators the Youth Justice Board require that young offending teams work to encourage the participation of young offenders in education, training or employment by the end of their sentence. This indicator is also part of the local authority national indicator set. Figures for 2007-08 showed that 71.1 per cent. of young offenders were engaged by the end of their sentence.</p>

	<p pid="e.803W.2/15">All young people in youth custody are expected to participate in education and training and this forms a central element of custodial regimes. Custody often provides a unique opportunity to engage young people in learning and for young people to develop their skills. The sentence planning process in custody includes planning education and training in accordance with the young person's needs.</p>

	<p pid="e.810W.2/1">The United Nations (UN) has recently agreed to the creation of two new senior leadership posts on gender in the UN. General Assembly Resolution 63/311 creates a new Under-Secretary General post to head a new UN Gender Entity. Security Council Resolution 1888 creates a post of Special Representative Against Sexual Violence in Conflict at Assistant Secretary-General level. The UK supported the establishment of both of these posts. Appointments will be made by the UN Secretary-General. The UK is committed to the promotion of open, transparent, merit-based appointment processes by the UN, which encourage the best candidates to come forward.</p>
	<p pid="e.810W.2/2">The UK strongly supports the creation of a new UN gender agency, on which there will be further negotiations during the current session of the General Assembly. Our priority is to bring negotiations on the establishment of the entity to a successful and speedy resolution.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-12-14e.300675.r0" oldstyleid="uk.org.publicwhip/wrans/2009-12-14e.813W.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1516" speakername="Bob Ainsworth" colnum="813W"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091214/text/91214w0041.htm#0912153001339">
	<p pid="e.813W.2/1">Significant differences in the terms and conditions of employment for military personnel and their civilian colleagues within the MOD make direct comparisons between the two very difficult. Moreover, it is difficult to predict allowances for the whole of 2010, since they are not subject to an annual increase but rather the result of periodic review.</p>
	<p pid="e.813W.2/2">The maximum monthly allowance for a MOD civilian in Afghanistan is &#163;7,750. The quoted figure is before tax and is based on the most senior individual working in Helmand Province, undertaking a working week in excess of 82 hours. Allowances paid to civil servants reflect the significant additional hours worked above and beyond their contracted working week and the unique conditions experienced in theatre. They vary considerably and are dependent on an individual's grade, location and working week. Should the conditions in theatre remain as they are currently, then the quoted figure will remain unchanged in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="e.813W.2/3">It is harder to be precise about the level of military allowances. Service pay and conditions are completely different to those of their civilian counterparts and the precise sum of the whole package that military personnel receive, including the tax-free operational allowances, will depend on their rank, personal circumstances and experience. The military package, which includes an X-factor for all schooling allowances and housing for the eligible, is designed to take account of the unique nature of military life. Full details of the Service Pay and Allowance Package are available on the Armed Forces Benefits Calculator internet site available at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="e.815W.5/19">ISAF forces operating in Helmand come from a number of different nations, which often operate closely alongside each other and alongside Afghan Army and police units. Without undertaking a detailed assessment of each engagement, it is not possible to define precisely in every case whether an attack was aimed at UK forces, at our ISAF partners, or against Afghan units. Data are therefore collected on the number of incidents involving ISAF forces in Helmand without attempting to identify the nationality of the forces actually being attacked. The environment in which forces are operating makes it extremely difficult to distinguish between incidents initiated by insurgent forces and those initiated by ISAF.</p>

	<p pid="e.820W.2/2">There are over 400 treaties concluded since 1945 of possible relevance to the hon. Member's question. Of these, there are four multilateral treaties which stand out in terms of their importance: the North Atlantic treaty 1949; the treaty on the European Union as amended by the Lisbon Treaty 2007; the treaty of economic, social and cultural collaboration and collective self-defence 1948 as amended by the Paris Agreements of <phrase class="date" code="1954-10-23">23 October 1954</phrase> on the Western European Union; and the Charter of the United Nations 1945. Before the UK were to provide military forces overseas by virtue of relevant provisions in any of these treaties, it would be necessary for a separate decision to be taken by the Government to commit UK armed forces for deployment abroad.</p>

	<p pid="e.820W.8/1">The MOD is currently in the process of modifying the criteria against which it collates management information on the medical fitness of Service personnel. Whereas previously we have measured the medical &quot;fitness for task&quot; of Service personnel, we are now moving to a process of measuring the numbers who are medically &quot;fully deployable&quot;, &quot;limited deployable&quot; and &quot;non-deployable&quot;. This should help us to focus our efforts on maximising the numbers available to deploy on operations.</p>
	<p pid="e.820W.8/2">The single Services and DASA have been working on the collection and validation of figures recorded against the new criteria, using data obtained from the Joint Personnel Administration (JPA) system. The aim is to provide reliable, validated data by spring 2010.</p>
	<p pid="e.820W.8/3">A new Armed Forces Weight Management Policy came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-01">1 October 2009</phrase>, which provides policy for the measurement of body composition and the management of Service personnel who demonstrate increased risk of ill health and inadequate physical fitness owing to their weight. The policy requires each Service to provide annual body composition measurement (BCM) for all personnel, in order to identify an individual's level of health risk and encourage maintenance of a healthy body weight.</p>
	<p pid="e.820W.8/4">Each of the single Services is implementing the policy. The Naval Service Fitness Information Software System (FISS) is currently undergoing user testing and will &quot;go live&quot; during January 2010, with the first full reporting period being completed 12 months later.</p>
	<p pid="e.820W.8/5">The Army FISS began on <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April 2009</phrase>, but roll-out is still in progress and data for a full annual reporting period is not yet available.</p>
	<p pid="e.820W.8/6">The RAF FISS began on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October 2007</phrase>. However, the provision of the data by individuals is voluntary, and prior to the introduction of the revised policy on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-01">1 October 2009</phrase> around half of RAF personnel had chosen not to do so. We are therefore unable to supply comprehensive data until a full annual reporting period completes in October 2010.</p>

However, the individual medical records of members of the armed forces are examined by medical staff prior to deployment and the armed forces use a medical grading system which considers both mental and physical health.

	<p pid="e.844W.3/3" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) compiles unemployment statistics for local areas from the Annual Population Survey (APS) and its predecessor the Annual Labour Force Survey (LFS) following International Labour Organisation (ILO) definitions. Unfortunately the sample size does not support analyses of unemployment of 16-24 year olds for local authorities or parliamentary constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="e.844W.3/4" class="indent">Table 1 shows the number and percentage of 16-24 year olds who were unemployed in each English Government Office Region, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the 12 month period ending February 1998 from the Annual LFS and March 2009 from the APS. As with any sample survey, estimates from the APS are subject to a margin of uncertainty. A guide to the quality of the estimates is given in table 1.</p>
	<p pid="e.844W.3/5" class="indent">ONS compiles the number of claimants of Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) from the Jobcentre Plus administrative system. Table 2 shows the number of computerised claims of Jobseeker's allowance (JSA) for people, aged 16-24 resident in each of the requested geographies in May 1997 and October 2009.</p>
	<p pid="e.844W.3/6" class="indent">It is not possible to provide the percentage of 16-24 year olds who were claiming JSA. As an alternative, table 3 shows the proportion of 18-24 year olds resident in each of the requested geographies who were claiming JSA in May 1997 and October 2009. This data is not available for parliamentary constituencies in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="e.844W.3/7" class="indent">As the information provided in these tables is extensive, a copy of the tables has been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>

He also set out that tax relief will be retained for any new child care vouchers that are issued in the future and that, from April 2011, all new recipients of child care vouchers will get the same income tax relief as basic rate taxpayers do currently. This will ensure that the system does not disproportionately benefit higher rate taxpayers.</p>

It has however made significant incremental improvements to the site since April 2008-including new content, improved navigation and a new look and feel in key sections of the site. This work is an integral part of its Service Transformation Agreement and commitment to converge content and services on <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk">www.direct.gov.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">www.businesslink.gov.uk</a> by 2011.

	<p pid="e.855W.2/1">Demand for face to face advice from HMRC Enquiry Centres has fallen heavily in recent years as customers increasingly turn to the telephone and internet for information. As a result HMRC is reviewing the pattern of service provision to better match service availability to customer demand. This includes considering moving to part week opening in some Enquiry Centres.</p>
	<p pid="e.855W.2/2">The first phase of the review includes Enquiry Centres in Frome, Wells and Bridgewater. The impact of these changes is being assessed by engagement with local external customer representative bodies including MPs, local authorities, Help the Aged, the Citizens Advice Bureaux and others. HMRC is also consulting with local staff, managers and trade unions. An Equality Impact Assessment of changes to Enquiry Centre opening hours will be published prior to any changes being made.</p>

When the UK joined the European Community (EC) in 1973, we signed up to the agreements which govern the application of VAT throughout the EC. Under these and successive agreements the UK is allowed to keep zero rates of VAT on certain items-many of which had been exempt from the purchase tax which preceded VAT-including drugs and medicines supplied by a pharmacist against a prescription. Most other goods and services became taxable at the standard rate and have remained taxable ever since. This includes most goods supplied by appliance contractors.</p>

	<p pid="e.857W.9/1">HM Revenue and Customs administer child tax credit (CTC), child benefit and guardian's allowance. A grandparent or any other person who is responsible for the care of a child or qualifying young person is eligible to claim CTC, child benefit, and, in some circumstances, guardian's allowance for that child or qualifying young person providing the qualifying criteria are met.</p>
	<p pid="e.857W.9/2">However, where the child is placed in the care of the grandparent under a fostering arrangement, eligibility will be dependent on the terms of that arrangement. When a local authority pays for the child's accommodation and maintenance child benefit, CTC and guardian's allowance are not paid for the foster child in order to avoid duplicate provision. However, if exceptionally, the local authority does not do this then the foster parents may be eligible for child benefit, CTC and in some cases guardian's allowance for the foster child.</p>

	<p pid="e.906W.8/1">The Department provides assistance in respect of flooding in exceptional circumstances. Following the summer 2007 floods we made available flood recovery grant of &#163;18.4 million to support the work of the hardest hit local authorities in helping those people in their communities in greatest need, whether insured or not. In addition, in July 2008, &#163;30.6 million was allocated under the Restoration Fund to support their continued efforts to rebuild their communities.</p>

	<p pid="e.906W.8/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-20">20 November</phrase>, we announced that a Community Recovery Fund of &#163;1 million would be made available to local authorities affected by the Cumbria flooding. Again this is for local authorities to support those people in their communities in greatest need, whether insured or not, and local authorities will have flexibility in how they can use the fund.</p>
	<p pid="e.906W.8/4">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) administer social fund crisis loans and community care grants, which provide help for the most vulnerable people with essential needs in an emergency. Crisis loans are intended for people on benefits or low income, and community care grants can only be used to help people on income-related benefits with little or no access to capital or other resources to meet the need.</p>
	<p pid="e.906W.8/5">Social fund crisis loans can be paid to people in work in circumstances such as these, where they are victims of a disaster and in need of immediate help.</p>

	<p pid="e.911W.3/1">The use of sprinklers and other fire suppression technologies in dwellings was considered in the review that lead to the 2006 revision of Approved Document B. This document provides guidance on compliance with Part B (Fire safety) of the Building Regulations. The extensive review that preceded the development of this new guidance considered a four year research project looking at the issue from both an effectiveness and cost/benefit perspective.</p>
	<p pid="e.911W.3/2">Sprinklers have been shown to be an effective measure in reducing fire deaths. However, the review, which included public consultation, concluded that it would not be cost-effective to provide sprinklers in all new homes but that it would be reasonable to provide them in blocks of flats over 30 metres in height where the risks were shown to be greater. A provision to this effect was, therefore, included in the revised Approved Document.</p>

	<p pid="e.912W.5/22">During the period 1997-98 to 2002-03, the shares of council tax base were set on the basis of national shares of total standard spending assessments for the services that each provides, using the control totals set out in annex E of the Local Government Finance Report (England) for that year.</p>
	<p pid="e.912W.5/23">In addition, during the period 1997-98 to 1999-2000, the figures for inner London boroughs and the receiver for the Metropolitan police district were adjusted to allow for expenditure on probation and magistrates courts.</p>
	<p pid="e.912W.5/24">From 2003-04 onwards, the shares of council tax base have been set so that the percentage increase in grant for each damping group of authorities is broadly proportional to the under lying percentage increase in formula spending share/relative needs formula for that group. In 2003-04, the resulting shares for shire county councils and shire district councils in two-tier areas were adjusted to reflect in part the combined impact of raising the assumed national council tax from about &#163;769.16 for 2002-03 to about &#163;1,037.46 for 2003-04 on the distribution of council tax income for these two groups of authorities are taken together.</p>

	<p pid="e.914W.7/1">We have acted rapidly in conjunction with lenders and money advice agencies to put in place a range of help and support for households struggling with their mortgage at every stage, and launched a campaign to ensure households have clear information about the help available. Most borrowers experiencing difficulties are able to agree a solution with their lender. In addition, the Government schemes provide a valuable backstop for those people who need further support. Over the last year over 330,000 homeowners have received help and advice with their mortgage.</p>

	<p pid="e.914W.7/3">The proportion of the mortgage market now committed to offering the Government-backed scheme or similarly extended forbearance without the need for Government guarantee is now more than 90 per cent. UK wide management information collected from these lenders and money advice agencies show:</p>
	<p pid="e.914W.7/4" class="indent">Over 33,000 loans were benefiting from extended forbearance where lenders were accepting less than contractual monthly payments or where loans had been modified to make monthly payments more affordable for the borrower;</p>
	<p pid="e.914W.7/5" class="indent">6,000 of these loans were deferring interest as part of an arrangement equivalent to the Homeowners Mortgage Support scheme, and only 15 have so far needed the formal backstop of HMS and have been registered for the Government-backed guarantee following the five-month qualification period.</p>

	<p pid="e.921W.6/1">We estimate that there are about 4.5 million domestic boilers which are &quot;G-rated&quot; or worse. While we do not hold sufficient information to say what percentage are in social housing or private housing stock, an analysis of the English Housing Condition Survey suggests social housing is less likely to contain G-rated boilers, following years of investment under programmes such as Decent Homes. The Greener Boiler Incentive will provide &#163;400 for up to 125,000 homes who seek to replace working G rated Boilers with more efficient heating technologies. In addition Building Regulations require broken boilers to be replaced with more efficient boilers. Currently 1.5 million boilers a year are replaced.</p>

	<p pid="e.927W.3/1">Existing good practice is that a cyber security breach resulting in a loss or compromise of customers' details would be reported to the Office of the Information Commissioner. DECC works closely with other areas of Government (notably the Office of Cyber Security (OCS) and the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI)) to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the national infrastructure that could be exploited by cyber threats, and to share best practice across the CNI.</p>
	<p pid="e.927W.3/2">If a cyber security breach impacts an energy utility company's operational capability leading to security of supply concerns, I have existing procedures (including my Department's emergency response plans) and existing powers (including, where appropriate, emergency powers under the Energy Act 1976) to intervene.</p>

The demand for grants for solar photovoltaic technology under the Phase-2 scheme (communities and other not-for-profit organisations) has been unprecedented and we have found it necessary to close that programme to new applications, however we are currently processing a backlog of &#163;5.7 million worth of applications for PV projects.</p>

	<p pid="e.933W.5/2">I understand that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about a specific situation in which he says access to 118 directory inquiries services is restricted by BT through their &quot;Home Hub&quot; broadband product.</p>
	<p pid="e.933W.5/3">BT's Home Hub is a wireless internet router which facilitates a range of services including broadband and a Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone capability. BT provides access to their own directory enquiries service (118 500) through the VoIP service and restricts access to other directory inquiries services. This restriction is limited to the Home Hub VoIP service as customers can access other 118 numbers through their normal BT phone, or by prefixing the number with five when using their VoIP phone to access their PTSN line. Users are also free to access 118 services through the internet.</p>
	<p pid="e.933W.5/4">A recent Significant Market Power (SMP) review by Ofcom found that &quot;call origination for Voice over Broadband (VoB) calls is not the same market as wholesale call origination on a narrowband network&quot; and as such, BT are within their rights to restrict access to other directory inquiries services.</p>
	<p pid="e.933W.5/5">Ofcom have recognised that as VoIP/VoB services develop and increase in significance they may need to re-examine their judgment and possibly include VoIP/VoB calls in BT's end to end connectivity obligation. In the mean time, the Department and Ofcom are keen to encourage commercial negotiation between BT and the affected service providers to find a resolution to this ongoing dispute.</p>

	<p pid="e.934W.2/1">Regional Transition Loan Funds were established by the Regional Development Agencies as a time limited measure while national instruments such as the Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme were put in place. In the SEEDA region the Transition Fund provides loans of up to &#163;150,000 for SMEs that are facing liquidity issues arising from the adverse financial credit squeeze. The Transition Fund is financed by SEEDA and managed by Finance South East. One business in Eastbourne has applied for funding under this scheme since it was established. This application was turned down as it did not meet the eligibility criteria. For comparison, in the SEEDA region over the same period, 141 businesses enquired about these loans, 27 businesses were offered funding and 20 have so far received funding, of which two are based in East Sussex. In those circumstances where companies did not meet the criteria a range of advice through the Business Link network has been made available, such as business health checks. Over 95,000 businesses have benefited from this service to date across England, including 17,851 in the South East.</p>

Inspectors have the power to prohibit further supply of electrical cables whose foreseeable use represents a risk of serious harm to persons. Where defective products are already in the supply chain action can be taken to require suppliers to warn and advise their customers.</p>

More generally, inspectors will shortly be carrying out an exercise to examine samples of cables in use on construction sites in the UK.

However, the UK Film Council in 2006 estimated that the total cost of copyright infringement to the UK film industry to be &#163;388 million of which digital infringement is estimated to have cost the industry &#163;202 million. The 2007 estimates were &#163;404 million total cost, of which digital infringement &#163;224 million. While digital infringement will include other forms of infringement than peer-to-peer, it is likely that it will account for a large proportion of the estimated figure.

	<p pid="e.949W.3/5">In the next six months, Sir Tim Berners-Lee will serve in an advisory capacity to the Minister for the Cabinet Office, and he will work with Professor Nigel Shadbolt to form a panel of technical and delivery experts to oversee the rapid implementation of key recommendations, including:</p>

	<p pid="e.949W.3/8" class="indent">helping to select and implement common standards for the release of public data</p>
	<p pid="e.949W.3/9" class="indent">helping to select, develop and implement common terms for that data where necessary</p>
	<p pid="e.949W.3/10" class="indent">developing Crown Copyright and 'Crown Commons' licenses and extending these to the wider public sector</p>
	<p pid="e.949W.3/11" class="indent">supporting the exploitation and publication of distributed and decentralised information assets</p>
	<p pid="e.949W.3/12" class="indent">looking at the potential for reform of the information regulatory framework, working with the ICO and other experts to ensure that the regulatory regime supports the proactive publication of Government information</p>
	<p pid="e.949W.3/13">(3) Driving the use of the internet to improve Government consultation processes as proposed by the Taskforce and learning from the innovations already used by DIUS, the Cabinet Office and others.</p>
	<p pid="e.949W.3/14">Other key areas in which Sir Tim Berners-Lee will advise the Government include:</p>
	<p pid="e.949W.3/15">(4) Working with the Government to engage with the leading experts internationally working on public data and standards, and to promote international liaison and global standards setting-an investment in future international data sharing.</p>
	<p pid="e.949W.3/16">(5) Helping to drive culture change in Whitehall toward an assumption of total publication for anonymous data using open standards.</p>
	<p pid="e.949W.3/17">The panel will work closely with the recently-appointed Director for Digital Engagement and other officials in the Cabinet Office, the Office for Public Sector Information (part of The National Archives), and the Technology Strategy Board.</p>

	<p pid="e.950W.8/6">For borrowers who are domiciled in the EU, effective collection is underpinned by EC Regulations 44/2001 which allows the SLC to obtain judgments in UK courts, which can be enforced by courts in other EU countries. Borrowers' accounts must be set up with repayment schedules and put into notional arrears in order that the SLC can inform borrowers that unless they take steps to provide income details and commence repayment where appropriate, legal action will be taken against them. This is an essential step in the overseas collection process.</p>
