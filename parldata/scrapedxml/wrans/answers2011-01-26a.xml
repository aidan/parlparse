	<p pid="a.268W.0/1">The information requested is detailed as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/2">The Attorney-General's Office (AGO) does not have a policy on the space provided per employee however use of space is kept under review. As a result the office is now shared with the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/3">AGO does not operate a hot desking policy and provides one desk per employee.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/4">The average space per employee is 17.25m<sup>(2)</sup>. This includes common areas such as reception and hallways and unusable office space such as plant rooms in the basement. AGO follows the Treasury Solicitor's Department (TSoL) flexible working policy which includes home working.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/5">TSoL policy is to make the most cost effective use of accommodation by operating flexible working arrangements, including providing nine desks for every 10 employees in their main location. In January 2011 in their main location the average number of employees per desk is 1.09 and the space provided on average per employee is 8.79m<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/6">The Treasury Solicitor's Department does provide for limited home working, subject to the needs of the business and with the prior agreement of line managers.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/7">The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has targets to reduce the size of its estate to a ratio of 10 square metres per employee, and achieve a ratio of between 8 and 10 square metres per employee when acquiring new property or following major refurbishments. As at <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-30">30 September 2010</phrase>, the CPS estate averaged 16m<sup>(2)</sup> per employee. The Department does not hold separate figures on the number of desks or workstations on the estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/8">The CPS has a policy on home working and a number of employees do work from home. Some CPS employees work in posts which are home-based on a permanent basis, e.g. employees working for CPS Direct (CPSD), which provides charging advice to the police outside normal business hours. In addition, some employees work from home on a casual basis (i.e. as a non-permanent arrangement), at the discretion of their line management, where there is benefit for both the CPS and the employee. The CPS has no specific policy covering hot desking.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/9">The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) utilises an open plan office policy, there are no cellular offices on the SFO's estate. This provides more space for meeting rooms which are shared by both the SFO and National Fraud Authority (NFA).</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/10">There is a full and detailed policy for home working which is one of the options available to staff under the SFO's flexible working policy. There are two types of home working:</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/11" class="indent">Working from home, where the home is used as a base location and the employee may sometimes be required to travel to and from the office</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/12" class="indent">Working at home, where the employee is based at an office but carries out some work in their own home</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/13">The combined staffing of the SFO and NFA means there are approximately 0.8 employees per desk. There are 20 hot-desks available for SFO staff. On average there is 12.4m<sup>(2)</sup> of space per employee inclusive of meeting rooms and storage space.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/14">The NFA recognises the benefit of flexible working arrangements and enables employees to work from home as necessary, with appropriate authorisation, but has no policy regarding the provision of office space per employee and hot desking.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/15">HMCPI's London office, occupies a listed building and the average space per employee is 29.5m<sup>(2)</sup>. This includes common areas such as reception and hallways and unusable office space such as plant rooms in the basement. HMCPSI currently does not have a policy on the space provided per employee, however the Inspectorate will soon be relocating to the TSol offices in One Kemble street where an open plan policy and hot desking policy is in operation, and it is anticipated that the average space per employee will be much reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.268W.0/16">HMCPSI currently have two members of staff who work on a regular basis from home. Staff are entitled to apply to work from home via their line managers and such a request would be considered in line with HMCPSI's flexible working policy which takes into account the business needs of the organisation and any security issues.</p>

For some of the raw materials such as soya cake and meal, this would have to be imported as it is not grown in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.283W.6/2">Cereals are an important element of animal feed across all livestock types, and broadly make up around 40% of feed. The remaining 60% consists of crops, such as soy, and also by-products from the food and drink industry, such as distillery dregs.</p>
	<p pid="a.283W.6/3">For the key cereals, such as wheat and barley, an estimate is made of the proportions of domestic and imported grain used for animal feed through the cereals balance sheet. This also includes grain which is home mixed and used on farm for feed in addition to manufactured compound feed. The balance sheet estimates indicate that the vast majority (above 96%) of wheat and barley grain used for animal feed is domestically sourced.</p>

	<p pid="a.290W.2/1">It is unclear exactly what the question is referring to. There are many regulations relating to the common agricultural policy (CAP) being modified in 2011 to bring them into line with revised comitology arrangements introduced by the Lisbon treaty. The UK will continue to work with the European Commission to ensure these technical changes are adopted in the most sensible manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.290W.2/2">If, however, the question is concerning the future of the CAP for the period 2014- 20, we anticipate the Commission will release legislative proposals in the summer. The UK wants to see a competitive, thriving and sustainable EU agriculture and food sector that is able to rise to the challenges and opportunities of the future. We therefore need ambitious reform of the CAP to deliver good value for farmers, taxpayers, consumers and the environment.</p>

Floor damping is the process of guaranteeing that no authority will receive more than a maximum percentage decrease in grant year-on-year on a like-for-like basis; in order to pay for this changes above the floor are scaled back for other authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.292W.2/1">The floods directive, as transposed by the Flood Risk Regulations 2009 in England and Wales, requires member states to identify areas that are at potentially significant risk of flooding. Flood hazard and flood risk maps and management plans must then be prepared for these areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.292W.2/2">Given that the Environment Agency already holds equivalent maps and plans for main rivers and coastal flood risk, our work focused on local sources of flooding, for which responsibility lies with lead local flood authorities. To assist local authorities in determining flood risk areas, DEFRA has identified indicative areas which local authorities must then review.</p>
	<p pid="a.292W.2/3">The method for identifying indicative risk areas was developed in consultation with the Environment Agency , Welsh Assembly Government, the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Local Government Association, drawing on both the Environment Agency's flood maps for surface water and a database of assets at risk. This established areas where 200 people, two or more critical services or 20 or more businesses are at risk of flooding. Clusters of these areas were identified and the results were then ranked to determine the highest risk areas. A threshold of 30,000 people at risk was applied to ensure that the subsequent mapping and planning phases are achievable and not too onerous.</p>
	<p pid="a.292W.2/4">The result was ten indicative flood risk areas within England, which account for 33% of the national surface water risk. Eight such areas have been identified in Wales.</p>

Importantly, the issues go much further than feeding livestock alone, as two-thirds of manufactured food products contain ingredients or derivatives made from soy.</p>

	<p pid="a.300W.2/2">HSE has regulatory responsibility for the safety of these activities and so as Minister responsible for Health and Safety I am providing a response to this question. For all UK oil and gas exploration and development activities, including coal bed methane and shale gas, there is a comprehensive regulatory framework to ensure that operations are properly licensed and controlled. This includes regulations administered by the Health and Safety Executive, who deal with the process safety aspects of this work. These include the Offshore Installations and Wells (Design and Construction, etc) Regulations 1996 (DCR), which are concerned with the integrity of the well for its full lifecycle. The Health and Safety Executive also gives advice to industry on how to comply with these safety regulations. Legislation, regulatory inspection programmes and guidance are kept under review and adapted where necessary to take account of new technologies and industry practices, and new knowledge on hazards and risks.</p>

There were 6.4 (full time equivalent) staff in post in this team at the end of December. The annual running costs over the full 12 months is next year forecast to be &#163;382,000.

	<p pid="a.307W.0/1">The community right to challenge (sometimes referred to as the community right to bid) and the community right to buy (as &quot;assets of community value&quot;) are included in the Localism Bill. The community right to challenge enables voluntary and community bodies, parish councils and local authority employees to express an interest in running a local authority service, which may trigger a procurement exercise. We will consider what other services the right may be extended to in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.0/2">Many of the details of the community right to buy scheme will be set out in regulations, on which we will shortly be consulting. It will give communities new powers to help them save local facilities threatened with closure by allowing local community groups, parish councils and others to nominate sites that are of particular value to the community. We will be consulting on what constitutes an asset of community value but it will include property owned by central Government, because the Bill provides that the scheme applies to the Crown. When a listed site comes up for sale, community groups will have a window of opportunity before a sale can take place, which they can use to prepare to bid for the site (eg by preparing a business case and raising funding). We envisage that the regulations will enable a local community group to enter a binding contract during the window of opportunity, giving an advantage over other potential purchasers.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.0/3">We want communities to be able to use these new rights effectively, and will shortly be consulting on what support may be needed to ensure this is the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.0/4">We are working towards making information on the central Government estate available to local people and communities, which will provide communities with information on public land so that they can hold land owners to account. The reform will enable communities to have greater influence in shaping the future of their areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.307W.3/1">Tables have been placed in the Library of the House providing the number of households accepted as owed the main homelessness duty during the July to September quarter 2010, the number of households in temporary accommodation at the end of September 2010 and rough sleeping figures for 2010, by local authority and county in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.3/2">The data are not collected at constituency level. St Albans constituency is made up of electoral wards in St Albans and Three Rivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.3/3">Information about local authorities' discharge of their duties under homelessness legislation is collected on quarterly PIE returns. Summary information about English local housing authorities' actions under the homelessness legislation (part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected at local authority level, and published by the Department in the quarterly Statistical Release on Statutory Homelessness, available both in the Library of the House and via the DCLG website:</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.3/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/homelessnessstatistics/publicationshomelessness/">http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/homelessnessstatistics/publicationshomelessness/</a></p>
	<p pid="a.307W.3/5">Data collected include the number of households accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty (to ensure that suitable accommodation is available). If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority must secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available and this information is also collected.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.3/6">Information is also collected on rough sleeping. Since 1998, only councils in areas with a known, or suspected, rough sleeping problem were required to conduct an official rough sleeper count-which meant that only 70 councils submitted information to central Government. Figures published in July 2010 showed that under this previous method, on any given night there were 440 rough sleepers in England. However, the coalition Government wanted a more complete measure of rough sleeping and when the remaining 256 councils provided estimates of the scale of the problem in their areas, this added a further estimated 807 rough sleepers-taking the national total to 1,247 rough sleepers on any given night.</p>
	<p pid="a.307W.3/7">Rough sleeping figures are published by the Department on the DCLG website and are given by local authority in the table at the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.307W.3/9">Under new guidance all councils across England will now provide information on rough sleeping. This move follows consultation with homelessness charities and councils and is aimed at getting a clearer picture of the scale of the problem in each area so more targeted support can be provided to some of the most vulnerable in society.</p>

NAS are also working with Business Link to promote a 'Meet the Apprentice' event and working with the local Apprenticeship Training Association (South West Apprenticeship Company (SWAC) to assist local employers to take on apprentices in the Swindon area.</p>

	<p pid="a.322W.5/4">Government investment in the programme will reach &#163;150 million a year by 2014/15. Options could include a first free year for disadvantaged students who were on free school meals or a foundation year to attract young talented people into the professions. Such measures could potentially help around 18,000 students in 2014/15. The number of students who can benefit from the new programme will depend on the final design which is currently being developed with advice from the expert panel.</p>

Member with this information once the statistics are ready for publication.</p>
	<p pid="a.330W.2/4">It is possible for borrowers to over-repay their student loans because of the loan collection process. After the end of each tax year, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) notifies the Student Loans Company (SLC) of loan deductions made by employers in the previous tax year. Due to this time lag, it is possible for people to over-repay. However, all overpayments are refunded with interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.330W.2/5">Since December 2009, in order to reduce the number of those who over-repay, borrowers nearing the end of their loan repayment term are notified by the SLC that they may opt out of the PAYE system, and complete their loan repayments by direct debit. Additionally, borrowers are advised to monitor their own repayments so they can calculate when they are likely to repay their loan in full.</p>

	<p pid="a.343W.3/2">Following our recent consultation and the publication of the consultation response in December, we have committed to the following programme of work to introduce measures to deliver the coalition agreement commitments through the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill:</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.3/3" class="indent">Making it easier for communities to have their say on local licensing, allowing local authorities to consider the views of the wider community, not just those living close to premises;</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.3/4" class="indent">Taking tough action against underage drinking by doubling the fine to &#163;20,000 for those found persistently selling alcohol to children, extending orders that see premises closed on a voluntary basis to a minimum of seven days and bringing in automatic licence reviews for these problem premises-which can see licences revoked;</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.3/5" class="indent">Charging a fee for late-night licences to contribute towards the cost of policing and local authority services to help mitigate the impact of the night time economy on local communities;</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.3/6" class="indent">Substantially overhauling the system for Temporary Event Notices (TENs) so that existing loopholes can no longer be exploited by unscrupulous operators, while ensuring the process is not bureaucratic for small voluntary and community groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.343W.3/7">Additionally, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-18">18 January</phrase> the Government announced their intention to ban the sale of alcohol sold below duty + VAT. By introducing this new measure, we will stop the worst instances of deep discounting and prevent alcohol being sold so cheaply that it leads to a greater risk of health harms or drunken violence.</p>

	<p pid="a.354W.5/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) uses a variety of channels to fund and deliver long lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) including through its support to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID and through bilateral support at country level. The purchase and delivery cost of LLINs varies between countries and by delivery channel. Recent analysis of 55 countries reporting on procurement by the Global Fund, which accounted for 35% of global purchases, estimated the average unit cost of purchasing a LLIN to be US $5.30 in 2009. This does not include distribution costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.5/2">DFID provides funds through the GAVI Alliance to roll out the pentavalent vaccine. Due to increased demand for the vaccine and a reduced price offer by an emerging market vaccine manufacturer, GAVI estimates that in 2011 the average weighted price for the vaccine will go down to US $2.58, compared to the current average price of US $2.97.</p>

	<p pid="a.354W.8/1">Support for school management committees is one of the four main elements of the Education Sector Support Programme in Nigeria (ESSPIN). To date ESSPIN has supported nearly 1,000 school management committees, which has led to significant improvements in local accountability and involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.354W.8/2">There is no plan at present to provide additional resources for this particular aspect of ESSPIN's work. However, a mid-term review which will begin in May 2011 will look at how funds can be best utilised within the programme to ensure greatest benefits to students, schools and communities. We are also supporting school management committees through other partners, including UNICEF, and will be reviewing how to achieve greatest results and best value for money.</p>

No decision has yet been taken as to whether any of the 1,000 plus vehicles so far purchased will be taken into the core equipment programme. The cost of renovating any vehicles will depend on the number of vehicles to be taken into the core equipment programme and the state of repair of these vehicles on their return from theatre.</p>

	<p pid="a.361W.2/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.361W.2/2">Non-consolidated performance awards-MOD: A close and effective link between pay and performance is a key element of the reward arrangements for the civil service. The performance element of pay is colloquially known as a bonus, but it is a misleading description because the performance-related element of pay is not additional, it is part of the departmental pay bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.361W.2/3">For the senior civil service (SCS) performance incentives are paid primarily as non-consolidated performance payments. Any award is based on a judgment of how well an individual has performed against their peers and awards are made to those judged to have made the greatest in-year contribution to business objectives. There is no restriction on the nature of the contribution but it must benefit the Department or defence more widely. Recommendations for awards are considered by moderation committees and must be linked to clear evidence of delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.361W.2/4">All satisfactory performers at SCS level were eligible to be considered for a non-consolidated performance award in line with Cabinet Office guidelines and the MOD pay strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.361W.2/5">Financial year 2003-04 was the first year in which the MOD paid non-consolidated performance awards to any of its staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.361W.2/6">The following table details how much was paid to members of the SCS in non-consolidated performance payments by financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.361W.2/7">Senior fixed term employees are individuals who are recruited through fair and open competition from outside the civil service. Those employed as senior fixed term appointees (FTAs) are on individual contracts and have a higher percentage of pay set to performance awards which are judged against stringent and stretching delivery based objectives. Some have staged payments and it is now usual to pay a smaller annual performance award with the remainder deferred for two to three years and judged against the delivery of medium to longer term objectives. Performance is judged by line management with assistance from senior officials, stakeholders, remuneration committees and in some cases internal audit.</p>
	<p pid="a.361W.2/8">Details of how much has been paid in non-consolidated awards and to how many SCS each year are shown in tables 1 and 2. Table 3 shows the monetary values of the largest non-consolidated payments made in each year to the combined SCS population of permanent staff and fixed term appointees.</p>

	<p pid="a.361W.2/184">For staff below the SCS, non-consolidated performance awards are paid to staff who meet the eligibility criteria. Higher levels of award are available for those who have contributed most to the business. These awards are distributed on the basis of relative assessment among peers and are designed to encourage continuous high attainment against stretching objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.361W.2/185">The MOD also operates an in year non-consolidated payment scheme, the special bonus scheme (SBS), which rewards eligible MOD civilians for exceptional performance in a specific task or for the achievement of a professional qualification the use of which benefits MOD and the individual. Separate arrangements apply to Ministry of Defence police (MDP) officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.361W.2/186">In 2007 the Department moved to a new pay system and the ability to interrogate payments made through the SBS before this date has been diminished and therefore any effort now to try and access this data would require a disproportionate cost. SBS data is though available for financial years 2003-04 to 2006-07 because it was reported in previous parliamentary questions.</p>

	<p pid="a.369W.4/1">Alcohol misuse is a major public health issue. We know that teenagers can be especially vulnerable to the harmful effects of drinking.

Estimate of Alcohol-related admissions<br/> Alcohol-related admissions<br/> The number of alcohol-related admissions is estimated, based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more of the following alcohol-specific conditions were listed:<br/> Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (I42.6)<br/> Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br/> Alcoholic liver disease (K70)<br/> Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br/> Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br/> Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br/> Chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced) (K86.0)<br/> Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br/> Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br/> Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br/> Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br/> Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br/> Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br/> The application of the NWPHO methodology was updated in summer 2010 and is now available directly from HES. As such, information about episodes estimated to be alcohol related may be slightly different from previously published data.<br/> 2. Age at start of episode<br/> This derived field, calculated from episode start date (epistart) and date of birth (dob), contains the patient's age in whole years<br/> 3. Finished admission episodes<br/> A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br/> 4. Assessing growth through time<br/> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in national health service practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.375W.0/14">It is important to note that such reports relate to suspected adverse reactions. Reports may be adverse reactions to the vaccine, they may be related to the process of vaccination rather than to the vaccine itself (e.g. nervousness or anxiety about needle injection); or they may be purely coincidental events that would have occurred anyway in the absence of vaccination (e.g. events due to underlying medical conditions). These reports cannot therefore be used to calculate the true frequency of adverse reactions.</p>

	<p pid="a.375W.3/1">Although the national health service has made significant reductions in the number of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemias (bloodstream infections), this Government are determined to do all they can to support the health and adult social care providers to make further improvements. From the outset, through the coalition agreement, this Government made clear that they expected the NHS to adopt a zero tolerance approach to all health care associated infections (HCAIs), including MRSA.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.3/2">The &quot;NHS Operating Framework 2011-12&quot;, published in December, requires the NHS to continue prioritising the achievement of the MRSA Objective, as well as the new Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) Objective. These Objectives, through their successful implementation, will have a significant impact on reducing variation by moving all organisations towards the performance of the best and consequently will at the same time reduce numbers at a national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.3/3">We have also, from the end of December 2010, extended the previous requirement for the NHS to screen all relevant elective admissions to also include relevant emergency admissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.3/4">To support the wide availability of data to help drive further reductions in MRSA, we have introduced weekly publications of data for both MRSA bloodstream infections and C. difficile infections at hospital-site level.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.3/5">We are also committed to ensuring that the NHS continue to have access to evidence-based guidance in order to reduce the number of all HCAIs, including MRSA, through the implementation of effective infection prevention and control practices. As part of this commitment, a comprehensive suite of updated guidance was published on the Department's &quot;Clean, Safe Care&quot; website on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-06">6 January 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.3/6">The Health and Social Care Act 2008 &quot;Code of Practice for health and adult social care on the Prevention and Control of Infections and related guidance&quot;, which the Care Quality Commission use as a basis for assessing compliance with the registration requirement on cleanliness and infection control, has been a driver for improvement in the hospital setting. We extended the scope of the Code to adult social care settings from October 2010 and will include primary care in due course so that we can ensure that all settings where patients receive care and treatment operate comparable infection prevention and control practices.</p>

	<p pid="a.380W.6/1">The cost incurred to date in respect of the private finance initiative (PFI) contract for Worcester Acute Hospitals National Health Service Trust since the new hospital opened in March 1999 is estimated to be &#163;233.1 million. This is the total of the annual unitary payments paid by the national health service trust to the private sector consortium for all the services it provides under the contract such as construction, provision of building maintenance and facilities management such as catering, cleaning and portering, information technology and equipment provision and replacement.</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.6/2">This figure is based on the audited summarisation schedules of the trust for 2003-04 to 2008-09 held by the Department (which it only has for six years on the same accounting standard); and estimates for 1999-2000 to 2002-03 and 2009-10 based on other information held and standard assumptions about inflation.</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.6/3">The estimated cost to be incurred for the remaining 19 years of the PFI contract is &#163;619 million. This is a projection based on the estimated payment for 2009-10 uprated annually using a retail prices index (RPI) figure of 2.5% (used as a long-term average estimate). It must be noted that the annual unitary payments fluctuate both up and down as a result of contractor performance, additional services requested by the trust or taken out, the effects of refinancings and changes to RPI, so these figures are only estimates.</p>

	<p pid="a.382W.2/1">People who have been found fit for work following a work capability assessment will not be eligible to claim employment and support allowance as they will no longer meet the eligibility conditions for that benefit. They may be eligible to claim other benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.2/2">It should be noted, that people claiming benefits on the grounds of incapacity can undertake a range of activities, including certain unpaid work and continue to be entitled to benefit. These rules are known as permitted work.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.2/3">The permitted work rules allow customers in the Work Related Activity Group to retain all their ESA for up to a year while undertaking paid work, provided earnings are below the &#163;95.00 a week and the hours worked do not exceed 16 hours a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.2/4">People in the Support Group, who are less likely to move into full-time work, are able to undertake permitted work on an indefinite basis. Unlike claimants in the Work Related Activity Group, they are not limited to an overall period of a year, provided that earnings do not exceed &#163;95.00 per week and the hours worked do not exceed 16 hours a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.2/5">The permitted work rules strike a delicate but important balance between, on the one hand, encouraging customers to build their confidence, undertake some part-time paid work, and plan a gradual move to sustained employment, while continuing to receive benefit, and, on the other, providing the incentive for them to move off benefit entirely and into full-time work, in line with the Government's overall approach.</p>

Causes of incapacity are based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, published by the World Health Organisation. To qualify for IB/SDA, claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work which is called the Personal Capability Assessment. Therefore, the medical condition recorded on IB/SDA claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefits, so for example, the decision for a customer claiming IB would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities in the Personal Capability Assessment; or on the effects of any associated health problems.<br/> 3. IB/SDA figures cannot be taken to represent numbers off work-they are merely the number of claimants of IB at a point in time. Any figures we supply cannot be taken to represent sick absences as they do not include short periods of sickness of 3 days or less or days of Statutory Sick Pay (payable by an employer). Together with this, the figures will include some unemployed persons as well as those who do not declare their employment status on making a claim.<br/> 4. Employment and support allowance (ESA). ESA replaced incapacity benefit and income support paid on the grounds of incapacity for new claims from 27 October 2008.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> DWP Information Directorate: Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.386W.5/1">The standard interest rate used to calculate support for mortgage interest is currently 3.63% which is based on the Bank of England's August 2010 published average mortgage interest rate. This rate is based on information from around 25 banks and building societies which cover over 75% of all banks and building societies' mortgage business, and is a weighted average of all existing loans to households secured on dwellings from banks and building societies in the sample. The standard interest rate applies to all claimants who receive support for mortgage interest whatever their contractual mortgage interest rate or mortgage product. There are no plans to change these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.386W.5/2">Claimants' actual interest rates were used in the past to calculate support for mortgage interest. But that method was abandoned in 1995, in favour of a standard interest rate, which has proved to be far more efficient and straightforward.</p>
	<p pid="a.386W.5/3">The pre-1995 arrangements, where claimants' actual rates were used by the department, were extremely complex to administer, prone to error and added cost. Reverting to that system carries an unacceptably high risk of increased overpayments and inefficiency, is resource intensive, and would not support the Government's aim of simplifying the benefit system.</p>
