	<p pid="b.215W.9/1">In 2005-06 the Department spent &pound;9,067 on producing the 'Cycle to Work Implementation Guidance'. In 2006-07 the Department's cycling delivery body, Cycling England, produced two promotional leaflets, one for employers and one for employees, which cost &pound;10,710. Cycling England promoted the scheme and leaflets through a marketing agency during the 2006 Bike Week, which focused on cycle commuting and although it is difficult to disaggregate each element of their promotion of Bike Week, we estimate that the cost in specifically promoting Cycle to Work was around &pound;6,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.215W.9/2">Since 2006 the market has matured considerably with around a dozen commercial providers now in operation and it is therefore in the interests of these providers to promote the scheme. The Department has not incurred any further expenditure other than minimal storage and distribution costs of the guidance and leaflets as they are still available on request.</p>

	<p pid="b.216W.2/1">There has been no assessment by the Department of the effect on carbon dioxide of the Cycle to Work scheme. The scheme is not run by the Department but was created by the bicycle industry to take advantage of the tax exemption provided in the Finance Act 1999 and the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. The Department's role has purely been to assist the bicycle industry in its implementation of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.2/2">There is no requirement for employers to register the scheme with the Department or Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. As we do not impose a burden on business to register centrally this information, we are not able to determine the precise level of participation in the scheme and therefore its impact on carbon dioxide.</p>

	<p pid="b.216W.11/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-14">14 July 2008</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.216W.11/2">No estimate has been made for changes in the total costs for driving test candidates when closing driving test centres in specific areas, or nationwide. This is due to the high number of variables that would have to be taken into account, such as where candidates live and the value they place on their time. Any estimated costs could be based only on assumptions and could result in inaccurate figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.11/3">The Driving Standards Agency (DSA) is a trading fund and costs are largely recovered through test fees paid by driving test candidates. In order to keep any fee increases to a minimum, DSA seeks economies in the way it conducts its business.</p>
	<p pid="b.216W.11/4">The existing driving test centre provision is constantly monitored to ensure that acceptable service standards are maintained but there is no wasteful over-provision of facilities. The right balance needs to be struck between the provision of a satisfactory level of public service and the cost that service incurs.</p>

	<p pid="b.223W.0/2"><i> </i>In 2008, we estimate that it costs US$385 to produce one kilogram of morphine equivalent<sup>(1)</sup> in Afghanistan. However, this is the 'farm gate' cost of illegal opium production, not the manufacturing cost of the final morphine product. This does not therefore include the following: regulation and security (policing of product, security of product transport from farm to factory); processing; equipment; chemicals; labour costs; and other business costs. These costs are unknown for Afghanistan. We estimate that the breakdown of costs for opium production in Afghanistan (per hectare) is as follows: production costs include fertiliser (estimated at 250 kilograms of urea and 250 kilograms of diammonium phosphate per hectare at a cost of US$210); oxen (at a rate of 10 days per hectare at a cost of US$8 per day); 350 labour days, including 200 days for harvesting (at an estimated wage rate of US$4 per day); and 150 days for land preparation; sowing; weeding; field clearance and seed collection (at an estimated rate of US$2.80 per day).</p>
	<p pid="b.223W.0/3">The Australian Crime Commission advise that it costs a licit manufacturer in Australia approximately US$300 (as at <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-30">30 June 2008</phrase>) to produce one kilogram of morphine. This is the cost of the final product, not the 'farm gate' cost. Due to the commercially sensitive nature of these data, a breakdown of the Australian Crime Commission figures is not available. In 1999 the International Narcotics Control Board stated that the price paid to growers was US$56 for each kilogram of morphine equivalent. The breakdown of these costs is also confidential.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-11">11 June 2008</phrase>, proposals were published for the HMRC office in Weston-Super-Mare, which envisage withdrawal from that office. These proposals are under consultation and no final decision has been made. An overview impact assessment which included the Weston-Super-Mare office was published on the same day. Feasibility work undertaken by HMRC before recommendations are made include assessment of the impact of closure on staff, customers and the wider community. This includes any equality impacts.</p>
	<p pid="b.232W.8/2">If the final decision is to withdraw from Weston-Super-Mare, an impact assessment will be published at that point, with an Equality Impact Assessment as an appendix to this document.</p>

	<p pid="b.232W.11/1">HM Revenue and Customs do not produce a single business case document for any specific building or location. The overall business case within which HMRC's regional review programme operates is its need to restructure in order to achieve the required efficiency savings and customer service improvements. Most of these savings are realised at business unit or even departmental level, and cannot realistically be apportioned to particular offices.</p>

	<p pid="b.233W.0/2">There are 342 taxi and private hire vehicle (PHV) licensing authorities in England and Wales. Under the relevant legislation each authority is permitted to set its licence fees at such a level as to enable it to cover the costs of administering the licensing system. Fees therefore vary from area to area depending on the administrative costs incurred.</p>
	<p pid="b.233W.0/3">Information is not collected centrally on the fees charged by each authority. However, a small-scale sample survey of authorities we undertook in 2006 indicated an average fee of around &pound;200 for a vehicle licence. Fees are also charged for the award of a PHV driver's licence and an operator's licence.</p>

	<p pid="b.237W.2/12">Following a TB breakdown, we aim to carry out post-mortem inspections of all the slaughtered cattle. Tissue samples are taken from the reactor (or if several animals must be removed, from a representative subset of those), to attempt isolation and molecular typing of the causative organism in the laboratory. This is done to support epidemiological investigations and management of the incident, rather than to validate the ante-mortem test results.</p>
	<p pid="b.237W.2/13">Failure to detect lesions of TB by post-mortem examination, or to culture <i> M. bovis</i> in the laboratory, does not imply that a test reactor was not infected with bovine TB. With TB in cattle, it is frequently not possible to observe lesions during abattoir post-mortem examination and, due to the fastidious nature of this organism, it is very difficult to isolate it from tissue samples without visible lesions.</p>
	<p pid="b.237W.2/14">Meaningful confirmation proportions for TB test reactors cannot be provided, as substantial numbers of skin and gIFN positive animals are not subject to laboratory culture, for example, once infection has already been identified in other cattle from the same herd.</p>
	<p pid="b.237W.2/15">Responsibility for inspecting TB carcases and their associated offal rests with the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS). Under the EU Food Hygiene Regulations, all animals herds with no visible tuberculosis lesions, plus any cattle with visible tuberculosis lesions localised in one organ or one part of the carcase, will have been considered fit for human consumption by the MHS.</p>

	<p pid="b.247W.0/1">Expenditure on UK Biodiversity forms one of the suite of indicators which DEFRA publishes on behalf of the UK Biodiversity Partnership in 'Biodiversity Indicators in your pocket'. Available information based on that underpinning the indicator is provided in the following table. The figures represent programme spend only and do not capture staff costs in non-departmental public bodies funded by the Department through grant-in-aid. Staff in these organisations also contribute significantly to wildlife management and conservation through their various activities, including for example, provision of advice. Furthermore, a number of other programmes have also contributed approximately &pound;10 million per annum to the total budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.247W.0/2">DEFRA's expenditure on biodiversity has approximately doubled in real terms over the last five years. The majority of this comes from agri-environment expenditure. &pound;3.9 billion of agri-environment funding has been secured for England for the period 2007-13, much of which will be targeted at biodiversity. Other contributions also arise from other organisations such as the Royal Botanical Gardens&mdash;Kew, who for example, will receive &pound;17.6 million in grant-in-aid this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.250W.2/3">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is the competent authority for food safety, and is responsible for designating and classifying shellfish beds and ensuring that these areas are monitored for microbiological contamination and the presence of marine biotoxins in accordance with the relevant food safety legislation. In England and Wales this monitoring is undertaken by local enforcement authorities.

	<p pid="b.258W.5/1">The most recent assessment was conducted in 2007 and drew on information from the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime's World Drugs Report 2006. This noted that opium and heroin from Laos and Burma is trafficked to neighbouring South East Asia countries (notably China) and to the Oceania region (mainly Australia). The main focus of the United Kingdom Government's drugs strategy is on drugs trafficked to this country and there was no indication that any of the traffic out of Burma is destined for the United Kingdom. The current stance of the Burmese Government makes it difficult for any non-Burmese national and international agency to work in that country.</p>

The force already receives additional Government and Corporation of London funding to perform a lead force role across the South East and this further funding will enable the force to expand its Economic Crime Department and take on the investigation of serious and complex frauds across the country.

	<p pid="b.268W.9/1">Communities and Local Government has taken numerous steps over the last two years to reduce its volume of general waste produced and sent for incineration. The measures taken have included:</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.9/2" class="indent">Reducing the number of personal general waste bins, to encourage staff to produce less waste and to dispose of recyclable materials in the appropriate facilities provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.9/3" class="indent">In headquarter buildings, plastic bottle recycling has been replaced by a system of 'total plastics recycling' enabling all common plastic polymers to be recycled, not just those used for bottles.</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.9/4" class="indent">Introducing mobile phone and waste electronic and electrical equipment recycling systems, in addition to the standard recycling provisions such as paper, cardboard, glass and cans.</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.9/5" class="indent">Organic waste recycling was also extended, enabling staff to compost waste in tea points of HQ buildings. This facility is also provided in kitchens and restaurant areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.9/6" class="indent">The number of printers has also been reduced to encourage less printing.</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.9/7" class="indent">Communications campaigns are run at various intervals to remind staff to recycle; this has included focusing on avoiding the use of single use plastic bags and holding a 'Sustainability Month' during which staff were reminded to make full use of recycling facilities provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.9/8" class="indent">An environmental champions network has been established comprising staff volunteers who encourage their colleagues to foster more sustainable practices in the office, such as reducing waste production and recycling more.</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.9/9" class="indent">Plastic food containers in staff restaurants have been replaced with biodegradable alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.9/10" class="indent">Major office furniture replacement projects have included ensuring redundant office furniture is disposed of by Green Works. Green Works is a not for profit social enterprise which redirects second hand furniture to third sector organisations such as schools and charities. The replacement office furniture has been selected ensuring a high level of reuse and recyclability to enable future general waste levels to be minimised.</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.9/11" class="indent">Communities also relaunched its reusable water bottling scheme in its main HQ building. Instead of buying mineral water in glass bottles, the Department bottles filtered tap water on site in reusable glass bottles. This not only minimises waste but, similar to many sustainable waste solutions, reduces carbon dioxide emissions associated with waste treatment and transportation.</p>
	<p pid="b.268W.9/12">The Department will continue to identify further waste solutions to improve its future performance.</p>

	<p pid="b.277W.3/1">Planning applications for Titan prisons would be considered under the Town and County Planning legislation and normally be determined by the local planning authority. It is possible that such an application could be called in by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government for her own decision, or, if refused by the local planning authority, any appeal could be recovered for determination by the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="b.277W.3/2">If the Ministry of Justice concluded, on the basis of pre-application discussions, that the relevant local planning authority would be likely to refuse planning permission and provided that he can certify that the scheme is of national importance and required urgently, the Secretary of State for Justice could submit the application direct to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government under section 293 A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. This provides for the case to be determined by the Secretary of State under an expedited procedure.</p>

	<p pid="b.292W.20/1">There are a number of recent initiatives and planned activities, primarily delivered through bodies such as UK Sport and the British Council, designed to improve sporting links between the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.292W.20/2">UK Sport currently supports sport development projects and programmes which foster school links through sport in 21 Commonwealth countries and plans to work in one further Commonwealth country. UK Sport works in conjunction with the British Council and UNICEF to deliver the international inspiration project to inspire young people in developing countries and communities to take part in sport.</p>
	<p pid="b.292W.20/3">In addition Dreams + Teams is an initiative to promote Youth Leadership and School Links through sport. Dreams + Teams currently operate in the Commonwealth countries (as shown in the table).

	<p pid="b.292W.20/4">UK Sport hosted the Next Step Conference, empowering young sports leaders to champion the Olympic values of friendship and fair play, in Namibia in 2007 where 19 Commonwealth countries were represented.</p>
	<p pid="b.292W.20/5">Representatives from 67 of the 71 Commonwealth Games Associations attended the Commonwealth Sports Development Conference in Glasgow in June 2008 focusing on how sport and development initiatives can raise levels of grass-roots participation and create pathways to excellence both here in the UK and in the developing world, and was hosted by Culture and Sport Glasgow with support from Glasgow city council.</p>
	<p pid="b.292W.20/6">UK Sport and the Commonwealth Games Federation signed a Memorandum of Understanding in January 2007 for a four year period to develop and broaden the relationship between the two organizations. Additionally, Sue Campbell, Chair of UK Sport, is also Chair of Commonwealth Advisory Body on Sport (CABOS) which was established in 2005 to promote the value of sport as a tool for social, economic, health and educational development. Its advocacy work is directed primarily at the Commonwealth governments through their Ministers of Sport, the Commonwealth secretariat and other key policy-makers.</p>

	<p pid="b.294W.2/37">Entertainment is regulated by the Act if it includes the performance of live music or dance, recorded music or entertainment comparable to these activities. It must be available to the public or members and guests of a qualifying club (whether a charge is made or not), or to a private audience if there is a charge with a view to making a profit.</p>
	<p pid="b.294W.2/38">Premises offering entertainment in the form of striptease or similar dancing must, therefore, apply for a licence to cater for the performance of dance (or entertainment of similar description), live or recorded music and, if it has a bar, alcohol sales.</p>

	<p pid="b.295W.2/1">People 1st, the Sector Skills Council for the tourism industry, is promoting career development opportunities as part of the National Skills Strategy for hospitality, leisure, travel and tourism&mdash;an employer-led strategy launched by my Department in March 2007. Government have signed up to the strategy's 10-point plan to improve skills, retention and career development, which is a key part of my Department's broader tourism strategy for 2012 and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="b.295W.2/2">Within the National Skills Strategy, People 1st has developed an on-line skills and employment resource&mdash;the UKSP (previously the UK Skills Passport)&mdash;which includes a detailed and easy-to-use career map of the sector, and allows individuals to match themselves and their skills to the best employers who have signed up to the industry's 'Good Employer' standards. UKSP marketing is also targeted to attract new talent by showing potential recruits the career opportunities available right across the sector. People 1st is also giving clarity to the role of qualifications in an individual's career pathway, from pre-entry to employment, through to workplace development and progression.</p>
	<p pid="b.295W.2/3">Finally, the National Skills Academy for Hospitality was approved by Government in May. Over the next five years over 65,000 learners will go through academy programmes, helping learners develop good careers in the industry through UKSP and by linking up with the network of Good Employers.</p>

The Government hold in high esteem the contribution of all those who supported the war effort during these major periods of national conflict which has been recognised in a number of different ways depending on the particular group. Any question of a badge specifically for munitions workers would be a matter for the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform which has legacy responsibility for those matters covered by the Ministry of Supply, including those who worked in the munitions industry.</p>

	<p pid="b.299W.3/1">The Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (SPVA) administers two schemes under which disability allowances may become payable&mdash;the armed forces compensation scheme (AFCS) and the war pension scheme (WPS). In the case of AFCS, ongoing disability allowances are payable to the most seriously injured and this payment becomes due on discharge. Therefore there are no such claims for ongoing disability allowances outstanding for serving personnel. However the majority of awards comprise of a lump sum payment which may be paid in service or following service depending on when the individual decides to make a claim. WPS claims are always made and awarded following discharge.</p>
	<p pid="b.299W.3/2">SPVA records show that at <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase> the number of claims of disability related payments, in the process of consideration, against each scheme was 1,292 for serving personnel and veterans under AFCS and 7,238 for veterans under WPS. This does not constitute a backlog as the claims are at various stages of consideration in line with the normal procedures. In considering claims under both schemes, medical evidence of the condition(s) claimed, prognosis for recovery or enduring disability and evidence of the link to service is required. Depending on the complexity and needs of the individual cases, gaining sufficient information in order to properly inform the correct decision can take a varying amount of time.</p>
	<p pid="b.299W.3/3">With regard to the number of claims under redress both schemes offer an appeals process which utilises the independent Pension Appeal Tribunals (administered by the Ministry of Justice). Personnel may decide to appeal for a number of reasons such as the availability of additional information or because they disagree with any aspect of the decision made. The number of appeals currently in progress is 102 for AFCS and 565 for WPS.</p>

	<p pid="b.300W.8/2">All operational ration packs (ORP) components are intended to achieve a minimum of 24 months shelf life after production. A selection of each pack date is sent for analysis by the MOD contracted chemist at the 18 month point. Depending on the recommendations made by the chemist the rations are then recommended for re-inspection in six months, three months or certified as no longer suitable for issue. This process is repeated until the rations are certified as no longer suitable for issue. A monthly report is issued to all units in the armed forces through front line Commands detailing the material condition of each pack date. Action is then taken to ensure that stocks are managed accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="b.301W.5/1">Medical Employment Standard (MES) codes (and supporting codes showing Medical Limitations) are used to define an individual's medical fitness and enable the communication of the necessary information to their career manager/chain of command without any breach of medical confidentiality. These codes are used to ensure that an individual is appropriately employed without unnecessarily endangering their own health or that of others. Historically, the codes have evolved along single-service lines and this presents difficulties in deriving a consistent, central view of medical employability across the services which has made it impractical to provide the information requested. Currently, the MES codes do not equate to medical 'deployability' (i.e. the fitness of an individual to deploy on operations).</p>
	<p pid="b.301W.5/2">A working group has been set up to define and plan a set of Joint MES codes and Medical Limitations against which all service personnel will be assessed for their deployability and employability status. This definition work is due to be complete by the end of 2008 and the changes will be implemented on relevant IT systems as soon as possible thereafter. Once in place, this system will provide centrally held information on fitness for employment and deployability. Once the system is in place we will consider the most appropriate means by which this information could be placed in the Library of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.301W.5/3">It is the Department's intention to maximise the employability and deployability of all individuals at all times. This means that an individual who is unfit for frontline operational duty may still be employable within his/her service. Each case is considered and managed on its individual merits.</p>

	<p pid="b.304W.0/1">No. It would be difficult, in equity, to extend the half rate pension to widows whose husbands had left the service before <phrase class="date" code="1973-03-31">31 March 1973</phrase> because they had not contributed financially towards the improvement. It has also been the long-standing policy of successive Governments that discretionary changes to improve the benefits offered by public service pensions schemes should be implemented for future service only.</p>

	<p pid="b.309W.2/1">The upgrade of RAF Northolt and the decommissioning and sale of other sites forms part of Project MoDEL, which is making good progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.309W.2/2">At Northolt, approximately half of the construction programme has been completed since contract award in August 2006. 11 new facilities have been delivered so far, including: four blocks of Single Living Accommodation (SLA)&mdash;250 rooms in total; welfare facilities; office accommodation; a five-bay hangar; and the new British Forces Post Office (BFPO) facility. The new facilities, not least the SLA blocks, have improved the living and working conditions for personnel at RAF Northolt.</p>
	<p pid="b.309W.2/3">So far as decommissioning and sales are concerned, six sites across the Greater London area have been designated surplus and are being released as part of Project MoDEL. Of these, RAF Eastcote and RAF West Ruislip have been sold for residential development, releasing funding for development of the Defence estate and other departmental priorities. The former BFPO site at Mill Hill and RAF Bentley Priory closed in January and May 2008 respectively. These two sites will be sold once planning submissions have been agreed by the local planning authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.309W.2/4">We are engaging closely with the local planning authority and a number of other organisations and stakeholders to secure the future of Bentley Priory's heritage. A way forward has been agreed and a planning application is currently with the London Borough of Harrow for approval.</p>
	<p pid="b.309W.2/5">RAF Uxbridge and Victoria House, Woolwich, remain operational at present. At Uxbridge, our contractor is preparing a supplementary planning document for the site for submission to the London borough of Hillingdon, and at Victoria House a planning application for development of the site as a residential care home is currently with the London borough of Greenwich for approval.</p>
	<p pid="b.309W.2/6">In addition, Chelsea Barracks was sold earlier this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.310W.8/2">Following the Government and Devolved Administrations' response to the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management's report in October 2006, the ISOLUS project team has been able to take forward technical and siting issues in conjunction with the new stakeholder groups, which have been created. The results of a technical options study are due by the end of this year. The project procurement strategy is currently being developed within the context of the Defence Industrial Strategy. These work areas are interrelated and the output from each will be drawn together over the next year to inform a recommendation for the way ahead. The project remains committed to further public consultation before major decisions are made.</p>

	<p pid="b.312W.8/1">The Defence Training Review (DTR) Package 1 Integrated Project Team (IPT) has from the outset routinely consulted the trade unions representing all the civilian employees potentially affected by the proposals stemming from the project. Such meetings, which now include representatives of the Metrix Consortium, take place every three months and provide an informal opportunity to update trade union representatives on project progress and address concerns and questions. Where required, the obligations under TUPE (2006) Regulations have been met through more formal consultation and exchanges of information. The approach taken has been as open as commercial considerations allow and has been cited by the trade unions as best practice. The MOD remains committed to continue the consultative process as the project proceeds. Consultation at MOD level is also matched by meetings and briefings that take place within DTR colleges.</p>

	<p pid="b.314W.12/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) is taking a close interest in the effects of rising oil prices in sub-Saharan Africa, drawing on reports by the OECD and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as our own assessments. The dollar price of crude oil has doubled over the past two years. The economic impacts in Africa vary from country to country, with oil producers generally gaining through increased foreign earnings.</p>
	<p pid="b.314W.12/2">Non-oil producers have experienced reductions in economic growth. According to the IMF, an increase in the real price of crude oil from $75 to $100 from October 2007 to April 2008 has reduced economic growth by between 0.2 and 1.0 per cent. For some countries, the impacts of high oil prices has been partly offset by higher prices earned from other exported commodities. For all countries, there have been increases in the consumer price of oil products, such as petrol and kerosene.</p>

This includes around $1 billion in sub-Saharan Africa, representing a quarter of the total value of legitimate African fish exports. DFID has contributed some &pound;700,000 to increase awareness of illegal fishing in southern Africa. This culminated in the Southern Africa Development Commission (SADC) Ministerial Conference on Illegal Fishing held in Namibia on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-04">4 July</phrase> (2008), at which urgent measures to tackle illegal fishing were discussed and agreed; these included improving sharing regional intelligence, improving fisheries governance and to encourage market measures that keep illegal produce out of supply chains.

It will also fund the construction of 50 new seismic resistant bridges to further help those communities cut off by the earthquake and to improve road access in many remote areas. In partnership with the UN we have also funded almost 900 fully equipped prefabricated offices to get local government back to work while permanent buildings are repaired. Other future work planned includes rebuilding of schools and other education institutions, almost 6,300 of which were damaged by the earthquake.</p>

	<p pid="b.320W.2/1">There are a range of employment programmes that ensure that people get the support that they need to move back into work.</p>
	<p pid="b.320W.2/2">The new deal embodied the idea that rights and responsibilities go hand in hand. In return for the extra support and opportunities provided, young people were expected to take up jobs and training or see their benefits cut. As we saw this approach working, we extended it to other groups. Together with a stable economy, this has helped take a million people off key out-of-work benefits and cut claimant unemployment by 50 per cent. The latest figures show that the number of people on jobseeker's allowance is 819.3 thousand. This is down 58.1 thousand on the year, and down 800.3 thousand since 1997. The result is we are spending over &pound;5 billion less on key out-of-work benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.320W.2/3">At the same time, we have increased employment support by &pound;800 million and been able to increase help to those who simply cannot work. This is good for the individual and for our society as a whole. All the evidence shows that work is the best route out of poverty and that by helping people into work, we make sure our economy benefits from making better use of individuals' talent while cutting the welfare bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.323W.2/1">The Security Industry Authority (SIA) provided the Department for Work and Pensions with a list of 7,266 individuals on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-07">7 March 2008</phrase>, and a further 920 individuals on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-16">16 April 2008</phrase>. This total of 8,186 names included cases where licences had already been revoked and all cases where appeals were pending at the time and where revocation remained a possibility. Work on checking the cases commenced on the <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-10">10 March 2008</phrase> and has only recently been completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.323W.2/2">Analysis of the details provided by the SIA shows that a total of 294 national insurance numbers were issued following the introduction of the right to work test in July 2006. Detailed checks have confirmed that 269 of these did have the right to work at the time the NINO was issued. The right to work had subsequently expired which is why they were found to be working illegally by the SIA. A balance of 25 cases were found not to have had the right to work and to have been issued with a NINO incorrectly. However, this was due to a temporary misunderstanding by staff about students having an automatic right to work which was quickly rectified.</p>
	<p pid="b.323W.2/3">The remaining 7,892 cases were either issued before the right to work test was introduced (4,617 or about 58.5 per cent. of the 7,892) or are cases where the names or NINOs given to the SIA appear to be false (3,275 or about 41.5 per cent.). Further examination into cases where false names or NINOs appear to have been provided has been initiated where appropriate.</p>

The number of people eligible for the enhanced disability premium will increase under employment and support allowance, due to the automatic passport to the premium for those in the support group. This ensures that everyone in the group receiving income-related employment and support allowance will receive the enhanced disability premium.</p>

	<p pid="b.329W.8/2">The report, 'Cannabis: Classification and Public Health (2008)', was published in May 2008 and copies have already been placed in the Library and are also available on the Home Office's website at:</p>

	<p pid="b.329W.8/4">Recently, the Department commissioned a systematic review of studies in this area. The peer-reviewed results of this review were published in <i> The</i><i> Lancet</i> in July 2007 and confirmed the increased evidence of an association, possibly causal, between prior cannabis use and later development of psychosis and schizophrenia with a 40 per cent. increase in risk reported (up to 200 per cent. increase for at-risk heavy users).</p>
	<p pid="b.329W.8/5">The Department has also commissioned research into the harmful components of cannabis and tobacco smoke. This work is well advanced and a publication date will be set in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.329W.8/6">The Department keeps the evidence of the physical and psychological effects of cannabis under review and has commissioned the National Addiction Centre to review the evidence of harms for the Department's publication, 'Dangerousness of Drugs (2001)', copies of which have already been placed in the Library. The Department has identified funding for the review to be updated later this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.331W.6/1">At the <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-30">30 June 2008</phrase>, there were 2,082 information technology (IT) accounts which had remote access to the Department's IT infrastructure. This included departmental staff and other authorised workers such as seconded and contract staff. Staff can connect securely from practically any location with access to a telephone or broadband line including their home address. If a mobile telephone network card has been supplied, connection is possible from anywhere with a general packet radio service or 3G signal. To establish how many accounts are solely for departmental staff or how many staff actually access the Department's IT infrastructure from their homes, will not be possible without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid="b.331W.9/1">The Department and its agencies have two sets of arrangements under which bonuses can be awarded. For senior civil servants (SCSs), pay arrangements are common across all Government Departments. The Department's senior pay strategy, which conforms to these common arrangements, explains that bonuses may be awarded for delivery of personal objectives or other short-term personal contributions to wider organisational objectives. Individuals are required to agree their priorities with their manager at the beginning of the performance year. Line managers then make recommendations for performance bonuses which are considered by the Department's pay committees at the end of the performance year. The pay committees, which meet annually, make the final decision on whether a bonus should be awarded, relative to the performance of others. In 2006 and 2007, 85 per cent. of SCSs in the Department and its agencies did not receive the maximum bonus possible under the scheme. Bonuses for 2008 have yet to be decided.</p>
	<p pid="b.331W.9/2">For staff below the SCS, the Department and its agencies operate a special bonus scheme whereby managers may award a bonus to recognise an outstanding contribution in a particularly demanding situation. This can include a temporary and substantial increase in job loading, dealing with pressures arising from temporary vacancies or job requirements, a high level of commitment and resolution to get a job done, difficulties requiring a special effort to overcome, or a contribution over and above what would normally be expected for the job and of the person, or team, concerned. Bonuses are generally small in value, but there is no specified maximum size of award. As a result, it is not possible to answer the question for this scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.349W.5/1">The Department's records show that we have received only one representation specifically on the number of beds in maternity facilities at Hemel Hempstead hospital, which was a parliamentary question from the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead in June 2008. However, from June 2005 to June 2008, we have received the following representations on the future of services at West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, including maternity services:</p>
	<p pid="b.349W.5/2" class="indent">three parliamentary questions;</p>
	<p pid="b.349W.5/3" class="indent">one business question;</p>
	<p pid="b.349W.5/4" class="indent">two ministerial meetings with hon. Members; and</p>
	<p pid="b.349W.5/5" class="indent">one debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.349W.5/6">The Department has also received around 1,900 items of correspondence on the future of services at Hemel Hempstead hospital since June 2005. However, due to the way in which correspondence is logged, items concerned specifically with the number of beds in maternity facilities at the hospital could be identified only at disproportionate cost.</p>

To underpin this, the Government will require PCTs to put in place clear and transparent arrangements both for local decision-making on funding of new drugs and for considering exceptional funding requests, and to publish information on those arrangements. Where the local NHS decides not to fund a treatment, the patient and clinician can expect an explanation.</p>

UK requires the Government to reconsider their policy of a blanket ban on the voting rights of convicted prisoners.

	<p pid="b.363W.6/2">In response, we undertook a first stage consultation which concluded in March 2007.

	<p pid="b.363W.6/3">I can confirm that the Government remain committed to carrying out a second, more detailed public consultation on how voting rights might be granted to serving prisoners, and how far those rights should be extended. But we consider it essential that any changes to the law to extend the franchise to those held in custody are considered in the context of the wider development of policy on the franchise and the rights that attach to British citizenship.</p>
	<p pid="b.363W.6/4">During April 2008 we provided the Committee of Ministers with a detailed note about implementing the Hirst judgment and we have undertaken to submit further information in due course on the form and timing of a further consultation in the light of the wider debate which is now taking place. Following consideration of the outcome of consultation, legislation to implement the Government's final approach will be brought forward as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>

Both nationally and at probation area levels, we are looking to increase the provision of community-based sentences for women including the availability of women-only settings for their delivery.

	<p pid="b.377W.2/2">A range of current legislation and guidance imposes duties on local authorities and professionals to ensure that looked-after children leaving custody are provided with the support and accommodation they need on release. Measures in the Children and Young Persons Bill will enable us to revise Children Act Guidance setting out how we expect local authorities to exercise their statutory duties to continue to plan for looked-after children throughout any period in custody which would necessarily include planning for their support in the community to minimise the risk of re-offending. Clause 16 of the Bill provides for power to be given to the Secretary of State to require the local authority to visit children who were provided with voluntary accommodation by the authority but who then loses their looked after status because they received a custodial sentence. The purpose of these visits will be to assess the support that the child may need on release from custody. It will be essential that children's and youth justice services coordinate any support needed to prevent re-offending.</p>

The figure for 2008 is based on provisional data: figures for other years are based on final data. The Department does not collect information for Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.378W.5/2">Rather than being a discrete initiative, 'personalised learning' means taking a highly structured and responsive approach to each child's and young person's learning, enabling all to progress, achieve and participate. Individual schools and teachers are best placed to tailor teaching to their pupils' needs. This may include teaching in different sized pupil groupings on different occasions, or using in-class grouping to allow pupils with a range of needs to work at an appropriate level. However, there is no expectation that by using personalised approaches to teaching and learning, schools will experience any change to their overall average class size as indicated.</p>

	<p pid="b.383W.5/1">Functional skills qualifications are currently being piloted and our intention is that, for GCSEs awarded from 2012, students taking mathematics, English or ICT should have to achieve the relevant FS qualification at L2 in order to obtain a grade C or above at GCSE. Level 2 functional skills qualifications are designed to be of a similar level of challenge to GCSE grade A*-C. As they assess different skills the pilot will test the potential effect on GCSE attainment, through analysis of results in the pilot assessments.</p>

The &pound;2 million funding for the programme has been for both the development and delivery of a national CPD programme, which is free for participants.</p>
	<p pid="b.385W.2/3">Initial applications were received from just over 1,300 teachers and this resulted in 915 practitioners actively engaging with the programme. Of those who did not end up engaging with the programme, most withdrew before starting, due to change of circumstances and/or time constraints. Every practitioner has a mentor and an individualised training programme. A total of 312 mentors have been appointed and trained. Practitioners have been completing their portfolios for moderation and certification, and 132 completed portfolios have been received so far.</p>

The final report on the impact of the programme to 2008, including case studies, is expected to be provided to the Department in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="b.391W.2/1">The minimum funding guarantee was introduced to the school funding system for the 2004-05 financial year. A schools forum may approve variations to the minimum funding guarantee proposed by the local authority that together affect no more than 50 per cent. of pupils in the authority's schools. The purpose of this provision is to allow local authorities and their schools forums to handle anomalies that may arise from the operation of the minimum funding guarantee, since the rules set down in the regulations are unable to cover all local circumstances. Where local authorities propose a variation to the minimum funding guarantee that will affect more than 50 per cent. of pupils, the Secretary of State's approval must be sought.</p>

	<p pid="b.392W.8/1">Schools should put as much effort into designing and managing toilets as they do in building and managing other facilities. They should be clean, safe, well equipped and accessible. Children and young people themselves cite the state of school toilets as a top priority. It is unacceptable that they are put off using toilets at schools because they are badly designed, vandalised dirty or hang-outs for bullies. We want pupils to be healthy by drinking plenty of water throughout the day and they cannot do that without feeling safe to use the toilets.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/2">That is why last year for the first time we laid down clear guidance in the form of a specification for design so that schools can use the record amounts of investment in school buildings and facilities to provide the highest quality pupils' toilets. The guidance sets out specific design features to combat antisocial behaviour; suggests how floor space can be designed effectively and encourages local education authorities and schools to involve pupils in the design and management of the facilities to foster a sense of pride and ownership.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/3">The required number of toilets in schools in England is set out in the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999. Responsibility for applying the requirements of these regulations rests with local education authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/4">Schools and local education authorities should comply with the requirements of the School Premises Regulations and the HSE Workplace Regulations regarding hygiene and cleanliness then school toilet accommodation will be adequate. But these are minimum requirements and we want more than that which is why we issued the guidance last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/5">In the first term of Government, the last 450 primary schools with outside toilets had them replaced. We are not aware of any remaining schools in England which only have access to outside toilets.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/6">We do not hold survey records on the provision of school toilets but we are confident that local education authorities will have assessed their toilet accommodation as part of asset management planning and together with the schools will have remedied most inadequacies by now.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/7">The bulk of schools capital is allocated by formula to authorities and schools so that they can address their local asset management planning priorities, including the upgrading of toilet and washroom facilities. Research on the use of devolved formula capital shows that around a fifth of schools have improved toilets each year from 2003-04 to 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/8">Central Government capital support for investment in schools has increased from under &pound;700 million in 1996-97 to &pound;6.7 billion in 2008-09 and will rise further to &pound;8.0 billion by 2010-11. Progress is being made year-by-year in improving the quality of the school building stock. Given the high levels of funding, authorities have the opportunity to upgrade toilets.</p>
	<p pid="b.392W.8/9">At present we are reviewing the School Premises Regulations and will consult on them in due course.</p>
