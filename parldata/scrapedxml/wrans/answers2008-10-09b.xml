While Royal Mail intends to close this centre, it will be opening three new delivery offices in Liverpool. The Government fully appreciates that the closure of mail centres or other Royal Mail facilities creates uncertainty for Royal Mail employees and their families. I understand that Royal Mail is discussing the impact of their proposals and decisions with employees and will work with them individually to understand their preferences for future employment within the business.</p>

This is part of the National Bee Unit's (NBU) statutory inspection programme for notifiable diseases and pests. The NBU also provides a free comprehensive training and education programme for beekeepers to enable them to develop their skills and become more self-reliant in combating disease problems through improved bee husbandry. In 2007, beekeepers benefited from more than 26,000 colony inspections and an extensive programme of training, including over 600 technical events of which 134 were in the north east region), delivered by the NBU to help improve disease control through good apiary management.</p>

	<p pid="b.720W.6/1">The 2008 harvest period has been one of the wettest on record with rainfall around double normal levels, which slowed progress with the harvest. The Government have taken action to help farmers in England by granting a temporary exemption from the cross compliance standard to enable them to use mechanical equipment and vehicles on waterlogged soils in order to complete the harvest. We are continuing to monitor developments closely, but it is still too early to make a full assessment of the impact of the wet weather on yield and crop quality.</p>

	<p pid="b.723W.3/1">For over 15 years, the Government have funded studies by the Natural History Museum and Institute of Zoology on trends in cetacean strandings and causes of death around the UK coastline.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.3/2">Strandings data are obtained and reported by the Natural History Museum in partnership with the Institute of Zoology and Scottish Agricultural College and Marine Environmental Monitoring. Annual reports of the UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme (CSIP) are available on the DEFRA website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.3/3" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/resprog/findings/index.htm">http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/resprog/findings/index.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="b.723W.3/4">Under this research contract, not only are all stranded animals recorded, but post-mortem examinations are carried out on some of the animal carcasses to establish the exact cause of death. Abundance estimates tell us populations of studied cetaceans in UK waters have not changed significantly over the past 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.3/5">The research conducted under this contract was renewed last April and runs until 2010 at a cost of over &pound;1 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.3/6">From 2000 to date, the UK has put over &pound;2 million into researching by-catch mitigation measures and monitoring by-catch on vessels through observers, to try to identify those fisheries responsible for high levels of cetacean by-catch, and mitigation measures that are effective at deterring cetaceans over the long-term and are safe and cost-effective for the industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.3/7">DEFRA has implemented a comprehensive system of by-catch monitoring under the requirements of the EC habitats directive and under Council Regulation 812/2004. The Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) produces annual reports on this research for DEFRA (which are also available on the website). Furthermore, SMRU has recently undertaken research on behalf of DEFRA into the effects of a new design of acoustic deterrent device ('pingers') on porpoise and dolphin distribution. These 'super-pingers' are larger, and therefore, fewer devices are required, reducing deployment problems. We hope to have more details on the efficacy of these new pingers by spring 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.3/8">In addition to this work, SMRU has also undertaken a by-catch mitigation research project, which has been looking at:</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.3/9" class="indent">Providing updated estimates of marine mammal by-catch for all relevant fishery sectors through analysis of fleet effort data; existing by-catch rate data; and through further monitoring of UK fisheries as determined under the UK's Small Cetacean by-catch Response Strategy;</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.3/10" class="indent">Investigating the impact of by-catch and other indirect effects of UK fisheries on marine mammal populations, and exploring ways of addressing the limits to by-catch from a management perspective; and</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.3/11" class="indent">Exploring as many research avenues as practicable to search for ways of changing fishing gear design or fishing tactics in order to minimise marine mammal by-catch.</p>
	<p pid="b.723W.3/12">The final report on this research project is expected to be made available publicly by the end of 2008. A new research contract on this issue has recently been agreed with SMRU and will run until April 2011.</p>

For example, the Environment Agency recently assisted Water 21, an environmental organisation engaged by local residents, which was looking to secure funding for works in the wider Slad Brook catchment in Gloucestershire. The Environment Agency provided river and general catchment data, gave advice on the technical aspects of its work and guidance on proposed actions. The project covers a number of aspects including measures to reduce flooding downstream in Stroud.</p>
	<p pid="b.726W.9/7">The Environment Agency also has a proposal to construct a flood storage reservoir upstream of New Mills Trading Estate on the Slad Brook to reduce flooding in the town. The &pound;500,000 proposal has recently been submitted to the Severn Trent Regional Flood Defence Committee for local funding in 2009-10. The project is competing against a number of other projects in the region and elsewhere. Funding is limited and the projects supported will be selected on their merits against the criteria above. We expect to make a decision in October on which project or projects will taken forward for further assessment before confirming funding for delivery in the new year.</p>

	<p pid="b.727W.2/1">Current flood protection varies for different parts of Morpeth, but it is estimated that the average flood defence provides protection against a one in 60 year event. The Environment Agency is currently examining temporary emergency works that may be required.</p>
	<p pid="b.727W.2/2">The Environment Agency is currently at the end of year one (planning phase) of a four year programme to develop a new scheme to protect Morpeth.

The Environment Agency is exploring an accelerated time scale for construction of the works.</p>

	<p pid="b.735W.0/1">The planning system provides strong protection for open spaces that communities need. Planning Policy Guidance Note 17; 'Open Space, Sport and Recreation' states that existing open spaces and land should not be built on unless an assessment has been undertaken by the local authority which has clearly shown the open space or land to be surplus to the requirements of the local community, taking into account all the functions that open space can perform.</p>
	<p pid="b.735W.0/2">PPG17 advises local authorities to make provision for all types of public open space and expects local authorities to undertake robust assessments of local needs and audits of existing open space and to establish standards for new provision. On the basis of these assessments and audits, local authorities should plan to meet future needs of their population (e.g. linked to new housing developments) and can place standards of provision in their development plan. 'Planning Policy Statement 3 Housing' says that local planning authorities should have clear policies for the protection and creation of open space, and new housing developments should incorporate sufficient provision where such spaces are not already adequately provided within easy access of the new housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.735W.0/3">Where land is registered as a town or village green, the land is protected from development in perpetuity. Section 15 of the Commons Act 2006 was commenced in England in April last year, in line with commitments given during the Bill's passage through Parliament, to clarify the criteria for the registration of greens.</p>
	<p pid="b.735W.0/4">Part 1 of the Commons Act 2006 contains mainly registration-related provisions which allow for the registers to be updated to create an accurate record of common land and greens. Accurate registers will underpin our objective to provide for the protection and better management of commons and greens for generations to come. Part 1 is being piloted from October 2008 with a view to a staged national commencement from 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.735W.3/2">Places of public religious worship, and buildings used in connection with them, were traditionally zero rated under the rateable value system of charging, meaning that they did not have to pay surface water drainage (SWD) charges.</p>
	<p pid="b.735W.3/3">In 2000 the then Secretary of State issued guidance on matters to be taken into account by Ofwat in agreeing companies' charging schemes, including charging non-household users that are not businesses, including places of worship, community facilities, charities and voluntary bodies. The guidance stated that those making similar demands on a service should be charged on the same basis. It also made clear that where premises impose customer-related costs in line with or lower than those of typical households, they should be able to benefit from tariffs which reflect their small demand on the water system. It also stated that the phasing in of any large, sudden changes in charges should be considered.</p>

	<p pid="b.736W.5/1">The Rural Payments Agency Inspectorate plans to complete the majority of sheep and goat inspections during the winter months when livestock are more readily available for inspection. However, due to the number and geographical distribution of inspections required to be completed and competing scheme inspection pressures, a minority of inspections will be completed during the summer months. In these instances the inspectorate endeavours to work with the keeper to minimise any disruption to other farming operations. All sheep and goat identification inspections must be undertaken unannounced, in practice this means an inspector can provide a maximum of 48 hours' notice.</p>

	<p pid="b.739W.2/1">The Government-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) sets itself targets&mdash;which are agreed with its funders, DEFRA and the devolved Governments&mdash;and these are written into each of its business plans. WRAP's fourth business plan was published earlier this year, and sets out its targets for the three-year period from April 2008 to March 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.739W.2/2">The extent of WRAP's delivery against its targets is set out annually in reports which are published by WRAP, and are publicly available on its website. The next such report will be published in October, and will set out how WRAP has performed against the targets contained in its third business plan, which covered the period April 2006 to March 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.739W.2/3">Prior to the publication of that report, it is possible, on the basis of WRAP's annual review for 2006-07, to report that WRAP has made it possible for the recycling industry to process an extra 5.8 million tonnes of materials per year. This consists of 4.17 million tonnes of aggregate; enough to build 83,000 new homes, 507,000 tonnes of wood, constituting 42 per cent. of the UK's domestic capacity, 495,000 tonnes of paper, 349,000 tonnes of compost, 137,000 tonnes of glass and 130,000 tonnes of plastic, enough to make 2.8 billion milk bottles.</p>
	<p pid="b.739W.2/4">The benefits of WRAP's work in terms of the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) are also significant. Since WRAP started work in 2001 it is estimated that the combined impact of its activities has saved over 1 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases&mdash;the same as taking 316,000 cars off the road. Over the lifetime of the projects that WRAP has directly supported, over 12 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases will be saved.</p>

	<p pid="b.740W.0/1">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) commissions external public relations agencies to communicate its research, advice and consumer campaigns to a wide range of target audiences, both business and consumer. The expenditure is predominantly in support of WRAP's national consumer behaviour-change campaigns: Recycle Now, Love Food Hate Waste and the programme to support home composting.</p>
	<p pid="b.740W.0/2">WRAP ensures that public relations activity is a cost-effective use of taxpayers' funds. For example, public relations spend of &pound;36,000 to launch The Food We Waste report in May this year delivered national and regional media coverage with an advertising value equivalent of &pound;1.995 million, equal to the entire annual communications budget for WRAP's Food Waste campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.740W.0/3">Public relations material produced for the consumer campaigns provides local authorities with valuable free support to help them meet recycling and waste minimisation targets. These campaigns have been highly successful over this period: the number of 'committed recycler' households in England has increased by 3.9 million, unnecessary food waste has been reduced by more than 100,000 tonnes and almost two million compost bins have been sold through the home composting programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.740W.0/4">It is only possible to express expenditure by financial year, and the following figures therefore relate to the two financial years between April 2007 and March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.740W.0/5">During 2007-08, expenditure on external public relations agencies was &pound;3.1 million, representing 4.3 per cent. of WRAP's budget for that year. In the current financial year (2008-09), the planned expenditure in this area is &pound;2.9 million, representing 5 per cent. of the overall budget for the year. It should be noted that WRAP's 2008-09 budget is significantly lower than the budget for 2007-08, which is why the expenditure on PR agencies in 2008-09, although lower than the figure for 2007-08, represents a higher proportion of this year's budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.740W.0/6">The firms employed to support WRAP over this period who are currently on the roster are 3 Monkeys, Ptarmigan, Tri-Media Harrison Cowley, Camargue, Bray Leino PR, and Fishburn Hedges. Firms no longer on the roster are Pelican PR, Lawton PR, Grayling, Proteus PR, Consolidated PR, and Kinross and Render.</p>
	<p pid="b.740W.0/7">During this period WRAP commissioned one piece of external public affairs support. Now completed, this six-month project was to engage public policy makers and opinion formers from outside WRAP's established stakeholder groups to discuss a range of developing resource efficiency issues on which WRAP is working. Chelgate Ltd was engaged at a cost of &pound;25,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.746W.2/1">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) has produced two relevant sets of guidance, both of which are freely available on its website.</p>
	<p pid="b.746W.2/2">WRAP's Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) Recycling Programme was set up in 2004 to investigate a range of factors to improve and increase the level of recycling by SMEs. The programme was delivered through a range of feasibility and demonstration trials which developed appropriate recycling services, charging mechanisms, sales and marketing approaches and advice on staff involvement in recycling. The overall aim was to make recycling at work easy, convenient and cost effective. The trials were successful, and have resulted in a number of new and expanded recycling services across England and Scotland. The results have been used to develop Good Practice Guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.746W.2/3">WRAP's Paper Advocacy Team was set up in 2005 to promote the benefits of using recycled paper to businesses. As well as providing direct advice to individual businesses, the team developed guidance documents, information sheets and case studies to provide more generic advice.</p>
	<p pid="b.746W.2/4">WRAP's website also includes a Recycle at Work section, which includes a searchable database of recycling service providers for small businesses, a step-by-step guide to how to start recycling at work, including in offices, and some case studies.</p>

	<p pid="b.747W.5/1">Section 75 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA) sets out, among other things, the sources of household waste. Subsection 75(8) empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations further refining this list. These regulations were made in 1992 and are known as the Controlled Waste Regulations (CWR).</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.5/2">Section 45(1) of the EPA places a duty on all waste collection authorities to make arrangements for the collection of all household waste arising in the area they are responsible for.</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.5/3">In the case of household waste from premises covered by schedule 2 of the CWR, this duty begins when the authority is asked to collect the waste by the person holding it. Sources of household waste covered by schedule 2 of the CWR includes, but is not limited to, waste from institutions such as schools, hospitals and prisons.</p>
	<p pid="b.747W.5/4">No guidance specific to the quantities of household waste arising in an area that an authority must deal with has been issued by DEFRA or any of its predecessors, as authorities have no choice over how much household waste they must collect. The Department did issue general guidance on both the EPA and the CWR when those statutory instruments came into force in the early 1990s.</p>

	<p pid="b.753W.2/1">The numbering system was devised to enable easy matching of datasets. As local authority names are recorded in different ways, e.g. London borough of Camden and Camden, London borough, it was proving difficult to match datasets based on local authority names alone, a process which was facilitated considerably by the numbering system. The letters &quot;JPP&quot; are the initials of the person who devised the system.</p>

	<p pid="b.754W.2/1">Places of public religious worship were traditionally zero rated, and therefore by default were not charged for surface water drainage under the rateable value system of charging.</p>
	<p pid="b.754W.2/2">In 2000 the then Secretary of State issued guidance on matters to be taken into account by Ofwat in agreeing companies' charging schemes, including charging non-household users that are not businesses, including places of worship, community facilities, charities and voluntary bodies. The guidance stated that those making similar demands on a service should be charged on the same basis. It also made clear that where premises impose customer-related costs in line with or lower than those of typical households, they should be able to benefit from tariffs which reflect their small demand on the water system. It also stated that the phasing in of any large, sudden changes in charges should be considered.</p>

Advice has also been issued on handling affected plots to speed up the decomposition of the grass in the manure. For example rotavating or digging over affected plots a number of times and ensuring the manure is turned readily. Providing this advice is followed, the risk to next year's crops should be low.</p>

There are no current requirements, and therefore no plans to extend the scheme to staff in Afghanistan at present, although this is kept under review. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is doing everything it can to discharge its duty of care to all staff serving in Afghanistan, within the constraints of the environment in which it operates.</p>

	<p pid="b.761W.0/2">An encouraging number of service user and carer representatives attended the four regional forums that have taken place and representatives have been invited to and are expected to attend the forum taking place in the east midlands later in October 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.761W.0/3">'New Horizons' will also take full account of the visions set out recently by the 10 strategic health authorities as part of the Next Stage Review, and by various key stakeholders, such as the coalition that produced 'A New Vision for Mental Health'.

	<p pid="b.762W.2/1">In early 2007, the four United Kingdom Chief Medical Officers considered the need for consistent advice across the UK on pregnancy and drinking alcohol. Following this, the Department's advice on drinking before and during pregnancy was revised and published in May 2007.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.2/2">In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published advice for health professionals on the treatment and care of women during pregnancy. This includes advice on drinking alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.2/3">The Department's advice is that pregnant women and women trying to conceive should avoid drinking alcohol and that, if they choose to drink, to minimise risk to the baby, they should not drink more than one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week and should not get drunk.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.2/4">The NICE guidelines emphasise the importance of avoiding alcohol completely during the first three months of pregnancy, the key time for organ and nervous system development.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.2/5">The Department is working with the alcohol industry to include information about drinking when pregnant on alcohol labels. This voluntary agreement with the alcohol industry, announced in May 2007, is to include unit content and daily guideline information on labels. The Department expects that advice to women to avoid alcohol if they are pregnant or trying to conceive should also be included on most alcohol labels by the end of 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.2/6">In May 2008, we launched a campaign to raise awareness of the public's knowledge of units of alcohol and how they relate to today's drinks and servings&mdash;this included communication to highlight the updated pregnancy advice around alcohol consumption.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.2/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-22">22 July 2008</phrase>, the Department launched the Government's alcohol consultation, asking for the views of the public and key stakeholders on what action the Government should take in response to the rising levels of alcohol health harm and crime and disorder. One of the questions that the consultation asks is whether the alcohol industry should have to include information on alcohol unit content and health on the labelling of alcohol products.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.2/8">We are working with the International Centre for Drug Policy to influence the development of the undergraduate medical curriculum and embed substance misuse, including a specific module on alcohol identification and brief advice, within the curriculum. This includes working with the Deans of the 24 English Medical Schools, who are all independent and set their own curriculum. The aims for undergraduate medical students are that:</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.2/9" class="indent">students should be able to recognise, assess and understand the management of substance misuse and associated health and social problems and contribute to the prevention of addiction;</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.2/10" class="indent">students should be aware of the effects of substance misuse on their own behaviour and health and on their professional practice and conduct; and</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.2/11" class="indent">students' education and training should challenge the stigma and discrimination that are often experienced by people with addiction problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.2/12">In spring 2008, we announced funding to develop the implementation of the curriculum and the training of new doctors, including, as a core priority, ensuring that future doctors will be able to recognise, assess and understand the management of alcohol misuse and its associated health and social problems, and the funding of co-ordinators in medical schools, whose roles include working with curriculum developers to ensure that the guidance is implemented and to facilitate integration of the guidance into their curricula.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.2/13">Guidance, issued in April 2007, has been developed to define the aims and core learning outcomes in substance misuse, which medical students should achieve during the undergraduate stage of their basic medical education.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.2/14">The guidance goes on to say specifically that on graduation students should be able to advise women on the effects of substance use, including alcohol, and the impact on foetal and maternal health. Concerning specific diseases, students should be able to describe the effects on pregnancy and on the newborn of misuse or dependence on alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs.</p>
	<p pid="b.762W.2/15">Currently, there are no plans to design a &quot;catch-up training programme&quot; on foetal alcohol spectrum disorder for those medical professionals already in practice.</p>

	<p pid="b.765W.2/1">SunSmart is the United Kingdom's National Skin Cancer Prevention and Sun Protection Campaign, run by Cancer Research UK on behalf of the UK Health Departments. The campaign runs on an annual basis, between April and September, and activities are evaluated by Cancer Research UK on an ongoing basis including both quantitative and qualitative factors.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.2/2">The Department is not currently collecting information on the effects of sunbed use. However, it is taking steps to gather information on the distribution and extent of sunbed use by young people, as mentioned in the Cancer Reform Strategy, copies of which have already been placed in the Library. A report is expected in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.765W.8/1">The retail model developed for community equipment met with overall approval from the sector. The outline business case was sufficiently robust to support developing the outline model to operational status. This is currently being undertaken through a shadow running process in the north west with local authority (LA) and health partners in Manchester, Oldham and Cheshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.8/2">The shadow running process demonstrated improvements in the user experience and efficiency of the service.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.8/3">Cheshire and Oldham have decided to implement the model locally. This confirms that, in their areas, the new prescription processes have been demonstrated to be effective and are capable of being scaled up to support full implementation of the retail model.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.8/4">The business case for a new model of delivery of wheelchair services is currently being considered by senior officials in the Department. At the present time we are unable to specify a timescale for any future decisions to be made and announced.</p>
	<p pid="b.765W.8/5">There are no current plans to issue guidance to LAs. LAs and health partnerships continue in their statutory duty to meet the needs of those individuals eligible for support. Retailers also continue to offer a range of services, including installation and personal advice, to those who self fund.</p>

	<p pid="b.773W.5/1">The Government have a number of ongoing work programmes, many operating in partnership with public and private sector stakeholders, to seek to combat all forms of fraud, including where computer systems are a factor in enabling fraudulent activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.773W.5/2">Government have allocated &pound;29 million over three years to implement the recommendations of the Fraud Review. This includes the creation of a National Fraud Strategic Authority, launched earlier this month; a new national lead force role for the city of London police; and a National Fraud Reporting Centre (NFRC), expected to go live in 2009, which will radically streamline the way that the public report fraud, including fraud committed over the internet, to the police. The NFRC will also equip law enforcement agencies with a powerful intelligence tool and help form the basis of better prevention advice and alerts to fraud threats for business and the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.773W.5/3">To help people and organisations protect themselves from crime which may involve an online element, the website <a href="http://www.getsafeonline.org">www.getsafeonline.org</a> was developed by the Government, police and industry. The website gives advice on how to stay safe online when shopping, banking or doing business over the internet, and how to protect computers and the personal information they contain. More general advice regarding identity fraud can be found on the website <a href="http://www.identitytheft.org.uk">www.identitytheft.org.uk</a> which was developed in partnership between Government, law enforcement and industry to provide advice to the public and business around combating identity theft and fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.773W.5/4">The Government are providing &pound;3.5 million over three years to create the Police Central e-crime Unit (PCeU). This will provide support to the police service in developing a structured response to online crime, and its initial focus will be on the area of fraud-related electronic crime, working with the NFRC to develop a response to reports on such matters. The PCeU will act as the central unit for the police on promotion of standards for training, procedure and response to e-crime. It will bring together forces, the National Police Improvement Agency and other groups to develop training and to coordinate activity to build up the skill levels within policing. Outside of this the Serious Organised Crime Agency will continue its ongoing work to tackle the international and serious organised crime groups operating on the internet, supporting the NFRC and PCeU where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.773W.5/5">Government continue to review and revise legislation to ensure that it is adequate to deal with modern ways of committing offences. The Fraud Act 2006 revised and updated legislation on fraud, including introducing an offence of fraud by false representation. This makes it an offence to commit any fraud by false representation in any form; it makes no difference if the representation is made to a machine or to a person, and there does not have to be any actual loss to a victim, it is merely enough to expose another to a risk of loss.</p>
	<p pid="b.773W.5/6">Ministers continue to have regular contact with the banking industry about crime reduction, including issues around online frauds.</p>

The Government are making good progress towards this target as there are already 22 SARCs in England and Wales. The Home Secretary's announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-07">7 October 2008</phrase> of the availability of &pound;1.6 million to help develop new SARCs and support existing ones will contribute further to the expansion of SARCs.</p>

	<p pid="b.779W.6/1">The children of asylum seekers have the same rights as all other children in the United Kingdom during the period of compulsory education. All 16 to 18-year-old asylum seekers are eligible for Learning and Skills Council (LSC) funding in respect of their attendance on a further education course in the same way as UK students.</p>
	<p pid="b.779W.6/2">Asylum seekers aged 19 or over are treated as UK students for the purpose of fees for further education where they have been legally in the UK for longer than six months pending consideration of their application for asylum or where they have failed in their claim but have been granted support under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. This follows the granting of concessions to enable asylum seekers to access LSC funding in certain circumstances, for example for courses teaching English for speakers of other languages. Otherwise they are treated as international students, and may be required to cover the full cost of their course. However an FE college or provider has discretion over the level of fee that they actually charge.</p>

However, universities have discretion over the level of fee that they actually charge. The Higher Education Refugees and Asylum Seekers network provides guidance on the detailed rules which apply.</p>

	<p pid="b.780W.0/1">Further Education colleges provide a broad range of services to their local communities, not just in education but in support of broader aims relating to economic development, cohesion and social mobility. Colleges draw most of their students from the local area and work in partnership with other local organisations to determine how their strengths, including their premises and facilities, can best meet their community's needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.780W.0/2">We are supporting them in this through record investment in buildings and equipment. Over the last 10 years, Government investment in the FE estate, including ICT, has totalled &pound;2.4 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.780W.0/3">The Learning and Skills Council is currently assessing the extent and nature of colleges' provision of wider community activities including the community's use of college facilities and will publish its findings in November. We will draw on these findings to identify good practice and to see what more might be done to support this aspect of colleges' work.</p>
	<p pid="b.780W.0/4">The DIUS consultation &quot;Informal Adult Learning - Shaping the Way Ahead&quot; identified the need for low cost, accessible learning venues as a key issue. DIUS will work with other Government Departments and local authorities to consider how access to a wide range of public spaces, including colleges, can be encouraged and supported to provide free or subsidised venues for book clubs, family history or other groups of people learning for pleasure.</p>
	<p pid="b.780W.0/5">Higher education institutions (HEIs) engage with the public in many ways, including providing access to sports facilities, museums, theatres and galleries; community volunteering by staff and students; and creating lifelong learning opportunities for a diverse body of learners. In 2006/07, over 110,000 people attended charged public lectures (and additionally 650,000 attended free events), and around 1,400,000 attended charged performance arts events organised by HEIs (and 412,000 attended free performance events). In addition, over 6,000 non-commercial partners, such as social, community and cultural organisations have benefited from the use of over &pound;38 million worth of HEI facilities and equipments over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="b.780W.0/6">The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has recently published the confirmed distribution for 2008-11 of nearly &pound;400 million to HEIs from the Higher Education Innovation Fund round 4 (HEIF 4), following approval of HEI strategies for its work to engage with social, cultural and community organisations, as well as businesses and public services (HEFCE Report 2008/34). An overview and assessment of these strategies is also available (HEFCE Report 2008/35).</p>

	<p pid="b.781W.2/1">Working with the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) we have supported the continuing enhancement of high quality teaching and learning in higher education (HE) through the core grant and a range of targeted initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.781W.2/2">In 1997 an independent body, the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA), was established to provide an integrated quality assurance service for UK HE. HEFCE has statutory responsibility for the quality assessment of HE in institutions that it funds, and it contracts with the QAA to fulfil this responsibility and to safeguard the public interest in sound standards of HE qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="b.781W.2/3">In addition to a programme of institutional audit, the QAA defines clear and explicit standards for HE, both for public information and as reference points for their quality assurance services. These include a framework for HE qualifications, subject benchmark statements, programme specifications, and the code of practice in HE.</p>
	<p pid="b.781W.2/4">We have encouraged the HE sector's introduction of the publication of a range of accurate and up to date information about each institution on the website <a href="http://www.unistats.ac.uk">www.unistats.ac.uk</a>. This includes the results of the National Student Survey (NSS) which asks final year students for views on the quality of their teaching and learning experience. The results serve to inform prospective students and promote continuous improvement in institutions. Since it started the NSS has shown a high level of consistency in relation to overall student satisfaction with the quality of their courses&mdash; around 80 per cent. from 2005 to 2008.</p>

	<p pid="b.782W.2/1">We are maintaining very good completion rates for first degrees with the latest statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showing that the UK ranks 3rd of the 27 countries reporting data in this area. This has been achieved and maintained during a period when higher education has been opened up to both increased numbers and a greater diversity of students.</p>
	<p pid="b.782W.2/2">However, the Government are not complacent and accept that there is more that we could do, which is why we welcomed the recommendations of the National Audit Office study and the follow-on Public Accounts Committee report on the retention of students in higher education.</p>
	<p pid="b.782W.2/3">The Higher Education Funding Council for England is taking forward these recommendations and working with the higher education sector to disseminate good practice and help higher education institutions learn from what works well elsewhere. HEFCE held regional workshops last spring to examine these issues and they are joint funding seven projects with the Paul Hamlyn Foundation over the next three years to inform better targeting of institutional support for students.</p>

	<p pid="b.792W.9/2">The Government are currently in the process of transposing the existing Annex VI (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) of MARPOL into UK law and will be following this legislation with the implementation of the EU Sulphur Content</p>
	<p pid="b.792W.9/3">of Liquid Fuels Directive.</p>
	<p pid="b.792W.9/4">These measures have been agreed internationally and regionally and establish standards for the sulphur content of marine fuels. MARPOL Annex VI applies to all vessels equally while the EC measure targets emissions in port and from vessels engaged in regular service between EC ports.</p>
	<p pid="b.792W.9/5">In implementing Annex VI, the Government have undertaken a series of consultations and sought to ensure that the measures are applied in a fair, transparent and equal manner across the maritime sector to ensure a level playing field for the industry. A further consultation on the EC Directive will be carried out in the spring of 2009.</p>
	<p pid="b.792W.9/6">Additionally the revisions to Annex VI of MARPOL have been developed as a result of work by an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) group of experts and take account of the cost and availability of fuel. The implementation of this will in due course be subject to UK consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.793W.2/2">Department for Transport officials are involved in regular discussions with officials from other member states and the European Commission on the issue of the sulphur content of marine fuels.</p>
	<p pid="b.793W.2/3">Recently there have been a series of both formal and informal experts meetings and other events hosted by the Commission considering emissions from shipping, notably in advance of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) negotiations on the revision of MARPOL Annex VI (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships). These discussions have focused around both the actual standards to be included in the revised Annex and the implications for the cost and supply of fuel.</p>
	<p pid="b.793W.2/4">The successful outcome at IMO on these revisions was in large part down to the work by EU member states to develop a compromise text that was agreed as being a significant advance on current standards while being financially and practically achievable by the international shipping community. Subsequent to this agreement member states have continued to coordinate on the issue in advance of implementation of the revised annex.</p>

	<p pid="b.800W.8/1">New academies are eligible for two types of start-up grants. Start-up grant (a) is for books, materials and equipment. It is based on the expected pupil capacity of the academy and most of the total grant is paid in the first year after opening, although smaller amounts are payable in later years if pupil numbers are initially below 90 per cent. of capacity. Its value depends on whether there is a predecessor school and whether the academy has a sixth form. The average awarded to academies opening in 2008/09 was &pound;873,601.</p>
	<p pid="b.800W.8/2">Start-up (b) grant is paid for two main purposes: to cover senior management overhead costs while an academy is building to capacity, and to meet transitional costs, for instance those arising while building work makes some facilities unusable, or meeting curriculum commitments for students of predecessor schools. It is mostly paid in the first two or three years after opening but will continue for longer if an academy has no predecessor. Because the grant (which is partly formulaic and partly assessed from bids) depends on the circumstances of each academy, the amounts awarded vary considerably. For academies opening in 2008/09, the average awarded has been &pound;969,104 (the median was &pound;780,335, with sums ranging from &pound;122,740 to &pound;3,203,252).</p>

	<p pid="b.801W.8/1">During 2006, 2007 and 2008 there have been 21 section five inspections of academies; none have been deemed to be making inadequate progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.801W.8/2">The year after each academy opens, Ofsted inspect and report on progress. Ofsted send a letter to the academy with a result of their monitoring visit which is published on their website. In the third year after opening, there is a full section 5 Ofsted inspection. During 2006, 2007 and 2008 there have been 27 monitoring visits paid to different academies. Of these, in 2007 St. Mark's C of E Academy was monitored by Ofsted who judged it was making inadequate progress in raising standards. Its progress was monitored again in 2008 and it was judged to be making inadequate progress though the significant changes in the academy's leadership were reported positively. The DCSF is working closely with governors to ensure good improvement is made before the next monitoring visit.</p>
	<p pid="b.801W.8/3">Stockley Academy was monitored in March 2008 and judged at that time to be making inadequate progress. However it was monitored again in late September and at the oral feedback the inspectors judged it was now making at least satisfactory progress. The written report will be available on the Ofsted website in the next two weeks.</p>

	<p pid="b.816W.0/1">The most recent Children in Need (CIN) census showed that approximately 120,000 children aged less than 11 years received services from social care in England during a census week in February 2005.

	<p pid="b.816W.3/1">Schools do not have to apply to the Department for Children, School and Families to become a trust or foundation school. A change of school category to foundation and the acquisition of a trust are 'prescribed alterations'. To make such a prescribed alteration, the governing body must publish statutory proposals in accordance with provisions set out in the Education and Inspections Act 2006 and regulations made under that Act. Since <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-25">25 May 2007</phrase>, proposals are decided by the governing body (or the schools adjudicator where proposals to acquire a trust have been referred by the local authority). There is no role for Ministers in the decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid="b.816W.3/2">To date, 106 schools (including 26 foundation schools) have acquired a trust under the provisions of the Education and Inspections Act 2006. In addition, 378 schools (including 53 foundation schools) are on the Trust and Foundation Schools Support programme where they have access to advice and guidance on the processes associated with acquiring a trust.</p>

	<p pid="b.823W.8/2">Research by the Community Development Finance Association suggests that about half the loans (by value) made by CDFIs are to social enterprises. In practice, however, some CDFIs such as Big Issue Invest or the Social Enterprise Loan Fund only lend to social enterprises.</p>
	<p pid="b.823W.8/3">The recent operational review of CITR, announced in the Government's Social Enterprise Action Plan, indicated that with most of the more active CDFIs engaged in financing only charitable or social enterprises, CITR has contributed to an improvement in the financing provision for social enterprises.</p>

	<p pid="b.825W.5/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what the latest estimate is of the number of individuals in the UK who own shares (225371).</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.5/4" class="indent">According to a survey carried out by the Office for National Statistics in 2006/07, 12% of people aged 16 or over in Great Britain held shares other than employee shares or share options and 5% held employee shares or share options. Applying these percentages to the mid-2006 population estimates suggests that 5.7 million people held shares other than employee shares or share options and 2.4 million people held employee shares or share options. These figures should not be added together to estimate the total number of people in Great Britain owning shares, as some individuals may own both types of share. The estimates do not include any indirect investment in shares through for example ISAs, unit trusts or pension funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.825W.5/5" class="indent">The proportions of individuals holding shares are based on data collected from the Household Assets Survey, which is a new longitudinal survey that collects information about the economic well being of households and individuals in Great Britain. The proportions were among statistics published in the interim report in January 2008, based on half the Wave 1 sample (16,000 households) and labelled as experimental statistics. Experimental statistics are in the testing phase arid not fully developed as they do not yet meet the rigorous quality standards of National Statistics.</p>

	<p pid="b.826W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question on what percentage of children in North Lincolnshire live in households where neither parent is in employment. (224948)</p>
	<p pid="b.826W.2/4" class="indent">Using the Annual Population Survey (APS) household dataset for the period January to December 2007, 14.7 per cent of children in North Lincolnshire lived in a workless household, which is a household where at least one person is of working age and no adults in the household are employed.</p>
	<p pid="b.826W.2/5" class="indent">As with any sample survey, estimates from the APS are subject to a margin of uncertainty as different samples give different results. This estimate is such that there is 95 per cent certainty that from all samples possible it will lie within the range 9.3 per cent to 20.2 per cent.</p>
