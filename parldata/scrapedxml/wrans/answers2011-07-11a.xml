Also shown is the number of dairy cattle on dairy holdings for England and Northamptonshire, along with UK milk production and milk yields to put the figures into context.</p>

The following table shows how the decline in the number of dairy cows has been offset by an increase in average herd size and milk yields. So while the number of dairy cows in England has fallen by 22% between 2001 and 2010, the level of milk production (at the UK level) has fallen only by 5%.</p>

	<p pid="a.22W.2/3">Rather it is for financial institutions to determine whether or not someone is a PEP, drawing on the definitions set out in the UK's Money Laundering Regulations 2007 and the global standards of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and taking account of available information about individuals' positions and activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.22W.2/4">Given the definition of PEPs, the Treasury expects that regulated businesses will have identified many of those subject to the Syria (Asset-Freezing) Regulations 2011 as PEPs and to have treated them accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.22W.2/5">It should be noted that identifying someone as a PEP does not automatically mean that financial institutions are unable to do business with that person. Rather it requires them to undertake enhanced due diligence before starting a business relationship and on an ongoing basis thereafter. Businesses must not start a relationship with a new customer unless they can satisfy themselves of the legitimacy of the customer, their funds and source of wealth.</p>

	<p pid="a.28W.3/1">The information is not available for all households, since there is no one source which provides comprehensive and universal child care costs. Child care costs are also highly variable.</p>
	<p pid="a.28W.3/2">In estimating current child care costs there are a number of different sources: the most relevant of which is administrative data for the child care element of working tax credits (see details following) but this does not give a complete picture as it does not cover all households. There is a survey of parents conducted for the Department for Education in England, but it does not allow us to accurately estimate the numbers of households with weekly child care costs over these amounts.<sup>(1)</sup> No administrative data are collected for the other two main potential sources of information, which are those receiving employer-supported child care, and those whose child care expenditure is disregarded in housing benefit and council tax benefit.</p>

	<p pid="a.29W.0/2">The modelling is adjusted to take account of imperfect take-up using microsimulation techniques. This is important as we expect take-up of entitlements to rise under universal credit due to the increased simplicity and integrated nature of the new benefit.</p>

The key assumptions being that those currently taking up some but not all of their entitlements will take-up all of the universal credit, while around half of those not taking up any of their current entitlements do so under the new system. We assume that in some cases take-up will remain unchanged, for example those people that we consider are currently not satisfying the requirements of the conditionality regime.</p>

These were developed in collaboration with an independent group of specialists in health, social care and disability. We intend that the priority in the benefit should go to those individuals who are least able to live independent lives and so are proposing to assess individuals&#8217; ability to carry out a range of key everyday activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.30W.8/3">Planning and buying food and drink;</p>

	<p pid="a.30W.8/5">Taking nutrition;</p>

	<p pid="a.30W.8/13">Moving around.</p>
	<p pid="a.30W.8/14">These activities have been chosen to provide a more holistic assessment of the impact of disability that the current DLA criteria, considering the impact of a more comprehensive range of impairment types. For example, the introduction of communication is a significant departure from DLA and one which will ensure we better take into account the effect of impairments of hearing, speech and language comprehension.</p>
	<p pid="a.30W.8/15">We are currently carrying out an informal consultation and have already met with over 60 disability organisations to discuss the criteria, how they will work and how they might be improved. We are also testing the assessment, to enable us to better understand its likely impact, by carrying out around 900 sample assessments over the summer. Our aim is to provide a further draft of the assessment criteria and regulations in the autumn, building on the testing and the feedback from disability organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.34W.1/1">The benefit cap will mean that people on benefit will face choices about housing costs similar to those faced by people in work. But it will not necessarily mean that they will need to move from their home. Even within the limits of this cap, households will still be able to receive significant amounts of financial assistance from state welfare payments and if a member of the household moves into work and becomes eligible for working tax credit they will be exempt from the impacts of the cap.</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.1/2">There is a range of help local authorities can offer to households at risk of becoming homeless including the provision of discretionary housing payments. We have already made an additional &#163;190 million available over the spending review period for this purpose as a result of the changes we have made to housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.34W.1/3">The Government published their impact assessment of the benefit cap in February alongside the introduction of the Welfare Reform Bill. This made clear that it is not possible to estimate the number of additional homelessness applications that might arise as a consequence of the overall benefit cap because this would have to be based on behavioural changes. The impact assessment can be found via the following link:</p>

	<p pid="a.38W.5/13">The size of sites was another calculation. The recognised optimum site size (for sites of the Mansfield Benefit Centre type) is between 200 and 500 seats. There are just 117 staff in post at Mansfield Benefit Centre.</p>

	<p pid="a.40W.2/4">The challenge, for Jobcentre Plus is to save &#163;170 million through its overall estates rationalisation programme. It is anticipated that the decision to close Mansfield Benefit Centre and 21 other Benefit and Contact Centres will save &#163;14 million by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.40W.2/5">It is not always possible to be specific about the savings that will be realised through the closure of individual sites. Mansfield Benefit Centre is a prime example as it is co-located with a Jobcentre that is not set to close. Typically when Jobcentre Plus relinquishes a floor of a building it will negotiate with estate provider Telereal Trillium to achieve a saving or it will explore the inward co-location potential for new revenue.</p>

	<p pid="a.42W.3/1">Jobcentre Plus advisers are the gateway to the information and support available for customers. The range of leaflets provided by the Department aims to provide broad information on the main benefits and services available. The leaflets are kept as concise as possible and written in plain English so that most people can quickly find what they want and understand the information. The leaflets cannot attempt to provide information on all circumstances. As the help provided to jobseekers is tailored to meet individual needs and depends upon a number of factors, it is impossible to provide concise and accurate information on all the help available. For a jobseeker this information would be provided by a member of staff in Jobcentre Plus. Information on travel to interview support is available in the leaflet &#8216;Help with job interviews&#8217;, DWP 1016, and this is available on request in Jobcentre Plus offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.42W.3/2">The Department has recently revised the main information leaflet suite and now has six brief signposting leaflets covering the main life events such as finding a job. People requiring more information can either go online to Directgov or ask at a Jobcentre Plus office for a further leaflet. This approach aims to encourage people to go online for information and reduce the overall cost of producing departmental leaflets.</p>

Joint Doctrine Note 2/11 (JDN 2/11) recognises that we must continue to observe these high standards when employing new technology, including Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), to achieve our defence objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.52W.0/2">As stated in its preface, JDN 2/11 seeks to consider how UAS may contribute to the UK's future defence and security needs. Its purpose is to identify the issues that should be addressed if such systems are to be successfully developed and integrated into future operations. It does not describe agreed policy but rather seeks to energise debate within the UK to inform policy development; the Ministry of Defence welcomes and encourages that debate and the opportunity to contribute fully to it.</p>

This was investigated and resolved at the time (with no suggestion of internal fraud) but with the passage of time preparing these figures for publication could be accomplished only at disproportionate cost as it would involve checking over 4,000 lines of data.</p>

This prevents the publication of information that would identify, or would tend to identify, an individual as being subject to a control order. Any changes to the number of individuals who have been subject to a control order subsequent to being acquitted of any terrorism offences, together with information in the public domain regarding the outcome of criminal trials, would tend to breach the court imposed anonymity order.

	<p pid="a.74W.2/1">The table shows, for the years 2001 to 2010, the number of defendants recorded on the Police National Computer (PNC) in England and Wales as having received at least one conviction, caution, reprimand or warning during the year, and the number of these who were recorded as having committed at least one offence while on bail during the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.74W.2/2">These figures have been drawn from the police's administrative IT system, the PNC, which, as with any large scale recording system, is subject to possible errors with data entry and processing. In particular the recording of information on whether or not the offence was committed while the offender was on bail is known to be incomplete. This is because the police have available to them a number of ways of recording the bail status of an offender of which the &#8216;offence committed on bail&#8217; field on the PNC is one. For operational purposes forces make differing use of these various sources and as a result figures derived purely from the PNC do not provide a complete picture of these offences; changes over time in these data may not represent real changes in offending while on bail.</p>

	<p pid="a.79W.5/1">Sharia councils are not part of the justice system of England and Wales and the Government have made it clear that they have no intention of making any change to that position.</p>
	<p pid="a.79W.5/2">Provided an activity prescribed by sharia law does not contravene the law of England and Wales, there is nothing that prevents people living by sharia principles. People are free to submit a dispute to a sharia council if they wish to do so and can if they wish formalise any agreement made by asking a court in England and Wales to reflect this in an order made with the consent of the parties. Any member of the community is also free to submit the case to a court in England and Wales if they wish for a decision to be made by the court.</p>
	<p pid="a.79W.5/3">As sharia councils are not part of the justice system the Government do not collate or hold any information on sharia councils or the gender breakdown within them. The previous Government did, however, commission an exploratory study of sharia councils in England with respect to family law. This identified a number of challenges to undertaking robust research in this area. The study was therefore limited and adds little to the evidence base. In particular, the findings cannot be regarded as a representative assessment of the operation of sharia councils. Following expert peer review of the draft report, the Ministry of Justice decided not to publish the findings.</p>

	<p pid="a.80W.3/1">The table shows, for the years 2008 to 2010, the number of offences recorded on the Police National Computer (PNC) in England and Wales that resulted in a conviction, caution, reprimand or warning and the number of these that were recorded as being committed while the offender was on bail. The data does not enable us to distinguish between police bail and court bail.</p>
	<p pid="a.80W.3/2">These figures have been drawn from the police's administrative IT system, the PNC, which, as with any large scale recording system, is subject to possible errors with data entry and processing. In particular the recording of information on whether or not the offence was committed while the offender was on bail is known to be incomplete. This is because the police have available to them a number of ways of recording the bail status of an offender of which the &#8216;offence committed on bail&#8217; field on the PNC is one. For operational purposes forces make differing use of these various sources and as a result figures derived purely from the PNC do not provide a complete picture of these offences; changes over time in these data may not represent real changes in offending while on bail.</p>

	<p pid="a.86W.2/4">Decisions taken by LSCBs on whether the criteria to undertake SCRs have been met are normally taken within one month of a case coming to the attention of the LSCB chair. However, in practice decisions may take longer and may be revisited in light of additional information, such as new medical evidence or the outcome of a coroner's inquest, which may subsequently become available. Therefore, there may be variations in the data included in this table over time.</p>

These are pupils whose education is the financial responsibility of the local authority, using either the schools budget or the schools budget with contributions from the wider local authority budget, such as another part of the children's services budget, the health authority or another local authority. The alternative provider may be situated either within or outside the local authority area.</p>

	<p pid="a.88W.8/4">(a) Pupils receiving home tuition for whom the local authority is financially responsible, including those requiring SEN support;</p>

	<p pid="a.88W.8/6">(c) Pupils of compulsory school age, not registered at a school, being educated at FE colleges and for whom the local authority is financially responsible, and asylum seekers of compulsory school age attending FE colleges or with voluntary sector providers;</p>

	<p pid="a.88W.8/8">(e) Pupils attending a special school not maintained by a local authority for whom the local authority pays the fees;</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.8/9">(f) Pupils held in a unit for their own safety, where the authority is paying for the education, although the unit is in another authority;</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.8/10">(g) Pupils not on a school roll elsewhere and held at a detention centre where the local authority is fully financially responsible for the pupil; and</p>

	<p pid="a.90W.11/1">There are no national requirements placed on schools or parents to provide identifying documentation when registering a child at a school. However, in applying for a place at a state-funded primary school, parents will be asked by the local authority to complete a common application form allowing them to state a minimum of three preferences. In completing that form parents must provide their name and address, and any documentary evidence in support, as well as the name, address and date of birth of the child. In some case, the local authority will need to ask for supplementary information in order to process applications. If they do so, they must only use supplementary information forms that request information that has a direct bearing on decisions about over-subscription criteria. Once a place has been offered, admission authorities may ask for proof of date of birth.</p>

Our priority for its introduction has been to make sure that funding for the premium is simple and transparent so that schools know how it is calculated and can work out how much they will receive. Mainstream schools with children whose parents are in the armed forces will benefit from the service premium and will receive in 2011-12 &#163;200 for every pupil recorded as a service child on the January 2011 school census. We will consider carefully whether the service premium could be extended to pupils whose parents have died in service in the armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.94W.3/4">Your recent parliamentary question has been passed to Her Majesty's Chief Inspector for response. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector is currently on leave, and I am replying on her behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.3/5">Since 2005, maintained school inspections have been carried out under section 5 of the Education Act 2005. Ofsted records all judgements made by inspectors in section 5 inspections/ including the judgement for overall effectiveness of the school.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.3/6">Maintained schools inspected under section 5 include nursery, primary, secondary (including academies and city technology colleges), special schools and pupil referral units.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.3/7">Tables A to E below show the number of maintained schools judged outstanding, good, satisfactory and inadequate for overall effectiveness at their section 5 inspection during the academic years 2005/06 to 2009/10 inclusive in South Lakeland District and England.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.3/8">In September 2009, Ofsted implemented a policy of more proportionate inspection using risk assessment and deliberately set out to inspect a greater proportion of previously satisfactory or inadequate schools each year and a smaller proportion of previously good or outstanding schools. This led to a skew in the sample of schools inspected and means that comparisons between years should be treated with caution as some differences are due to the different sample of schools inspected during the different periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.94W.3/9">Statistics covering the outcomes of all inspections carried out in each academic year since 2005/06 can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.96W.12/1">Deaths from air pollution are not recorded as a specific cause. However, the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants estimated<sup>(1)</sup> on the basis of 2008 data, that fine particulate air pollution (measured as PM2.5) had an effect on the mortality of the United Kingdom population equivalent to 29,000 deaths in 2008. However, the Committee considered it very unlikely that this represents the number of individuals affected. Instead it speculated that air pollution, acting together with other factors, may have made some smaller contribution to the earlier deaths of up to 200,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.96W.12/2">Estimates have not been made on a year-by-year basis, however, in years close to 2008 that are likely to be similar to 2008, in terms of both PM2.5 levels and population characteristics, the effect on mortality would be similar to that calculated for 2008.</p>

	<p pid="a.99W.0/1">&#8216;Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer&#8217;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-12">12 January</phrase>, sets out how the Government will introduce human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as triage for women with mild or borderline cervical screening test results and HPV as a test of cure for treated women. The Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2011-12 states that commissioners should work with their local services and NHS Cancer Screening Programmes (NHS CSP) to implement HPV testing as triage for women with mild or borderline results, leading to a more patient-centred service and major cost savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.0/2">The current intention is that, subject to meeting certain criteria, local cervical screening programmes will implement HPV triage in 2011-12 and HPV test of cure in 2012-13. Implementing both improvements in the same year would risk the quality and safety of the current programme and put an unnecessary burden on colposcopy services.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.0/3">The Department is currently preparing advice to the national health service that will be issued shortly, alongside implementation guidance from NHS CSP. In autumn 2011, NHS Supply Chain will publish a framework agreement on the purchasing of the five HPV testing kits that are currently available. While services will not be able to implement HPV testing as triage until the framework agreement is published, they will be able to put all necessary plans in place so that, as soon as the agreement becomes available, they will be able to make decisions and place orders without delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.0/4">It is not possible to state the exact number of tests that will take place in 2011-12 and 2012-13. As a guide, around 200,000 women a year have mild or borderline screening test results. There are currently around 500,000 women on annual 10-year follow-up following previous treatment, but this is expected to reduce to around 100,000 a year once these women have been subject to a test of cure in 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.0/5">Funding for implementation has been made available for 2011-12 and 2012-13 and will be managed by NHS CSP. We expect all women in England to be benefiting from HPV triage and test of cure from 2013-14, when we also expect savings of up to &#163;16 million per year to be made from this new policy, as set out in the impact assessment we published alongside the new cancer strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.0/6">Subject to the consultation on &#8216;Healthy Lives, Healthy People&#8217;, Public Health England (PHE) will have responsibility for national elements of the cancer screening programmes. PHE will fund the NHS Commissioning Board annually to commission local elements of screening programmes on behalf of PHE.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.0/7">The results of the HPV sentinel site implementation project will be published in due course, once associated papers have appeared in peer reviewed journals.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.0/8">Regarding the future of cervical screening, the independent Advisory Committee on Cervical Screening (ACCS) is advising on the introduction of HPV Testing as Primary Screening (HPVTaPS). Working groups have been established to take forward work in three areas:</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.0/9">work force requirements and supporting transition;</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.0/10">protocols and algorithms for testing; and</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.0/11">demonstrating the economies and benefits to women of HPVTaPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.99W.0/12">The working groups are due to report to the ACCS at its meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-24">24 November 2011</phrase>, where the piloting of HPVTaPS will be considered.</p>

	<p pid="a.100W.8/3">The NHS Health Check programme is for people in England aged between 40 and 74. It assesses people's risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease and diabetes and supports people to reduce or manage that risk through individually tailored lifestyle advice and support, and appropriate follow up. In doing so, it will help ensure greater focus on public health and the prevention of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and kidney disease. This programme has the potential to prevent over 4,000 people a year from developing type 2 diabetes and detect at least 20,000 case of diabetes and kidney disease earlier.</p>

	<p pid="a.106W.2/1">Monthly reporting of progress with eliminating mixed-sex accommodation (MSA) guidance was introduced in December 2010. Before this, there were no accurate data on how many patients suffered the indignity of sharing with someone of the opposite sex. Now, hospitals providing national health service-funded care report all breaches of MSA sleeping guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.2/2">Progress has been excellent, with reported breaches nationally falling by 83% between December 2010 and May 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.106W.2/3">Alongside the absolute number of breaches, an MSA breach rate is published to enable comparison between organisations. This is the number of breaches per 1,000 finished consultant episodes.</p>

That is why we have invested &#163;150 million in the NHS this year to support re-ablement, which will help people recover their independence after a spell in hospital.</p>

	<p pid="a.113W.3/1">No one should be made to stay in hospital longer than is necessary. The national health service and social care must work together to ensure people have the support they need on leaving hospital. Some patients need particular support after a spell in hospital to settle back into their homes, recover their strength and regain their independence. The coalition Government have recently increased the level of investment made available to local health and care services to spend on front line services and helping people return to their homes after a spell in hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.113W.3/2">The spending review recognised the importance of social care in protecting the most vulnerable in society. In recognition of the pressures on the social care system in a challenging local government settlement, the coalition Government have allocated an additional &#163;2 billion by 2014-15 to support the delivery of social care. This means, with an ambitious programme of efficiency, that there is enough funding available both to protect people's access to services and deliver new approaches to improve quality and outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.113W.3/3">As part of this funding, this year funding of &#163;150 million has been made available for re-ablement and &#163;648 million for social care spend that benefits the NHS which could help to reduce the level of delayed discharges. The re-ablement money will help people to leave hospital more quickly, get settled back at home with the support they need, and to prevent unnecessary admissions to hospital.</p>

	<p pid="a.114W.2/1">Subject to the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill, general practitioners (GPs) will be given real responsibility to ensure that commissioning decisions are underpinned by clinical insight and knowledge of local healthcare needs. GPs, in partnership with other local healthcare professionals such as therapists and community nurses, are best placed to understand the speech, language and communication health needs of local populations and how to work with their local populations to design services that meet those needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.114W.2/2">Clinical commissioning groups will work with elected councillors, local authority commissioners and representatives of patients and the public through health and wellbeing boards to develop a comprehensive analysis of health and social care needs in each local area, and to translate these into action through the joint health and wellbeing strategy and their own commissioning plans. Health and wellbeing boards will promote joined up commissioning that will support integrated provision of services across health and social care. This should mean that groups such as users of speech, language and communication services experience health and care services that are better joined up and better meet their needs as individuals.</p>

FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. <sup>(2)</sup> Primary diagnosis The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital. <sup>(3)</sup> Stroke It should be noted that the ICD-10 codes for Stroke are: I60 Subarachnoid haemorrhage I61 Intracerebral haemorrhage I62 Other nontraumatic intracranial haemorrhage I63 Cerebral infarction I64 Stroke not specified as haemorrhage or infarction <sup>(4)</sup> Emergency admission via A&amp;E The method of admission code identifies how the patient was admitted to hospital. The following admission methods were used to classify an admission as being an emergency via A&amp;E: 21 = Emergency: via A&amp;E services, including the casualty department of the provider 28 = Emergency: other means, including patients who arrive via the A&amp;E department of another healthcare provider). Data to be based on in-patients rather than A&amp;E universe <sup>(5)</sup> Provisional data The data is provisional and may be incomplete or contain errors for which no adjustments have yet been made. Counts produced from provisional data are likely to be lower than those generated for the same period in the final dataset. This shortfall will be most pronounced in the final month of the latest period, ie November from the (month 9) April to November extract. It is also probable that clinical data are not complete, which may in particular affect the last two months of any given period. There may also be errors due to coding inconsistencies that have not yet been investigated and corrected. <sup>(6)</sup> Assessing growth through time HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data. <i>Note:</i> Data quality HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i>Source:</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES); Outpatients, The NHS Information Centre for health and social care</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.121W.2/1">As of March 2011 we were aware of 2,076 British nationals in detention overseas, a figure which includes individuals detained at all stages of the legal process. We are unable to estimate how many of those have been detained without charge in individual foreign countries. Estimating this figure, and how long they have been detained in each case, would prove difficult and incur disproportionate cost. We aim to contact British nationals, depending on local circumstances, within 24 hours of being told of their arrest or detention. We will consider approaching the local authorities if a British national is not treated in line with internationally-accepted standards, including if their trial is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases.</p>

	<p pid="a.123W.3/1">The FCO treats any allegation of mistreatment of domestic workers in diplomatic households very seriously. The police investigate allegations that the law has been broken by persons entitled to immunity and report the results to the FCO. When an allegation is brought to our attention by the police, we liaise as necessary with the relevant diplomatic mission and the UK Border Agency to work for an appropriate response. In the case of an allegation of mistreatment requiring further investigation by the police, the FCO will request a waiver of the diplomat's immunity from the diplomatic mission concerned on behalf of the police. Failure to provide a waiver may result in a request to the mission for withdrawal of the diplomat. In 2010 there were two cases involving allegations of mistreatment of a domestic worker in a diplomatic household.</p>

	<p pid="a.124W.6/1">There are no changes envisaged to the number of staff employed in our high commission in the Gambia as a result of the closure of bilateral aid programmes from the UK. DFID had contracted a locally engaged officer to help oversee the winding down of DFID's Gambia bilateral programme. Their contract ended in March 2011 and DFID has no plans to renew the contract. As with all our posts, we keep staffing levels under regular review. The UK continues to invest substantially in the Gambia through a variety of programmes delivered through our high commission, totalling over &#163;120,000. Development support to the Gambia also continues through our contributions to multilateral organisations such as the European Union. For 2008-09 the figure for attributed UK aid to the Gambia through multilateral organisations was &#163;923,000.</p>

Although I did not raise Ms Gutteridge's case on that occasion, I raised it with Prime Minister Odinga during his recent visit to London in July. The UK Government have taken her case very seriously and raised it with the Kenyan authorities on a number of occasions since her deportation. In particular, we have raised concerns that her deportation was in response to legitimate work on human rights issues related to terrorism suspects transferred to Uganda, rather than on grounds relating to counter-terrorism. We have also publicly and privately raised concerns about allegations of rendition, which I know is a particular focus of the work she was involved with.</p>

We have also been clear that actions by both Israel and Hamas have contributed to this situation. Working closely with the EU and Quartet, we continue to call on Israel to ease restrictions on access and enable a return to economic normality. During my recent visit to the region, I explained the risks to Israel from the current situation in Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.129W.2/3">Israel's decision to move from a list of 120 permitted goods to a list of specific prohibited items was a positive step. However there has been no fundamental change in the crossings regime and economic stagnation and de-development in Gaza remain the norm. We are clear that more needs to be done, particularly to enable exports, accelerate key imports for reconstruction and ensure free movement of people. Without economic growth in Gaza, there is a risk of fostering a more broadly radicalised environment. An improved economy and a resurgence of Gaza's pragmatic business fraternity are not only essential for the people of Gaza, but are also firmly in Israel's security interests.</p>

The Government believe that it is prison space rather than court capacity which remains the key capacity constraint, which an extraterritorial court would not solve.

	<p pid="a.143W.2/3">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what recent estimate has been made of the number of job vacancies available in (a) England, (b) the West Midlands and (c) Dudley borough in each of the last 12 months for which figures are available.

This data only includes job vacancies notified to Jobcentre Plus and consequently is inconsistent with the UK estimates from the Vacancy Survey, however geographical breakdowns of this data are available. Currently Jobcentre Plus vacancies account for around half of the total number of vacancies as reported by the Vacancy Survey.</p>

	<p pid="a.150W.5/1">The Department published an updated impact assessments for the Smart Meter Programme in March 2011. These estimate that over the next 20 years, the rollout of smart meters will deliver &#163;7.3 billion net benefits to consumers, energy suppliers and networks. The benefits include enabling consumer behaviour change, revolutionising industry processes, improving customer service and facilitating smart grids. By 2020, we expect the average domestic consumer, with both electricity and gas, to save an average &#163;23 per year on their energy bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.150W.5/2">The updated impact assessments were published alongside the Government's consultation on our Smart Meter Prospectus in which we set out the strategy, plans and timetable for rollout. Under these plans we expect to see completion of the rollout by 2019, at least one year ahead of previously published plans.</p>

This will result in a clear strategy by the end of this year which maps out the numbers and mix of skills they need in the medium to long term, how they intend putting these in place and what resources are available to enable them to implement the strategy. The UK has committed to train at least 2,500 health workers to 2014 and will work closely with the Ministry of Health and non-governmental partners to ensure UK resources are targeted at the priority skills needed.</p>

Emergency humanitarian co-ordination meetings have taken place on a regular basis in Khartoum and Juba. At present, lack of access to the conflict affected areas and populations hinders accurate humanitarian needs assessment by humanitarian personnel. Though the uncertainty about SAF intentions has forced a further withdrawal, NGOs and UN are ready to respond once security and access allows. We are working with the United Nations to ensure that if security and access is granted, assistance will reach these displaced civilians. The UN has reserves of both shelter and food for such situations. As well as its ongoing support to the Common Humanitarian Fund, the UK has made an additional &#163;10 million available for contingency planning to respond to any emergencies that are linked to southern secession.</p>

	<p pid="a.171W.2/3">The Specification of Apprenticeships Standards in England (SASE), introduced in March 2011, sets out the requirements for apprenticeships and the NAS are working closely with sector skills councils, colleges and providers to manage its implementation. While there is no set minimum duration for an apprenticeship, as it depends on the apprentice's individual abilities and prior experience, we would generally expect an intermediate level apprenticeship to take about one year to complete. This will allow the apprentice not only to achieve the relevant qualifications, but also to demonstrate their competence in the job role.</p>
	<p pid="a.171W.2/4">Where a current delivery model falls short of the SASE, the Skills Funding Agency will work with the training provider or college to support them to change their delivery model to one that fully meets the requirements. Where the delivery model cannot be adapted NAS and the agency we will remove our support for the apprenticeship programme and cease funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.173W.2/1">The Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) was introduced in January 2009, with a broader eligibility than the Small Firms Loan Guarantee (SFLG) which it replaced. It has assisted 15,000 businesses who have been offered a total of &#163;1.5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.2/2">EFG supports loans to viable businesses with an annual turnover of up to &#163;25 million seeking loans between &#163;1,000 and &#163;1 million, and is available to businesses in most business sectors. However, EFG is subject to certain sector restrictions arising from the EU de minimis State Aid rules, the Industrial Development Act 1982 (which provides the statutory basis for EFG) and also for national policy reasons. A list of the main sector restrictions is provided on the EFG Business Sectors page of the BIS website.</p>
	<p pid="a.173W.2/3">The operation of the EFG is kept under review, but at this time, we have no plans to change its eligibility criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.177W.0/11">The Government currently provide 50% fee remission for all learners in England participating in ESOL who are eligible for public funded skills provision. Those on income based-benefits are eligible for full fee remission.</p>
	<p pid="a.177W.0/12">From August 2011, where English language skills have been identified as a barrier to entering employment, full Government funding will be provided for ESOL to unemployed people in receipt of jobseekers allowance or in the employment and support allowance (Work-Related Activity) Group. We will also continue to pay 50% of ESOL course fees for people who are settled here. We will no longer fund ESOL courses delivered in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.177W.0/13">This Department does not make estimates of the demand for courses. Further education (FE) colleges and training providers are responsible for meeting the needs of their local community, and increased freedoms and flexibilities that we have introduced will help them respond and determine within their funding where this is prioritised.</p>
	<p pid="a.177W.0/14">An assessment of how the changes announced in Skills for Sustainable Growth may affect ESOL learners is currently being carried out by this Department. I expect to be able to publish this before summer recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.177W.0/15">We do not directly record what type of benefits people are receiving when they take up training. We do, however, collect information on why a learner has received fee remission for any learning they undertake. From these data we can provide some information on claimants but, this should be used with caution given it does not provide an accurate picture of the full range of benefit entitlements that a person has. Using the fees waived field in the individual learner record we can say for the 2009/10 academic year that 4,800 ESOL enrolments for adult (19+) learners in Leicester local education authority and 1,700 ESOL enrolments for adult (19+) learners in Leicester South constituency received fee remission as the learner was in receipt of an income-related benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.177W.0/16">This Department does not make estimates of the effect of policy changes on FE jobs. As autonomous bodies, it is for FE colleges and training providers to make staffing decisions based on their business need.</p>

	<p pid="a.178W.3/1">Since the publication of &#8220;Skills for Sustainable Growth&#8221;, a large number of organisations and individuals have made representations to this Department about the impact of our proposals for English for speakers of other languages (ESOL). Between <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-31">31 May</phrase>, over 1,200 pieces of correspondence were received, and the Minister for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40547" name="John Hayes">the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr Hayes)</phrase>, discussed ESOL in person with a number of hon. Members, further education (FE) bodies and interested groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.178W.3/2">An assessment of the impact of the changes announced in &#8220;Skills for Sustainable Growth&#8221; on ESOL learners was agreed in principle in November 2010 and formally commissioned in February 2011. The assessment will be published before the summer recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.178W.3/3">This Department has made no estimate of the effect of policy changes on employment in the FE sector since, as autonomous bodies, it is for FE colleges and other training providers to make staffing decisions based on their business needs. Neither has this Department estimated the demand for specific courses. National Statistics on FE participation and achievement are published quarterly.</p>
	<p pid="a.178W.3/4">Likewise, this Department has made no specific assessment of the impact on school children of their parents' access to ESOL courses and has not undertaken any research into household income or the level of disposable income available to families with ESOL needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.178W.3/5">Attitudes and views from both learners and non-learners were, however, examined by the 2005 National Adult Learners Survey. This showed that difficulty in paying course fees was only cited by 21% of respondents (21% of learners and 18% of non-learners) as an obstacle to learning.</p>
	<p pid="a.178W.3/6">Analysis of the income levels of Level 2 and Level 3 learners in the FE sector was also undertaken using data drawn from the Labour Force Survey, Apprenticeship Pay Survey and the Prior Qualifications Survey. For work-based learning, around two-thirds of learners were in the bottom two income quintiles (ie earning below &#163;17,000 per year), and for college-based learning around four-fifths of those who were working were in the bottom two income quintiles. The analysis did not explicitly cover either Skills for Life (SfL) or ESOL learners, as it was done to assess the impact of changes to age and qualification-related entitlements which were announced in the November 2010 Skills for Sustainable Growth and Investing in Skills for Sustainable Growth. We are currently conducting a new survey of incomes of FE sector learners which will include SfL and ESOL learners. Results from this survey should be available by the end of this year.</p>

The guidance set out significantly increased expectations for the priority that institutions should give to fair access and widening participation.

	<p pid="a.187W.2/11">The Government have been very clear about the importance of widening participation and improving fair access in higher education. We are establishing a new framework, with increased responsibility on universities to widen participation; and greater Government investment in improving attainment and access for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Higher education Institutions (HEIs) will deliver a range of outreach activities as part of their access agreements, agreed with the Office for Fair Access, and their widening participation strategic assessments, agreed with the Higher Education Funding Council for England.</p>
	<p pid="a.187W.2/12">The future role of the current Widening Participation Allocation will be considered as part of HEFCE's consultation on the use of the teaching grant to ensure that it supports successful widening participation activity in the future, and the Government have already made clear that this remains a priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.187W.2/13">The Government are investing in the new National Scholarship programme, providing funding for the programme with &#163;50 million in the first year (2012/13), rising to &#163;100 million in 2013/14 and &#163;150 million a year from 2014/15. This funding will be allocated by HEFCE. Institutions will be expected to match fund Government's contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.187W.2/14">In addition, every institution that intends to charge more than &#163;6,000 for its courses must have an Access Agreement approved by the Director of Fair Access. Access Agreements are plans drawn up by institutions setting out how they will promote access to higher education from under-represented groups and the investment they will make in outreach and other access activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.191W.2/4">For any university wanting to charge more than &#163;6,000, the Government issued, in February, new and strengthened guidance to the director of fair access asking the director to review access agreements annually rather than every five years as at present.</p>

	<p pid="a.199W.2/2">HS2 would enable the redevelopment of Euston station, which would likely be necessary regardless of whether HS2 proceeds. The redevelopment and expansion of the station, including 10 HS2 platforms, a new ground-level concourse serving the whole station, the reconfiguration and expansion of the existing inadequate London Underground ticket hall and a new bus interchange would cost &#163;1.01 billion to construct. This figure excludes HS2 costs (e.g. design and project management), compensation costs, and risk and optimism bias. However, the Government anticipate that a considerable proportion of this cost could be recouped from at-station commercial and residential development. Information on the property and other impacts of the station redevelopment are set out in the Appraisal of Sustainability, available at:</p>
	<p pid="a.199W.2/3"><a href="http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/library/doc">http://highspeedrail.dft.gov.uk/library/doc</a>uments</p>
	<p pid="a.199W.2/4">Rail Package 2 would require the provision of three additional platforms at Euston, which has been costed at &#163;62 million, excluding on-costs, compensation, and any improvements to London Underground interfaces. This work would be conducted within the existing station footprint. It would be likely to cause significant disruption to passengers as there would be no scope to commission new platforms ahead of closing existing platforms for redevelopment. In addition, as the Euston works necessary for Rail Package 2 have not been developed to the same level of detail as the HS2 proposals, further technical work would be necessary to consider whether the proposals would not also require the widening and remodelling of the station throat and the London Underground interfaces.</p>
