Prior to this date the Discrimination Law Review Project was the responsibility of the women and equality unit in the Department of Communities and Local Government. Since 2005, Ministers for women and equality have met the Children's Rights Alliance for England on two occasions; one of those meetings was attended by a group of young people. In late 2006, the women and equality unit hosted a roundtable discussion on children and young people, which was attended by non-governmental organisations and the children's commissioners for England and Scotland. During the consultation period for the Equality Bill, the Children's Rights Alliance for England organised a consultation event on behalf of the women and equality unit. Officials also met the Children's Rights Alliance for England in August 2007 and the children's commissioners for England and Scotland in March 2008.</p>

A summary of the evidence reviewed will be published later in 2008. In the letter the Commission set out a programme of small projects that it would undertake to help establish a better understanding of the evidence. Among other things it will set up an expert panel and work with the gambling industry to explore player data, with a view to understanding how this data can be used in future research. The Commission will report to my Department again in June 2009 on progress with this programme of work.</p>

	<p pid="c.2310W.0/3">In countries with strong commitments to development, we focus on supporting the implementation of comprehensive country-led HIV and AIDS strategies, directly funding governments and working with civil society partners and donor agencies. In more fragile states, where governments are less effective, we provide technical support to strengthen government capacity as well as direct support for service delivery by civil society organisations.</p>

	<p pid="c.2310W.3/1">The Department for International Development (DFID) provides flexible funding to back national plans and priorities and to help strengthen health systems as a whole. UK Government health spend in developing countries was &pound;750 million in 2006-07. Addressing the shortage of health workers in these countries is a high priority for DFID. For example, in Ethiopia DFID is contributing to the massive scale-up of community health workers&mdash;from fewer that 3,000 in 2004 to 24,000 now and 30,000 by 2009. In Malawi, DFID is contributing to the Emergency Human Resources Programme, which aims to double the number of nurses and triple the number of doctors. DFID has also provided &pound;1 million to the Global Health Workforce Alliance from 2007-09.</p>
	<p pid="c.2310W.3/2">In &quot;Achieving Universal Access&mdash;the UK's Strategy for Halting and Reversing the Spread of HIV in the Developing World&quot; the Government have committed &pound;6 billion to strengthen health systems and services over seven years to 2015 in poor countries where HIV and AIDS are a major problem. We have also committed &pound;1 billion to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria by 2015.

DFID has also participated in joint UK Government scenario planning exercises in Kosovo and Iraq. Scenario and contingency planning has helped DFID develop a better, shared understanding of context within country offices and with other Government Departments, particularly the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and Ministry of Defence (MOD). It has helped DFID think through the mix of aid instruments and partnerships we should use, improve risk assessment and management, and define and test options for country plans and HMG strategies.</p>
	<p pid="c.2312W.3/2">Six DFID country offices have drawn on some support from external experts as part of the work (Bangladesh, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan) and the estimated cost of this work has been &pound;130,500. The majority of country offices have carried out the work in-house. A cross-Whitehall scenario planning group (comprising DFID, FCO, MOD, Stabilisation Unit and the Horizon Scanning Centre) has also been established centrally, and this group is sharing lessons and experiences of scenario planning work. DFID's new country planning guidance (issued on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-14">14 July 2008</phrase>) requires all country offices to include scenario and contingency planning as part of the process.</p>

In such situations, the cost is borne by the appropriate police authority. We are not aware of any discussions that have been held on this issue with the construction industry.</p>

	<p pid="c.2321W.2/2">The term &quot;business crime&quot; is not specifically used within the recorded crime offence series. The offences that may be attributed to business crime are: robbery of business property, theft by an employee, shoplifting, and fraud by a company director. The available statistics are given in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="c.2321W.2/3">Our strategy is to encourage business to work closely in partnership with the police and local authorities through the Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) to inform local crime reduction strategies.</p>
	<p pid="c.2321W.2/4">Partnership working is perhaps the single biggest success in tackling crime over the past 10 years. We funded the Action Against Business Crime Group to set up and maintain 200 business crime reduction partnerships in towns and cities across England and Wales. These partnerships have proved remarkably successful.</p>
	<p pid="c.2321W.2/5">The Home Office is committed to working with our retail partners to ensure that we find effective solutions and responses to retail crime.</p>
	<p pid="c.2321W.2/6">Shops and stores are at the heart of most of our communities and crime against those outlets affects us all.</p>
	<p pid="c.2321W.2/7">A key strand of the work to address business crime is to ensure that partnerships and stakeholders have the right &quot;tools&quot; and knowledge to deal with retail crime effectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.2321W.2/8">As an example of this, the Home Office has funded the Perpetuity Group, which is led by Professor Gill, to devise an audit tool which retailers can apply to their stores and significantly lower the opportunities for shop thieves to operate.</p>

The ECRIS proposal is designed to provide a standardised format for the electronic exchange of information extracted from criminal records, in particular information on the offence for which a person has been convicted and the sentence passed by the court.

	<p pid="c.2338W.0/2">The number of profiles is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because a number of subject profiles on the NDNAD are replicates, that is, a profile for a person has been loaded to the NDNAD on more than one occasion. This may arise for a number of reasons, such as a person giving a different name on different occasions they are arrested, or because of upgrading of profiles. It is estimated that 13.3 per cent. of the subject profiles held on the entire NDNAD are replicates.</p>
	<p pid="c.2338W.0/3">Ethnic appearance is based on the judgment of the police officer taking the sample as to which of six broad ethnic appearance categories the person is considered to belong to. 'Unknown' means that no ethnic appearance information was recorded by the officer taking the sample.</p>

	<p pid="c.2342W.0/2">Work on revising the figures is in progress. It will also take account of the judgment in the S and Marper case before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on the proportionality of retaining biometric data for those charged but not convicted of an offence. The ECtHR judgment is expected later this year. Revised projections should be available in early 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.2342W.3/1">Information held on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) is available on the basis of the police force which added the DNA profile, not the residence of the person sampled. Information is, therefore, not available on the number of residents of Leeds, West constituency or Leeds metropolitan district who have had a DNA profile added to the NDNAD, but is available on the number of profiles loaded by West Yorkshire police. The people from whom these profiles were taken may not be resident in the area where they were sampled.</p>
	<p pid="c.2342W.3/2">The NDNAD holds records on the ethnic appearance of persons who have DNA taken, based on the judgment of the police officer completing the record about which of six broad ethnic categories the person belongs to. These categories are white&mdash;north European; white&mdash;south European; middle eastern; Asian; black; and Chinese, Japanese or other south east Asian. There is no separate category for eastern Europeans. If the police officer does not make an entry for ethnic appearance, this is recorded as 'unknown'.</p>
	<p pid="c.2342W.3/3">It is not, therefore, possible to provide the information requested. However, it is possible to provide information on the number of profiles added to the NDNAD by West Yorkshire police, and by all English and Welsh police forces, broken down by age and the ethnic appearance categories used. The age shown is the person's current age, not the age they were when the DNA sample was taken. This is shown in the following table.</p>
	<p pid="c.2342W.3/4">The number of profiles held on the NDNAD is not the same as the number of individuals. As it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion, some profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because profiles are upgraded.</p>
	<p pid="c.2342W.3/5">At present, the national replication rate is 13.3 per cent., that is, the number of people whose details are loaded is 13.3 per cent. fewer than the number of profiles. However, this rate may vary between police forces, so figures for the number of individuals whose profiles have been loaded are not given for specific forces.</p>

	<p pid="c.2345W.3/1">The greater the number of different areas of DNA (loci) examined by a DNA profiling system, the higher the level of accuracy.</p>
	<p pid="c.2345W.3/2">When the United Kingdom National DNA Database (NDNAD) was set up in 1995, the SGM system was used, which looked at six loci plus amelogenin (the area showing the person's gender). In 1999, SGM was replaced by SGM Plus, which looks at 10 loci plus the gender area. The probability of an adventitious (chance) match between full SGM DNA profiles of unrelated individuals is of the order of one in 50 million. The quoted probability of a match between full SGM Plus DNA profiles of unrelated individuals is one in one billion (i.e. one in a thousand million). The NDNAD Custodian carefully monitors replicate DNA profiles loaded to the NDNAD, and a key reason for doing this is to identify potential adventitious matches between SGM Plus DNA profiles derived from unrelated individuals. To date, no such adventitious match has been found. This indicates the SGM Plus match probability to be significantly lower than the figure quoted&mdash;it is probably better than one in one trillion (that is, one in a million million).</p>
	<p pid="c.2345W.3/3">It was decided when SGM Plus was introduced that it was not value for money to reanalyse all the samples taken between 1995 and 1999 to upgrade them from SGM to SGM Plus. However, if a match occurs involving an SGM profile, or a partial crime scene profile, the original samples are routinely reanalysed using SGM Plus to provide the best possible match.</p>
	<p pid="c.2345W.3/4">The Interpol Standard Set of Loci include seven loci plus amelogenin. Six of the seven loci are the same as in the SGM system. In order to carry out an Interpol search, six out of these seven loci plus amelogenin should be present. The Interpol Standard Set of Loci is therefore equivalent to SGM, with a discriminating power of approximately one in 50 million for full profiles from unrelated individuals.</p>
	<p pid="c.2345W.3/5">If a DNA profile submitted by an overseas police force matches a profile on the NDNAD, the information supplied to that force is limited to notification that a match has occurred.

	<p pid="c.2349W.2/2">Discretion may be exercised to waive certain requirements of the immigration rules applicable to former members of the armed forces, including the requirement for an application for indefinite leave to be made within two years of the date of discharge. Discretion may be exercised in individual cases if there are strong reasons why settlement in the UK is appropriate and account is taken of all relevant factors. Gallantry awards may be one factor in whether discretion is exercised.</p>

	<p pid="c.2352W.0/2">The majority of passengers travelling on flights from China and Vietnam to the United Kingdom are likely to be visa nationals. Biometrics are taken from all visa nationals over the age of five as part of the entry clearance process. The passport details and biometric information is available to immigration staff working at ports of entry.</p>
	<p pid="c.2352W.0/3">In addition to this UKBA&mdash;the Uk Border Agency&mdash;has a network of airline liaison officers (ALOs) based in key source and transit locations which are targeted by those who may seek to abuse the UK's immigration controls. ALOs provide a comprehensive programme of formal training for carriers in UK passport and visa requirements and forgery awareness. This training incorporates a session about the smuggling and trafficking of children and adults, and the means of identifying vulnerable children and their traffickers by their demeanour and the documents they may present.</p>
	<p pid="c.2352W.0/4">Finally, the e-Borders Programme will check and screen against watchlists 60 per cent. of all passenger and crew movements, including children, in and out of the UK by December 2009, 95 per cent. by December 2010 and 100 per cent. by 2014.</p>

	<p pid="c.2352W.3/2">Information on time spent on patrol by police officers has only been collected since 2003-04. Values for Northamptonshire are set out in table A and values for England and Wales in table B.</p>
	<p pid="c.2352W.3/3">Time spent on patrol refers only to time when an officer is patrolling, but engaged in no other duty. Activity (such as advice to a member of the public) carried out while on patrol is recorded separately. The percentage of time spent on patrol needs to be considered alongside other activities. We use the front-line policing measure to provide a fuller picture of police officer activity, and figures for this measure for England and Wales are also given in the tables.</p>
	<p pid="c.2352W.3/4">The measure assesses time spent by police officers on core policing duties such as patrol, responding to 999 calls, as well as activities of CID and specialist officers. While these officers are not always visible to the public, they are none the less carrying out core policing duties.</p>
	<p pid="c.2352W.3/5">I am told by Northamptonshire police that they have invested significantly in proactive crime fighting activities to address serious and organised crime, major crime and terrorism. This focused activity has contributed to a reduction in crime for the people of Northamptonshire, but is not included in time on patrol.</p>
	<p pid="c.2352W.3/6">I am also told that in Northamptonshire, police responses to incidents requiring a rapid emergency response have risen by 20 per cent. This represents almost 9,000 more prioritised emergency responses to the public in 2007-08 compared to 2004-05. Public satisfaction at police response to incidents in Northamptonshire is also rising, and public confidence in policing in Northamptonshire (as measured by the British crime survey) has risen by almost 10 per cent. in the past 18 months.</p>

The statistics relating to exclusion from the 1951 Convention under article 1F do not differentiate between those who are refused asylum on grounds of participation in terrorism or for other grounds which are covered within article 1F.

	<p pid="c.2362W.5/4" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="c.2362W.5/5" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many individuals' postal addresses have been disclosed by the Child Support Agency to their former partners; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.2362W.5/6" class="indent">It is not the practice of the Child Support Agency to provide details of an individual's postal address to former partners. However, on occasion errors do occur and the Agency investigates each incident thoroughly and considers financial redress where appropriate. The Agency does not centrally collate records of these investigations.</p>
	<p pid="c.2362W.5/7" class="indent">The Agency's records do show however that since January 2007, of the 1.3 million open child maintenance cases, the Information Commissioner's Office have informed the Agency of just three complaints from our clients alleging unlawful disclosure. These complaints were investigated by the Child Support Agency and, where appropriate, consolatory payments were made by way of an apology for the inconvenience, worry and distress caused.</p>
	<p pid="c.2362W.5/8" class="indent">It is worth noting that there are also occasions where, with the consent of both parents, it may be in the interests of the child for the Agency to pass on contact details to either parent. The Agency is currently looking at how it can facilitate this transfer of information within the framework of the Data Protection Act.</p>
	<p pid="c.2362W.5/9" class="indent">The Agency takes the protection of personal information very seriously. If you have any concerns relating to a particular case, I would be happy to investigate and respond accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="c.2367W.0/19">The Department acquires fully serviced accommodation from Land Securities Trillium (LST) under PFI&mdash;private finance initiative&mdash;arrangements. Any new space the Department requires is identified, acquired, managed and operated by LST to meet the Department's needs. The improved energy efficiency of our total operations is one of a range of issues that is considered in the acquisition of new space. Ease of access for customers and the requirements for highly efficient office space (both existing and new build) are among other criteria.</p>
	<p pid="c.2367W.0/20">Energy efficiency is incentivised within the PFI arrangement and is incorporated also within the Department's Estate Strategy. Specific measures to improve efficiency are detailed within the Department's three year Sustainable Development Action Plan, which is incorporated within its Sustainable Development Annual Report for 2007.</p>
	<p pid="c.2367W.0/21">While the Department's increased use of IT and extended opening hours, to provide a better service to customers and improved facilities for staff, has impacted on our energy efficiency, a planned programme of work is in place to meet the carbon from offices and energy efficiency targets. The Department has secured investment for 41,000 'spend-to-save' measures through its PFI arrangements and is installing Smart Meters in its largest 700 buildings to improve reporting and energy management. These measures, together with an intensive energy efficiency and communications campaign, have resulted in absolute carbon emission reductions of 10.8 per cent. in 2007-08. Their ongoing implementation, together with improved governance and a review of site plant and equipment, mean that the Department predicts a further reduction of 15 per cent. by 2011, meeting the Sustainable Operations target.</p>

			<tr pid="c.2372W.2/11"> <td colspan="5"><sup>(1)</sup><i> Pension Transformation Project (PTP):</i><br/> The apparent increase over the original stated costs can be attributed to a fundamental change in delivery approach.<br/> When PTP started in April 2002, costs were early high level estimates based on delivery via a private supplier (who would recover development costs of the system through an operating contract).<br/> Policy later changed and it was decided DWP would fund the capital costs of PTP itself.<br/> As a result, development costs went up but operating costs went down.<br/> Overall, this actually means an improved return* on the total investment, although development costs appear higher than the very early estimate provided in 2002.<br/> * Net present value of the programme has increased by 40 per cent. to &pound;585 million, compared to &pound;350 million in the initial business case. HM Treasury guidance states the NPV is the primary criteria for deciding whether government action can be taken. This is arrived at by converting all costs and benefits to present values so that they can be compared.<br/> <sup>(2)</sup><i> Customer Information System (CIS):</i><br/> The original cost estimate of &pound;40 million was based on the original scope of the project. There has subsequently been significant extension of the scope as the CIS Programme has responded to changes in the Departmental Modernisation Programme.<br/> The costs originally submitted for CIS in July 2003 assumed that CIS would be developed as a back-end system supporting the Customer Account Managements (CAM) systems intended for deployment in each of the Client Groups. It also assumed that the Standard Enquiry Function (SEF) would be developed to support a very small number of users who would not have access to CAM.<br/> Plans evolved with the result that the only Client Group to deliver a CAM system in line with this earlier specification was the Pension Service.<br/> The additional costs result from requirements to service both the 'old' Legacy applications and the 'new' PTP CAM, as well as developing and implementing architectural changes in a seamless way. In addition, the absence of CAM functionality meant that the SEF has been rolled out to in excess of 124,000 users.<br/> CIS scope was increased to deliver desktop access to approximately 19,000 staff in 408 local authorities for the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit replacing remote access terminals, which were provided to only a very limited number of users in each of these local authorities.<br/> The increased investment together with the delivery of enhanced requirements has resulted in CIS benefits increasing from &pound;155 million to &pound;533 million which includes direct benefits of &pound;130 million and enabled benefits of &pound;403 million. During this period, the introduction of CIS has led to the decommissioning of two major benefit systems (the Departmental Central Index and Personal Details Computer System) as CIS is now the master of personal details across all of DWP.<br/> Additional work has also been carried out with other Government Departments and further work is planned in this area.<br/> <sup>(3)</sup><i> Central Payments System (CPS):</i><br/> The figure of &pound;90 million relates to the outline business case produced during the feasibility phase in 2004. This related to a scope that is significantly smaller than the current programme. The original scope was for the replacement of existing payment processing software and excluded an integrated accounting solution. Furthermore, the integration scope of CPS has increased from four entitlement management systems to nine.<br/> The NPV figure of &pound;154 million relates to the full business case approved in March 2006. The figure of &pound;169 million relates to the latest outline business case approved in May 2008.<br/> <i> Note</i>:<br/> The costs in the table represent the investment costs of implementing the particular project and programme. Costs of running the solutions implemented by the projects and programmes are not included in the table as in the vast majority of cases, they are more than compensated for by the financial and non-financial benefits they generate. These savings are demonstrated in the NAO report &quot;The Efficiency programme: A Second Review of Progress&quot;.</td> </tr>

All figures are consistent with Budget 2008, as well as expenditure information published on the internet at:<br/> www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd4/expenditure.asp<br/> 2. Winter fuel payments are rounded to the nearest million pounds, but cold weather payments have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand pounds.<br/> 3. The winter fuel payment was introduced in 1997. Annual payments are made to most people aged 60 or over. The current rate is &pound;200 per household with someone eligible and aged between 60 and 79 and &pound;300 per household containing someone eligible and aged 80 or over. At present over 8 million households benefit each year.<br/> 4. From 2000-01, winter fuel payments were extended to include people aged 60 to 64 years and also include the over 80 payments.<br/> 5. Winter fuel payment expenditure is forecast to increase significantly in 2008-09 following the announcement at Budget 2008 of an additional payment for winter 2008-09 of &pound;50 for eligible households with someone aged between 60 and 79 and &pound;100 for households with someone aged 80 or over.<br/> 6. Customers eligible for cold weather payments are those awarded pension credit or those awarded income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance who have a pensioner or disability premium or have a child who is disabled or under the age of five. Following the introduction of employment and support allowance in October of this year eligible customers will also include those in receipt of income related employment and support allowance that includes a work or support component, any disability premium, or who have a child who is disabled or under the age of five. A payment is made when the average temperature has been recorded as, or is forecast to be, 0&deg;C or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the eligible customer's postcode.<br/> 7. Up to and including the winter of 2007-08, a cold weather payment was &pound;8.50 for each week of very cold weather. The Prime Minister has announced that for the winter 2008-09 a cold weather payment will be increased to &pound;25 for each week of very cold weather.<br/> 8. Cold weather payment expenditure for 2008-09 cannot be forecast because the number of payments will be dependent on the severity of the winter. However, a notional figure of &pound;24 million is included in the forecasts for the Social Fund, provided to HM Treasury.<br/> <i> Source</i>:<br/> Departmental Accounting and statistical data</td> </tr>

Households stating the lowest incomes to the Family Resources Survey may not actually have the lowest living standards. Many people who report very low incomes appear to have high spending. Hence any statistics on numbers in this group may be misleading.</p>

	<p pid="c.2386W.2/4" class="indent">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about the reasons that Maternity Allowance work has been centralised into four Benefit Delivery Centres. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
	<p pid="c.2386W.2/5" class="indent">The decision to centralise Maternity Allowance (MA) formed part of the wider agenda to centralise processing of all benefits in order to improve their delivery and realise efficiencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.2386W.2/6" class="indent">For the benefits with larger caseloads, Incapacity Benefit, Jobseeker's Allowance, and Income Support, it was possible to centralise this work in 78 sites across Great Britain. But because of smaller number of recipients we needed fewer sites if the benefits of economies of scale and consistency were to be realised in the centralisation of MA. We also decided that in order to avoid the need for redundancies we would use the centralisation of MA and other benefits to locate work in potential redundancy hotspots.</p>
	<p pid="c.2386W.2/7" class="indent">This resulted in the centralisation of MA into the four Benefit Delivery Centres of Yeovil, Wrexham, Hanley and Bury St Edmunds in the spring.</p>

	<p pid="c.2388W.3/2">Since its launch in 1998 the New Deal has led a major transformation in employment support for people in Britain. Since its introduction New Deal has helped 1.97 million people into work. Benefit recipients participating in New Deal more than once are more likely to enter employment from their second spell on the programme than their first, and from their third spell than their second. Each period on New Deal moves participants closer to the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="c.2388W.3/3">Information on the number of current participants on New Deal 50 plus and New Deal for Disabled People is not currently available. These statistics have been suspended while a review of the method for compiling current participant figures is carried out.</p>
	<p pid="c.2388W.3/4">Current participant figures for New Deal for Lone Parents are available to March 2007. Figures for the period from April 2007 are not currently available as a result of the identification of a problem with the data which are used to compile the statistics. Figures for the period after April 2007 will be released as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="c.2394W.2/1" class="holdinganswer">holding answer <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-10">10 September 2008</phrase></p>
	<p pid="c.2394W.2/2">In 1997 the poorest pensioners lived on &pound;68.80. Today no pensioner need live on less than &pound;124.05. The Government have introduced a number of measures to reduce the levels of poverty in older people. The number of pensioners in poverty in the UK has fallen from 2.9 million in 1998-99 to 2.1 million in 2006-07 (as measured by 60 per cent. of contemporary median income after housing costs). Once housing costs are accounted for, pensioners are less likely to be in poverty than the population as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.2394W.2/3">Measures taken include the introduction of the minimum income guarantee and its successor pension credit. The value of the safety-net we provide for the poorest pensioners has increased by over a third in real terms since 1997. We have successively raised the standard minimum guarantee in pension credit by earnings in every year since its introduction. Our commitments in the Pensions Act 2007 to continue to uprate the pension credit standard minimum guarantee in line with earnings over the long term, and to reintroduce the earnings link to basic state pension from 2012, or by the end of the next parliament, will help secure these gains into the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.2394W.2/4">In addition we have introduced winter fuel payments for those aged 60 or over, with a higher amount for those 80 or over. For winter 2008-09 we will make an additional payment of &pound;50 for households with someone aged 60-79 and &pound;100 for those with someone aged 80 or over. We have also introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over and made above inflation increases in the basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid="c.2394W.2/5">The Department for Work and Pensions has undertaken a range of research over the last five years to investigate the nature of poverty in older people. For example, research has been commissioned to better understand older people's experiences of poverty and the link between income poverty, deprivation and age. In working to ensure all pensioners take up their entitlements to pension credit, the Department has also undertaken research to explore the barriers and triggers to claiming pension credit.</p>

	<p pid="c.2398W.8/2">There is a statutory requirement to review all social security benefits each year and to increase certain benefits from April each year. The increase applied to most contributory and non-contributory benefits is calculated using the increase in the Retail Prices Index for the 12 months ending in the preceding September. This ensures that benefits keep their value in broad terms.</p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.8/3">The inflation figures are based on a year-on-year comparison of prices. Therefore any recent fluctuations in inflation will be taken into account in the benefit increases that will take effect from the following April.</p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.8/4">In addition to the annual uprating, the Chancellor also announced in his Budget 2008 speech that for winter 2008-09 an additional payment will be made alongside the winter fuel payment. Households with someone aged 60 to 79 will receive an additional &pound;50 and households with someone aged 80 or over will receive an additional &pound;100.</p>
	<p pid="c.2398W.8/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-09-11">11 September 2008</phrase>, the Government also announced a new &pound;1 billion package of measures to help people cut their energy bills. Measures on offer deliver significant energy savings&mdash;e.g. cavity wall and loft insulation&mdash;and 11 million lower income and pensioner households are eligible for these free of charge. Also for winter 2008-09 cold weather payments will increase in value from &pound;8.50 to &pound;25.00. Cold weather payments are made to vulnerable people in receipt of qualifying benefits, including pension credit, if there is a period of very cold weather in their area.</p>

	<p pid="c.2399W.2/36">The reduction in the amount recorded as recovered in 2006-07 was largely as a result of the introduction of customer compliance in April 2006. Customer compliance deals with low level fraud and customer error allowing the criminal compliance teams to focus on the more serious and complex fraud cases which are likely to result in a criminal sanction. The focus of customer compliance on low level fraud allows for earlier intervention resulting in a shorter period of overpayment and smaller cash value.</p>

	<p pid="c.2407W.3/2">DEFRA is responsible for enforcing the Agricultural Wages Order (AWO) in England and Wales. The AWO sets minimum wage rates and certain other minimum terms and conditions of employment which apply to workers in agriculture. Compliance with minimum wage legislation is one of the criteria which a labour provider must meet to be issued with a licence by the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (GLA). DEFRA Ministers have regular discussions with the GLA, but there have been no specific discussions about the enforcement of the Agricultural Wages Order.</p>

As well as being places for healthy exercise, allotments are also an increasingly important resource for wildlife. Many of the plants and animals that struggle to survive on intensively managed farmland find a refuge on allotment sites. Natural England published the 'Wildlife on allotments' document in 2007.</p>

	<p pid="c.2409W.5/2">Coccidiosis is not a notifiable disease hence reporting of coccidia diagnoses is voluntary. The levels of endemic diseases, such as coccidiosis, in the cattle and sheep population of Great Britain (GB) are monitored through the Veterinary Laboratories Agency's (VLA) Endemic Disease Surveillance Programme. This is performed by analysis of test results from clinical diagnostic samples submitted by veterinary surgeons to the VLA regional laboratories and to the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) disease surveillance centres for investigation. The figures shown in Table 1 correspond to the number of coccidiosis incidents recorded by the VLA's Veterinary Investigation Diagnosis Analysis (VIDA) database for the years 2003 to 2008. Incidents in this setting are defined as farm holdings reporting a case of coccidiosis, affecting one or more animals, either for the first time or after a four-week period from the last reported incident of coccidiosis diagnosed on that farm. Note therefore that holdings can be recorded as having cases more than once within the same year.</p>

	<p pid="c.2409W.5/42">These figures show only the incidents diagnosed as a result of veterinarians submitting samples to these Government laboratories and therefore do not provide an unbiased or comprehensive estimate of the occurrence of the condition in GB. Many factors may influence the likelihood of a farmer/his veterinarian submitting a clinical sample for diagnosis: general economic situation within the sheep and cattle industry, awareness of the disease and its perceived importance, other concurrent priorities, the particular clinical presentation of the suspected disease etc.</p>
	<p pid="c.2409W.5/43">All these factors need to be taken into account when interpreting the figures. Changes over time of any of these factors will impact on the observed trends, so caution needs to be exercised when comparing annual figures. Furthermore, and within these limitations, figures in Table 1 only represent incidents where clinical disease was present and could be confirmed with the current testing procedures. The figures therefore are likely to represent a fraction of the total number of animals and farm holdings infected with coccidiosis in GB.</p>

	<p pid="c.2411W.5/2">Rural priority groups in remote areas have the same access to the offers under the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) as others. With CERT aiming some &pound;1.5 billion energy supplier investment in carbon reduction measures at a priority group of low income and age 70-plus households, we expect to see rural priority group households see significant benefits. CERT also includes measures which deliver specific benefits to rural households. For example, we expect some 90,000 priority group households to benefit from fuel switching, e.g. moving to gas central heating from electric or oil heating. We have also established a 'flexibility' option under CERT, whereby suppliers get a significant uplift in carbon credits for installing more expensive measures, such as solid wall insulation and heat pumps in off gas grid properties. They can utilise this flexibility option for up to 5 per cent. of their 40 per cent. priority group target.</p>

The precise number of moorings (residential and non-residential) depends on the lengths of the canals (which can be split into a higher or lower number of berths) and the lengths of the boats which moor alongside the canal. British Waterways estimate that they have around 4,600 moorings of which approximately 7 per cent. will become available for tender by the end of this year's trail.</p>

	<p pid="c.2422W.2/2">We have not allocated funding specifically for an evaluation of the biodiversity value of areas of rainforest within oil palm plantations. However, biodiversity issues have been covered within broader studies such as the 'Review of Work on the Environmental Sustainability of International Biofuels Production and Use', funded by Defra and published in April this year as well as Defra's September 2007 report on Sustainable Commodities (Defra research project EV02019) which examined the environmental and social impacts of eight commodity groups, including palm oil.</p>
	<p pid="c.2422W.2/3">Defra is also contributing towards the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) study which will examine, among other things, the costs of biodiversity loss in the main biomes. This study is due to be published in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="c.2422W.5/2">There are currently nine slaughterhouses in the UK licensed and available to handle pre August 1996 cattle: five in England; two in Scotland; one in Wales and in Northern Ireland. In order to manage the seasonal fluctuations in cattle presented under the Older Cattle Disposal Scheme (OCDS), Government and industry colleagues worked together to provide a booking system, the purpose of which is to be able to predict the demand for the scheme and to match slaughter capacity. At present the abattoir capacity is undersubscribed.</p>

	<p pid="c.2427W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="c.2427W.6/2">The worst affected areas have a population which is 54 per cent. Tibetan. The UK assistance and the Chinese response generally has covered all the victims of the earthquake, including the Tibetan and Qiang communities.</p>
	<p pid="c.2427W.6/3">We have been in close contact with the Chinese authorities since the earthquake. They have been dealing very competently with all the victims. The UK provided funds for the immediate relief effort. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-16">16 May</phrase>, three days after the earthquake struck, we provided &pound;1 million to the Chinese Association for NGO co-operation. The money was used to buy food, water, blankets and 2,400 tents. Between 22 and <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-30">30 May</phrase>, four flights arrived in Chengdu from Dubai carrying a further 5,332 tents. The total value of the tents, including transport costs, was &pound;1.2 million. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-18">18 June</phrase>, we agreed a contribution of &pound;350,000 to the International Labour Organisation for training to help survivors of the earthquake re-launch or start their own businesses for the first time. The programme aims to re-establish 1000 businesses and start 700 new ones in the next year. The Department for International Development (DFID) total contribution to date is therefore &pound;2.55 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.2427W.6/4">We have also established a facility to provide technical assistance for the reconstruction effort. It will have an initial ceiling of &pound;1 million. The main focus will be on areas where we already have a comparative advantage, such as health, education, water and sanitation, participatory, socially inclusive planning and community based poverty reduction in remote villages.</p>

	<p pid="c.2428W.8/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply</p>
	<p pid="c.2428W.8/2">The UK signed the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1981 and ratified it in 1986. In accordance with Article 18 of the Convention, the UK undertakes to submit reports every four years on measures adopted to implement the Convention to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.</p>
	<p pid="c.2428W.8/3">In May 2007, the UK submitted its sixth periodic report to the UN, which summarises the main legislative, judicial and administrative measures undertaken by the Government since 2003. Countries are called to account on their performance on the Convention and the UK is being examined by the United Nations Committee on its five and six Periodic Reports on <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-10">10 July 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.2428W.8/4">The UK's decision to accede to the CEDAW Optional Protocol enables women in the UK, or their representatives, to appeal to the Committee if they believe there has been an infringement of the Convention. There have been two communications in respect of the United Kingdom to date. Both have been inadmissible.</p>

Local licensing authorities are already able to attach conditions to individual premises licences in support of the four main licensing objectives. Such conditions can relate to appropriate levels of supervision at individual premises, and it is entirely correct that such decisions are taken at local level, flexibly responding to local licensing needs.</p>

These include: 21 Military Police Company; a Military Transition Team embedded with 26 Brigade of the Iraqi Army; a Transition Team embedded with an Iraqi National Police Battalion; a Civil Military Operations Cell; an Explosive Ordnance Detachment; and a Biometrics Team.</p>
	<p pid="c.2432W.9/3">A number of other US elements, including the Coalition Air Force Training Team and the 14<sup>(th)</sup> US Engineer Battalion, operate within MND(SE). The UK works to co-ordinate effort and influence with these organisations but there is no requirement for a formal command relationship.</p>
	<p pid="c.2432W.9/4">There are no formal command relationships between the Iraqi armed forces and UK armed forces although their activities are very closely co-ordinated, primarily through key leader engagement at the senior military level and by the UK's embedded military transition teams.</p>
	<p pid="c.2432W.9/5">Other non-UK units may, on occasion, temporarily deploy into the MND(SE) area of operations for specific missions. The precise command relationship with these units will vary depending on the nature of their operational tasking.</p>

	<p pid="c.2433W.2/1">There have been over 100 deployments by UK forces since 1997. These vary in size, for example the current support to the UN Mission in Sudan with only two people up to the deployment of a whole division to Iraq in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="c.2433W.2/2">Defence planners use the terms large, medium and small to distinguish the scale of putative or generic operations. These are the building blocks which guide the size and shape of our armed forces, rather than a blueprint for actual operations. Force packages will ultimately be determined by the requirements of each operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.2433W.2/3">Nonetheless, in very general terms, of our major recent operations, the size of our commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq both roughly align to the planning assumptions for a medium scale operation with our commitment in the Balkans more closely representing a small scale commitment since the withdrawal of the majority of UK troops from Bosnia in March 2007. The deployment of a division to Iraq in 2003 could be categorised a large scale operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.2433W.2/4">The level of concurrent operations sustained by the MOD and the armed forces since 2001 is detailed in Figure 4, Page 44 of the Ministry of Defence's Annual Report and Accounts 2007-2008 Volume I: Annual Performance Report and illustrates our relative commitment to each operation over the last seven years.

Pay as You Dine is still being rolled out across all three Services and where it has been introduced, the single Services are monitoring the delivery of the scheme with the contractor. While feedback from Service personnel has been gathered through the various Continuous Attitude Surveys, implementation across the Services is ongoing and it is too early to make an overall assessment of the effectiveness of the Pay as You Dine scheme.</p>

	<p pid="c.2434W.2/3">There is no &quot;Hungry Soldier&quot; scheme, but an administrative procedure within units that recognises that some individuals, on occasions, are unable to manage their budgets effectively. Our policy for dealing with this is to place such individuals on the &quot;Food Charge&quot; and to provide the standard &quot;core&quot; meals until they are able to resolve their financial difficulties.
