	<p pid="a.1158W.2/1">The Skills and Jobs Retention Group has met formally 10 times. In addition, there has been regular discussion between group members, other individuals, business and organisations to progress work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1158W.2/2">The group itself has no budget although it worked closely with SEMTA to ensure that they secured &#163;450,000 funding from the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) Employer Investment Fund for the system design and implementation of the new national web-based exchange&#8212;the Talent Retention Solution (TRS).</p>
	<p pid="a.1158W.2/3">This allowed the TRS to be launched in July. This is a solution designed by business for business. No assessment has yet been made of precisely how many people have been assisted by the TRS so far. However, good progress is being made with more than 150 companies registered on the website and, based on our discussions with them, we expect significant vacancies to come onto the system in the months ahead.</p>

Following a public consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-14">14 July 2011</phrase>, I announced to Parliament proposals for reforming our regulation. This will mean consistent protection for British consumers as all overseas operators will be subject to the same regulatory standards and requirements as British-based operators, for example in relation to problem gambling, preventing underage play and reporting suspicious betting patterns.</p>

I receive regular updates on the discussions between the two groups and, while progress is slow, it is being made. We understand that the contracts for Northern Racing and Arena Leisure are either agreed or very close to agreement and that some of the independent courses have begun discussions. All parties are working towards all contracts being agreed by the end of this year and I will be keeping a close watch on progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.1165W.2/2">Parliament has charged the independent broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, with maintaining standards to protect children from harmful material.

If there was new evidence which clearly showed existing levels of TV violence as a major problem in the UK then Ofcom would need to consider this fully and act accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1165W.2/4">Within this framework, it is the broadcasters' job to make judgments about what individual programmes should contain and the time at which they are broadcast.</p>

	<p pid="a.1167W.5/1">Ministry of Defence guidance mandates that all external consultancy requirements be articulated in the form of a business case, with financial approval provided at the appropriate level. This business case must consider all potential options, including internal resources, and make clear the rationale for recommending the external option to provide the service required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1167W.5/2">The requirement is categorised by the top level budget holder into one of eleven categories so that the expenditure is appropriated correctly. The requirement is then procured by way of a competitive tendering exercise if practicable, either through an existing corporate framework agreement or on a bespoke basis by advertising for expressions of interest prior to an invitation to tender being issued, in the Defence Contracts Bulletin if above &#163;10,000 in value, and in the Official Journal of the European Union if above &#163;101,000 in value, under the restricted procedure. In the event of a competitive tendering exercise being impracticable, the requirement is advertised on a single tender procurement basis in advance of the contract being placed, in the Defence Contracts Bulletin, if above &#163;40,000 in value, and in the Official Journal of the European Union if above &#163;101,000 in value, by way of a voluntary transparency notice, under the negotiated procedure. Unless a corporate framework agreement has been used, contract awards are again advertised in these two publications as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1167W.5/3">All invitation to tender and contract award documents above &#163;10,000 in value are placed on the transparency website unless a framework agreement pre-dating January 2011 has been used.</p>
	<p pid="a.1167W.5/4">It is worth noting also that since July 2010, the Cabinet Office has imposed a pan-Government freeze on external consultancy expenditure to the effect that all intended expenditure below &#163;20,000 has to be approved at Director (1 star) level and above &#163;20,000 with less than nine months duration approved at ministerial level. All consultancy requirements valued above &#163;20,000 and within an intended duration longer than nine months have to be approved by the Efficiency Reform Group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1167W.5/5">Prior to any engagement or contract being placed, Departments have to ensure that the requirement is necessary and that no internal resource is available to undertake the work. All external consultancy contracts are reviewed on this basis every three months with the maximum term permitted being nine months whereupon Efficiency Reform Group approval is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.1167W.5/6">In addition, any proposal from an external consultant quoting average man day rates above a certain threshold requires approval from Efficiency Reform Group.</p>

	<p pid="a.1168W.2/2">Since 2008 the Ministry of Defence (MOD) has not collected estimates of regional expenditure on equipment, non-equipment, or personnel costs as they do not directly support policy making or operations. However, all of the museums listed are based in England.</p>

	<p pid="a.1180W.5/2">The Government does not own emergency stocks of petroleum products, such as petrol or diesel fuel, that could be released in an oil supply disruption. However, as a member state of the EU and the International Energy Agency (IEA), the UK meets its international obligations to hold oil stocks by directing companies under the Energy Act 1976 to hold minimum levels of oil stocks as part of their commercial stocks. IEA member countries made available oil stocks in June 2011 in response to short term supply disruptions as a result of violence in Libya and Yemen; the UK made available some three million barrels.</p>

	<p pid="a.1183W.12/1">I am appalled by the ongoing practice of child sacrifice, and other forms of ritual murder in Uganda and around the world, as highlighted by the Jubilee Campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183W.12/2">According to official figures from the Ugandan Government, there were 14 cases of ritual murder last year, including nine children. In response. 43 suspects were arrested, of which 32 were charged with murder, attempted murder or other offences. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development (DFID) continue to monitor the effectiveness of the Government of Uganda's measures to combat this appalling practice. This includes, as well as the normal criminal investigation and prosecution processes, the establishment of a ministerial task force, the setting up of child and family protection units in the police force, and by the end of this year the establishment of a national plan of action on child sacrifice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183W.12/3">Furthermore, the DFID office in Uganda has supported child protection work in Uganda through UN Children's Fund, who focus on child sacrifice as part of their broader work. We are also engaged with local non government organisation who are working to raise awareness of this problem and who are campaigning for tighter regulation of so-called &#8220;traditional healers&#8221; in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183W.12/4">We remain concerned about corruption and regularly engage the Government of Uganda on this issue. In September, The Secretary of State for International Development, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40595" name="Andrew Mitchell">the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell)</phrase>, wrote to the Finance Minister making clear that our continued support to Uganda will depend on a shared commitment to the underlying partnership principles of our development relationship. These include promoting good governance and transparency, fighting corruption; and respecting human rights and other international obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183W.12/5">We have expressed particular concern regarding the unaccounted funds identified in reports by Uganda's auditor general into expenditure on hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in 2007. Action taken by us thus far included cuts to UK budget support in 2009 and 2010. DFID have also provided technical assistance to the Director of Public Prosecutions and Inspector General of Government to support them in enhancing their investigative and prosecution capacity. This month, three serving Cabinet ministers have stepped down pending court proceedings over corruption charges linked to Uganda's hosting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 2007. They join the former vice president who is also facing charges. We are also aware of recent corruption allegations raised by Ugandan parliamentarians around oil contracts and will continue to monitor these developments closely.</p>

The evidence to be considered by SaBTO includes that from the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens which takes account of evidence from Imperial College and other research groups. In the light of that evidence, SaBTO will consider whether the conclusions they reached in 2009 should be reviewed, and whether they wish to make recommendations on this matter to United Kingdom Health Ministers.

	<p pid="a.1185W.6/1">Bt proteins are active components of some pesticide products and are also found in a number of insect-resistant genetically-modified crops. In both cases the safety of residual Bt proteins in food is evaluated as part of the relevant authorisation systems. Bt proteins are of low toxicity to mammals and the safety assessment is not based on assumptions about whether or not they are absorbed into the blood supply. Nevertheless, the available data from in <i>vitro</i> tests show that Bt proteins are rapidly broken down by digestive enzymes in the same way as most other proteins in the diet. There are no current plans to sponsor such research.</p>

	<p pid="a.1195W.10/2">All existing buses and coaches used to provide local or scheduled services will then have to comply with PSVAR by end dates between 2015 and 2020, depending on vehicle type. At March 2011, 60% of all buses in Great Britain had been issued with a PSVAR accessibility certificate and a further 25% had low floor access but did not hold a PSVAR certificate.</p>

	<p pid="a.1202W.12/1">Access to Work provides vital support to help disabled people get and keep employment. We want as many disabled people as possible to know this support is available. The recent Sayce review recommended changes that will increase the number of people who are able to benefit from Access to Work and raise awareness about its availability amongst disabled people and employers. A public consultation following the review has just closed and we will be considering ideas and reactions from that consultation and publishing a statement in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.12/2">During the Sayce consultation period two Access to Work events were held, one in Manchester for third sector organisations and Access to Work Users and a further meeting in London for employers of disabled people. The attendee list at both events was extensive and featured many recognisable names.</p>
	<p pid="a.1202W.12/3">Also from <phrase class="date" code="2010-12-09">9 December 2010</phrase>, disabled job seekers have been able to find out immediately if they are eligible for Access to Work support by completing a short online questionnaire at Directgov. If eligible, they are then able to print off a new Pre-Employment Eligibility Letter which will help build their confidence when applying for jobs and can be shown to prospective employers. This delivers the commitments in the coalition programme to reform Access to Work, so that disabled people can apply for jobs with funding already secured for any adaptations and equipment they will need.</p>

	<p pid="a.1209W.2/1">The Government recognises the important role that cash benefits such as disability living allowance play in supporting disabled people to overcome the inequalities they face and remain independent. That is why personal independence payment will remain outside universal credit, ensuring it is non means-tested cash benefit to assist disabled people to meet extra costs associated with disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1209W.2/2">Personal independence payment will be a personal benefit paid to the disabled person or their appointee. In households where two or more claimants are entitled to personal independence payment, individuals will be able to claim the benefit in their own right.</p>
