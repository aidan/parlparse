	<p pid="a.690W.6/1">As stated in the Natural Environment White Paper 2011, the Government have committed to work with industry and other bodies to reduce the negative impacts of artificial light and to protect existing dark areas. Examples of work undertaken to fulfil this commitment include the inclusion of text regarding light pollution within the draft National Planning Policy Framework that requires local planning authorities to ensure light pollution is limited, and the inclusion of guidance on light pollution in the Highways Authority's code of practice for highway lighting management, &#8220;Well-lit Highways&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.690W.6/2">The Government have also committed to consulting relevant organisations this year on whether the exemptions for some types of premises from artificial light statutory nuisance continue to be appropriate. No action is being taken that is specific to London.</p>

REACH specifies various deadlines in 2010, 2013 and 2018 by which substances must be registered, depending on the tonnage manufactured or imported.

With both Norway and Sweden we have general &#8220;Defence Materiel Cooperation&#8221; Memorandum of Understandings under which meetings are arranged to discuss equipment issues of mutual interest. We are also conducting a structured dialogue with Germany, which includes potential equipment cooperation. We currently have no general procurement discussions with either Denmark or Finland.</p>

It is anticipated that such activity would be the primary cause of any substantive rise in prostitution, and current evidence does not suggest that there is any increase in human trafficking linked to the Olympics at the moment. Despite this, we remain vigilant. We have law enforcement measures in place to deal with any potential increase in the threat. The Human Exploitation and Organised Crime Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police Service are working to disrupt prostitution and recover victims, including victims of trafficking, in the five Olympic boroughs in London. If the evidence indicates an increase in trafficking we shall ensure that appropriate measures are put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.704W.0/3">This Government are committed to tackling the harm and exploitation to individuals, impact on communities, and links to organised crime, that can be associated with prostitution. We have published a review of effective practice in responding to prostitution, to empower local areas to respond to local issues.</p>

After October 2008 a primary and secondary code were recorded. Information on secondary condition for February 2009 is not available due to a number of transitional recording issues; the impact of these issues is thought to be reducing over time. <sup>(2)</sup> Not available. <i>Notes:</i> 1. Caseload figures are rounded to the nearest hundred. 2. Figures are adjusted to be consistent with the overall caseload from the WPLS. 3. Figures do not include people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital. 4. The preferred data source for benefit statistics is 100% Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study. However, the 5% sample data is generally the preferred source for analysis on disabling condition as information is more complete for disabling condition on the 5% sample. (Some recipients of DLA who transferred from the AA system may not have been allocated a specific disabling condition code. This problem can be corrected on the sample data but not on the WPLS data. The number of cases affected is decreasing over time). 5. A diagnosed medical condition does not mean that someone is automatically entitled to DLA. Entitlement is dependent on an assessment of how much help someone needs with personal care and/or mobility because of their disability. These statistics are only collected for administrative purposes. <i>Source:</i>  DWP Information Directorate: Sample data (5%).</td> </tr>

This provides a broad guide to the skill level of the vacancies it receives, but there is no specific record of whether vacancies require applicants to be qualified to degree level. Vacancies are normally held for a certain period of time agreed with the employer and closed automatically after this point. It is not therefore possible to say what proportion of vacancies is filled.</p>

For example, a claimant of Income Support and Incapacity Benefit would appear in &quot;Incapacity Benefits&quot; not &quot;Income Support&quot;. 7. From November 2008 the &quot;incapacity benefits group&quot; includes Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). ESA replaced Incapacity Benefit (IB) and Income Support (IS) paid on the grounds of incapacity for new claims from 27 October 2008. Prior to this the &quot;incapacity benefits group&quot; referred to claimants of Incapacity Benefit (including credits only) or Severe Disablement Allowance including people claiming IS on the grounds of incapacity. 8.

	<p pid="a.724W.6/1">Legislation requires that most prisoners serving a normal determinate custodial sentence must be released automatically at the halfway point of their sentence. Release at this point is not early as there is no discretion to hold prisoners beyond it; section 244 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 confers a duty on the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40513" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke)</phrase>, to release fixed term prisoners as soon as they have served one-half of the sentence. For those serving 12 months or more, the second half of the sentence is served in the community under licensed supervision and offenders are liable to be recalled to continue serving the sentence in prison if they fail to comply with their licence conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.724W.6/2">Two schemes have operated during the past five years that have allowed prisoners to be released earlier than statutorily required at the half-way point of sentence. The Home Detention Curfew (HDC) scheme has operated under legislation since 1999. Prisoners who meet the eligibility criteria and are risk assessed as suitable may be released on HDC up to 135 days before the half-way point of sentence. Table 1 shows the number of proven violent and sexual offences committed by offenders while on HDC for the years 2004-05 to 2008-09, the latest period for which figures are available.</p>
	<p pid="a.724W.6/3">In the method used to derive these figures an offender is considered to have reoffended if, during their period on HDC, he or she committed an offence that was recorded on the Police National Computer (PNC) as resulting in a caution or conviction; for the offence to count, the caution or conviction has to be given within nine months of the end of the quarter in which the offender started on HDC. For this reason, some offences committed during an HDC period which resulted in a conviction beyond this nine month period do not appear in the table.</p>
	<p pid="a.724W.6/4">Further details of reoffending while on HDC can be found in Chapter 2.2 of the Compendium of Reoffending Statistics and Analysis, published in November 2010:</p>
	<p pid="a.724W.6/5"><a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/statistics-and-data/mojstats/compendium-of-reoffending-statistics-and-analysis.pdf">http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/statistics-and-data/mojstats/compendium-of-reoffending-statistics-and-analysis.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="a.724W.6/6">To put these figures in context, in the last five years for which data are available 87% of prisoners have completed their period of HDC successfully and only 5% reoffended while on HDC.</p>
	<p pid="a.724W.6/7">The End of Custody Licence (ECL) was an administrative scheme, introduced as a temporary measure on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-29">29 June 2007</phrase>. It was withdrawn in March 2010 and the last ECL release was on <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-09">9 April 2010</phrase>. Under ECL, prisoners who met the eligibility criteria serving sentences between four weeks and four years were released under temporary licence for the final 18 days of the custodial element of the sentence. There are no plans to reintroduce ECL.</p>
	<p pid="a.724W.6/8">Details of proven offending on ECL are unavailable but figures on alleged reoffending on ECL are found in table 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.724W.6/9">These figures have been drawn from the police's administrative IT system, the police national computer, which, as with any large scale recording system, is subject to possible errors with data entry and processing. The figures are provisional and subject to change as more information is recorded by the police.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40599" name="George Osborne">the Member for Tatton (Mr Osborne)</phrase>, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.733W.5/3">&#8220;The House is today asked to support an Opposition motion that would add another &#163;20 billion to the structural deficit.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.733W.5/4">The Chancellor considered a range of evidence on the cost of Opposition policies, based on published information and HMRC analysis. This included:</p>
	<p pid="a.733W.5/5">HMRC estimates that temporarily reducing the rate of VAT for 12 months (from now) would increase the deficit by around &#163;12.4 billion. This is in line with the &#163;12.1 billion estimate of the revenue received in 2011-12 from the rise in the main rate of VAT, as set out in Table 2.1 of Budget 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.733W.5/6">Temporarily reducing the rate of VAT on home improvements is estimated to increase the deficit by &#163;2.2 billion, as set out in the answer given on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-17">17 October 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-10-17.713"><i>Official Report</i>, column 713W</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.733W.5/7">HMRC estimates that temporarily reducing employer national insurance contributions for small firms taking on extra workers could increase the deficit by around &#163;1 billion. This figure is based on broad assumptions, including the definition of a &#8216;small firm&#8217; as one with 10 or fewer employees, and is therefore subject to particular uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.733W.5/8">The cost of bringing forward capital spending would depend on the specific proposal. The estimate given in the debate reflected an illustrative assumption that the policy would imply no real terms cuts in capital departmental expenditure limits in 2011-12. If this were the case, the increase in the deficit would be &#163;5.5 billion, as set out in Table 2.3 of Budget 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.733W.5/9">In the same debate, the Chancellor said:</p>
	<p pid="a.733W.5/10">&#8220;I can give the House new information on what just a 1% rise in interest rates would mean for this country at the moment.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.733W.5/11">Estimates of the effect of higher interest rates on debt interest costs are published by the OBR in the supplementary tables accompanying their Budget forecast. Table 2.18 shows that a 1% rise in gilt yields across the forecast period would raise debt interest costs by &#163;6 billion per year by 2015-16.</p>
	<p pid="a.733W.5/12">A 1% rise in mortgage interest rates is estimated to raise annual mortgage payments by UK households by around &#163;10 billion. This is based on figures for the stock of outstanding mortgage debt published by the Council of Mortgage Lenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.733W.5/13">A 1% rise in the rate of return on portfolio UK debt held by foreign residents is estimated to increase net annual interest payments to foreign creditors by around &#163;15 billion, based on Office for National Statistics data.</p>

	<p pid="a.736W.5/1">The use of tax havens is one aspect of tax avoidance. To address tax avoidance the Government have set out a strategic approach. This is supported by HMRC's anti-avoidance strategy which puts the emphasis on prevention of avoidance through robust legislation and deterrence, backed up by accurate detection and robust action where avoidance does occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.5/2">Specific activities undertaken within HMRC's strategy to address avoidance through the use of tax havens include for example obtaining and sharing information on avoidance through membership of the Joint International Tax Shelter Information Centre (JITSIC).</p>
	<p pid="a.736W.5/3">In addition tax havens often involve attempts at concealment and HMRC has made significant progress in tackling this by obtaining information such as banking details and introducing offshore disclosure initiatives.</p>

There are exceptions, for example, workers with disabilities qualify at 16 hours. There are no plans to change the age at which people can qualify for the working tax credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.737W.2/2">However, the new universal credit, introduced over two Parliaments, will replace the current complex system of means-tested working-age benefits with a simple streamlined payment. The universal credit will extend in-work support to groups such as under 25s who cannot get working tax credit currently, which will help to address the concerns you have outlined. The first new claims to universal credit are expected to begin from 2013 and full migration is due in 2017.</p>

	<p pid="a.746W.3/3">The deal also includes a number of pledges where the evidence is more limited. However, we do not believe that a limited evidence base is a reason not to proceed with pledges that have the potential to benefit public health.</p>
	<p pid="a.746W.3/4">The Department's Research and Development Directorate is commissioning an independent evaluation of the impact of some elements of the responsibility deal. A team of researchers, commissioned by the Department, are currently assessing evaluation options and in due course will recommend approaches likely to deliver robust findings.</p>

These have informed policy development and will continue to do so. The responses as a whole have highlighted the wide variation in the way that local authorities provide services. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-31">31 October</phrase> the Department published Children in Care and Adoption Performance tables which show, against 15 key indicators, how each local authority is performing. These data are intended to drive local debate and discussion and to help weaker councils to learn from the best. On the same day the Prime Minister launched a national debate on children in care and adoption. Suggestions received via the Tell Tim website will be considered alongside others received over the next few months as part of this debate. We are continuing to promote the facility through Children in Care Councils, and I am attending several regional meetings, to further inform our policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.757W.2/5">We are also working with the Small Firms Enterprise Development Initiative (SFEDI), mentoring organisations, trade and business representative bodies and private business to encourage more experienced business people to sign up to mentor new and growing businesses.</p>

	<p pid="a.763W.3/1">The Daylight Saving Bill, as the Government intend to seek to amend it, would have no immediate effect. In the first instance it simply requires a review of costs and benefits, to enable all the relevant interests, including those of people who are religiously observant, to be properly assessed and thereafter taken into account if a change is proposed. It is only right that there be a proper examination of the likely effects for people throughout the UK before such a significant change can occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.763W.3/2">Our initial view is that a change in time could have an adverse impact on the ease with which some individuals may be able to observe their religion; there might be potential economic consequences as well. It is also is possible that a change might have benefits for some people who are religiously observant. The matter needs to be studied in depth and I can confirm that the report which would be prepared prior to considering whether there should be a trial advancing the clocks would, among other things, include a review of the likely impact on religious observance. The findings on this issue would be taken fully into account by the Government when considering whether to seek to exercise the power to have a trial. In the event of a trial taking place, the effects of the change, including upon religious observance, would also be monitored and taken into account in the decision on whether or not to make the arrangements permanent.</p>

	<p pid="a.775W.0/1">The Feed-in Tariffs scheme has helped create business and job opportunities in green sectors of the economy. Estimates of the scale of this impact in the future are uncertain because they depend on factors such as how many installations will come forward, installation times and how many associated supply chain jobs are created. Our rough estimates based on installations scenarios suggest that there could be around 1,000 to 10,000 gross additional jobs (full-time equivalent) in this sector in the three years to 2014-15 under the proposals published by DECC for consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-31">31 October</phrase>. These estimates relate to jobs within the PV sector, rather than the overall economy-wide employment level.</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.0/2">The proposed tariffs are intended to provide a rate of return of approximately 4.5-5%, in line with what was intended at the launch of the FITs scheme. By allowing future solar PV uptake at an affordable support level, while still providing attractive rates of return in the current investment climate, FITs will ensure that businesses installing domestic solar PV remain viable at a time when there is spare capacity in the economy which cannot readily be redeployed. These firms will then have the opportunity to position themselves to install some of the energy efficiency measures under the Green Deal/ECO once this policy has been fully introduced (it is currently expected to launch in autumn 2012).</p>
	<p pid="a.775W.0/3">We have not made an assessment in relation to the international competitiveness of the UK solar power industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.776W.0/1">Last year DECC contacted a number of academic institutions, NGOs and private businesses to request further evidence to help inform the Department's views on the prospects for global unconventional gas production. A range of factors make unconventional gas more costly and harder to access in regions outside of North America.</p>
	<p pid="a.776W.0/2">Given the uncertainties around when, and the degree to which, unconventional gas will be produced outside North America, DECC continues to take a cautious view of the implications for gas security of supply. We will be monitoring progress closely.</p>
	<p pid="a.776W.0/3">Looking at domestic potential, a British Geological Survey study in 2010 estimated that if UK shales were similar to those in the USA they could yield some 150 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to roughly two years' of UK demand. The BGS is currently undertaking more detailed work for the Department which will also take into account the recent drilling results of Cuadrilla in Lancashire. However little drilling has taken place and commercial production of shale gas has not been proven, so it is not yet possible to make a reliable estimate of recoverable reserves.</p>
	<p pid="a.776W.0/4">Overall therefore it is too early to be able to assess the potential contribution of shale gas in meeting energy needs in the next decade.</p>

	<p pid="a.785W.2/4">For example, DFID supports Nepal's national education programme, known as the Schools Sector Reform Programme.

	<p pid="a.786W.5/1">According to the Government of Ethiopia, 4.56 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance countrywide. Rains have now started in most of the drought-affected areas. This will bring some relief to farmers and pastoralists but also increases the risk of disease outbreaks.</p>
	<p pid="a.786W.5/2">A new humanitarian assessment is planned for November. We expect that the overall number of people in need will reduce in 2012 as a favourable harvest in the highlands will help to stabilise food prices and improve availability. However, in the drought-affected south-eastern lowlands it will take communities at least two years to recover. We are particularly concerned about the situation in the conflict-affected Somali Region of Ethiopia, where insecurity makes it difficult to provide assistance to over 1 million people in need. We are addressing these issues with the Ethiopian authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.786W.5/3">There are also 250,000 refugees in Ethiopia. According to the UN refugee agency UNHCR, over 90,000 Somali refugees have arrived since the beginning of the year, fleeing drought and conflict in their own country. A further 28,000 have arrived from Sudan since September, fleeing the continuing conflict in Blue Nile State.</p>
	<p pid="a.786W.5/4">This year, the UK has provided emergency food aid to over 2.4 million drought-affected Ethiopians. In addition, we are currently providing treatment for over 100,000 malnourished children and pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, clean water and sanitation for over 420,000 people, seeds and fertilizer for over 26,000 families, and animal health care for over 9,000 families. We have also provided emergency shelter, water and essential items for over 125,000 Somali refugees.</p>
	<p pid="a.786W.5/5">To break the cycle of drought and crisis, we also support programmes to build resilience of drought-affected communities, including the national safety net programme that provides cash and food in exchange for work to nearly 8 million people vulnerable people.</p>

	<p pid="a.788W.5/1">The UK Government's policy is that the terms on which financial assistance is provided should be determined by what a developing country can afford, rather than how it chooses to use these resources independent of the source of funding. The World Bank only lends money to those countries who can repay the loan. For low income countries, lending is provided on highly concessional terms through a dedicated arm of the World Bank, the International Development Association (IDA). For the poorest most indebted countries, such as Yemen and Burkina Faso, IDA funding is provided as grants. I am encouraging other donors to meet their aid commitments and to spend their resources to meet poor country demands in line with international guidelines.</p>

	<p pid="a.789W.2/1">In 2010-11, the latest year for which information is available, the three countries in receipt of development assistance from DFID with the highest gross national income per capita were Russia (DFID funding of &#163;1.3 million in 2010-11), Brazil (&#163;0.2 million) and South Africa (&#163;17.4 million). The UK's bilateral development programme in Russia will end as soon as possible. DFID does not currently have a dedicated bilateral programme in Brazil. From 2009 onwards, DFID's Brazil related expenditure has primarily been used to promote a stronger role for Brazil in addressing global development challenges. Of these three countries, South Africa is the only country with a continuing bilateral development programme. South Africa faces substantial development challenges with 13 million people surviving on less than &#163;1 per day and nearly one in five of the adult population living with HIV. A distinctive British bilateral aid programme focussed on HIV and support of private sector development as an engine for growth can make a significant impact. More details on the top priorities and results to be achieved in South Africa can be found at:</p>

	<p pid="a.790W.6/1">During the current crisis, results achieved to date through UK aid for people in and from Somalia include: provision of food for 247,000 people; 490,000 children vaccinated against measles; safe drinking water for 300,000 Somali refugees; tents for 20,000 households in Dadaab Camp in Kenya; shelter and essential household items such as blankets and cooking utensils for 40,000 Somali refugees in Ethiopia. In the current financial year, my Department has spent &#163;74 million on humanitarian relief for Somalis.</p>
	<p pid="a.790W.6/2">During the last three financial years, results achieved include treatment of 100,000 starving children and pregnant and breastfeeding mothers; provision of clean water to 350,000 people; provision of shelter for 50,000 internally displaced people; and 1.3 million children and women vaccinated. Department for International Development spent &#163;80 million on humanitarian assistance: &#163;29.9 million in 2010; &#163;31.9 million in 2009 and &#163;18.3 million in 2008. The Department has also provided support for Somali refugees through funding to the United Nations' High Commissioner for Refugees as part of their wider programmes in Kenya and Ethiopia.</p>
	<p pid="a.790W.6/3">So far during the current financial year, some of the results achieved through other aid to Somalia include: an increase in child-birth deliveries attended to by skilled attendants from 9% to 13%; eight peace agreements averting inter-communal and cross-border conflicts, with over 10,000 people benefiting from improved access to services and reduction in civilian casualties; creation of over 200,000 long-term jobs and provision of demand-driven training to 5,700 youth, of which 60% were women. Department for international Development has so far spent &#163;59 million in aid to Somalia the current financial year. The initial approved operational plan budget for Somalia was &#163;44 million. On current projections, the Department expects to spend at least &#163;84.5 million in total this financial year, including humanitarian allocations made in the year. The additional allocations were made in response to the deteriorating humanitarian situation and enhanced needs because of the drought, high food prices and ongoing conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.790W.6/4">Over the last three financial years, my Department spent &#163;47.5 million in 2010, &#163;55 million in 2009 and &#163;35.6 million in 2008 as aid to Somalia. See link:</p>
