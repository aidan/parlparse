	<p pid="a.235W.3/1">Smaller hotels in seaside towns will benefit both from VisitEngland's (VE's) thematic marketing which will be promoting coastline and coastal resorts, and from activities associated with 'attract and disperse' marketing which will also include coastal resorts. VE's main priority is to grow the domestic tourism market, encouraging more people to take holidays and make visits within this country. Stakeholders across the industry will benefit from this approach.</p>

Transferring museums and libraries functions to Arts Council England will ensure work is delivered in a more efficient way with a reduction in back office functions. It will also bring together three areas of cultural policy in a single organisation with a proven track record, giving the Arts Council greater influence in discussions about the power of culture, particularly at a local level.</p>

	<p pid="a.248W.5/1">The New Homes Bonus is a powerful, simple, transparent and permanent incentive for local authorities and communities to increase their aspirations for housing growth. The final scheme design of the New Homes Bonus will be published shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.248W.5/2">The New Homes Bonus will sit alongside the Government's current national planning for housing policies as set out in Planning Policy Statement 3: Housing (PPS3). PPS3 focuses on developing brownfield land for housing as a priority, particularly vacant and derelict sites and buildings, as well as surplus public sector land where possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.254W.9/2">This agreement ensures that consular staff in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office notify Victim Support National Homicide Service of the murder of a British national abroad if the bereaved family are resident in England or Wales. Consular staff will then advise the family of the service provided by Victim Support and, with the family's consent, a Victim Support caseworker will contact them to arrange a meeting.</p>

	<p pid="a.261W.5/1">There has been considerable economic progress in Zimbabwe since the formation of the Inclusive Government in 2008. But there has not yet been political reform on anything like the same scale. It is clear that there is still a long way to go before the country can be considered stable and democratic. The constitutional reform process, which has itself been marred by some apparent intimidation, and the setting up of Media, Electoral and Human Rights commissions are encouraging signs. But a number of key provisions of the Global Political Agreement remain unimplemented. The general conditions necessary for free and fair elections have yet to be established. Moreover, President Mugabe continues to make unilateral appointments to important offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.5/2">There has been a considerable reduction in the severity and frequency of human rights abuses since the formation of the Inclusive Government. However the recent constitutional reform process has shown that State actors still have a capacity for violence and intimidation and we remain concerned about ongoing abuses, particularly recent examples of politically-motivated violence apparently tied to potential elections. We call on the Zimbabwean authorities to resume the downward trend in human rights abuses.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.5/3">In the absence of a roadmap to credible and properly monitored elections, the Inclusive Government continues to offer the only credible means of transforming Zimbabwe and of delivering basic services to its people. But to succeed, it needs a clear commitment from all parties to work together to implement the reforms set out in the Global Political Agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.261W.5/4">We will continue to engage with our international partners, including South Africa and the Southern African Development Community, in considering how best to work with reformers in Zimbabwe and the region, to improve prospects of reform and to prepare for credible and properly monitored elections.</p>

	<p pid="a.266W.6/1">University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust (UHCW) does not have a contract directly with ISS. This is held between Coventry and Rugby Hospital Company (CRHC) and ISS. CRHC is the private company that is contractually required to market test 'soft' FM services (catering, cleaning, car parking etc) at regular intervals on behalf of the trust under the private finance initiative (PFI) contract, and to manage the tendering process.</p>
	<p pid="a.266W.6/2">During the initial stage of this process in the first half of 2010, CRHC, on behalf of their sub-contractor (ISS), was asked to submit data to the trust, in order for it to carry out a benchmarking exercise. The trust commissioned work from independent consultants which demonstrated that the existing ISS service costs were within market range. Based on this the trust considered renewing the existing service provider. At the same time the trust was offered a cost reduction package, which included significant reductions within the contract of over &#163;1 million per annum and the part-absorption of a number of annual cost pressures, at the supplier's risk, up to 2018. These factors were considered by the Trust Board on <phrase class="date" code="2010-07-28">28 July 2010</phrase> and the decision taken to instruct CRHC to extend the ISS contract to 2018 on these terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.266W.6/3">The contract between CRCH and ISS has been continued with the same output specifications and service agreements in terms of the standard and quality of services ISS are required to deliver. So despite the cost reduction programmes, it is not expected patients and staff will experience any changes in these services. Ministers are satisfied that the trust has therefore secured overall value for money from its renegotiation of this contract and do not therefore intend to discuss this issue with the chief executive of the trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.266W.6/4">Where national health service hospitals renegotiate existing contracts, relevant business cases and other supporting information should be publicly available for discussion, subject to the commercial interests of the NHS. Final and approved documents must also be published, for example under a trust's Freedom of Information publication scheme, which is again subject to commercial considerations.</p>

	<p pid="a.274W.6/1">The UK pesticides regulatory body-the Health and Safety Executive's Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD)-has liaised with other EU regulatory authorities that have imposed restrictions on the use of these pesticides. It also reviews developments on how risks to bee health from the use of pesticides are assessed and monitored. CRD scientists attended the 10th International Symposium of the International Commission for Plant-Bee Relationships (ICPBR) on Hazards of Pesticides to Bees, in October 2008; no new scientific evidence was presented at this meeting, or more recently, to suggest a need for changes to current UK pesticide authorisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.6/2">Ministers have also considered scientific advice, including views of the independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides, on a report issued last year by a number of environmental organisations-the Buglife report &quot;The impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on bumblebees, honeybees and other non-target invertebrates (2009)2. The report highlighted a need for data on the impacts of neonicotinoid pesticides on overwintering of bees in the risk assessment process. This issue had already been identified by regulators and is being addressed through changes to the EU regulatory data requirements. Government scientists have continued to keep up to date with emerging findings and we are supporting further work in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.274W.6/3">The Government have regularly considered the available evidence in this area and there is no need for an additional review. CRD would act on any substantive evidence should incidents occur in the UK and will continue to monitor research and developments in other EU member states and elsewhere to see if they are relevant to the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.278W.5/1">Crayfish plague is not a notifiable disease in England and Wales and is therefore not subject to any formal controls. However, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) does investigate all reported mortalities of crayfish. It also provides advice to other agencies and stakeholders on the most effective ways to contain the disease in the case of a confirmed outbreak. It is believed that most populations of signal crayfish in Great Britain are likely to carry the pathogen causing this disease, and so efforts to prevent the spread of the disease have concentrated on preventing the spread of the carrier species.</p>
	<p pid="a.278W.5/2">Outbreaks of crayfish plague have been rare in recent years, but to reduce the risk, several measures have been put in place by the Environment Agency (EA). For example, fish movements are licensed through Section 30' consents: through this licensing procedure, the EA is careful to ensure that fish from waters that contain signal crayfish are not moved to those where native crayfish occur. There is an agreed protocol with Natural England to protect protected wildlife sites containing native crayfish.</p>

	<p pid="a.285W.0/3">The guidance advises that, in cases which involve the very long term (at least fifty years), and which involve substantial and irreversible wealth transfers between generations, a sensitivity calculation should be carried out on the discount rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.285W.0/4">The sensitivity calculation should exclude the 'pure time preference' component of the discount rate. This reflects society's preference for consuming the benefits of policies sooner rather than later so, in some part, reflects impatience. It is not ethically defensible for the pure time preference, or impatience, of the current generation to lead to decisions which do not take full account of the welfare of future generations.</p>
	<p pid="a.285W.0/5">The other components of the discount rate reflect such factors as the expected growth in consumption (the fact that, if people are expected to be better off in the future than they are now, an extra unit of consumption is generally taken to be worth less), which should continue to be allowed for in long term policy assessments.</p>

	<p pid="a.308W.11/1">Since December, when Parliament approved maximum tuition charges for academic year 2012/13, we have received a number of representations on behalf of students, universities and other organisations. We are considering these, as well as maintaining our regular contacts with bodies representing both institutions and students, as we move to finalise the higher education student support package.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.11/2">Our next legislative steps to put the new system in place are through clauses in the Education Bill currently before Parliament. These will provide for the introduction of new, more progressive, interest rates on the repayment of student loans, and also allow us to regulate tuition charges for part-time courses, to which we will be extending loan support so that eligible part-time students will no longer have to pay for tuition up-front.</p>

We believe they should offer a sure foundation for states and businesses to improve their performance with regard to human rights.

	<p pid="a.309W.5/3">We have worked closely with Professor Ruggie as he refines the principles, following his consultations with businesses, states and civil society organisations. The guiding principles are due for consideration by the UN Human Rights Council in June 2011 and the UK will work to build consensus for their adoption. Further information on Professor Ruggie's work in his capacity as the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on Business and Human Rights is available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.311W.6/1">The Health and Safety Executive advises Government on matters relating to worker safety and occupational illness. HSE's evidence is that asbestos is Britain's biggest industrial killer, responsible for an estimated 4,000 deaths per year. HSE's 'Asbestos: Hidden Killer' campaign was aimed at tradespeople such as plumbers, electricians and joiners who are the group currently at highest risk from exposure to potentially fatal asbestos fibres.</p>
	<p pid="a.311W.6/2">Evidence has been used to inform the Hidden Killer project from the start with independent researchers monitoring the effectiveness of all phases of the campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.311W.6/3">Full details of the evaluation on both phases are available on HSE's website at:</p>

	<p pid="a.311W.6/5">Continental Research evaluated the first national wave of activity (February 2009); their results demonstrated the campaign achieved excellent recognition with 80% of the target audience aware of publicity surrounding asbestos and 72% aware of specific elements of the press or radio adverts. Crucially 89% of the target audience agreed that the adverts were &quot;aimed at someone like me&quot; and over half of those who saw or heard the advertising claim to have taken more safety precautions when working with asbestos.</p>
	<p pid="a.311W.6/6">The second wave of national activity was evaluated by BMG Research and demonstrates further significant uplifts in already high levels of awareness surrounding the risk of asbestos (to 85%). The attitudinal response remained positive with significant uplifts in the proportion agreeing it is &quot;aimed at someone like me&quot; (to 93%) and that if &quot;got me thinking about may exposure at work&quot; (90%). Outcomes include that nine in 10 of those who recognise an element of the campaign report having taken, or planning to take, some action as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.311W.6/7">Traffic to HSE's website has been monitored with a 600% increase on page requests compared to a similar period the year before.</p>

	<p pid="a.313W.5/1">The Government takes gas safety and awareness of carbon monoxide issues very seriously and provides significant information on websites and in published information. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) advises consumers to always use a Gas Safe registered engineer for all gas work in their home, including domestic boiler installation, and to ensure that any gas appliances are regularly serviced and maintained. Although not a substitute for the correct installation or maintenance of an appliance, HSE also strongly recommends the use of audible carbon monoxide alarms.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.5/2">In April 2009 HSE launched the Gas Safe Register, the statutory registration scheme for gas engineers. The scheme has the strong focus of raising consumer awareness of gas safety risks and has undertaken significant campaigns, including national TV advertising, coverage on a wide variety of consumer programmes and national and regional press and radio, along with regional and community events. Research by the Gas Safe Register has shown that 81% of consumers are aware of gas safety risks and the Gas Safe Register.</p>
	<p pid="a.313W.5/3">HSE and Gas Safe Register continue to work to raise awareness of the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning, including focusing on vulnerable groups. The 'Let's talk gas safety' campaign focused at the Over 65's has recently launched, involving close working with local 'Age UK' groups and this will be supplemented throughout the year with both general and targeted awareness raising promotions and ongoing media campaigns.</p>

These figures have been scaled up to the overall total, by the application of a single rating factor therefore subtotals based on uprated 5% data may differ from 100% data because of sampling variation in the 5% sample.<br/> 3.

There are no time limits for cases to be heard or judgments to be handed down at these courts. The length of time an appeal takes may be extended further should it be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union. For the first two quarters of 2010-11 70,300 immigration appeals were received by the Tribunal Service and during the same period 73 appeals proceeded to the Court of Appeal, while four were determined at the Supreme Court.</p>

	<p pid="a.341W.3/1">We are committed to giving every child, and young person, the best possible start in life and recognise the importance of high quality teaching particularly for those with special educational needs (SEN). This is vital if they are to achieve their potential. We know that currently there are over 56,000 schoolchildren with an autistic spectrum disorder. I believe that local authorities are best placed to assess the skills and expertise of those who teach pupils with SEN and to develop their own plans to improve the quality of provision, working with schools and parents to ensure that the necessary expertise is in place in their area. We expect all local authorities to provide support for children with special educational needs and we will work with them to ensure that there is sufficient high-quality provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.341W.3/2">To support the understanding of the work force in relation to SEN we have published resources for use in initial teacher training and Continuing Professional Development through the Inclusion Development Programme. A specific resource focusing on supporting pupils with an autistic spectrum disorder is included.</p>
	<p pid="a.341W.3/3">In addition the Children's Workforce Development Council has been remitted to support those who work with disabled children and young people in mainstream and specialist settings. This includes determining what specialist skills, knowledge and behaviours are needed by people working with disabled children and young people.</p>

It set out the funding policy changes to be implemented in 2011/12 and stated there would be a system of transitional protection to smooth the implementation of changes year on year. For 2011/12 this will mean no provider facing a reduction in funding per student of more than 3%. The precise reduction or increase each provider will face will depend on its individual circumstances and the YPLA is currently working through those calculations.

Since 2008 the gap has remained the same following the introduction of a consistent funding methodology between all types of providers. The methodology used by KPMG was to cost identical programmes for each provider type and then to assess the difference. The conclusion was that the gap was due to a 3% difference in funding rates and 2.6% paid to schools for teachers' pension payments. KPMG also stated that the Teachers' Pay Grant (TPG) was now a clearly identifiable grant for schools with sixth forms that was not available to FE and other providers. Including the TPG in the calculation widened the gap to 9.6%. Other factors such as differences in treatment for VAT were not considered to form part of the funding gap.</p>

	<p pid="a.345W.5/2">In developing our proposals for reform of higher education funding we have received a number of representations from individuals and institutions, including in the craft sector. The reforms will shift the balance of public funds for teaching from direct grant to institutions to funding that follows the informed choices made by individual students. This will provide strong incentives for institutions to focus on providing high quality teaching as efficiently as possible. However, we do not expect the overall income of the sector to reduce. Putting together the remaining funding for recurrent grant for teaching and research and the Government's loans outlay to institutions on the upfront costs of graduate contributions, the aggregate effect could be that the total investment by this Department in institutions in England would rise in cash terms from around &#163;9 billion in 2010-11 to around &#163;10 billion in 2014-15 while broadly maintaining existing levels of participation.</p>

	<p pid="a.356W.6/1">The Department has not provided estimates of the cost per kilowatt hour of fossil generation in 2030 to provide back up to intermittency. In principle this would depend on a range of factors including the fixed costs of the plant, and the prevailing wholesale fuel price.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.6/2">Fossil fuel power stations are not the only way to provide back up for intermittent wind generation. There are a number of alternative solutions including responsive demand, interconnection and storage such as pumped storage, batteries and hydrogen, all of which are expected to play a role in the future energy mix.</p>
	<p pid="a.356W.6/3">The Department has however published a number of studies which give estimates of the total cost of fossil fuel capacity under a range of renewables scenarios. These studies, the Redpoint Analysis (2009) and UK Renewable Energy Strategy: Impact Assessment for the Centralised Electricity Sector, are available at:</p>

	<p pid="a.357W.3/2" class="indent"><i> (a)</i> As part of the Giving Green Paper published in December 2010, levels of corporate donations were assessed. Drawing on data from the Charity Market Monitor, the assessment found that in 2008-09 corporate donations to charity ranged from under 1% to 48% of pre-tax profits. On average, in over 80% of industries, donations by firms were less than 1% of pre-tax profits. In terms of amounts donated, companies in the pharmaceutical industry gave the largest amounts. Trends in corporate giving were not assessed as part of the Giving Green Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.357W.3/3" class="indent"><i> (b)</i> The Giving Green Paper, published in December 2010, cited analysis carried out by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) and the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF).

In 2009-10, 28.4 million adults (56%) donated to charity in a typical month. We do not hold data showing donations over the last 30 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.359W.2/1">Encouraging social action, including volunteering is one of the three aims of the Governments vision for a big society. In December 2010 the Government published the &quot;Giving Green&quot; paper, which sought to start a debate on how we can make social action a norm and encourage more people to give their time. The Green paper announced two new funds to increase volunteering which will support agencies that rely on volunteer staff. The two funds are:</p>
	<p pid="a.359W.2/2" class="indent">1. A &#163;40 million volunteering match fund to encourage private sector investment in volunteering.</p>
	<p pid="a.359W.2/3" class="indent">2. A &#163;42.5 million fund to support local volunteering infrastructure making it easier for people to find local volunteering opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.359W.2/4">Citizens Advice Bureaux were also able to apply to the &#163;100 million transition fund which will help civil society organisations delivering front-line services to become more resilient in the changing funding environment. The first round of payments to successful applicants will be made by the end of March 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.359W.2/5">In addition, the Cabinet Office is the lead coordinating body for the 2011 European year of volunteering. One of the main priorities for the year is to encourage and enable individuals to make a contribution within their communities and help social issues by volunteering.</p>

The cancer incidence figures for previous years, in this case 1997 to 2007, differ from those in the Annual Reference Volumes Series MB1 &quot;Cancer statistics registrations, England&quot; because the figures in this answer were obtained from the National Cancer Registrations system which is a live database.</p>

Mutualisation projects are being driven by employees across the public sector. The Cabinet Office pathfinder programme includes cross-section of 21 projects to build awareness of these opportunities. Pathfinders do not receive any financial assistance from Cabinet Office, as such there is a not a formal applications process for becoming a Cabinet Office mutual pathfinder.</p>

That is why the Government have launched 'Every Business Commits', which asks business to do its part not just in creating economic growth but also by adding its expertise to tackling social problems and building stronger communities. Every Business Commits goes beyond corporate social responsibility and calls on businesses to help create a more sustainable and community-centred approach to doing business. This might include investing in future skills, protecting the environment, supporting their local community, investing in employee wellbeing, and encouraging the development of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

The Localism Bill, currently receiving parliamentary scrutiny, sets out many of the provisions which will underpin this process. Decisions on local issues affecting social cohesion will be increasingly put into the hands of local communities, and the measures we are taking to encourage local transparency of local government services, data, and expenditure will further enable these communities to take an informed role in these decisions, and assess progress locally.</p>

	<p pid="a.373W.2/2" class="italic"> Letter from Stephen Penneck, dated February 2011:</p>
	<p pid="a.373W.2/3" class="indent">As Director General for the Office for National Statistics, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question relating to average number of hours per day spent by (a) boys and (b) girls in watching television (38385).</p>
	<p pid="a.373W.2/4" class="indent">In 2000, ONS conducted the UK Time Use Survey that aimed to measure the amount of time spent by the UK population on various activities. The survey showed that on average:</p>
	<p pid="a.373W.2/5" class="indent">boys aged between 8 and 15 spent 134 minutes per day watching TV and an additional 6 minutes watching videos or dvds.</p>
	<p pid="a.373W.2/6" class="indent">girls aged between 8 and 15 spent 131 minutes per day watching TV and an additional 7 minutes watching videos or dvds.</p>
	<p pid="a.373W.2/7" class="indent">In 2005 a further time use diary was collected on a much smaller scale, using a pre-coded diary as part of the NS Omnibus survey. This survey only asked questions to adults.</p>
