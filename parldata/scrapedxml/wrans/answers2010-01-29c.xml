Geoff Russell, the LSC's Acting Chief Executive, will write to the hon. Member for North Cornwall with the information requested and a copy of his reply will be placed in the House Libraries. Since 2008, the conditions for all EMA payments have included behaviour and effort as well as attendance. We have never stipulated that bonuses are only payable where a student has submitted all coursework on time. The decision to award a bonus payment is made by the learning provider and the reasons behind individual decisions are not held centrally.</p>

	<p pid="c.1107W.2/2">The report demonstrates the important role that LOtC could have in raising young people's engagement by drawing on research from around the globe and providing evidence that children achieve higher academically, have greater levels of physical fitness, increased confidence and self-esteem, show leadership qualities, and have greater engagement and motivation in learning. The report is available at</p>

	<p pid="c.1107W.2/4">Where a child is educated at home on a full time basis the level of formality will vary according to the wishes of the parent and the needs of the child. Some parents will adopt a more child led approach to learning while others will prefer a more formal approach or something that takes in elements of a range of different approaches. In each case the education provided must be suitable to the age, ability, aptitude and any special educational needs that the child may have. It will not always be possible to distinguish between formal learning and non-formal learning in this context.</p>

	<p pid="c.1123W.11/2">Regular communications were issued to staff across the organisation via intranet and email ahead of, and during, the period of severe weather advising on the actions to be taken. Advice was as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.1123W.11/3" class="indent">Managers were instructed to have their business continuity plans and key contacts readily available for activation.</p>
	<p pid="c.1123W.11/4" class="indent">Staff were advised not to take undue risks to travel to work if it was not safe.</p>
	<p pid="c.1123W.11/5" class="indent">Staff who were unable to attend their normal place of work must inform their manager that they are delayed or will not attend for duty. Where possible in these circumstances, staff were expected to work from home or, subject to management authorisation and organisation, attend another Ministry of Justice office or location.</p>
	<p pid="c.1123W.11/6">Following the adoption of these principles, the impact on departmental business is considered to be relatively low. There were a number of closures of courts and tribunals at various stages and some courts, offices and prisons had to cope with fewer staff for short periods. In general, business continuity plans were activated without incurring additional expenditure, with work being prioritised and postponed. It would incur disproportionate cost to contact every local office, prison, court, probation board or trust and tribunal to obtain a financial impact assessment and to analyse and collate this information.</p>

	<p pid="c.1127W.0/6" class="indent">The UK Government has published a compact designed to &quot;reinvigorate&quot; EU economies and build &quot;strong, sustainable and balanced&quot; growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.1127W.0/7" class="indent">Gordon Brown welcomed the new President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy, to Downing Street this morning to discuss the priorities for Europe including action on the economy, climate change and security.</p>

Mr van Rompuy said the EU has responded swiftly to the situation, with EU members already pledging &#8364;400 million, including &#8364;30 million from the UK. The EU is committed to helping Haiti with longer term reconstruction, Mr van Rompuy said.</p>

The consultation document stated that the Government's preferred approach was to ensure tenants received adequate notice if they needed to move by giving courts the power to delay possession and introducing a new notice of intention to enforce possession.

This states that movements within the EU must take place between approved businesses and must be accompanied by an Administrative Accompanying Document (AAD) at all times. Once the goods have been received at their destination, the consignee must discharge the movement by returning a report of receipt to the consignor.</p>

	<p pid="c.1148W.3/1">To date there have been four annual indicators set with regards to chlamydia screening/testing.

	<p pid="c.1148W.3/2">In April 2007, we introduced a national health service local delivery plan data monitoring line (LDP PSA11d). The LDP line measured the proportion of the population aged 15 to 24 years screened for chlamydia through the National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP). The expectation set for the LDP was for 15 per cent. of the 15 to 24-year-old resident population in each primary care trust (PCT) to be screened for chlamydia between <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.3/3">In 2008-09 chlamydia was included as a tier two vital signs indicator. This measures the proportion of the 15 to 24-year-old total population tested for chlamydia outside of genito-urinary medicine clinics. In 2008-09 the expectation was for 17 per cent. of the target population to be tested for chlamydia, 25 per cent. in 2009-10 and 35 per cent. in 2010- 11.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.3/4">Data on the numbers tested in the NCSP, nationally, in each region, in each PCT within London and the testing levels achieved, have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="c.1148W.3/5">The Department does not break down PCT allocations by individual policy areas, at either the national or local level, or monitor how PCTs spend their allocations. It is for PCTs to decide their priorities for investment locally taking in to account both priorities and the national health service operating framework. However, a National Audit office report 'Young people's sexual health: the National Chlamydia Screening Programme', published on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-12">12 November 2009</phrase>, estimated that between 2003 and 2009, &#163;100 million had been spent on delivering the programme.</p>

	<p pid="c.1154W.0/1">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has advised that the terms of reference of its internal governance review are published on the Authority's website <a href="http://www.hfea.gov.uk/5743.html">www.hfea.gov.uk/5743.html</a></p>
	<p pid="c.1154W.0/2">The HFEA has also advised that following consideration of advice prepared by the Chief Executive, the Members of the Authority determined it unnecessary for the review to be undertaken by an external person. This was a matter for the HFEA and the Department of Health was not involved. The purpose of the review is to assess the adequacy of the Authority's revised governance arrangements in relation to the threshold between administrative enforcement of its powers and the sphere of criminal law. The HFEA considers this internal review to be the right way to look critically at what happened and to ensure changes made to its processes and procedures provide it with adequate governance arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.1154W.0/3">The HFEA has advised that the senior officer undertaking the review has devoted many months to reviewing the documentation held by the Authority. This officer will shortly contact those involved, inviting them to contribute.</p>
	<p pid="c.1154W.0/4">The HFEA has been undergoing an overall programme of change since 2008. This followed the changes to the Authority's membership and its senior management team that began in 2007. The change programme has included the establishment of a new appeals committee, a new compliance and enforcement policy, indicative sanctions guidance and a clear separation of functions between inspection of clinics and licensing. The internal governance review will inform the Authority as to whether further changes are needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.1154W.0/5">The annual allocation of grant-in-aid funding is determined on the basis of the HFEA's annual business plan and its estimate of the funding needed to conduct its business in that year, which may involve some expenditure on legal assistance.
