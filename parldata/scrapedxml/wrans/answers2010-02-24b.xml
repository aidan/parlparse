These issues have been covered particularly in discussions with the Inspector General of the Nigerian police force and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation. Our high commission in Abuja and the Department for International Development (DFID) will continue to raise UK concerns at the highest level, and to encourage reform and accountability in Nigeria's police force, for example through DFID's Justice for All programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.554W.0/1">The trafficking of drugs to the UK is the subject of constant attention by the law enforcement agencies working collaboratively, in the United Kingdom and overseas, against the drugs and individuals involved. In 2008-09 SOCA was involved, with partner agencies, in seizures of 88 tonnes of cocaine and heroin. SOCA works closely with international partners to help them destroy production capability in source countries and deny traffickers the ability to operate their routes to the UK. This enforcement activity appears to have contributed to increases in the wholesale price of cocaine and a reduction in its purity at street level, changes which are suggestive of a shortage of supply of the drug in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.554W.0/2">We are currently implementing the recommendations of 'Extending Our Reach: a comprehensive approach to tackling serious organised crime' which was published in July 2009 which, through a wide range of measures, will improve the UK's effectiveness against organised crime, including drugs trafficking.</p>

Our discussions immediately followed my visit to the Joint Inter-Agency Task Force in Key West, Florida, where joint work is producing strong results in interdicting the traffic in cocaine from Latin America and the Caribbean.

	<p pid="b.569W.6/1">The Government are taking decisive steps to tackle the effects of the recession, reduce unemployment and is committed to helping every unemployed person return to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.569W.6/2">While we do not operate programmes specifically aimed at supporting redundant workers from the financial services sector, we have made available up to &#163;5 billion, since November 2008, to offer a substantial package of new back to work support to all jobseekers, irrespective of their background, throughout their time on jobseeker's allowance.</p>
	<p pid="b.569W.6/3">We have quadrupled funding to the Rapid Response Service which provides support to employees under threat of redundancy, helping them to find new employment quickly.</p>
	<p pid="b.569W.6/4">We have also significantly increased the funding to maintain and increase the existing support that is available to newly unemployed claimants through Jobcentre Plus and its external partners. As well as help with jobsearch, skills and access to basic skills training, newly unemployed people now have day one access to Local Employment Partnership vacancies, help to meet the expenses involved in finding work and, for some, access to Work Trials.</p>
	<p pid="b.569W.6/5">In April 2009, we strengthened this support by introducing group jobsearch sessions specifically targeted at newly unemployed people, as well as specialist back to work support for newly unemployed professionals and executives, delivered through recruitment agencies. We built on this in the recent White Paper &quot;Building Britain's Recovery: Achieving Full Employment&quot;, and from spring 2010, we will be strengthening the support offered to professional customers by offering further access to a follow-up session with these agencies to maintain the momentum of their journey back to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.569W.6/6">Further back to work support is available to all jobseekers throughout their claim and the longer somebody is on jobseeker's allowance, the more support they can get. This currently includes access to recruitment subsidies, self-employment support, work focused training and volunteering at six months and more intensive personalised support from external providers later in a claim.</p>
	<p pid="b.569W.6/7">There is also a substantial package of support available to 18 to 24-year-olds to help them get back to work which includes a guarantee of a job, work focused training or work experiences at the six month stage in a claim.</p>

	<p pid="b.576W.3/1">Benefit sanctions are aimed at establishing a framework of rights and responsibilities with benefit customers, and encourage positive outcomes by obliging customers in receipt of working age benefits to engage with the support on offer and help them move into employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.3/2">Benefit sanctions have been an integral part of Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) since it was introduced and the detail is set out in the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.3/3">Since April 2000 the sanction regulations for Incapacity Benefit customers have been set out in various Work Focused Interviews (WFI) regulations: The Social Security (Work-focused Interviews) Regulations 2000 No. 897; The Social Security (Jobcentre Plus Interviews) Regulations 2001 No. 3210; The Social Security (Jobcentre Plus Interviews) Regulations 2002 No. 1703; The Social Security (Incapacity Benefit Work-focused Interviews) Regulations 2003 No. 2439; and The Social Security (Incapacity Benefit Work-focused Interviews) Regulations 2008 No. 2928, Regulation 9.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.3/4">The sanctions regime for Employment and Support Allowance customers is set out in The Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008 No. 794, Regulation 63.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.3/5">The Income Support sanction regime was introduced through the Social Security (Work-focused Interviews for Lone Parents) and Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 2000; The Social Security (Jobcentre Plus Interviews) Regulations 2001; and the Social Security (Jobcentre Plus) Regulations 2002 respectively. Copies of all of this legislation are available in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.3/6">The Department continually reviews the effectiveness of conditionality and the associated sanctions regimes across all working age benefits and undertakes research on their effectiveness in supporting customers to move into employment. Published reports on the operation of sanctions are listed on the Department for Work and Pensions website at:</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.3/7" class="indent"><a href="http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/rrs-index.asp">http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/rrs-index.asp</a></p>
	<p pid="b.576W.3/8">and are available in the House Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.3/9">The 2008 White Paper 'Raising expectations and increasing support: reforming welfare for the future' (CM7 506), set out the Government's intention to test a model of escalating sanctions based on the principles set out in the 2008 independent review of conditionality 'Realising Potential: A vision for personalised conditionality and support' by Professor Paul Gregg. The model introduces five stages of sanctions, initially in Progression to Work pathfinder areas, which will allow for more attempts at contact and in depth case reviews with lone parents and partners of certain benefit recipients, and a number of stages before a financial sanction is considered.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.3/10">Furthermore, the Welfare Reform Act 2009 introduced two new sanctions to the Jobseeker's Allowance. The first is the power to sanction a customer who commits acts of violence or threatening behaviour against Jobcentre Plus staff during the course of a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance. The second is a sanction for Jobseeker's Allowance customers who fail to attend their mandatory appointments as part of the requirements of receiving Jobseeker's Allowance, this change will be implemented from April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.3/11">The Welfare Reform Act 2009 also introduced the power to sanction lone parents on Income Support and partners of certain benefit recipients, with younger children, for not undertaking agreed work related activity. The first stage of implementation for these measures will be in October 2010 in the Progression to Work pathfinder Jobcentre Plus districts.</p>
	<p pid="b.576W.3/12">As part of the ongoing review of support for Jobcentre Plus customers with disabilities and health conditions, we are reviewing the current sanctions regime for Employment and Support Allowance customers and we will publish details about any proposed changes in spring 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.579W.0/1">It is the role of Jobcentre Plus to work with all customers and help them overcome any barrier to getting into work. where this involves meeting a skills need, a customer, including one in receipt of either incapacity benefit or employment and support allowance, can be referred to a range of training provision provided by either Jobcentre Plus or the Learning and Skills Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.579W.0/2">There is a wide range of training provision on offer throughout the country for all customers, including those in receipt of incapacity benefit and employment and support allowance. Customer training needs are assessed on an individual basis and customers are then referred to provision that not only meet their needs but also the needs of local employers. The adequacy of skills training is therefore not assessed on a national basis but is driven by the local labour market and an assessment of the individual's needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.579W.0/3">The primary national return to work programme for people claiming incapacity benefits or employment and support allowance is Pathways to Work. In Pathways to Work areas, private and voluntary sector providers are contracted to tailor provision to meet the needs of the customer. It is their responsibility to ensure that any training is adequate and appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.579W.0/4">Last October we announced a review of Pathways to Work. The White Paper, 'Building Britain's Recovery: Achieving Full Employment', published in December, set out our underpinning principles for reform and confirms that we will bring forward proposals in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="b.579W.0/5">Train to Gain is not routinely offered to those on benefits. It is a programme aimed specifically at employers, giving them better access to a range of training opportunities for improving the skills of their employees and the productivity of their business.</p>
	<p pid="b.579W.0/6">Over the last few years, to boost demand and respond to the downturn the Government introduced a number of temporary funding flexibilities for qualifications delivered as part of Train to Gain. Until August 2010, this includes providing full funding in respect of full level 2 qualifications (5 A*-C GCSEs or the vocational equivalent) where the employee already holds a qualification at that level.</p>
	<p pid="b.579W.0/7">The National Skills Strategy Skills for Growth (November 2009), set out the Government's intention to focus their substantial investment through Train to Gain on areas of high growth and ensure a greater level of co-funding by employers. The emphasis will therefore be on fully supporting employers to up skill their employees, with employers contributing the costs where their staff need to reskill.</p>

The review will focus on the management and leadership of the family justice system and what can be done to promote informed settlement and agreement of family law cases outside of the court system. It will seek to learn from the experience of other jurisdictions and from research and will be supported by the appointment of an expert, external advisory group. The review will report in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="b.584W.5/1">The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) is taking forward a wide-ranging programme of work to manage the risks of violent extremism and radicalisation among offenders. Part of this programme includes work to research, develop and evaluate potential intervention approaches.</p>
	<p pid="b.584W.5/2">Given the comparatively low numbers of terrorist offenders and the different motivations and behaviours they present in relation to their offending, it is difficult to identify with statistical significance and reliability factors associated with terrorist offending or reoffending. Therefore prison and probation staff need to use all available sources of evidence to assess the risk of serious harm or reconviction which terrorist offenders pose, and to identify appropriate intervention strategies.</p>
	<p pid="b.584W.5/3">For any intervention to be effective it will need to target the reasons why people offend which are different for each individual. There are currently no group work programmes specifically accredited for use with those convicted of offences related to terrorism. NOMS is working to understand the potential use of a wide range of intervention strategies which may help combat violent extremist offending and address the criminogenic factors of the individual violent extremist offender.</p>

	<p pid="b.585W.2/9">Prisoners released on End of Custody Licence, ECL, are paid subsistence in place of benefits. This subsistence payment is necessary to ensure that during their period of ECL they are able to purchase food and meet essential living expenses.

	<p pid="b.585W.2/10">When the ECL scheme was first introduced, offenders released for the maximum of 18 days received their subsistence payments in instalments through the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), who make payments on behalf of the Ministry of Justice. Prisoners released for less than 18 days were paid in full by prisons on release. From <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-23">23 June 2008</phrase>, payment in instalments by DWP was extended to prisoners spending 15 days or more on ECL. From <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-15">15 December 2008</phrase>, payment in instalments by DWP was further extended to offenders spending eight days or more on ECL. The advantage of the system of payments through DWP is that prisoners receive their subsistence in instalments rather than in a single lump sum.</p>

	<p pid="b.597W.8/1">There are currently four regions where there are MOD or defence-related commercial sites that are likely to be considered for submarine dismantling project activities. These regions are Devon, Fife, Argyll and Bute and Berkshire. A number of briefings to elected representatives in these regions have already been carried out, including to the hon. Member, and others have been scheduled.</p>
	<p pid="b.597W.8/2">The project is at an early stage in the process to develop an effective public consultation and associated strategic environmental assessment. This work has included identification of existing nuclear sites, both defence and civil, that are technically capable of submarine dismantling or storing the resultant radioactive waste. At this stage, two sites have been identified that could be technically capable of carrying out dismantling activities and 12 sites have been identified that could be technically capable of carrying out waste storage. Technical capability is only one aspect and the wider suitability of sites has not yet been assessed.</p>
	<p pid="b.597W.8/3">Further analysis work is still required and, until the public consultation is complete, no decisions will be taken on sites for either submarine dismantling or waste storage. I am withholding details of the individual sites identified at this time, as the MOD intend to publish this information in the future as part of the planned public consultation and strategic environmental assessment.</p>

LSOAs are smaller than wards and are designed to remain consistent in size, and over time, to allow more detailed identification of pockets of deprivation. There are 32,482 LSOAs in England with an average population of 1,500 people.</p>
	<p pid="b.610W.3/2">The indices are presented by ranking each area to show relative, rather than absolute levels of, deprivation. LSOAs are ranked from 1, most deprived, to 32,482, least deprived.</p>

	<p pid="b.613W.2/1">Chapter 11 of the &quot;Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities&quot;, issued by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in July 2006 under section 182 of the Housing Act 1996 (&quot;the 1996 Act&quot;) provides guidance to local authorities on determining whether housing applicants became homeless, or threatened with homelessness, intentionally or unintentionally. Supplementary guidance on intentional homelessness, in respect of applicants who face homelessness following difficulties in mortgage commitments, was issued by the Secretary of State in August 2009 under s.182 of the 1996 Act. The guidance is available on the Department's website at the following link:</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.2/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/homelessnesscode">http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/homelessnesscode</a></p>
	<p pid="b.613W.2/3">Under section 190(2)(a) of the 1996 Act, where a local housing authority in England are satisfied that an applicant is eligible for assistance, has a priority need for accommodation but has become homeless intentionally, the authority must secure that accommodation is available for the applicant's occupation for such period as they consider will give the applicant a reasonable opportunity of securing accommodation for his or her occupation. Under section 190(2)(b), the authority must also provide the applicant with (or secure that the applicant is provided with) advice and assistance in any attempts the applicant may make to secure that accommodation becomes available for his or her occupation. Under section 188(1) of the 1996 Act, authorities also have a duty to secure accommodation for applicants, pending inquiries, if they have reason to believe the applicant may eligible for assistance, homeless and may have a priority need for accommodation. This duty will apply even if the authority has reason to believe the applicant may have become homeless intentionally.</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.2/4">Information about English local housing authorities' activities under the homelessness legislation (Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) is collected at local authority level, and published by the Department in the quarterly statistical release on statutory homelessness, available both in the Library and via the CLG website:</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.2/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/homelessnessq32009">http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/statistics/homelessnessq32009</a></p>
	<p pid="b.613W.2/6">Under the legislation, the priority need categories include, among others, applicants with whom dependent children reside or might reasonably be expected to reside. Data collected includes the number of applicants accepted by local housing authorities as eligible for assistance, in priority need but intentionally homeless.</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.2/7">The number of households found to be eligible for assistance, intentionally homeless and in priority need in the years 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 is 10930, 9560 and 8890 respectively. Information about the number of these households that included children is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.2/8">Information about the number of households found intentionally homeless and provided with emergency accommodation, and for how long they were accommodated, is not held centrally.</p>
	<p pid="b.613W.2/9">Data on households found to be eligible for assistance, intentionally homeless and in priority need are provided in live table 627 on statutory homelessness, which is published on the Department's website:</p>

	<p pid="b.613W.2/11">The number of households accepted as eligible for assistance, in priority need but intentionally homeless and accommodated in temporary accommodation for such period as will give the applicant a reasonable opportunity to secure accommodation was 1370, 810 and 840 at the end of March 2007, March 2008 and March 2009, respectively. The latest quarterly data show 600 such households in temporary accommodation at the end of September 2009.</p>

	<p pid="b.616W.5/1">This Department has made no such estimates. Assessment and inspection is carried out by a number of inspectorates, including the Audit Commission which is sponsored by Communities and Local Government (CLG). The cost to the Audit Commission of its assessment and inspection is covered by a mixture of the fees paid by local authorities and direct grant from CLG. In 2009-10, the grant from CLG for the Commission's local government and Fire and Rescue Authority work totalled &#163;20.2 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.616W.5/2">This Department has not conducted or commissioned any research on these matters. However, the Audit Commission, on behalf of the joint inspectorates responsible for Comprehensive Area Assessment (CAA), commissioned an independent evaluation of CAA. This is looking at implementation and delivery of the new arrangements, co-ordination across inspectorates and the initial cost to inspected bodies under CAA. The evaluation report is expected to be published in March.</p>
	<p pid="b.616W.5/3">As part of the Government's Smarter Government White Paper, CLG are leading on commitments to remove indicators that are no longer relevant or needed by April 2010 and reducing the overall number of national indicators against which local authorities will have to report their performance for the next spending period. We are also running a number of Total Place pilots and have invited them to provide information on the costs of assessment and inspection. The Department is preparing a report on Total Place which will issue at Budget 2010. HM Treasury are leading a review of the work and number of inspectorates, supporting the Government's aims to reduce the burdens connected to assessment and inspection.</p>

	<p pid="b.621W.0/23" class="italic"> Changes in labour force estimates</p>
	<p pid="b.621W.0/24">In 1998, fundamental changes were introduced to the labour questions on the June Agricultural and Horticultural Census in England. It appears that this change in questions may have led to the recording of additional Labour who were not previously included in the returns.</p>
	<p pid="b.621W.0/25">We therefore advise caution when comparing the 1998 results with previous years. The June 2001 figures include estimates for holdings that have been converted from the temporary register. Further improvements to the register of agricultural holdings have also been made, mainly as a result of livestock tracing. As a result it is not possible to directly compare the June 2000 and June 2001 results. Furthermore, it is not possible to backdate the existing labour series as it is impossible to estimate how long the newly registered holdings have been in existence. However, the June 2001 results have also been calculated assuming the register changes had not taken place to provide comparable figures.</p>

	<p pid="b.627W.0/1">The Government have supported the &quot;Growing Schools&quot; programme since 2001. The programme provides easy access to a wide range of curriculum-based resources and a comprehensive continuous professional development programme for teachers. In the last three years this has been funded at &#163;350,000 per annum. It is up to schools to identify suitable space for food growing.</p>
	<p pid="b.627W.0/2">DEFRA announced in the Government's new Food Strategy (Food 2030), published in early January, that it would be providing further support to the programme. The new DEFRA funding will build the capacity of the programme and enable a further 65,000 pupils, parents and staff to gain hands-on experience of growing food. This will be included as part of a forthcoming tender exercise which will appoint the contractor for the next phase of the programme.</p>

Between industries the difference in estimated costs can be more marked.

	<p pid="b.652W.5/1">Salford has been focusing on narrowing the gap in achievement between all pupils with special educational needs (SEN) and their peers, working with schools on using the inclusion development programme, which improves the skills of the workforce in meeting the needs of children with SEN and preparing to roll-out progression guidance, which supports schools in setting high expectations for what children with SEN should achieve.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.5/2">Salford's special schools are increasingly providing out-reach support to mainstream schools to build their capacity and better support their pupils.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.5/3">Salford is also part of the Greater Manchester Challenge and is benefiting from additional investment to extend the great practice that already exists within the city region, finding innovative methods and local solutions to crack the cycle of disadvantage and educational underachievement.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.5/4">As a result, Salford has narrowed the gaps between pupils with SEN and their peers at both key stage 2 and key stage 4. The percentage of pupils with SEN making three levels of progress across key stage 3 and 4 has also risen significantly.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.5/5">The LSC has invested funding into a variety of projects which focus on improving educational outcomes in Salford. It is recognised that a high proportion of young people who are Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) when they leave school will have SEN. Current projects include:</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.5/6" class="indent">Providing additional support and personalised learning programmes to young people who, during key stage four, are identified as becoming at risk of disengaging from learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.5/7" class="indent">Working with learners in an individual way through foundation learning to deliver clear progression pathways; and</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.5/8" class="indent">Engagement with employers to develop supported work placements and training and to provide progression routes for learners with more complex learning difficulties and/or disabilities. It will also help partners to build capacity and provide adult learners with opportunities to develop their skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.5/9">The funding set aside for expenditure on SEN in 2009-10 by Salford LA is &#163;23,803,000<sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="b.652W.5/10" class="indent"><sup>(1)</sup> These figures include the Individual Schools' Budget for special schools, spending in maintained nursery, primary and secondary schools identified as &quot;notional SEN&quot;, the centrally retained element of the school budget, and the SEN element of the LA budget.</p>

It includes advice on pupils with sensory needs and pupils with disabilities.</p>
