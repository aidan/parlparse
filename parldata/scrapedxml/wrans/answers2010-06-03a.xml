	<p pid="a.53W.8/1">I have decided to withdraw from Parliament the Code of Practice for the welfare of game birds reared for sporting purposes because I do not consider that it is entirely based on scientific evidence, particularly in relation to the housing of breeding birds. I have also reconvened the working group which drafted the original code, with the intention of amending the code and re-laying it before Parliament for approval as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.66W.2/1">Making payments direct into an account, including a post office card account, is the way the Department pays pensions and benefits because it is safe, efficient and fast. Cheque payment is available for those customers who, exceptionally, cannot be paid into an account of any kind.</p>
	<p pid="a.66W.2/2">The Department has begun the process to replace the current system of cheques. Cheques are more vulnerable to fraud than payments into an account and the replacement product will better provide the security that is needed to protect the taxpayer against fraud and abuse. We have worked with stakeholders to ensure that the new service meets the needs of all customers who are unable to operate an account of any kind, including the more vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.66W.2/3">The Department's statistical information is broken down by benefit or pension account rather than by individual. As at February 2010, the latest date for which information is available, the number of state retirement pension accounts paid by cheque was around 44,000, or 0.4 percent. However, some state pensioners also receive additional benefits or allowances. Overall, this means that some 90,000 pensioner accounts, around 0.7 percent, are paid by cheque in respect of state pension, pension credit or other allowance. Some of these allowances will be combined together and paid as one cheque.</p>

	<p pid="a.68W.6/1">The Access for All programme was launched in 2006 and currently includes 148 stations, which are targeted to receive an accessible, step-free route to and between platforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.68W.6/2">Stations were selected based on footfall, weighted by the incidence of disability in the local area so as to prioritise investment where it could deliver the maximum benefit to disabled people. In addition, approximately a third of the funding was allocated to achieve an equitable regional spread, with train operators and others consulted on their priorities. There was not a minimum usage threshold for eligibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.68W.6/3">In addition, the Access for All small schemes programme has made match funding available for smaller enhancements at stations, meeting local needs. Applications to this fund have been assessed based on indicative value-for-money criteria of &#163;1 per annual passenger. To date, around &#163;23,500 has been offered to Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive for enhancements at Levenshulme including hearing induction loops and passenger information systems.</p>

	<p pid="a.75W.5/1">Applicants for the armed forces are required to declare any unspent convictions, in terms of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, as part of the application process. The general principle applied by each of the services is that any unspent convictions will be a bar to recruitment. However, in some exceptional cases applicants with unspent convictions are able to enter service, for example a one-off offence committed as a minor, but this is subject to authorisation from the appropriate single service manning authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.75W.5/2">There are some offences that will never be spent in terms of the Act and will permanently prevent service in the armed forces, for example, a custodial sentence of 30 months or more. Failure to disclose an unspent conviction represents a breakdown in trust and stating a falsehood on attestation. This will invariably result in dismissal.</p>

Sir John's update in March reported that to achieve a coherent and resilient ecological network we will need to look beyond existing designated sites and take account of landscape designations, local wildlife sites and green spaces.</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.16/3">The Government are also looking forward to the completion of work currently being carried out by Natural England on the implementation of landscape-scale enhancements to benefit wildlife. This will build on and use the lessons learned from existing work such as the Great Fen, a collaboration between Natural England, Environment Agency, the local Wildlife Trust and district council, which is joining up two national nature reserves through creating 3,700 ha of wetland habitat in Cambridgeshire, which will deliver benefits not only for biodiversity but also for water quality, recreation and local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.88W.16/4">In addition, this Government will deliver a White Paper, the first since 1990, that will, finally, take an integrated approach to the natural environment in all its aspects. By reflecting nature's real value in our social and economic decisions we will be able to review and improve the ways in which we both harness and protect it. We are currently considering options and time scales for taking this commitment forward.</p>

Only where there were defaults on loan repayments would there be a cost to the EU budget. Member states would be liable for a share through their monthly subscriptions to the EU budget: based on the UK's contribution to the 2010 EU budget, the UK's share would be approximately 13.6% of any increase, or up to a maximum of around &#8364;8 billion.</p>

	<p pid="a.102W.5/1">The European Commission proposed revisions to the EU Directive setting minimum rates of excise duty on alcoholic beverages in September 2006. Following two discussions at Ministerial level at ECOFIN in November 2006, when it was not possible to reach agreement, successive EU Presidencies have chosen not to schedule further Council discussion of the dossier.</p>
	<p pid="a.102W.5/2">The Commission is currently in the process of reviewing the EU rules on alcohol duty again and will report the findings of their review to the Council in due course. It is unclear at this stage whether they will propose changes to EU legislation on minimum rates of duty.</p>
