Secondly, the Senior Costs Judge's judgment of <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-21">21 March</phrase> implies additional expenditure of, on best current estimates, around #5 million on solicitors for the families; expenditure on costs arising from this case is expected to run into several hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p>

	<p pid=".797W.6/2">The Government's priority is to ensure the universal postal service and this is Postcomm's primary statutory duty. In exercising its functions Postcomm must act in accordance with its primary and other statutory duties including compliance with EU obligations.</p>
	<p pid=".797W.6/3">Currently EU legislation allows member states to reserve certain mail services to universal service providers but only to the extent necessary to maintain the universal service. There are maximum limits to the services that may be reserved; but there is no minimum and some EU countries have determined either that they no longer need to reserve services or that the level of service they need to reserve is lower than the maximum limits.</p>
	<p pid=".797W.6/4">Discussions are in progress to amend the current European Postal Directive with regard to the further opening to competition of Community postal services and when the new Directive is adopted the Government will consider with interested parties what action is necessary for its transposition in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid=".802W.5/1">The Pregnant Workers Directive was adopted in October 1992, and included measures to encourage improvements in the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding. It included, in particular, provisions entitling workers to minimum periods of maternity leave and setting minimum standards for pay or allowances during maternity leave.</p>
	<p pid=".802W.5/2">The UK already had in place various statutory provisions for maternity leave and pay prior to the Directive. Some changes were subsequently made as a result of the Directive, and other changes have been made, for unrelated reasons, in the intervening years. The Government has therefore made no recent assessment of the costs of the Directive on its own.</p>

	<p pid=".802W.11/1">The Department commissioned an independent report into the costs associated with introducing the European Works Council Directive based on a survey of companies with experience of operating such Councils. The results of this study were incorporated into a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), a copy of which is available in the Library and on the DTI website. The RIA identified a range of potential benefits from European Works Councils for employers, employees and the economy as a whole. The benefits in terms of improving industrial relations, boosting productivity and facilitating change would be felt in the longer term and could not be separately quantified. The costs to individual firms of organising European Works Council meetings were expected to range from #47,000 per year to #175,000 depending on the size of the undertaking. This represents a very small proportion of their turnover, and a valuable investment in improved employer-employee relations.</p>

In the case of Rolls-Royce, we have agreed to change the current requirement that 75 per cent. of the Board are British to a requirement that a simple majority, including the Chief Executive and any Executive Chairman, are British; to allow the appointment of a non-British non-Executive Chairman; and to remove the aggregate foreign shareholding limit.

	<p pid=".811W.9/1">The EU has adopted a Common position including an arms embargo, bans on high level visits, items which may be used for torture, non-humanitarian aid, and a visa ban and asset freeze on members of the regime. The EC has also suspended Burma trading privileges in response to the use of forced labour in Burma. In addition, the UK does not encourage trade, investment or tourism with Burma. We do not offer assistance to any British company wishing to trade with Burma. There is hardly any new investment into the country.</p>
	<p pid=".811W.9/2">There is no consensus at this point to implement a formal ban in any of the international forums listed. Against this background and in consideration of the evolving political situation in Burma, including the gradual release of political prisoners and the lessening of the pressure on opposition parties, there are no plans to pursue formal investment bans at this point. We will follow events closely and will respond proportionately to further developments, positive or negative.</p>

	<p pid=".812W.3/1">The aggregate amount is #18,968,850 of which #100,000 will be retained as discretionary grant for special projects and special events deemed of benefit to the wider emergency planning community in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".812W.3/2">The remaining #18,868,850 will be allocated to individual authorities as set out in the table below.</p>
	<p pid=".812W.3/3">The following formula has been adopted to determine these allocations. First, each authority receives #53,000. Second, each county council receives #12,000 in respect of each shire district within the authority's boundaries. These flat-rate payments account for some 65 per cent. of the aggregate grant in recognition of the fact that every authority, regardless of size and population, must incur similar unavoidable costs in conducting the basic emergency planning function. The remainder of the total grant (approximately 35 per cent.) is then distributed according to the Bellwin threshold in recognition of the fact that population size provides a rough proxy for the scale of the emergency planning that authorities need to undertake.</p>
	<p pid=".812W.3/4">A simple application of the formula would result in some authorities facing a significant decrease on the grant they had received during the current financial year, whilst others would receive a significant increase. Mindful of the importance of keeping such year-on-year changes within reasonable bounds, a damping has been added to the formula so that no authority loses more than 10 per cent. or gains more than 20 per cent. compared with the current year.</p>
	<p pid=".812W.3/5">Before reaching decisions on this allocation method, consultations were held with Local Authority representatives on the basis of a draft formula. As a result of the representations made, that original formula was amended to give greater weight to the flat rate element and lesser weight to the element distributed by reference to the Bellwin threshold. The damping was also changed to reduce the floor level for losses.</p>

	<p pid=".830W.8/1">The interim rules for livestock movements, which we announced on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-05">5 February</phrase>, allow greater flexibility for farmers to move their animals. The 20 day standstill rule has been waived for some types of movement, subject to conditions and we will continue to keep these arrangements under review. However, veterinary advice is that the 20 day standstill needs to remain in place for the time being as a disease control measure. A copy of a document explaining the Veterinary basis for the Interim movement rules has been placed in the Library of the House and is available on the DEFRA website.</p>

	<p pid=".830W.11/2">Movements of farmed livestock within the European Community are subject to harmonised animal health rules which are implemented into national legislation. These rules set down the animal health conditions that must be met before such animals can be certified for export and they provide for checks to be made on the animals at their premises of destination. The Commission's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health keeps the rules under constant review and introduces safeguard measures as necessary to address animal health problems across the Community. Imports into Great Britain of animals susceptible to foot and mouth disease resumed in November 2001 and since then we have been carrying out 100 per cent. post import checks on all such consignments.</p>
	<p pid=".830W.11/3">Imports of livestock from non-EU countries are also covered by EU rules. Imports are prohibited from countries where there is a known animal health risk. Imports from approved countries must enter the Community via an approved border inspection post where the consignments are subjected to physical, identity and documentary checks.</p>

We worked hard to get UN agreement to these goals and all of the work of my Department is aimed at reaching these Goals. The Millennium Declaration also called on industrialised countries to reduce trade barriers for least developed countries, debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries, and increased development assistance, particularly for countries with large numbers of people in poverty and effective pro-poor policies.</p>

The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative has led to over $50 billion in debt relief being granted to qualifying countries. This Government has increased UK Official Development Assistance by a third in real terms since 1997. We are committed to making substantial further progress towards the UN 0.7 per cent. target in the next spending round. At the UN conference on Financing for Development in Mexico last week, the European Union announced a commitment to increase average Official Development Assistance as a proportion of gross national income to 0.39 per cent. by 2006, an increase of $7 billion.</p>

	<p pid=".833W.5/2">The Review will be conducted by a team attached to DEFRA's Corporate and Service Delivery Directorate General, working in consultation with other Government Departments with an interest. The Review Team will be advised by a Steering Group of a majority of non-Departmental members.</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/3">The terms of reference for the Review are:</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/4" class="indent">XTo evaluate the effectiveness of the operation of DEFRA agencies, with regard to the Departmental aim and objectives and their relationship with the Department and the sectors they serve.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/5">The Review is to be conducted in two parallel processes:</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/6" class="indent">for those Executive Agencies due for quinquennial review in 2002 (VLA, CSL, CEFAS): to conduct an evaluation of their performance since the date of the last review and to examine their relationship with core-DEFRA, other Government Departments (OGDs) and the Devolved Administrations (DAs);</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/7" class="indent">for the regulatory Executive Agencies (PSD and VMD): to take into account the conclusions of, and developments since the completion of their Quinquennial Reviews.</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/8">In so doing, the Review will:</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/9" class="indent">analyse the requirements of Government, industry and society for core science facilities and key skills for the provision of R&amp;D, scientific support services, surveillance, policy and regulatory functions, advice and emergency response capability;</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/10" class="indent">analyse and identify the work required to support the core requirements;</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/11" class="indent">examine the likely trend of DEFRA and other public funders' requirements, including developments in horizon scanning and contingency planning;</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/12" class="indent">consider the possible options and evaluate the best models for delivery of the services and the organisation of the functions required, including policy advice and associated work;</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/13" class="indent">assess the implications for DEFRA, OGDs, the DAs and the Agencies about the choice of those models;</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/14" class="indent">assess the implications for non-core activities; and</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/15" class="indent">assess the implications for commercial activity.</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/16">The Review Team will consult customers, stakeholders, scientific opinion and other interests and will take into account relevant reviews and studies, in particular the SR2002 Science and Research cross-cutting review and DEFRA's prioritisation of science programmes exercise; the work on the development of science in DEFRA, including a new Science and Innovation Strategy; and the Cabinet Office Review of Agency Policy.</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/17">In light of the findings of the consultation exercise, the Review will examine the most appropriate freedoms, controls, financial regimes, governance arrangements and performance management to ensure the optimum delivery of a high quality service, providing good value for money.</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/18">The Review Team will report with recommendations to Ministers through the Management Board by the end of October 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".833W.5/19">Interested parties are invited to submit their views to the Review Team by <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-30">30 May 2002</phrase>. Details of how to contact them are contained in DEFRA's news release, issued today.</p>

	<p pid=".834W.2/3">The fees and charges in both schemes have been increased by 1.8 per cent., broadly in line with inflation. However, my Department is writing to local authorities to advise them that if there is not much more widespread adoption of cost accounting practices for LAPC over the next six months this increase may be rescinded at the next review of the charging schemes later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".838W.2/1">As Head of the Judiciary, the Lord Chancellor investigates complaints about the personal conduct of both full-time and part-time judicial office holders. He does not, however, investigate complaints against solicitors who are part-time Judges when the complaints relate to their work as solicitors, as this is a matter for the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors and ultimately for the Law Society. The Lord Chancellor has no disciplinary powers in relation to solicitors. If a solicitor who is a part-time judicial office holder is subject to such a complaint, he or she is required to inform the Lord Chancellor's Department of the outcome. The Department is aware of four such complaints in the past 12 months.</p>

	<p pid=".844W.3/1">It remains the case that we believe it is as yet premature to decide on acquiring ballistic missile defences to deploy either for defence of the UK or of deployed forces. But we have carried out a range of studies focused on assessing the threat and the feasibility of the technology available to counter it, and continue to do so. A Pre-Feasibility Study was completed in June 1996, and an extension to it was carried out during 1997 and 1998 at a cost of #300K. The Technology Readiness and Risk Assessment Programme (TRRAP) was carried out between 1998 and 2001 at a total cost of #12.5 million. A further programme of work beyond TRRAP to look further at the main technical risk areas it identified, and at the feasibility of defending against more complex and longer range threats, is underway. Studies are also assessing the significance of any capability gap in defence against theatre ballistic missiles, including the role that active theatre missile defence systems might play. The total cost of the current work in this financial year is #3.6 million. This work is due to continue until March 2003 with a similar level of financial provision.</p>

Since 1997, we have reduced our operationally available stockpile to fewer than 200 warheads. We have reduced the readiness of our nuclear forces with only a single Trident submarine on deterrent patrol, carrying 48 warheads against a previously planned ceiling of 96 warheads per submarine. We have signed and ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and continue to promote its entry into force, and we are still pressing for negotiations to begin at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva of a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty.</p>
	<p pid=".845W.0/3">In addition to the measures set out above, we have signed and ratified the relevant protocols to both the Treaty of Raratonga (South Pacific Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone) and the treaty of Pelindaba (African Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone). We have placed fissile material no longer required for defence purposes under international safeguards, have been more transparent about nuclear and fissile material stockpiles and begun a national accounting for fissile material produced. We have also begun a programme to develop UK expertise in verifying the reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons internationally.</p>

	<p pid=".846W.3/8">Expenditure by the companies concerned is a matter for them. The Ministry of Defence pays them a unitary charge when the housing service contracted for is available. In total payments of #23 million have been made to the end of February 2002. The contractor is responsible for house design, construction, maintenance and life cycle upgrading. DHE is responsible for allocation and occupation management.</p>

	<p pid=".849W.0/1">The contents of United States legislation are of course a matter for the United States Government. However, I understand that the primary purpose of the draft legislation is not the control of exports; in that respect it does not, in its current form, change the contents or the scope of the US Munitions List, though it does refer to it. It includes some policy recommendations relating to the administration of the United States' export control process but is more concerned with the funding of the United State security assistance programmes with various countries, including non-proliferation work.</p>

These planners are led by a United Kingdom Defence Adviser to the Macedonian government, whose role is to advise on Macedonia's NATO Membership Action Plan and on improvements in the Macedonian government's ability to carry out defence planning.

	<p pid=".849W.3/3">Recently a British Military Advisory and Training Team provided advice on how to conduct low-level counter-insurgency training for the Macedonian Rapid Reaction Brigade, so as to meet Western standards for such training. We expect this programme to continue over the next months and will investigate what military assistance we can best provide for the Macedonian for the longer term.</p>

However, the deployment, activities and working patterns of Customs staff at Newhaven and other locations are kept under constant review to ensure the most effective and efficient targeting of resources. Since January 2001, Customs officers operating at Newhaven have seized smuggled tobacco products with a total revenue value of around #215,500.

We are also supporting the development of health systems to effectively deliver care, including home-based and palliative care. In parallel, we are supporting work to build a solid evidence base to inform effective and responsible provision of ART in developing countries. Where functioning health systems do exist we are seeking to help governments to consider the issues surrounding the introduction of ART in the most cost effective and equitable way.</p>

	<p pid=".864W.5/1">Since October 2001, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has delivered 370,000 metric tonnes of emergency food aid to the region; over 300,000 metric tonnes of which has been distributed within Afghanistan. WFP assistance is now successfully reaching 6.6 million people in Afghanistan.

The teams are tasked with streamlining food aid operations, assessing health conditions, investigating non-food emergency needs, monitoring food distribution and verifying reports by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on earlier food deliveries. If necessary, the helicopters will also allow WFP to airlift a limited amount of food aid on an emergency basis.</p>
	<p pid=".864W.5/3">We have contributed #6 million towards WFP's operations inside Afghanistan&mdash;for both direct procurement and transportation of food, and for logistical support to help speed up the movement of food aid into the country. We have also supported a number of agencies&mdash;the UN, Red Cross and non-governmental organisations (NGOs)&mdash;for supplementary feeding and secondary distribution of food inside Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid=".866W.8/1">The production and sale of commodities is very important to the livelihoods of people in developing countries. For a significant number of the least developed countries commodities account for more than 50 per cent. of merchandise exports. Price volatility is a characteristic of many commodity markets (such as cocoa, coffee and tea) and reflects changing patterns of consumption and production.</p>
	<p pid=".866W.8/2">DFID believes that better livelihoods for poor people must be at the centre of any strategy for poverty reduction. DFID is currently supporting a significant number of livelihood programmes and projects throughout the developing world. These seek to provide direct benefits to poor people, including those whose livelihoods are linked to commodities. The range of commodities involved is extensive and includes fish, cut flowers, horticultural products, cereals, beverages, oilseeds, as well as roots and tubers.</p>
	<p pid=".866W.8/3">Improving developing country access to international and regional markets is very important to encourage more processing of commodities and more value added. DFID is working with developing countries to strengthen their capacity in trade. We are also working to tackle tariff and non-tariff barriers to developing country exports, especially those that exist in the European Union. DFID provides support to initiatives that provide more timely market information, contributes to improvements in essential infrastructure (including energy and transport) and works to ensure appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks exist to promote investment.</p>

	<p pid=".867W.11/1">Helping developing countries achieve the millennium development goal of universal primary education by 2015 is DFID's major focus for tackling illiteracy. Increasing access to good quality primary education and ensuring that children are literate when they leave school is essential for development and poverty reduction. Since 1997 the Government has committed over #650 million to support sustainable education systems in developing countries able to provide high quality primary education for all children. We will do more.</p>
	<p pid=".867W.11/2">We will also give increasing attention to helping developing countries tackle adult illiteracy and poverty reduction. Improving literacy practice for adults continues to be an integral part of many different sectoral programmes supported by DFID, such as transport, water, health, small business development, environment, livelihoods and governance. Our new Background Briefing paper, <i>XImproving livelihoods for the poor: the role of literacy&quot;</i>, examines the way in which literacy features in such programmes and the key issues that have emerged as different parts of DFID have considered the ways in which literacy and poverty interrelate. It highlights principles of good practice (drawing on recent experience), examines potential entry points and identifies challenges for DFID in giving greater priority to literacy in our commitment to poverty reduction.</p>

	<p pid=".868W.8/1">DFID has provided #4 million to partner NGOs to feed 400,000 children and vulnerable adults for the past six months. The main difficulty has been in obtaining adequate supplies of maize. With growing national shortages suppliers have been unable to fulfil their contracts. However, the NGOs, working collectively, are generally managing to make alternative arrangements to import food directly.</p>
	<p pid=".868W.8/2">DFID has worked closely with the UN's Humanitarian Assistance and Recovery Programme, providing #6 million for both food and medical supplies. The impact of this has been hampered by the lateness of the Zimbabwe Government appeal, the time taken to assemble the UN team, and the sparseness of donor responses.</p>

	<p pid=".870W.2/1">The United Kingdom played a leading role in the preparatory process leading up to the Monterrey Conference in helping to formulate the EU position for the Conference. The EU worked hard during the negotiations of the text of the outcomes document: the XMonterrey Consensus&quot;. This is a good document, in which developing countries commit to set in place the pro-poor economic policies and good governance that is required to attract foreign direct investment and mobilise domestic resources; and donor countries commit to provide enhanced support to developing countries through providing more and better quality oda, through opening up markets to trade access in the context of the Doha process, and through ensuring that the HIPC process provides sustainable debt relief. The UK also played a leading role in developing the package of commitments announced by the EU at Monterrey, which includes a commitment to increase EU aid volume from an average of 0.33 per cent. to an average of 0.39 per cent. by 2006&mdash;which represents an additional 7 billion dollars per annum. Baroness Amos and I represented the UK at the Conference itself. I chaired a round table on financing sustainable development and participated in a round table on partnerships. Baroness Amos held a press conference to publicise the DFID/HTM paper on the case for aid and participated in a round table on coherence.</p>

	<p pid=".870W.5/1">In the XMonterrey Consensus&quot; document which was agreed at the Financing for Development Conference, the nations of the world agreed that developing countries need to set in place pro-poor economic policies and good governance in order to attract foreign direct investment and mobilise domestic resources. Donor countries need to provide more and better oda; provide better market access for developing country products through the Doha negotiations; ensure that the HIPC process provides heavily indebted poor countries with a sustainable exit from debt, and take concrete steps to give developing countries a stronger voice in the international financial architecture. The UK Government, throughout the Financing for Development process, has promoted the view that development assistance should be untied and should be targeted on poor countries with large numbers of poor people and good policies; and that donors should harmonise their procedures to reduce the burden on developing country governments; should move away from stand-alone projects towards direct support through government budgets where possible; should strengthen government accounting and audit capacity so as to enable a greater use of budget support by donors; and should provide aid in support of country-owned poverty reduction strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/2">The Government believes that the Monterrey Consensus, alongside the WTO Doha Declaration, provides an excellent basis for a new global partnership to tackle poverty eradication and manage globalisation so that it works for all the world's people, including the poorest. We hope that the World Summit on Sustainable Development, at Johannesburg in September, will build on these outcomes, and help to identify means of implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".870W.5/3">A full outline of how my department is contributing to the delivery of the Government's commitment to global sustainable development will be published in our Departmental Report next month. Priorities are set out in the two White Papers on International Development (which can be found on <a href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk">www.dfid.gov.uk</a> or obtained from the DFID Public Enquiry Point). In addition, my department has considered the full sustainable development implications of its bid for resources as part of the Spending Review.</p>

In the past year we have approved in excess of #154 million of new funding for work in this area (#136 million for the polio eradication programme). The global drive to reduce poverty will also bring many benefits, in reducing some of the key causes of disability and improving the quality of life and opportunities for people with disabilities.</p>

This is supplemented by a contribution of #650,000 to the Radio Okapi project which is disseminating information on the peace process to the Congolese people, and #160,000 to assist peace and reconciliation in the Kivus. We continue to press all signatories to the Lusaka Peace Agreement to honour their commitments and work constructively towards a full peace settlement in the region. It is paramount that the delegates currently engaged in the Sun City talks avoid further prevarication and commit themselves to the critical task of reaching agreement on arrangements for a transitional government and timetable for free elections. Much time has already been lost in the Dialogue and it is crucial that real progress is now seen, for the sake of all of the people of the region.</p>

	<p pid=".878W.9/1">My Department provides support to both UK-based and overseas non-governmental organisations through a number of sources, including through the Civil Society Challenge Fund and through our geographical programmes. We also have Partnership Programme Agreements (PPAs) with 11 UK-based NGOs and PPAs with a further four NGOs are under discussion. Expenditure under these PPAs in the 2002&ndash;03 financial year is expected to total #56,300,000. A substantial proportion of these agencies are working in localities which are either in conflict or have recently experienced conflict: peacemaking, peacebuilding and conflict resolution activities are therefore a key part of the challenge of promoting sustainable development and reducing violent conflict.</p>

	<p pid=".879W.2/1">Violent conflict remains one of the most important obstacles to reducing poverty. My Department is developing its work in the field of conflict prevention and peacebuilding both directly through our work in developing countries and with two conflict prevention pools jointly managed by DFID, the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>
	<p pid=".879W.2/2">More than 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa are currently devastated by or are recovering from violent conflict and 20 per cent. of the continent's population live in countries affected by armed conflicts. Through the Africa Pool, an inter-Departmental strategy has been developed for conflict prevention and peace-keeping in Africa, which focuses on geographic and thematic priorities. The Strategy involves working with international partners to support African Governments and institutions to prevent and resolve conflict at country and regional level.</p>
	<p pid=".879W.2/3">We have focused particular attention on securing peace and stability in Sierra Leone and contributing to the establishment of durable and lasting solutions to the conflicts in the Great Lakes and Sudan. More broadly, my Department will continue to work on building inclusive and accountable governance structures, including security sector reform, strengthening state institutions and improving people's livelihoods, all of which contribute directly to conflict prevention and peacebuilding in Africa. With regard to Security Sector Reform, working with other donors and with international organisations and institutions, my Department has been active in developing policy as well as in implementing practical reform measures.</p>
	<p pid=".879W.2/4">We also continue to address the issues raised by the Report of the Panel on UN Peace Operations, better known as the Brahimi Report, to help improve the ability of the UN to deal with complex peace operations. Activities have to date focussed on developing the resources for information gathering and analysis in and around the United Nations, and we are now discussing further activities with the UN Department of Peace Keeping Operations to further strengthen their operational capabilities.</p>
	<p pid=".879W.2/5">Under the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, my Department, in close co-operation with FCO and MOD, is implementing a #19.5 million programme that seeks to reduce the uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons. We will continue to clarify and address the relationship between the uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons, insecurity and underdevelopment.</p>
	<p pid=".879W.2/6">We have also developed a methodology to help development agencies assess possible development interventions in countries at risk of violent conflict. This methodology has been endorsed and picked up by other donor agencies in their conflict prevention work.</p>
	<p pid=".879W.2/7">DFID is also active in its support of conflict prevention work at regional and international levels and through contributions to multilateral agencies, including the United Nations and the EU. We provide core support for the strengthening of the key humanitarian agencies&mdash;UNHCR, OCHA, WFP and the Red Cross family, as well as UNDP, UNICEF and the OHCHR&mdash;in addition to contributing to specific appeals during emergencies. We continue to be heavily involved with humanitarian mine action, primarily through the UN Mine Action Service. This includes mine clearance, developing indigenous capacity and the development, testing and trailing of suitable technologies.</p>
	<p pid=".879W.2/8">My Department will continue to focus on improving and strengthening the disaster response mechanism that exists under the co-ordination of the United Nations at both local and global level to respond to disasters around the world. Following a disaster, most lives are saved in the first few hours by immediate local effort. We are therefore working to build local, national and regional capacities for effective response.</p>

	<p pid=".880W.2/1">In the Report of the Panel on UN Peace Operations published in August 2000 (better known as the Brahimi Report), emphasis was placed on the importance of equipping UN personnel with the necessary skills in peacebuilding and conflict prevention.</p>
	<p pid=".880W.2/2">We have been supporting a number of training initiatives for UN personnel (and others), notably, the UN Staff College training course in Early Warning and Preventive Measures, which provides UN field and Headquarters staff with basic skills in conflict analysis, as well as a comprehensive guide to the UN prevention process through the use of case studies. We have been supporting this course since its development in 1998 and over 720 UN staff have been trained to date.</p>
	<p pid=".880W.2/3">In addition to this, we support the Fellowship Programme in Peacemaking and Preventive Diplomacy at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). This training in conflict analysis, with a particular focus on negotiation and mediation, is designed for mid-level UN officials and National Government Civil Servants.</p>
	<p pid=".880W.2/4">My Department also provides capacity building support to the Office of Emergency Programmes in UNICEF and the Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery in UNDP.</p>
	<p pid=".880W.2/5">This supports a range of institutional development activities, from policy development to monitoring and evaluation. It also supports in-house training activities with a particular focus on conflict and other humanitarian emergencies. The training programmes not only benefit the staff in these specialised units, but also other Headquarters staff, and of course, field staff.</p>
	<p pid=".880W.2/6">In conjunction with the Canadian government we have sponsored the development, production and implementation of gender training materials for personnel involved in peace support operations. They emphasise women's role in conflict-reduction and peacebuilding activities.</p>

	<p pid=".885W.15/1">As to civil work, since the introduction of a competitive appointments system in 1998 all applicants to be included in panels of junior counsel maintained by the Attorney General and as standing counsel have been asked to complete an equal opportunities monitoring form which asks them to indicate their ethnic origin. Completion of the form is voluntary. The method of selection for the panels and the operation of the panel system is being reviewed.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.15/2">As to criminal work apart from the Crown Prosecution Service and the Serious Fraud Office, a panel of junior counsel conducting cases on behalf of HM Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue, the Department of Work and Pensions/Health, the Department of Trade and Industry, DEFRA, the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency is being set up.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.15/3">All applicants to be considered for the panel and, in the recently concluded appointments exercise for the Customs and Excise and the Department of Trade and Industry, as standing counsel, have been invited to complete an equal opportunities monitoring form, completion of which is voluntary.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.15/4">As to the Crown Prosecution Service, all applicants to be considered for lists of junior counsel maintained by the CPS are invited to complete an ethnic monitoring form on a voluntary basis. The CPS maintains a national database with details of the ethnicity and gender of all counsel on its lists. Since July 2001 the CPS has been monitoring its distribution of work to counsel by ethnicity and gender. A computer program has been developed to facilitate data collection which will be made available in all CPS areas within the next few months. The information currently being gathered is shared with the Bar and the distribution of work is discussed at regular liaison meetings, which take place on all circuits.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.15/5">The Serious Fraud Office is in the process of establishing a new counsel Xpool&quot; containing the names of counsel considered suitable for SFO work, who have been referred by their Heads of Chambers. When accepted by the Director for inclusion in the SFO Xpool&quot;, counsel are invited to complete an individual ethnic monitoring form on a voluntary basis. When the new pool has been in operation for a year, the results of this monitoring will be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid=".885W.15/6">The Law Officers are committed to promoting diversity and equal opportunity. Advertisements for all recruitment exercises state that members of ethnic minorities are particularly encouraged to apply.</p>

	<p pid=".887W.0/1">In the Parliamentary Answer given by the then Attorney General on <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-12">12 March 2001</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2001-03-12.68"><i>Official Report,</i> column WA68</phrase>, he announced that the Government had accepted all the recommendations in principle, but had opted for a phased approach to implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/2">Since that announcement, the Prosecutions Group of the Solicitor's Office has forged ahead with a rapid programme of change, to enable it to deliver legal services of a high quality in a responsive and flexible way. New managers and staff have been recruited, the organisation has been restructured, and working practices are being reformed.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/3">The Parliamentary Answer also referred to accountability for the prosecutions function moving from the Commissioners to the Attorney General on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/4">Final agreement has not yet been reached on the implementation of Recommendation 4 of the Gower/Hammond Recommendations, which recommended that in relation to the prosecution function the Solicitor for the Customs and Excise should not be funded by the Commissioners, but should have his own ring fenced budget and be accountable for his own expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/5">This Recommendation is accepted in principle by the Government, but there are technical issues relating to the establishment of a separate vote which require further time to resolve. The Government is committed to the full implementation of Recommendation 4 no later than <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, but in the meantime the Prosecutions Group budget will remain as part of the Customs and Excise vote, though it will be separately identified and managed by the Solicitor for the Customs and Excise, and financial Accounts/Reports will be produced as if that budget has been established as a separate vote.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/6">As a consequence of these revised arrangements, the Attorney General will not assume full accountability for the prosecutions function from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April</phrase>. Instead, from that date the following arrangements will apply:</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/7">(1) The Commissioners (and Treasury Ministers) will be responsible for, and accountable to Parliament for:</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/8" class="indent">anything done in the course of an investigation;</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/9" class="indent">enforcement policy, including the resources to be deployed;</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/10" class="indent">prosecution policy ie the seriousness with which offences should in general be treated and wider issues of Departmental policy such as the disclosure of informants;</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/11" class="indent">decisions on alternatives to prosecution such as compounding, civil evasion action etc.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/12">(2) The Law Officers will be responsible for, and accountable to Parliament for:</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/13" class="indent">the quality of legal advice given by Investigation Legal Advisers;</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/14" class="indent">the quality of the Prosecutions Group casework decision making in relation to cases referred to that Group for prosecution;</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/15" class="indent">the application (the Prosecutions Group having consulted with Customs Administrators, as appropriate) of prosecutions policy and public interest factors to individual defendants in cases referred to the Prosecutions Group for prosecution.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/16">Inspection of the Prosecutions Group by the CPS Inspectorate will commence on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, and the Prosecution Group will proceed with the trials referred to in the previous Parliamentary Answer.</p>
	<p pid=".887W.0/17">The Government is satisfied that the arrangements that will apply from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April</phrase> strengthen the involvement of the Attorney General with the difficult and complex criminal casework conducted by the Solicitor's Office, maintain the momentum of change that has been established and preserve an appropriate position on Parliamentary accountability.</p>

	<p pid=".890W.0/1">It is estimated that an accommodation centre with around 750 residents would require between 200 and 300 staff. These are likely to include a mixture of locally recruited staff, together with some who transfer from elsewhere in the country. Staff training, and its cost, will be a matter for the contractors selected to run the sites.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.0/2">Transport implications will form a part of the planning process for the trial Accommodation Centres. We will provide for transport for residents where necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.0/3">We will consult local service providers as part of the planning process. Department of Health officials will act as the initial conduit between the Home Office and the National Health Service (NHS) in respect of accommodation centres once the sites have been selected.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.0/4">This is a matter for contractors who will run the centres. Bids to operate Accommodation Centres have not yet been invited.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.0/5">I am satisfied that in most respects our European partners are already meeting the quite broadly defined provision of the Geneva Convention. However, it is true that there are differences in the way the Geneva Convention is interpreted and there are variations in asylum practice among Member States. This is why the United Kingdom (UK) government has committed itself to helping establish a common European asylum system, which can respond effectively to the challenge that global movements of people present and help limit unwarranted secondary movement of asylum seekers between European Union (EU) states.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.0/6">The Government has opted in to all the European asylum proposals to date and in doing so continues to exert maximum influence during negotiations. Of particular significance in reaching consensus on a common application of the Geneva Convention is the proposal for a Council Directive on minimum standards for the qualification and status of refugees, presented by the European Commission in November 2001. One of the key aims of this draft directive is to establish a common interpretation of Article 1A of the Geneva Convention, the grounds for refugee status. The definition of prosecution adopted by the Commission reflects the current UK position.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.0/7">Hemswell Cliff is just one of a number of places that are being considered as a possible suitable site for an Accommodation Centre for Asylum Seekers. A final decision has not yet been taken. We have no plans to vary police grant in areas where asylum facilities may be located.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.0/8">The budget for National Asylum Support Services (NASS) in 2000&ndash;01 was #38* million. This figure includes grants totalling #22 million* to the voluntary sector for the provision of services to asylum seekers and refugees.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.0/9">Total spending on asylum support in the year <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-01">1 April 2000</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-31">31 March 2001</phrase> was #751 million*. This includes grant payments of #580 million* to local authorities and the Scottish Executive for provision of accommodation and support for asylum seeking adults and families under the Interim Regulations and for unaccompanied asylum seeking children (UASC). A further #12 million* was paid to local authorities and the Scottish Executive directly by NASS under contracts to provide accommodation and related services for dispersed asylum seekers.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.0/10">#46 million* was paid directly by NASS to private sector accommodation providers for the provision of accommodation and related services to dispersed asylum seekers.</p>
	<p pid=".890W.0/11">The budget for the current financial year, 2001&ndash;02, is #36 million*. This figure includes grants totalling #18.1 million* to the voluntary sector for the provision of services to asylum seekers and refugees.</p>

	<p pid=".890W.0/13">No consultations have taken place on the provision of dental services in Lincolnshire in relation to the potential site at Hemswell Cliff.

	<p pid=".897W.2/1">Our policies are focused on raising educational standards. It is wasteful for resources to be locked into maintaining surplus places in schools. Wherever possible these should be freed up and directed towards improving standards. In planning school provision, local education authorities should look for opportunities for removing surplus capacity, with a view to bringing supply and demand for school places into better balance. Their initial focus should be on those schools with 25 per cent. or more of their places unfilled, having particular regard to standards at those schools. The overall aim should be to maximise parental preference and to provide good quality education in the most cost-effective way. The Department's annual survey of surplus places allows us to monitor how local education authorities are meeting this challenge. The Audit Commission has again drawn attention to this issue and, with District Auditors, is promoting good practice.</p>
	<p pid=".897W.2/2">Local education authorities have again made progress in the removal of surplus places. The survey returns indicate that there were 699,770 surplus school places in January 2001, representing 9 per cent. of the total capacity of 7.8 million places. This is an overall reduction of 10,219 places on the 2000 figures. Since 1998 a total of 74,050 surplus places have been removed. This reduction means that more money will be spent raising school standards rather than maintaining empty buildings.</p>
	<p pid=".897W.2/3">The following tables are based on the returns made by the local education authorities in respect of all maintained primary and secondary schools in their area. They set out the numbers of surplus places as at January 2001 for each local authority area, listing primary and secondary separately, together with the proportion that these represent of total capacity. They also highlight the numbers of schools which at that date had surplus of 25 per cent. or more, and at least 30 surplus places, together with the proportion that these represent of the total number of schools.</p>
	<p pid=".897W.2/4">The number of schools with 25 per cent. or more surplus places has again risen for the second successive year, to 2,441 compared with 2,406 in 2000. As with the 2000 survey, the number of primary schools in this category has risen (2,139 in 2001 which represents 12 per cent. of all primary schools, compared to 2,013 (11 per cent.) in 2000) while the number of secondary schools has declined (302 in 2001, which represents 9 per cent. of all secondary schools, compared with 393 (11 per cent.) in 2000).</p>
	<p pid=".897W.2/5">The returns also provide the Department with details of the action authorities propose to take on schools with 25 per cent. or more surplus. The returns indicate that in many cases action is being taken, or is planned. Where planning strategies are unclear in areas with particularly high levels of surplus, the Department will be following up with the authorities concerned.</p>

	<p pid=".901W.2/1">Fifty-three Local Education Authorities have recently submitted proposals to the Department, seeking funding support through PFI credits for school based projects aiming to sign in 2003&ndash;04. These proposals represent a PFI credit requirement of over #3 billion. Following a rigorous appraisal of the bids by the Department's officials, we are today announcing that 21 projects, representing more than #900 million PFI credits in total, have been approved in principle and will be invited to prepare outline business cases for further consideration. Proposals representing around #750 million are expected to sign in 2003&ndash;04, and the remainder in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".901W.2/2">This is a very substantial package of investment. It will support the Government's drive to improve the learning environments in schools, and will also help to further raise standards for children, the school workforce and the wider community.</p>
	<p pid=".901W.2/3">Details of the projects to be supported are being published today in a Departmental Press Notice and I have arranged for copies to be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".903W.3/1">The transfer of responsibilities in respect of underwater archaeology to English Heritage is dependent on legislation to extend English Heritage's remit out to the limit of the territorial waters of the UK adjacent to England. Provision for this was included in the Government's Culture and Recreation Bill which fell before the last election, thus preventing us meeting this element of the PSA target. Similar provisions are included in Baroness Anelay's National Heritage Bill which is currently before Parliament and is receiving Government support.

	<p pid=".904W.9/1">The White Paper XTime for Reform: Proposals for the Modernisation of Our Licensing Laws (Cm 4696)&quot;, published on <phrase class="date" code="2000-04-10">10 April 2000</phrase>, set out our views on the problem of binge drinking and our plans for reforming the alcohol and public entertainment licensing laws in England and Wales, including the hours during which alcohol may be sold or supplied to the public at public houses and other premises. The existing law establishes permitted licensing hours outside of which licensed premises may not sell or serve alcohol without the special permission of licensing justices; and their consent may only be granted in particular circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".904W.9/2">The existing fixed closing times are artificially early. They actively contribute to binge drinking at the end of normal opening time, and result in significant numbers of intoxicated people on our streets simultaneously. This in turn leads to peaks of disorder around closing times. To counter and minimise public disorder resulting from fixed closing times, we intend to introduce flexible opening hours as a condition of the licences of each venue, with the potential for some to operate up to 24 hour opening on each day of the week, subject to consideration of the impact on local residents. These changes require the amendment of primary legislation and we intend to introduce a Bill to that end as soon as Parliamentary time permits.</p>

The ultimate goal is that no one should wait longer than one month from an urgent referral for suspected cancer to the beginning of treatment except for a good clinical reason or through patient choice. There is a series of staged milestones towards this goal: new targets introduced for 2001 were a maximum one month from diagnosis to treatment for breast cancer and a maximum one month from urgent GP referral to treatment for acute leukaemia and children's and testicular cancer. By 2005 there will be a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to treatment and a maximum two month wait from urgent GP referral to treatment for all cancers. Achievement of these targets will be supported by investment in workforce and equipment, and by service redesign through the Cancer Services Collaborative.</p>

	<p pid=".911W.6/3">The Office of Manpower Economics carried out a survey of principal dentists in Great Britain in March 2000. They reported that 81 per cent. of dentists describe themselves as full-time and 19 per cent. are part-time. Twenty per cent. of all principal dentists are both full-time and also work fully in the NHS. A further 5 per cent. are part-time and work fully in the NHS.</p>

The survey found that one quarter of full-time principals spent 100 per cent. of their time on GDS work. This would be equivalent to 4,040 principals at December 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".914W.5/1">There are many categories of products currently on sale in the UK which the European Commission's proposals for a Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products are not intended to cover. However, specifically in relation to products which are currently sold legally as unlicensed herbal remedies under Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act, 1968, there are a number of reasons why a proportion of existing products might not satisfy the terms of the proposed Directive. The most likely reasons might be: failure to meet safety or quality standards, or failure to demonstrate that the remedy or corresponding products (that is, comparable herbal medicines) had traditional use. In many such cases in should be possible for companies to make changes&mdash;for example improving quality standards or making adjustments to the ingredients or strength of specific products&mdash;in order to comply with the terms of the Directive.</p>
	<p pid=".914W.5/2">Subject to a successful outcome to European negotiations, the introduction of a systematic regulatory framework for traditional herbal medicines should result in improved public health protection, enhanced public confidence in herbal medicine and the continuing availability of a very wide range of remedies.</p>

Copies of the report and its annexes are available at the following website: <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/cmo/publications.htm">www.doh.gov.uk/cmo/publications.htm</a>.

	<p pid=".919W.5/1">We have established the General Social Care Council (GSCC) to raise the standard of social care and increase the protection of the public. The GSCC will do this by promoting high standards in the training of social workers and other social care staff, publishing codes of practice, setting out the standard of conduct expected of social care workers and by registering the workforce, starting with qualified social workers in 2003. In order to maintain registration with the GSCC individuals will be expected to keep their practice and training up to date. We have also announced a change to the social work qualification from a two-year diploma in social work to a three-year degree level qualification.</p>
	<p pid=".919W.5/2">The term <i>Social Worker</i> is often used by people working in social care who do not hold a social work qualification. When sufficient numbers of qualified social workers have been registered by the GSCC we shall take steps to protect the use of the title social worker to those who have a social work qualification and who are registered as such with the GSCC. It will be an offence under the Care Standards Act 2000 for anyone to misrepresent his/her self with the intention of deceiving.</p>

	<p pid=".922W.2/2">The NHS Plan set out our commitment to increasing the workforce and the NHS Cancer Plan confirmed our commitment to investment in the cancer workforce. Cancer networks (including those in the North West) nationally have recently been completing a number of toolkits which have looked at both clinician and nursing posts. Cancer networks are expected to audit their workforce requirements as part of the national standards for cancer. This is monitored through the peer review appraisal process. This information will continue to be used so that appropriate workforce development programmes are in place, which will help ensure that sufficient numbers of breast cancer consultants, surgeons and nurses are in place for future years.</p>

	<p pid=".935W.2/1">This Department is not currently planning to inspect local councils for compliance with the XNo Secrets&quot; guidance. We have commissioned the Centre for Policy on Ageing to undertake an analysis of all local council multi-agency codes of practice. Once the results of this work are made available a decision will be made on the need to follow up the XNo Secrets&quot; guidance.</p>
	<p pid=".935W.2/2">At present there are no plans to include a specific adult protection indicator in the Personal Social Services Performance Assessment Framework. There are however several existing indicators of relevance to adult protection (for example emergency admissions, avoidable harm from falls and hypothermia, clients receiving reviews and inspections of residential care). A decision on including a specific adult protection indicator will be made once the Centre for Policy on Ageing have concluded their analysis.</p>

I therefore imposed conditions requiring two railway extensions to be provided before the core terminal building is opened. I also said that I was minded to make the necessary Orders under the Transport and Works Act (TWA) authorising the proposed railway extensions, and to grant planning permission for this development.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.2/2">I was, however, unable at that stage to grant the necessary approvals for the railway works. This was because I wished to attach planning conditions giving satisfactory control over the railway development, but these conditions had not been discussed at the inquiry. I therefore set out in my November letter the conditions I was minded to impose and invited comments. I have subsequently received comments from interested parties which have shown a good measure of agreement for the conditions I proposed, and which have helped me to finalise their wording.</p>
	<p pid=".945W.2/3">I have therefore now decided to make the TWA Orders and to give planning approval for the Heathrow Express and Piccadilly Line extensions. Copies of both decision letters, which include the full sets of conditions for these works, have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".946W.8/2">This is a matter for London underground (LU). LU's rolling stock is purpose-designed and the Underground uses a four-rail system and operates to different rules from the main line. These differences make it difficult for LU rolling stock to operate beyond the existing network. However, there are short sections of the main line over which LU has long standing running rights and which have been specially adapted for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid=".946W.8/3">LU has carried out an assessment of a section where they plan to extend the Metropolitan line to Watford Junction (the Croxley Link). This involves a short section of new line and then a connection to the Euston/Watford Junction main lines.</p>

	<p pid=".952W.2/1">The Strategic Rail Authority have indicated in their Strategic Plan that the total amount of private sector investment envisaged will be very similar to that envisaged in the 10-year Plan. They have also indicated that the precise amount will depend on the pace of negotiations and the terms that can be negotiated.</p>
	<p pid=".952W.2/2">Infrastructure renewals, which are the replacement or updating of railway assets to make them fit for use on the railway network, create assets that have a useful life over more than one accounting period. Under accounting rules, they can therefore be properly accounted for as investment to be amortised over the expected accounting life of the assets. Railtrack's current accounting policies reflect this, as did British Rail's when that organisation still existed.</p>

Train operators also operate commercial railcard schemes such as the Network Railcard (for travel in the South East) and the Family Railcard, whose terms are a matter for the train operators, and which are not subject to regulation by the SRA.</p>

	<p pid=".958W.0/1">My Department sponsors the Energy Saving Trust's Powershift programme which provides grants towards the cost of purchasing cleaner fuel vehicles. Last year, following an extensive consultation with vehicle manufacturers and fuel suppliers, I announced changes to the programme which offered higher levels of grants for manufacturer-approved LPG vehicles. This move is intended to encourage more manufacturers to invest in the development of production-line LPG vehicles. My Department maintains close links with vehicle manufacturers to keep track of their plans to introduce LPG models.</p>
	<p pid=".958W.0/2">The Government's general policy has been to encourage the wider use of LPG through fuel duty incentives and purchase grants offered under the Powershift programme rather than by setting an outright target for LPG consumption. Where Government does set targets these will tend to be based on environmental performance rather than specifying particular fuels or technologies.</p>

	<p pid=".959W.0/3">The Government's measures and policies for tackling air pollution from road transport, industry and other sources are set out in the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, published in January 2000. It includes ambient air quality standards for benzene, 1,3 butadiene, particles (PM10) carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead and low level ozone and objectives for their achievement between 2003 and 2008. Proposals were issued last year to strengthen the objectives for PM10, benzene, carbon monoxide and introduce a new objective for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The current advice from the advisory Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards is that PM10 provides the most appropriate basis for an air quality standard rather than the finer fraction particles PM2.5.</p>

	<p pid=".959W.3/1">Since 1996 all new vehicles have had to meet stringent noise standards before entering service. No further reductions in noise limits are planned in the short term but the UK is participating in the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Working Group on vehicle noise which is examining the scope for further noise reductions. Requirements restricting the noise from tyres are being introduced in stages from this year in accordance with EU Directive 2001/43/EC.</p>
	<p pid=".959W.3/2">The 10-year Transport Plan extended the Government's commitment to reducing trunk road noise by stating that lower noise road surfacing will be used for all future maintenance and new construction work. All concrete roads on the national network will be resurfaced with this quieter material by March 2011. Current plans are that at the end of the 10-year Plan period some 60 per cent. of the national road network will have a lower noise surface.</p>
	<p pid=".959W.3/3">A programme of work is also underway to provide noise mitigation measures on certain trunk roads built or altered before 1988 prior to current methods of assessing traffic noise being adopted.</p>

	<p pid=".960W.2/1">My Department is currently involved in a joint initiative by the Commission for Integrated Transport and the Freight Transport Association to explore the scope for Local Authorities to consider flexibility in delivery restrictions in exchange for better environmental performance by the distribution industry resulting in less disturbance to local residents. The aim is to develop a Code of Practice which would result in a significant reduction in the noise and other nuisance commonly associated with urban deliveries. This would enable deliveries to be carried out outside peak congestion hours, more flexibly and efficiently with fewer vehicles. Improved distribution would also help to ensure that products are available on the shelves at the times people want to buy them. The use of gas-powered vehicles might be amongst the appropriate Xbest practice&quot; measures considered by local authorities in determining whether to ease delivery restrictions.</p>

	<p pid=".968W.6/1">The Urban White Paper Implementation Plan issued in March 2001 sets out how a wide range of initiatives across Government are supporting the objectives of the White Paper to deliver an urban renaissance. The Implementation Plan and six-monthly Implementation Bulletin (due to be re-issued in March 2002) provide an account of progress to date, as well as the key objectives we aim to deliver on over the next two years. Both documents can be found on my Department's website: <a href="http://www.regeneration.dtlr.gov.uk">www.regeneration.dtlr.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.6/2">We are working closely with 24 towns and cities across the country to take forward the urban agenda. These efforts will feed into the Urban Summit 2002. This will take place on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-31">31 October</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-01">1 November</phrase> at the ICC in Birmingham. The Summit will reconfirm the Government-wide commitment to urban renaissance, celebrate success in bringing about change and identify where further action is needed, and evaluate the recommendations in the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.6/3">The Government's vision for neighbourhood renewal was set out in the Neighbourhood Renewal National Strategy Action Plan, launched by the Prime Minister in January 2001. It aims to deliver economic prosperity, safe communities, high quality schools, decent housing and better health to the poorest parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.6/4">This approach focuses Government programmes explicitly on deprived areas, many of which are located in inner cities, and requires local people and the public and private sectors to work in partnership. Government departments, local government and other public service providers are expected to bend their mainstream budgets to meet better local needs in deprived neighbourhoods. Departments have been set a series of minimum standards known as floor targets&mdash;for the first time they will be judged on the areas where they are doing worst and not on the national average.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.6/5">Extra resources are being directed to the 88 most deprived local authority areas to kickstart the strategy, including the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund, worth #900 million over three years.</p>
	<p pid=".968W.6/6">The strategy is co-ordinated and driven forward by the cross-cutting Neighbourhood Renewal Unit based in DTLR. Further information on the National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal, including updates on progress, can be found on the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit website: <a href="http://www.neighbourhood.gov.uk">www.neighbourhood.gov.uk</a>.</p>

	<p pid=".980W.8/1">The Department has produced eight new TV fillers in the financial year 2001&ndash;02. Five of these cover road safety and three, which were modifications of previous TV advertising, cover fire safety. We have also updated five existing fire safety fillers. The total cost committed was #219,745.</p>
	<p pid=".980W.8/2">The eight new fillers will be launched at the beginning of the new financial year and we will monitor their success to inform future strategy, including the need to produce additional films.</p>
	<p pid=".980W.8/3">Figures returned by TV stations indicate an estimated total of 19,765 transmissions will have been secured by the end of March 2002, equivalent to #3.2 million worth of airtime. Coverage was achieved on BBC, ITV, Channel 5 and various satellite channels.</p>
	<p pid=".980W.8/4">We expect the value of airtime received to increase in the next financial year as our research has indicated that TV stations are more receptive to newer films.</p>

	<p pid=".981W.0/2">The Department's previous fillers (as DETR) secured at least 1,000 transmissions to publicise foot and mouth information and the role of the Drinking Water Inspectorate.

	<p pid=".985W.2/3" class="indent">As the Employment Service is an Executive Agency, the Minister of State has asked me to reply direct to your letter of <phrase class="date" code="2001-12-12">12 December 2001</phrase>, enclosing one from Ms Yvonne Allen of 23 Round Berry Drive, Salcombe, Devon, concerning the funding of her course. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Operating Officer of the Agency.</p>
	<p pid=".985W.2/4" class="indent">I was naturally concerned to learn of the difficulties Ms Allen is facing. To enable me to respond fully to the issues raised, I contacted Diana Ross, the Regional Director for the South West, and asked her to look into this matter for me.</p>
	<p pid=".985W.2/5" class="indent">It may be helpful if I first provide some background information. As you may be aware, Ms Allen undertook the Education and Training Opportunity option which is available to clients taking part in the New Deal for 25plus initiative. To be eligible for the provision clients must be over the age of 25, unemployed and at the time Ms Allen commenced New Deal 25plus, claiming Jobseeker's Allowance for two years or more.</p>
	<p pid=".985W.2/6" class="indent">Ms Ross tells me that prior to starting her training Ms Allen agreed an Individual Training Plan with her New Deal Personal Adviser. This states that her objective was to complete the Advanced Certificate in Therapeutic Counselling and gives the dates of the funding, which are from September 2000 to June 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".985W.2/7" class="indent">I understand that after completing this funded opportunity, Ms Allen was then invited to discuss her next steps towards finding work with her New Deal Personal Adviser, Fiona Cardrick. At this point, Ms Allen expressed a wish to pursue further training to gain the Diploma in Therapeutic Counselling. Fiona explained that as Ms Allen had already received a year's funding under the Education and Training Opportunity option, she was not eligible for further funding through New Deal. I should add that since New Deal began, it has always been the clearly stated policy to offer funding under the Education and Training Opportunity option for a maximum of one year. I can confirm that Ms Allen has received the maximum amount of funding allowed for participants on this option and that she was made aware of the limitations on funding at the outset.</p>
	<p pid=".985W.2/8" class="indent">I understand that Ms Allen is currently considering other sources of funding and has had further discussions with Fiona Cardrick, her Personal Adviser about her next steps.</p>
	<p pid=".985W.2/9" class="indent">I am sorry to send what I know will be a disappointing reply, but I hope it is helpful in clarifying the situation.</p>

	<p pid=".986W.11/1" class="holdinganswer">holding reply <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-21">21 March 2002</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".986W.11/2">We have considered carefully the impact of the current rules which reduce certain benefits paid to pensioners and people of working age after six weeks of hospitalisation. The down rating of benefits preserves the principle that the State should not make double provision. It also recognises that a substantial number of people leave hospital before six weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".986W.11/3">We consider the six week rule strikes a fair balance between what the state should provide financially and the provision individuals should make for themselves, however, we also recognise that people have on-going financial commitments whilst in hospital. We therefore announed on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-05">5 March 2002</phrase> that we have decided to extend the period before benefits are downrated by a further seven weeks to the 13 week stage. This will mean that people previously affected by the six week rule will be able to keep their benefits untouched if their period of stay in hospital is under 13 weeks. This will account for the majority of stays.</p>
	<p pid=".986W.11/4">We will introduce this change to coincide with the introduction of Pension Credit.</p>
	<p pid=".986W.11/5">The hospital personal allowance, currently #14.50 per week, is intended to provide for small personal items not provided by the hospital and is set by legislation. The amount is currently set as a percentage of Retirement Pension, which is reviewed every year. Benefit is restricted to this amount because, generally speaking, the National Health Service can be said to have assumed, to a large degree, the responsibility of providing for patients who have spent more than 52 weeks in hospital. There are no plans to change the amount by which benefits are reduced for hospital inpatients who have been in hospital for more than 52 weeks.</p>

	<p pid=".988W.8/2">We are transforming the welfare system from a passive organisation paying out benefits to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient.</p>
	<p pid=".988W.8/3">In support of these aims we are ensuring that work pays. The Working Families Tax Credit and the National Minimum Wage have for the first time guaranteed a minimum income for working families with children. These measures together guarantee that every family with children where at least one person is working 35 hours a week will receive a minimum income of #225 a week, or almost #12,000 a year.</p>
	<p pid=".988W.8/4">Entitlement to Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit is assessed by comparing a person's net income, less income disregards, with the amount they would receive on Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance. For each pound that their income exceeds this level, the amount of benefit payable is reduced by fixed tapers. For people moving from welfare into work these tapers ensure they are better off.</p>
	<p pid=".988W.8/5">For people in work, who receive a pay rise, the combined effect of the tapers in Working Families Tax Credit, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit means they remain better off. If Working Families Tax Credit was not taken into account in Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit families who worked longer hours or took better paid jobs would be worse off as they would face high marginal deduction rates.</p>

	<p pid=".989W.2/1">Our immediate priority for Housing Benefit is to work with local authorities to drive up standards across the board, tackle fraud and error and promote work incentives. We have introduced a wide range of measures providing incentives for local authorities to tackle housing benefit fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/2">In November 1997 we launched the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate to help raise standards in secure housing benefit administration. The BFI has so far published 116 reports helping local authorities to tackle weaknesses in their services and identifying and spreading good practice.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/3">In April 1998 we tightened the criteria for establishing fraud to prevent abuse of the Weekly Benefit Savings scheme which was originally introduced in 1993.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/4">In May 1998 we introduced the Verification Framework to help prevent fraud and error from entering the housing benefit system and help to detect it when it occurs. #160 million has been made available from April 2001 to fund local authorities which sign up to the Verification Framework, and over 75 per cent. of authorities have now done so.</p>
	<p pid=".989W.2/5">In April 2001 we introduced a comprehensive new anti-fraud scheme for local authorities that provides a broader range of financial incentives to prevent, detect, punish and prosecute fraud than did the old Weekly Benefit Savings scheme. To fund these two schemes we have made #180 million available since April 2001. Sixty-three authorities adopted the new scheme in April 2001 and the remaining authorities will do so in April this year.</p>

The aim of the Government's reforms is to see a marked increase in those numbers. The new scheme will be rigorously enforced; the simplicity of the new rules will enable the Agency to devote substantially more resources to enforcement. In the meantime, pending the start of the new scheme, I continue to look to the Agency to secure the best possible rate of compliance achievable under the current scheme.</p>

	<p pid=".995W.2/1">Research commissioned for the White Paper of July 1999, XA new contract for welfare&quot; found that the child support system was failing the children it was set up to help. A major part of the problem is that the existing formula for assessing maintenance is too complex. As a result too few resources have been available for enforcement. Consequently currently only around half of those Non-Resident Parents with an assessment pay all of the maintenance that is due. The Government therefore decided to simplify the child support system basing it on a simple percentage of the non-resident parents net income. It will be transparent and easier to understand so allowing a more customer focused Child Support Agency to spend less time calculating maintenance and more time chasing payments.</p>

	<p pid=".999W.5/1">Extended payments of Housing Benefit were introduced in 1996 and are available when an Income Support or an income-based Jobseeker's Allowance claim ends due to a person starting work (or increasing their hours and/or earnings) which is expected to last at least five weeks. They can be paid for four weeks and remove the uncertainty faced by many people about whether they will be able to pay their rent and council tax between the last payment of benefit and receipt of their first wages.</p>
	<p pid=".999W.5/2">As these claims are a fixed period award of Housing Benefit for up to four weeks they were originally excluded from all Housing Benefit statistics to make sure they did not inflate or distort the figures. They were, however, collected for internal use and they have been included in a footnote to tables in the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit Quarterly Summary Statistics since November 1999.</p>

	<p pid=".1001W.5/1">Approximately four months before reaching State Pension age (60 for a woman, age 65 for a man) an automatic claims package is issued to prospective pensioners provided the customer's current address is held on the computer.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/2">This contains form BR833 which sets out the options of how to make a claim for State Retirement Pension and leaflet AC1 which explains the benefits of payment straight into a bank account. The claim form gives the customer the option of payment by order book or payment straight into a bank or building society account.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/3">We are modernising the service we offer to pensioners and since November 2000 customers can make a claim over the phone with an experienced operator to guide them through the claim form. As part of this process callers are explained the methods of payment available i.e. either order book or payment straight into a bank or building society account. The claim form is thereby tailored to the particular circumstances of that customer and is returned for them to sign and date. All they need to do then is to send the completed form to their nearest processing centre.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/4">From 2003, payments directly into a bank or building society account will become the Department's normal method of payment. This is a more modern, secure and efficient way of paying benefits and pensions, already chosen by over 40 per cent. of all customers and 60 per cent. of new pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/5">The Department has been aware of FRS17 throughout its development, a process that has taken several years.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/6">Ministers and officials hold regular consultations with those involved with the pensions industry. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State met representatives from the ASB on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-27">27 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1001W.5/7">There are many factors tending to increase the costs and risks faced by employers who choose to offer defined benefit occupational pension schemes including longer life expectancy and lower expected future investment returns. It is not possible to isolate the effects of FRS17 from these other factors.</p>

	<p pid=".1002W.3/1">Since 1986 the Inland Revenue has required pension funds which are funded in excess of 105 per cent of their liabilities to reduce their surplus. This may be done in a variety of ways, including improved benefits to scheme members, employer or employee contribution holidays and taxable refunds to the employer sponsoring the scheme. The Pensions Act 1995 requires that, before any refund is made to an employer, all current and future pensions in payment should be increased annually in line with the Retail Prices Index up to a maximum of 5 per cent., that trustees should satisfy themselves that the use of the surplus is in the interest of the members, and that members should be notified of the proposal in the manner set out in law.</p>
	<p pid=".1002W.3/2">The trust deed for each pension scheme may also regulate the way that surpluses can be reduced. If the trustees propose to make a payment to the employer, and this is permitted by the trust deed, members can challenge their decision through the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra) if they believe that the statutory procedures have not been followed. If the trust deed does not permit payments to the employer, the trustees may apply to Opra to change the scheme rules in order to allow payment.</p>
	<p pid=".1002W.3/3">My right hon. Friend has not issued formal guidance on the operation of the Pensions Act 1995. Opra issues guidance on a variety of topics. Note 3, published in 1998, deals with Opra's role in the payment of surplus.</p>

	<p pid=".1002W.6/1">The Government is currently in the process of strengthening the law relating to the nomination and selection of trustees to ensure that every occupational pension scheme has member-nominated trustees. We do not think it was right to force schemes to have member trustees from particular categories of membership, because that would erroneously give credence to the idea that trustees have a representative role, which they do not. The duties and responsibilities of all the trustees are the same, regardless of how they come to the post.</p>
	<p pid=".1002W.6/2">The timing of this work will depend on the outcome of the broader simplification review being undertaken by Alan Pickering which is due to report in June, but we remain firmly committed to increasing the number of member trustees generally.</p>

	<p pid=".1006W.2/1">The Weekly Benefit Savings (WBS) scheme was introduced in April 1993 to encourage Local Authorities to undertake activity to combat benefit fraud. It is based on a system of rewards and penalties for the amount of fraud detected.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.2/2">Changes were made to the scheme in 1998 following concerns from the National Audit Office and Audit Commission that WBS was being inappropriately claimed in cases where fraud had not been established or a fraud investigation had not been properly undertaken.

To address this, increased rates of additional subsidy were made payable to Local Authorities and a reduced level of penalty was introduced in April 1999.</p>

	<p pid=".1006W.5/154">Notes:</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.5/155">1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data set which is derived from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS does not include Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.5/156">2. The estimates are sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that control for tenure, Council Tax band and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error and to variability in non-response. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household).</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.5/157">3. The estimates are presented on both a Before Housing Costs (BHC) and an After Housing Costs (AHC) basis in line with HBAI conventions. Figures are also provided including and excluding the self-employed, as research suggests that, for self-employed people, income as reported in surveys is often a poor indicator of living standards.</p>
	<p pid=".1006W.5/158">4. Estimates for the numbers of pensioners and children living in households below 60 per cent. median income by region have not been provided as the FRS grossing regime does not permit the provision of reliable estimates of numbers, as distinct from percentages. This issue does not affect either GB level estimates of numbers nor regional estimates of percentages. The grossing methodology in the FRS is currently being reviewed with one aim being to resolve this issue.</p>

	<p pid=".1012W.3/1">Entitlement to Retirement Pension begins with the pay-day on or following the pensioner's 60th or 65th birthday. Changes in entitlement, for example a decrease because of a prolonged stay in hospital, also takes effect from the pay-day following the change in circumstances. The same rule applies with the termination of the award. The principle of paying Retirement Pension in whole weeks stems from the fact that the benefit is traditionally paid in advance.</p>

	<p pid=".1013W.0/2">FRS17 is an accounting standard introduced by the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) which is entirely independent of Government. Financial reporting standards are introduced after a long period of public consultation which offers an opportunity for those with an interest to make representations to the ASB.</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.0/3">The Department has been aware of FRS17 throughout its development, a process that has taken several years.</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.0/4">Ministers and officials hold regular consultations with those involved with the pensions industry. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State met representatives from the ASB on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-27">27 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1013W.0/5">There are many factors tending to increase the costs and risks faced by employers who choose to offer defined benefit occupational pension schemes including longer life expectancy and lower expected future investment returns. It is not possible to isolate the effects of FRS17 from these other factors.</p>
