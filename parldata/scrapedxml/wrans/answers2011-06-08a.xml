	<p pid="a.307W.3/2">In the European Union, genetically modified (GM) foods undergo a pre-market evaluation that includes the safety of components introduced into GM crops, such as Bt proteins. The safety of Bt proteins has also been assessed during the authorisation of pesticides that contain the microorganism Bacillus thuringiensis. The assessment of the Bt proteins that are present in authorised GM foods is based on tests in animals and does not include human trials to examine whether the proteins pass into the blood supply. However, the available data from in vitro tests have shown that Bt proteins are rapidly broken down by digestive enzymes in the same way as most other proteins in the diet.</p>

	<p pid="a.308W.2/1">The Government are fully committed to raising energy efficiency standards for products, and encouraging consumers and businesses to buy the most efficient products available. Removing the least efficient products from the market remains one of the most cost-effective ways of reducing CO2 emissions, and benefits consumers and businesses by reducing their energy bills. The UK is at the forefront of negotiating ambitious yet achievable minimum energy performance and labelling standards in Europe for the highest energy-consuming appliances. Government recently launched a campaign with retailers to promote a better understanding of the EU Energy label among consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.308W.2/2">In addition to minimum energy performance and labelling standards agreed in Europe, DEFRA, along with the Energy Saving Trust, has launched a voluntary retailer initiative for televisions, which encourages retailers to remove the least efficient products from their shelves ahead of legislative requirements and promote best in class products. The UK is also working closely with industry on an EU-wide voluntary code of conduct on data centres.</p>

	<p pid="a.316W.0/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Scott Woolveridge, dated June 2011</p>
	<p pid="a.316W.0/3">As acting Chief Executive of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Questions about opinion polls and surveys planned and conducted by IPSA.</p>
	<p pid="a.316W.0/4">Since IPSA began operations in May 2010 it has conducted one public opinion poll and one external online survey as part of the first Annual Review of the MPs' Expenses Scheme. The opinion poll was part of a regular omnibus poll conducted by an independent polling company at a cost of approximately &#163;2700. The online survey was created by IPSA staff using commercial software, at a one-off cost of &#163;1169 (with one-off web hosting cost of &#163;464). This software has subsequently been used for a website usability survey and may be used to conduct future external surveys.</p>
	<p pid="a.316W.0/5">At this stage, IPSA does not have specific plans for future external surveys or opinion polling, although we would anticipate periodically carrying out research into public opinion in relation to the work of IPSA.</p>

	<p pid="a.317W.0/1">The drug rehabilitation requirement (DRR) is the primary means for sentenced offenders to address their drug misuse as part of a community order or suspended sentence order. The costs of the DRR cover treatment, which is funded by drug (and alcohol) action teams (D(A)ATs) in England, and the costs of managing the requirement by local Probation Trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.0/2">Significant local variations in D(A)AT commissioning practice and costs of treatment modalities have made it difficult to establish the average cost of the treatment element of a DRR.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.0/3">Detailed work to cost the services funded by NOMS estimates the average direct cost of supporting a DRR. This is the cost per completion at different levels of intensity for different lengths of requirement, each of which relate to the seriousness of the offence and the extent of the offender's needs.<sup>(1)</sup> The estimates are as follows, and are contained in published information which has been placed in both Libraries.</p>

	<p pid="a.317W.0/17">The following table shows the number of DRR commencements, successful completions, and revocations for non-compliance following breach proceedings broken down by age and gender in each of the last three years for which full information is available<sup>(2)</sup>. Data on the number of applications made for a summons or warrant to return the offender to court for breach is not collected centrally by type of requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.317W.0/18">The proportion of offenders successfully completing DRRs rose from 47% in 2008-09 to 56% in 2009-10<sup>(3)</sup>. This is encouraging because we know from research relating to the drug treatment and testing order (DTTO), which was replaced by the DRR, that offenders who complete orders have significantly lower reconviction rates (53%) than those that do not (91%)<sup>(4)</sup>, although it is not possible to attribute this difference entirely to the programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.317W.0/20"><sup>(1)</sup> The DRR can be used for low, medium and high sentencing bands. The amount and intensity of the drug treatment delivered under the DRR can be tailored to individual treatment needs regardless of the seriousness of the offence.

As part of this commitment, the banks intend to lend &#163;190 billion of new credit to businesses in 2011, up from &#163;179 billion in 2010. If demand exceeds this, the banks will lend more. &#163;76 billion of this lending will be to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

	<p pid="a.350W.2/13">The CQC&#8217;s methodology does not prescribe a set frequency for visits. In line with the principles of risk-based regulation, the CQC carries out visits in line with its judgment of risk when these are the most effective way of gathering information about compliance. This means the CQC targets its resources on providers where the risk is highest, while reducing the regulatory burden on providers where the risk is low.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.2/14">Across its regulatory scope, the CQC has capacity to undertake 15,000 to 20,000 responsive reviews over a one-year period, the vast majority of which it anticipates to include a site visit. This does not reflect the full extent of its site visit regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.350W.2/15">Site visits will therefore take place wherever necessary and it is not possible to predict the number which will take place in each quarter of the year 2011 to 2012.</p>

Dental contract pilots, which will test aspects of the new contract, are about to become operational. In addition, to reinforce the benefits of the contractual changes, we are exploring how general dental practices can develop closer links to primary schools, and we have included rates of dental decay among five year old children in &#8220;Healthy Lives, Healthy People: proposals for a public health outcomes framework&#8221;. Dental practices in Northamptonshire, where there is already support on oral health promotion for children and young adults, will be well placed to take advantage of these changes.</p>

	<p pid="a.372W.5/1">Subject to the NHS Listening Exercise and the passage of the Health and Social Care Bill, the NHS Commissioning Board will commission national and regional specialised services with commissioning consortia responsible for commissioning other complex services. Through consortia, general practitioners (GPs) and other clinicians will have new opportunities to shape the way that health services are designed and delivered. Taking into account the increasing range of NICE Quality Standards, consortia will work closely with secondary care and other health care professionals, and with community partners, to design joined-up services, and optimal care pathways, that make sense to patients, families and the public. They will have the freedom to seek the commissioning support they need to do this.</p>
	<p pid="a.372W.5/2">We will ensure that there is particular emphasis within the &#8216;pathfinder&#8217; programme on testing ways of ensuring that consortia quickly develop knowledge and expertise in relation to more complex and specialist services. We will also ensure that the NHS Commissioning Board has a particular focus on promoting quality improvement in relation to more complex or specialist services. This will include exploring joint commissioning with local authorities, for instance in relation to care and support for children (including looked after children and children living in families with multiple problems), people with long-term mental health conditions, and people with learning disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.372W.5/3">In addition, local authorities and commissioning consortia will be required to prepare a Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA). This is to ensure that each area develops a comprehensive analysis of the current and future needs of their area (including those relevant to health, social care, public health). Based on the JSNA, the members of the Health and Wellbeing Board will be required to develop a joint health and well-being strategy for their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.372W.5/4">Arrangements for annual health checks for people with learning disabilities are currently covered by a Directed Enhanced Service, which forms part of the overall contractual framework for GP practices. Under the future commissioning arrangements proposed in the Health and Social Care Bill, the NHS Commissioning Board would be responsible for commissioning services from GP practices and for negotiating any changes to GP contracts.</p>

The Department works closely with Motability but it is an independent charity and is wholly responsible for the administration of the Motability scheme.

	<p pid="a.375W.3/2">Motability has advised that the rigorous assessment process and criteria they use for determining support for adapted vehicles has meant that they have never identified any incidences of scheme customers receiving support they were not entitled to. Support for vehicle adaptations is provided through Motability's own charitable fund or the Specialised Vehicles Fund, which Motability administers on behalf of the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.375W.3/3">The Specialised Vehicles Fund provides financial assistance to those severely disabled scheme customers who require complex vehicle adaptations that allow them to enter a car as a passenger while remaining seated in their wheelchair or enables them to drive their car whilst remaining seated in their wheelchair. The Department is satisfied that the criteria Motability use to sift applications to the Specialised Vehicles Fund helps severely disabled people who face barriers to living independently including those who are seeking or in employment or education.</p>

For people who do not have the necessary English language skills to find work, the Government recognises the importance of English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) training in helping them gain employment and to contribute to society. It is equally vital that where people are required to engage in the labour market as a condition of receiving benefits that appropriate support is in place. The Government's priority is therefore to focus the available resources of publicly-funded ESOL provision on people whose lack of English is preventing them from finding work.</p>

	<p pid="a.380W.2/1">The spending review 2010 announced that from 2013 we will introduce a cap on the total amount of benefit that working-age people can receive so that households on out-of-work benefits will no longer receive more in welfare payments than the average weekly wage for working households. The benefit cap is intended to promote fairness between those in and out of work and to increase incentives for people to move into work or increase their hours of employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.380W.2/2">On its introduction we estimate that household benefit payments will be capped at around &#163;500 per week for couple and lone parent households and around &#163;350 per week for single adult households.</p>

	<p pid="a.380W.2/7">Excluding households where a member is in receipt of <i>(f)</i> employment support allowance in the work-related activity group is expected to reduce savings to approximately &#163;210 million in 2013-14 and &#163;225 million 2014-15.

	<p pid="a.382W.3/1">The spending review 2010 announced that from 2013 we will introduce a cap on the total amount of benefit that working-age people can receive so that households on out-of-work benefits will no longer receive more in welfare payments than the average weekly wage for working households. The benefit cap is intended to promote fairness between those in and out of work and to increase incentives for people to move into work or increase their hours of employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.3/2">On its introduction we estimate that household benefit payments will be capped at around &#163;500 per week for couple and lone parent households and around &#163;350 per week for single adult households.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.3/3">If the benefit cap were applied as described in the spending review the savings to the Exchequer are estimated to be &#163;225 million in 2013-14 and &#163;270 million in 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.3/4">Estimates suggest that excluding <i>(a)</i> child benefit from the calculation of the household benefit cap would reduce savings to approximately &#163;115 million in 2013-14 and &#163;140 million 2014-15, while excluding <i>(b)</i> child tax credit would reduce savings to approximately &#163;40 million in 2013-14 and &#163;50 million in 2014-15. Figures are not available for 2015-16 and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.3/5">Working tax credit recipients (including those receiving child care support through WTC) are excluded from the benefit cap, therefore excluding support paid for <i>(c)</i> child care costs through working tax credit from the benefit cap will have no impact on the overall savings.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.3/6">The information requested in section <i>(d)</i> is not available as the estimated savings from the benefit cap in universal credit will depend upon final detailed design issues regarding the treatment of in-work households.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.3/7">Note that estimates above are based on the current benefit system including changes announced in the spending review 2010, but excluding universal credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.382W.3/8">Analysis of those affected by the benefit cap has been modelled using survey data&#8212;as such there is a degree of uncertainty around the results.</p>

	<p pid="a.385W.2/2">Changes to child benefit are one of a number of changes the Government have made to the tax and benefits system. These changes also include substantial increases above indexation of the child element of the child tax credit in April 2011 and April 2012. Treasury analysis shows that modelled tax and benefit reforms announced since Budget 2010 may have a small reduction in child poverty in 2011-12 and 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="a.385W.2/3">The Government have recently published their first Child Poverty Strategy, which covers the period 2011-14, and sets out the Government&#8217;s vision for every child to have the opportunity to realise their potential and stabilise the lives of particularly vulnerable families.</p>

	<p pid="a.385W.5/1">The national child poverty strategy, published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-05">5 April</phrase> this year, sets out how we will reduce child poverty across the UK. In addition to setting out how national reforms&#8212;such as the introduction of universal credit&#8212;will help reduce child poverty across the UK, the strategy also sets out local areas&#8217; key role in tackling child poverty. Through decentralising power, reducing bureaucracy and greater local accountability we are giving local areas the freedom they need to tackle the particular root causes of child poverty in their area; for example the first phase of community budgets aimed at tackling families with multiple problems are being implemented in 16 local areas including eight London boroughs.</p>
	<p pid="a.385W.5/2">The universal credit will support those who do the right thing, who take a full-time job to have an income which lifts them out of poverty. Our proposed design should enable most families with children who have a parent in full-time employment to have an income that lifts them out of poverty. The same should apply for lone parents who work at least 24 hours a week or more. The six contractors for London were announced in April and the programme will be rolled-out in London over the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="a.385W.5/3">The strategy also sets put the Child Poverty Core Offer of sector-led support that is available to all local authorities to help them implement their duties to reduce child poverty under Part II of the Child Poverty Act. As part of the Government&#8217;s wider goal to free-up policy delivery to target local need, we will continue to push power away from the centre to local government, communities and voluntary sectors, to help those families in difficulties make their voices heard.</p>

	<p pid="a.390W.2/1">I refer the hon. Member to my answer of <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-08">8 February 2011</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-02-08.208"><i>Official Report,</i> columns 208-09W</phrase>, to his question asking what funding has been allocated for <i>(a)</i> apprenticeship places, <i>(b)</i> advanced apprenticeship places and <i>(c)</i> higher apprenticeship places in 2011-12; and what funding was allocated in each such category in (i) 2009-10 and (ii) 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.2/2">The Apprenticeships programme is demand led. Government does not plan apprenticeship places by level but provides funding and forecasts the overall number of places that may be afforded. We rely on employers and providers to work together to offer sufficient opportunities to meet local demand, taking advantage of the greater freedoms and flexibilities that we have created in the further education system.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.2/3">In 2009-10, the planned expenditure on participation in apprenticeship training was &#163;1,042 million<sup>(1)</sup>. The apprenticeship budget for the 2010-11 financial year is &#163;1,328 million<sup>(2)</sup>: &#163;780 million for 16 to 18-year-olds; &#163;548 million for 19+. We expect to spend over &#163;1,400 million in the 2011-12 financial year: &#163;799 million for 16 to 18-year-olds; &#163;605 million for those aged 19 and over<sup>(3)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.2/4">The total volume of apprenticeship starts in 2009/10 was 279,700. This is an increase of 16.6% compared to 2008/09. Of these there were:</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.2/5">190,500 apprenticeship (Level 2) starts-a 20.2% increase on 2008/09;</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.2/6">87,700 advanced apprenticeship (Level 3) starts-a 7.9% increase on 2008/09;</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.2/7">1,500 higher level apprenticeship (Level 4+) starts-a large increase on 2008/09.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.2/8">We have ensured there is sufficient funding in place to train over 350,000 apprentices in England in the 2010/11 academic year. For the 2011/12 academic year, our indicative forecast is to fund over 360,000 apprenticeship places. The levels that these places are at will be determined by the level of skills employers actually need in their business.</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.2/9">Provisional data shows that there were 119,800 apprenticeship starts in the first quarter of the 2010/11 academic year. Of these there were:</p>
	<p pid="a.390W.2/10">76,300 apprenticeship (Level 2) starts;</p>

	<p pid="a.390W.2/13">We are committed to improving, expanding and re-shaping apprenticeships so that Level 3 becomes the level to which learners and employers should aspire.

	<p pid="a.391W.5/1">The Merlin Agreement was about setting stretching lending targets to the banks to make sure that they make available the credit that businesses need to grow. This is particularly important for small businesses, and this is why we have insisted on individual figures for SMEs.</p>
	<p pid="a.391W.5/2">The Bank of England reported the banks' first quarter performance against the Merlin Agreement on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-23">23 May</phrase>. Lending to SMEs in the first quarter was &#163;16.8 billion against a quarterly &#8216;stretch&#8217; target of &#163;17.2 billion (the &#8216;capacity&#8217; target would imply a figure of &#163;19 billion). This is disappointing and, although lending to small firms will not follow a linear pattern month on month, the banks must do more to ensure that they meet their commitment over the next few months.</p>
	<p pid="a.391W.5/3">The agreement with the banks was made mid-way through the first quarter, and this might have impacted on the figures. But it is too early to properly assess the impact of the Merlin Agreement on small businesses' ability to access bank finance.</p>
	<p pid="a.391W.5/4">We will therefore continue to monitor very closely whether the banks are making sufficient credit available to small firms before passing a definitive judgement on the impact of the agreement on small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.391W.5/5">The Government are clear that, if the banks fail to meet their commitments, the Government reserves the right to return to the matter and take further measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.392W.2/1">On April 7 2011, the Government published the first in a series of publications entitled &#8216;One-in, One-out: Statement of New Regulation&#8217;, which will be published twice a year. The Statement of New Regulation showed that the Government's One-in, One-out rule has resulted in an overall reduction in the net cost to business and civil society organisations of -&#163;3.207 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.392W.2/2">When work started on the Statement of New Regulation, Departments proposed a total of 157 domestic regulatory measures, 119 of which would have imposed a cost to business. In the course of preparing the Statement of New Regulation the requirement for the estimates to be assessed and confirmed by the independent Regulatory Policy Committee was rigorously imposed, and Departments were challenged to defend particular regulatory decisions. The result was that the total number of proposed regulations dropped by 70% (from 157 to 46). Of the remaining 46 measures only 11 impose a net cost to business, 26 impose a zero net cost to business and nine reduce the net cost to business.</p>

We are addressing current weaknesses in the vital intermediate technical skills that are increasingly important as jobs become more highly skilled and technological change accelerates. We have already made significant progress in the short time since the skills strategy's publication.</p>
	<p pid="a.401W.2/2">We have placed apprenticeships at the heart of the system, expanding, improving and reshaping them so that technician level&#8212;Level 3&#8212;becomes the level to which learners and employers aspire. We are creating clear routes from apprenticeships to higher level training. Alongside apprenticeships there will be a wider and more flexible system of vocational qualifications that meets the needs of the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.401W.2/3">In addition, we have established the Growth and Innovation Fund to support employers to be more ambitious about raising skills to reach their growth potential. And we have refocused the role of the UK Commission for Employment and Skills to be a true vehicle for economic growth and social partnership, with employers, trade unions and others coming together to give effective leadership on skills. One of the UKCES's strategic objectives is to provide high quality labour market intelligence to enable the supply of skills to be matched with demand more effectively.</p>
