Nevertheless, the increasing number of outbreaks in Eastern Europe raises concerns that the virus may be more widespread than previously anticipated in the affected region. Should the number of virus detections continue to increase in Eastern European countries, this may change the likelihood of introduction of the virus to the UK. Defra continues to monitor developments and assess the situation.</p>

Following a public consultation exercise and an adverse judgment by the European court of justice on infraction proceedings by the European Commission against the UK, we are now finalising the waste management (England and Wales) Regulations 2006. The main purpose of the Regulations is to repeal the exclusion in section 75(7)<i>(c)</i> of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and to apply to agricultural waste the national controls that are already in place to comply with the Waste Framework Directive and the Landfill Directive. Our aim is to make and lay the Regulations before Parliament by <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2006</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.2112W.5/1">Local authorities and regional assembles are the responsible bodies to plan for the management of all waste types within their areas. Any growth in waste volumes needs to be seen in the context of wider trends in waste volumes linked to overall economic performance as well as any waste growth linked to planned expansion of housing. In defined growth areas, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) have held regional seminars to discuss how waste arising from increasing population, particularly from construction, demolition and excavation can be properly planned for to ensure that the necessary infrastructure can be developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.2112W.5/2">The ODPM are also in discussions with the Environment Agency to carry out a study to predict quantities and types of waste that are likely to arise in the Thames Gateway region and the results from this study will be applicable to other designated growth areas.

Over the three-year period to 2005&ndash;06, authorities are also benefiting from a total of &pound;294 million invested through the Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund and its successor the Waste Performance and Efficiency Grant, will provide a further &pound;260 million over the three years to 2007&ndash;08. Finally, through the Private Finance Initiative (PFI), credits worth &pound;355 million have been made available over the three years to 2005&ndash;06 as an extra source of funding, with a further &pound;535 million available in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08.</p>

Section 9(1) of the Waste and Emissions Trading Act (WET Act) places each waste disposal authority (WDA) under a duty to secure that the amount of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) sent to landfills in that year does not exceed the amount authorised by the landfill allowances available to that authority for the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.2113W.5/2">At the end of the each scheme year (<phrase class="date" code="">31 March</phrase> annually), there will be a six month reconciliation period. Authorities will have three months to submit their end of year data. During the following two months, the monitoring authority will provide each authority with a draft reconciliation between the amount of BMW the authority landfilled and the number of allowances it holds. Should an authority have landfilled more waste than it holds allowances for, it can then use the sixth month to trade or borrow allowances to balance the figures. Any authority which has landfilled in excess of the allowances it holds at the end of the reconciliation period will be liable to a financial penalty of &pound;150 per tonne (Section 9(2) of the WET ACT). In a target year: the Government will reserve the right to pass some or all of any fine imposed by the European Court of Justice. Guidance on the procedure for the application of penalties under section 9(2) of the WET Act and on the Secretary of State's powers to waive, and to extend the time for paying, penalties and interest with respect to landfilling of BMW in excess of allowances held has been published on the DEFRA website at</p>

	<p pid="a.2114W.5/1">UK methane emissions have fallen every year since 1990 and by 2004 had dropped to about half of 1990 levels. The main sources of methane emissions in the UK are landfill sites, agriculture, coal mining, gas distribution, and oil and gas production.</p>
	<p pid="a.2114W.5/2">Landfill site operators that continue to accept waste must fulfil the requirements of the Landfill Directive including taking appropriate measures to collect, treat and use landfill gas to produce useful energy or, where that is not possible, flare it. Other government measures to reduce the levels of biodegradable waste being sent to landfill include the landfill tax escalator, the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme (designed to meet the Landfill Directive targets), and public awareness campaigns. Together these measures have resulted in a decrease of about 63 per cent. in landfill methane emissions between 1990 and 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.2114W.5/3">The nature of emissions from agriculture make them a more difficult to target for reduction than in other sectors. Nonetheless, improvement in animal diet and productivity has produced an 11 per cent. decrease in methane emissions from animals since 1990, and further reductions are expected. Recent research from the Rowett Research Institute, based in Aberdeen into anti-methane feed ingredients has yielded promising results, and in initial trials a reduction of up to 70 per cent. in emitted methane has been achieved. The UK Government remain committed to research into reducing methane emissions from ruminants. We are also committed to exploring techniques for methane recovery from agricultural waste and its use as a clean energy source.</p>
	<p pid="a.2114W.5/4">With regard to methane from coal mining, UK Coal signed up to the UK Emissions Trading scheme in 2002, with the target of reducing methane emissions from their installations by 400,000 tonnes by 2006. Furthermore methane extracted from abandoned coal mines and used as fuel has been exempt from the climate change levy since 2003. This exemption encourages the owners of mining facilities and decommissioned mines to invest in systems that capture methane that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. In addition the Coal Authority and the Department of Trade and Industry are developing a scheme further to encourage the mitigation of methane from abandoned mines. Methane emissions from coal mining (including closed mines) fell by some 73 per cent. between 1990 and 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.2114W.5/5">Fugitive emissions from natural gas dropped by about 39 per cent. between 1990 and 2004. National Grid Gas plc, which owns and maintains the UK gas distribution network, is continuing to make improvements to the UK gas network. The planned replacement of 91,000 km iron gas mains with polyethylene pipes will lead to a further reduction in methane emissions from gas transmission.</p>
	<p pid="a.2114W.5/6">Methane emissions from offshore production of oil and gas fell by 53 per cent. between 1990 and 2004 in line with trends in numbers of installations and production levels.</p>

	<p pid="a.2115W.5/1">The Government recognises the importance of encouraging industry to develop recyclable products. Since it began work in 2000 the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) has had a positive impact in developing markets for recycled materials and removing barriers to recycling. WRAP is engaged with producers and purchasers and has developed guidance along with the provision of advisory services to increase the take up of recycled products throughout a range of industries.</p>
	<p pid="a.2115W.5/2">Producer responsibility legislation, such as the Packaging, End of Life Vehicle (ELV) and forthcoming Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations, places obligations on producers to recycle products when they come to their end of life, providing an incentive for them to ensure their products are more recyclable from the outset.</p>
	<p pid="a.2115W.5/3">Finally as disposal costs continue to rise due to increased landfill tax there should be an indirect pressure on manufacturers to make products more recyclable.</p>

	<p pid="a.2116W.5/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/2"><i>(a)</i> Waste strategy 2000 set out national recycling and composting targets for household waste, of 17 percent. in 2003&ndash;04, rising to 25 percent. in 2005&ndash;06, then 30 percent. in 2010 and 33 percent. in 2015. Each local authority was also set a statutory target for 2003&ndash;04 and 2005&ndash;06 and to assure that further progress is made, I recently launched for consultation options for further recycling/composting targets in 2007&ndash;08. All of the Tees Valley authorities met their 2003&ndash;04 targets and most are making good progress towards their 2005&ndash;06 targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/3">In addition to the recycling targets the Household Waste Recycling Act 2003 requires waste collection authorities&mdash;subject to certain exemptions&mdash;to provide a kerbside collection service of at least two recyclable materials by 2010. Furthermore, waste disposal authorities have been set challenging landfill diversion targets for biodegradable municipal waste which will drive authorities to ensure that the recycling of this waste is maximised.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/4">The Government recognises the challenge local authorities in England face meeting their statutory performance standards in recycling and composting. Accordingly, in the 2004 Spending Review announced an increase in the environmental, protective, and cultural services block of &pound;888 million by 2007&ndash;08 over 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/5">Funding is also being provided from a variety of other sources to help authorities meet and exceed their targets. DEFRA's waste minimisation and recycling fund and its successor, DEFRA's waste performance and efficiency grant, are providing funding totalling &pound;294 million over the three years to 2005&ndash;06 for specific projects to expand recycling operations of which the Tees Valley authorities have in total received around &pound;5.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/6">The Tees Valley authorities have also benefited from consultancy support for the development of a joint waste management strategy through DEFRA's waste implementation programme which has devoted over &pound;150 million over the three years to 2005&ndash;06 to strategic measures helping authorities to divert waste from landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/7">The waste resources and action programme&mdash;a not-for-profit company supported by funding from the Government&mdash;has provided support to the Tees Valley authorities on home composting and over &pound;270 000 for funding local communications in four of the five authorities. Each of the Tees Valley authorities is also participating in a &pound;66 000 household incentive pilot scheme funded by DEFRA. The scheme will provide valuable information to all authorities on what household incentives provide the best increases in recycling rates in different types of community in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/8">Within the context of the regional spatial strategy&mdash;which will provide the overarching framework for growth in the North East over the next 15 to 20 years, a regional waste strategy is being developed to encourage greater re-use and recycling of waste resources, moving them higher up the 'waste hierarchy'. The Government have also set up the North East regional support fund which has provided over &pound;100,000 over the last two years for waste research chosen by the North East authorities&mdash;including strong Tees Valley representation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/9"><i>(b)</i> There are different mechanisms in place to encourage businesses to recycle more and divert more waste from landfill sites. These include:</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/10" class="italic">The landfill tax escalator:</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/11" class="indent">The standard rate of landfill tax, which applies to active wastes, has been increased by &pound;3 per tonne in 2005&ndash;06, and will be further increased by at least &pound;3 per tonne in the following years to reach a medium&mdash;to long-term rate of &pound;35 per tonne. The rate is currently &pound;18 per tonne. The landfill tax was introduced to stimulate reductions in the levels of waste going to landfill and encourage the development of more sustainable waste management practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/12" class="italic">The BREW programme:</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/13" class="indent">The business resource efficiency and waste (BREW) programme, which recycles revenue generated through the landfill tax, provides new support to business that specifically targets waste minimisation and the diversion of waste away from landfill.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/14" class="italic">The landfill diversion targets:</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/15" class="indent">These will apply to biodegradable commercial waste that is collected by a local authority. As the cost of disposing of this waste will increase, authorities that collect commercial waste will have an incentive to ensure that as much of the waste is recycled as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/16" class="italic">Economics:</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/17" class="indent">The economic incentive for businesses to recycle is often much more clear-cut than it is for households as businesses generally pay for the volume of waste they create whereas householders pay a flat fee as part of council tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/18" class="italic">Packaging waste regulations:</p>
	<p pid="a.2116W.5/19" class="indent">These regulations set annual business targets for recovery and recycling of packaging waste designed to meet the national targets. Any business handling more than 50 tonnes of packaging and with a turnover of more than &pound;2 million is obligated. To date, businesses have recovered 53 percent in 2003 of packaging waste, compared with 33 percent in 1998; and recycled 47 percent. compared with 29 percent. in 1998.</p>

	<p pid="a.2118W.2/2">However, Government strongly believes that the right approach to changing behaviour is to continue to work with householders to ensure that they are given every opportunity to take part in recycling through the provision of a high quality recycling service, before enforcement is considered as an option.</p>

	<p pid="a.2119W.5/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.2119W.5/2">There is no statutory requirement for milk to be provided in local authority maintained schools. It is a matter for local authorities and schools to decide. However, where a local authority provides milk, education legislation requires them to provide it free to pupils whose parents are in receipt of the following: income support; income based job seeker's allowance; support under part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999; child tax credit, provided that they are not entitled to working tax credit, and have an annual income (as assessed by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) that from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-06">6 April 2005</phrase> does not exceed &pound;13,910; or the guarantee element of state pension credit. In addition, children who receive income support or income based jobseeker's allowance in their own right are entitled to free school milk where it is provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.2119W.5/3">It is this Department's view that where a local authority engages a contractor to supply milk to the schools in their area, the contractor is deemed to be acting on behalf of the local authority. In these cases the local authority would remain responsible for providing free milk to eligible pupils. The Department will investigate any complaints related to a failure to carry out duties imposed by education legislation. Ultimately, the Secretary of State may direct a local authority to carry out their duty in relation to free milk provision where they are failing to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.2120W.0/1">The most important recent development is the adoption, in December 2005 under the UK presidency of the EU, of the EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Regulation. This will allow the EU to enter into Partnership Agreements with developing countries and provide them with assistance to tackle illegal logging. This assistance will include a licensing system designed to identify products and license them for export to the EU. It will be reinforced by powers for HM Customs to take a range of actions relating to unlicensed products from partner countries; this will allow member states to prohibit the import of illegal timber from those countries into the EU for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.2120W.0/2">The first Partnership Agreements will be signed in 2006. The Department for International Development (DfID) has recently announced that it will be setting aside 24 million over the next five years for this FLEGT negotiation process and for tackling illegal logging more generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.2120W.0/3">The Government also have been giving specific help to producer countries to prevent trade in illegal timber. Examples from the countries mentioned are as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.2120W.0/4" class="italic">(a) Indonesia</p>
	<p pid="a.2120W.0/5" class="indent">In Indonesia there is a programme of work under a Memorandum of Understanding (signed in 2002) that commits both governments to tackle illegal logging and associated trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.2120W.0/6" class="italic">(b) China</p>
	<p pid="a.2120W.0/7" class="indent">The Eighth EU-China summit, held in Beijing on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-05">5 September 2005</phrase>, agreed that the EU and China would work together to tackle the problem of illegal logging in the Asian region. The Government are working to take this forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.2120W.0/8" class="italic">(c) Brazil</p>
	<p pid="a.2120W.0/9" class="indent">The UK has contributed &pound;14 million to the multi-donor pilot programme for the Preservation of Brazilian Rain Forests and is a major contributor to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) which is creating and maintaining protected areas in the region through the Amazon Region Protected Areas Programme.</p>

	<p pid="a.2124W.2/1">The Ministry of Defence is fully committed to relocating 3,900 posts out of the south-east under the Lyons review. All relocation proposals are judged on the basis of value for money as demonstrated in a business case. A proposed move into London or the south-east must therefore offer significant value for money, efficiency and business benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.2124W.2/2">Currently the only confirmed move of posts into the south-east is a result of the collocation of the two existing RAF headquarters into a single integrated HQ at High Wycombe. This is an element of the Ministry of Defence's efficiency programme and will achieve significant manpower and financial savings, but will result in a net increase of 96 posts at High Wycombe.</p>

	<p pid="a.2128W.5/1">Studies within the Ministry of Defence have concluded that there is no current defence requirement for retaining Bentley Priory and therefore the Department is considering options for its disposal. This work is being taken forward through Project MoDEL, which aims to consolidate the defence estate in Greater London to ensure that it is the right size and quality to support our future operational outputs and to improve working and living conditions for current and future generations of service personnel in London. The MOD is in the process of selecting an industry partner to take the project forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.2128W.5/2">The MOD is well aware of the unique historical importance of RAF Bentley Priory. Defence Estates has completed a detailed Heritage Assessment, which was shared with English Heritage in July 2004. The Department has engaged with a wide range of stakeholders with an interest in the future of RAF Bentley Priory, including the Battle of Britain Fighter Association (BoBFA), and understands their aspirations. Meetings have also been facilitated between BoBFA and the two short-listed industry bidders for the Project MoDEL contract. Defence Estates' staff are also engaging with BoBFA over the development of a formal Conservation Statement, which will act as the definitive identification of the site's heritage importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.2128W.5/3">The MOD wishes to identify a long-term and sustainable solution that will ensure that the site is preserved in a way that is appropriate to its significant importance, whilst seeking to enhance public access. In doing so, it is important that we maintain the momentum of Project MoDEL, in order to realise the benefits it will deliver at the earliest opportunity.</p>

In addition, a manning action plan has been introduced to improve recruitment and retention which includes: improved and more flexible Terms and Conditions of Service (TACOS); better integration of training with the Regular Army including increased levels of training support and availability of equipment; and enhancements to support administration, welfare, recruiting and employer support activities.</p>

	<p pid="a.2138W.2/1">Approximately $4.5 billion was pledged for Sudan at last April's Oslo Donors' Conference. These pledges related to the whole of Sudan, including Darfur, not just to the south, and were for both humanitarian and development needs over the three years 2005&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="a.2138W.2/2">It is important that these pledges are converted into cash. There will be an opportunity to formally review how well this is progressing at the donors' conference in Paris in early March, where there will undoubtedly be pressure on donors to fulfil their earlier pledges. We know that of the $194 million pledged for the first year of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for development assistance, some $150 million has already been paid in, over $100 million of this is for the south. Last year, donors also contributed or firmly committed over $1 billion in humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.2138W.2/3">Nevertheless, Sudan's needs remain acute, and we continue to take every suitable opportunity to encourage other donors to respond as generously as they can. We have particularly sought to persuade donors to contribute to the newly established Common Humanitarian Fund, administered by the UN. Sudan remains a priority country for DFID, and this year we will spend over &pound;100 million there on aid.</p>

	<p pid="a.2138W.5/1">Despite recent surveys by the UN showing that average crude mortality and malnutrition rates in Darfur have fallen below emergency thresholds, the situation there remains critical. According to the UN, approximately 1.8 million people remain displaced in the region. They remain almost entirely reliant on humanitarian assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.2138W.5/2">The recent upsurge in violence and tension in West Darfur has led to the UN raising its security level to phase 4 (the highest before evacuation), causing the UN and other agencies to reduce staffing levels, and severely limiting access to some areas of the state. Although the UN is working hard to implement contingency plans, any prolonged period without access will inevitably have a harmful affect on the population.</p>
	<p pid="a.2138W.5/3">The UN launched its Sudan-wide humanitarian work plan for 2006 last month. $650 million is being sought for the international response in Darfur. DFID has already committed &pound;40 million to the overall programme, and are encouraging other donors to respond as generous as they can.</p>

	<p pid="a.2139W.2/5">Such attacks are abhorrent and unacceptable. We have made clear to the Government of Sudan that more must be done to provide security for the people of Darfur, and that the perpetrators must be brought to justice. Last month, the UK with other representatives of the international community, participated in a joint mission to assess human rights in West Darfur. The mission paid specific attention to sexual violence, and produced a number of recommendations. We are pressing the Government of Sudan to implement these as a matter of urgency.</p>
	<p pid="a.2139W.2/6">With our partners, we are encouraging the Africa Union Mission in Darfur to scale up patrols and provide protection for women and girls when they leave their camps. Where this happens the number of reported rapes has decreased significantly. Next month the UN will launch a new information system that will record details of all incidents of sexual and gender-based violence, better data helping to ensure better prospects of prosecution. Separately, DFID is providing funding for protection as part of our humanitarian and rule of law programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.2139W.5/1">We are responding generously to the humanitarian needs of Sudan, including Darfur, contributing &pound;70 million in 2005. We are doing this by directly supporting the UN humanitarian work plan, and by our funding of international NGOs and other agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.2139W.5/2">In the main, our funding is not earmarked for any specific region, but a substantial proportion of our work plan contribution goes to the principal UN agencies working in Darfur, such as UNICEF (water and sanitation, especially in camps for displaced people), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the World Food Programme (emergency food supplies). Of the main international NGOs working in Darfur, we are supporting Oxfam (water); Goal (provision of basic humanitarian services); M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (health care); Action Contre Faim (nutrition); and CARE (non-food humanitarian items). We are also supporting the International Committee of the Red Cross, who are working in priority areas of Darfur, often beyond the reach of other humanitarian agencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.2140W.2/1">HMG had previously agreed to provide direct budget support to Ethiopia. The terms of that agreement included mutual commitments, including commitments to the principles of good governance and democracy. In my view, recent political events amount to a breach of trust, and so I have decided that, in the current circumstances, DFID will not provide budget support but will seek to find other means to support the poorest in Ethiopia. I have emphasised to Prime Minister Meles that the only way to resolve the current political crisis is through inclusive political dialogue and the continuation of the democratisation process which we are ready to support. Our future assistance to Ethiopia will be designed with increased monitoring and accountability so we can be sure that the aid reaches the poor people who need it.</p>

	<p pid="a.2142W.5/1">Monitoring of the use of aid to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is conducted in accordance with standard DFID procedures that apply across all of the Department's programmes. For our bilateral aid, organisations implementing projects on behalf of DFID are required to submit regular, usually quarterly, financial and narrative reports on their activities. In addition, projects over &pound;1 million require a full review to be undertaken by at least annually with recommendations for actions to maximise impact and a final completion report, including the lessons learned to inform future programming. Regular monitoring by DFID staff, who remain closely in touch with partner organisations throughout the duration of a project, is also an important part of the monitoring process.</p>
	<p pid="a.2142W.5/2">All multilateral agencies have their own internal monitoring and evaluation systems and DFID's work on reforming of the international system has included helping to strengthen these systems to deliver results at a country level. An example is DFID's use of the Multilateral Effectiveness Framework to assess the performance of multilateral agencies and make recommendations for improvement. The UK has a seat on the board of multilateral organisations, and so is involved in multilateral decision making including the development and review of country strategies and programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.2142W.5/3">DFID also works jointly with multilateral agencies on many projects. DFID in the DRC works with multilateral agencies and other bilateral donors on justice, infrastructure, humanitarian, police, governance, HIV/AIDS and social sector projects. Working together in this way enables DFID to design, monitor and evaluate these programmes jointly with other donor organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.2142W.5/4">One of the most important ways in which we monitor multilateral agencies' work is through daily discussion, sharing information and ideas, between DFID staff in the DRC and partners in the European Commission, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations on both the development of their overall strategies for the DRC and the implementation of individual programmes.</p>

	<p pid="a.2143W.8/1">The last reliable pre-conflict figures for safe water are for 2000, when urban and rural levels of access to safe water were estimated at 92 per cent. and 46 per cent. respectively. The discriminatory policies of the former regime meant access varied significantly by region and was generally worse in the south. Access to safe water deteriorated as a result of the conflict and post-war looting in 2003. The immediate post-conflict coverage was estimated at 60 percent. for urban and 30 per cent. for rural populations. Since then, donors, including DFID, have worked hard to restore supplies, and we estimate that 1.25 million more Iraqis have access to safe drinking water than before the conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.2143W.8/2">The best information we have on safe water supply in Iraq comes from the &quot;Iraq living Conditions Survey 2004&quot; conducted by the Iraqi Central Office for Statistics and Information Technology in April/May 2004. This survey can be found at <a href="http://www.iq.undp.org/ILCS/overview.htm">http://www.iq.undp.org/ILCS/overview.htm</a></p>
	<p pid="a.2143W.8/3">In urban areas, 99 per cent. of households have access to safe drinking water but for 33 per cent. the supply is unreliable. In rural areas, 65 per cent. of households have access to safe drinking water, but for 22 per cent. the supply is unreliable.</p>
	<p pid="a.2143W.8/4">In most cases, the main barrier to access to safe drinking water is the condition of the pipelines, rather than the water supply itself. This is partly due to the tendency for insurgents to target water, electricity and oil pipelines, as well as the reconstruction staff working to repair them.</p>

	<p pid="a.2145W.2/1">Estimates of Iraq's infant mortality rate vary. The most detailed information we have on infant mortality rates in Iraq is the &quot;Iraq living Conditions Survey 2004&quot; (ILCS) conducted by the Iraqi Central Office for Statistics and Information Technology in April/May 2004. This survey can be found at <a href="http://www.iq.undp.org/ILCS/overview.htm">http://www.iq.undp.org/ILCS/overview.htm</a> This gives information about infant mortality for the period 1999&ndash;2003. We do not have a breakdown of the data by year as requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.2145W.2/2">For the period 1999&ndash;2003, the survey shows the infant mortality rate as 32 deaths per 1,000 births during the first year of life. The rate for girls was 29 per 1,000 for girls and 25 per 1,000 for boys. However, other estimates have reported significantly higher infant mortality rates, and the ILCS report acknowledges that their estimate may be too low because of under-reporting of child deaths.</p>
	<p pid="a.2145W.2/3">A 2003 report by Ali, Blacker and Jones (respectively of the World Health Organisation (WHO), the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and UNICEF), reported the 1998 infant mortality rate as 100.8 deaths per 1,000 births. The UN Population Database (2004 revision) estimated Iraq's infant mortality rate as 94.3 deaths per 1,000 births for the period 1995&ndash;2000. They use the same estimate of 94.3 per 1,000 for the period 2000&ndash;2005.</p>

	<p pid="a.2145W.5/1">Under Saddam Hussein's regime between 2001 and 2003, the economy shrank at an average rate of 9 per cent. per annum. After the 2003 conflict the economy recovered, with an initial economic growth rate of 46 per cent. in 2004. In 2005, the Iraqi authorities were successful in promoting macroeconomic stability despite the extremely difficult security environment, and economic growth was a modest 2.6 per cent. These are estimates which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has accepted, but it acknowledges the data quality as poor. In 2006, the IMF predicts an increase in economic growth to 10 per cent., a reduction in inflation, and an increase in net international reserves, advancing Iraq's transition towards a market economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.2146W.8/1">Iraq reached its highest production levels; 3.5 million barrels per day (mbd)&mdash;just before its invasion of Kuwait in July 1990, before exports were halted by an international boycott. After the first Gulf War, oil production fell to about 500,000 barrels per day, enough for domestic consumption. (Figures taken from the US Congressional Research Service's Report to Congress on Iraq Oil, April 2005.) When the United Nations Oil for Food Programme started in December 1996, oil exports increased, although export levels were sporadic as a result of various disagreements between Iraq, its customers and the United Nations. During 1999 to 2001, production averaged 2.49 mbd and in 2002 Iraq's crude oil production rate was an estimated 2.02 mbd (source: US Energy Information Administration). Since the Second Gulf War, output has varied considerably as security problems and sabotage have disrupted the flow of crude oil to terminals in Turkey and the Persian Gulf; however, prices have remained high.</p>
	<p pid="a.2146W.8/2">With 115 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves, Iraq has the world's second largest oil reserves, amounting to 11 per cent. of the global total (the largest is Saudi Arabia with 260 billion barrels). Only 17 of 80 oil fields have been developed; the most significant are Kirkuk in the north and Rumayla in the south.</p>

	<p pid="a.2150W.8/1">Eliminating gender inequality and promoting women's empowerment are essential to the achievement of all the millennium development goals (MDGs), not just MDG3 which focuses on women. My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for International Development and I are regularly involved in discussions both internally and with external contacts on issues relevant to women's rights and empowerment. For example, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State raised issues relating to social exclusion and women's rights in a high-level panel discussion during the millennium review summit in September and subsequently discussed the issue of gender equality in education when he gave evidence to the International Development Committee at their session on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank meetings and the summit in October.</p>
	<p pid="a.2150W.8/2">At a country level, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State had the opportunity to raise these issues during his visit to Bangladesh in December, where our strategy focuses on women and children. The Beijing high level group/education fast track initiative meeting which I attended in China on <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>, also provided the opportunity to discuss the importance of girls' education, and to highlight the links between girls' education and reducing HIV infection. As part of our work on HIV and AIDS, we emphasise the unequal impact on women and their greater vulnerability, and on the occasion of world AIDS day, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State launched the progressive EU statement on prevention that emphasises women's rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.2150W.8/3">Issues of gender equality and the impact of development programmes on women are considered in preparation of DFID country assistance plans, and over the next year, we will be looking to see how we can strengthen this process given the increased emphasis in our development assistance on direct budgetary support. We recognise that no serious strategy for achieving the millennium development goals can fail to address gender inequality and women's empowerment as a central concern, and we are working to ensure that gender issues are made a priority across our work.</p>

	<p pid="a.2151W.2/1">It is encouraging that the African Commission on human and peoples' rights, at its recent meeting in Banjul, The Gambia, issued a report which clearly condemned the human rights violations currently being perpetrated in Zimbabwe. This reflects the wide interest in Zimbabwe across Africa, and the growing impatience of its leaders with the poor governance under Robert Mugabe. I meet African leaders in my frequent travels to Africa (most recently to Kenya and Ethiopia), at international meetings and in the UK. Zimbabwe is frequently among the topics discussed.</p>

	<p pid="a.2156W.8/1">I am confident that the Freedom of Information Act is working and working well. It is estimated that in the first year of its operation, major central Government bodies alone received approximately 36,000 FOI requests. In the third quarter of 2005, for those bodies whose performance is monitored by DCA, 67 per cent. of resolvable requests resulted in the full disclosure of information. For local government and the wider public sector, anecdotal evidence also suggests that there has been a large number of valuable releases of information on issues that matter to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.2156W.8/2">My Department has made no estimate to date of the cost of the implementation of FOI to either (1) central Government or its agencies, or (2) local government.</p>

			<tr pid="a.2158W.2/15"> <td></td> <td>Criminal higher courts&mdash;Remuneration changes in October with the introduction of a common graduated fee scheme by the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Crown Prosecution Service for advocates in all trials lasting up to 25 days in the Crown court. The effect of those changes was to raise total remuneration for one to 10 day cases by about &pound;3.2 million and to leave the level of remuneration for 11 to 25 day cases broadly the same. These changes also included changes in the graduated fee scheme to allow for some payment for conferences and the attendance fee for plea and directions hearings was increased from &pound;75 to &pound;100.</td> </tr>

			<tr pid="a.2158W.2/21"> <td></td> <td>Criminal courts&mdash;Remuneration changes in August to the Very High Cost Criminal case contract rates and Criminal Graduated Fee schemes. The effects of the changes were: to reduce bureaucracy for the Bar by taking some 50 percent., of VHCC cases into an extended graduated fee scheme, which now covers cases up to 40 days; raising the graduated fee rates for 11 to 25 day cases to the level which was expected in 2001 when the scheme was introduced and carrying those rates through to the 40 day extension; all Category 4 VHCC cases will be paid at the same &quot;rates as Category 3 VHCC cases; substantially increasing refreshers so that the same rate is now paid for Category 2 and 3 cases as for Category 1; moving terrorism cases into Category 1; moving under five-year advocate call rates to over five-year call rates. This settlement was a package to the Bar worth approximately &pound;17 million. &pound;11 million came from changes to the VHCCC scheme, and a further 6 million from the changes made to the 11 to 25 day graduated fee scheme where we made good the unintended shortfall that had occurred since the scheme was extended to 25 days on October 2001.</td> </tr>
			<tr pid="a.2158W.2/22"> <td>2005</td> <td>October&mdash;Cuts in rates paid in some graduated fee and Very High Cost Criminal case contracts (to both advocate's and litigator's rates). Extension of the existing graduated fee scheme for cracks and guilty pleas. Estimated savings in RAB terms from these additional measures, excluding Cracks and Guilties, are &pound;5.1 million and &pound;20.8 million for 2005&ndash;06, 2006&ndash;07 respectively. The extension of the Cracks and Guilties schemes is anticipated to increase savings by an estimated total of &pound;20 million over 2005&ndash;06 and 2006&ndash;07.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="a.2160W.3/2">The existing Home Office personnel systems are designed to show moves of people not posts. The only information the Department holds is based on moves between buildings where 10 or more staff move on the same day, and all the relocations that can be identified are within the same city or area. Since 2001, there have been no such relocations of departmental civil service jobs to Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="a.2169W.5/1">The Accession Monitoring Report, published on a quarterly basis, provides detailed statistical data on Accession state nationals who have registered on the Worker Registration Scheme (WRS).</p>
	<p pid="a.2169W.5/2">However, apart from London, the report does not contain data relating to individual towns or cities. For reference, the latest version of the report is available on the Home Office website via:<a href="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/ind/en/home/0/reports/accession_monitoring.html">http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/ind/en/home/0/reports/accession_monitoring.html</a>. The following figures have therefore been obtained from local management information using the WRS database.</p>
	<p pid="a.2169W.5/3">They have not been provided under National Statistics protocols and are therefore provisional and subject to change. The information covers the period one May 2004 to <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase>, which corresponds with the period covered by the latest Accession Monitoring Report. The Birmingham postal area covers a large part of the West Midlands. Therefore the figures have been broken down into two parts (i) City of Birmingham covered by the area postcodes B1&mdash;B5 inclusive; (ii) Birmingham area postcodes (codes starting with &quot;B&quot;) within the West Midlands (excluding those in Hereford and Worcestershire, Warwickshire and Staffordshire). The number of accession state nationals who registered with the scheme and gave an address in these respective areas during the period one May 2004&mdash;<phrase class="date" code="2005-09-30">30 September 2005</phrase> is as follows: (i) Birmingham (city)&mdash;1,225 (ii) Birmingham (area)&mdash;1,335 (excluding those in the Birmingham city area).</p>
	<p pid="a.2169W.5/4">This gives a total of 2,560 within the geographical area referred to. The figures show those applicants who have registered on the Scheme since one May 2004. The figures are not current; an individual who has registered to work and who leaves employment is not required to de-register, so some of those counted will have left the employment for which they have registered and some are likely to have left the UK. Thus the number currently residing in Birmingham or the West Midlands is unknown.</p>

	<p pid="a.2173W.6/1">Companies House has not increased the annual document registration fee payable with the annual return filed electronically. In November 2004 Parliament approved the increase of the fee payable with the paper annual return to &pound;30. There were two main reasons for the increase. First, Companies House is required to review its fees on a regular basis. The last full pricing review was completed in 2004 and confirmed that costs and prices were out of line in some areas and needed to be rebalanced. The fees are linked, as required by European Law and HM Treasury guidance, to the forecast cost of providing each service. Companies House is required to prevent the fees from one service subsidising the costs of another service. Secondly, the annual registration costs associated with filing in paper format has risen because handling paper is labour intensive compared to electronic filing. The fees Companies House charges to all companies, including not-for-profit companies, must reflect these differences in cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.2180W.9/1">There are no official data on the amount of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in the UK. The Industry Council for Electronic Recycling (ICER) published in 2005 estimates for the volume and number of items of WEEE arising in the UK for the year 2003. This suggested that there are some 93 million units representing around 1 million tonnes of WEEE from domestic users arising in the UK annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.2180W.9/2">The white goods sector is responsible for the largest proportion of this WEEE in terms of weight, but the ICT and consumer electronics sectors produce more units.</p>
	<p pid="a.2180W.9/3">WEEE is currently dealt with via existing UK waste legislation. A significant volume of WEEE by weight is currently recycled or re-used in the UK. The remaining WEEE is disposed of in a similar manner to other forms of domestic waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.2180W.9/4">The WEEE Directive requires the UK to promote the separate collection of WEEE from other forms of domestic waste to facilitate increased recycling and re-use of WEEE as a way of promoting sustainable development in Europe. The WEEE Directive also requires the pre- treatment of WEEE prior to recycling to prevent the dispersion of hazardous substances into the environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.2183W.2/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has commissioned research in a number of areas relevant to the safety assessment of genetically modified (GM) foods. This research is undertaken by independent research scientists and the work is peer reviewed before the reports of the research are made publicly available through the FSA's library. Details of the research are published in the annual reports of the FSA's research and surveys programmes and also available on FSA's website at: <a href="http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/researchinfo/foodcomponentresearch/novelfoodresearch/g01programme/">www.food.gov.uk/science/research/researchinfo/foodcomponentresearch/novelfoodresearch/g01programme/</a> and at: <a href="http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/researchinfo/foodcomponentresearch/novelfoodresearch/g02programme/">www.food.gov.uk/science/research/researchinfo/foodcomponentresearch/novelfoodresearch/g02programme/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.2183W.2/2">GM foods are thoroughly assessed for safety on a case by case basis before they can be authorised in the European Union and this involves scrutiny of the scientific evidence concerning potential risks to human health. In addition, the FSA seeks advice from the advisory committee on novel food and processes on any new information that has implications for the safety of GM foods. Details of the advisory committee's evaluations of GM food safety research are available on its website and in its annual reports. The assessments of new GM food products are conducted at EU level by the European Food Safety Authority, which also publishes reports and opinions on the scientific data that it has evaluated.</p>

	<p pid="a.2184W.2/1">There is a variety of sexual health related surveillance data currently produced and routinely distributed to service providers and commissioners.

	<p pid="a.2184W.2/2">We recognise, however, that further improvements to the collection and availability of data are needed in order to meet the challenges of improving sexual health. To this end, the Department is currently funding a project to develop a common data set for sexual health with the aim of it being approved as a national health service information standard later this year. The standard is being assured by the Information Standards Board to ensure interoperability with other standards, fitness for purpose and implementability.</p>
	<p pid="a.2184W.2/3">The common data set will apply to all settings providing sexual health services, including primary care, and will provide, among other improvements, much better residence based information at local level. It is anticipated that the common data set will ultimately be collected through the systems being put in place by the national programme for information technology in the NHS (Connecting for Health) and that data will be made available for surveillance, performance monitoring and other purposes.</p>

	<p pid="a.2197W.8/2">Free home to school transport is a service that local authorities provide to parents of school pupils where they consider it 'necessary' to secure a child's attendance at school. Local authorities must consider transport necessary for all pupils of compulsory school age (including those with disabled parents), and who attend their nearest suitable school, provided that the school is beyond the statutory walking distance.</p>
	<p pid="a.2197W.8/3">From December 2006, the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, places a duty on the public sector to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people and to eliminate discrimination. This duty is anticipatory, meaning that public authorities will have to review all their policies, practices, procedures and services to make sure they do not discriminate against disabled people and ensure that all their services are planned with disabled people's needs fully considered in advance.</p>
	<p pid="a.2197W.8/4">In the Department's view, this means that local authorities will be under a duty to amend their home to school transport policy if, for example, that policy relied on disabled parents accompanying their children along a walking route for it to be considered safe, and where the parents' disability prevented them from doing so. In such circumstances, a reasonable adjustment would be for the local authority to provide free home to school transport. The Department will publish guidance to this effect in advance of the duty coming into force.</p>

	<p pid="a.2199W.3/1">Educational establishments which are publicly funded are covered by the provisions of the Health Bill currently before Parliament. The Bill, when passed, will prohibit smoking in enclosed public places including early years education settings, Sure Start children's centres, schools, colleges of further education and institutions of higher education, with some exemptions for residential accommodation for students and staff. Young people living in residential schools homes who are over the legal minimum age at which smoking is permitted, currently 16, would have the same right to smoke as other young people of the same age in their own rooms.</p>
	<p pid="a.2199W.3/2">Currently, nurseries and pre-schools are required, under national standards, to have a no smoking policy. We already encourage schools to be smoke-free environments. All schools should aim to become healthy schools and should be smoke free or be working towards being smoke free by September 2007 to gain healthy school accreditation. The national minimum standards for residential special schools encourage smoke-free policies. Higher education institutions must comply with all smoking legislation for their premises: it is for individual institutions to decide their own smoking policies in line with current legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.2202W.2/1">There has been no reduction in the amount of money paid to local authority music services for improving the teaching and learning of music; this will remain at just under &pound;60 million per annum until at least 2008. In addition, all music services will receive an additional &pound;10,000 in 2006&ndash;07 to support further instrumental and vocal tuition at Key Stage 2. Over the next two years, they will receive a share of &pound;2 million for musical instruments and support for continuing professional development at a cost nationally of a further &pound;2 million. I would expect these increases to have a significant positive impact on music services' ability to support teaching and learning at Key Stage 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.2202W.2/2">The further &pound;26 million allocated to primary schools may be used to buy in specialist support from a range of providers&mdash;I believe it is right to allow schools this degree of choice. Given music services' track record at KS2, and their positive relationship with schools (96 percent. say they are satisfied with the service they receive), it is likely that a great deal of this specialist support will continue to be bought in from local music services.</p>

	<p pid="a.2203W.5/1">The information requested has been placed in the House of Commons Library.</p>
	<p pid="a.2203W.5/2">Standards of literacy and numeracy in our primary schools, as measured by the national curriculum tests, have never been higher. In 2005 79 per cent. of 11-year-olds achieved the target level 4 of the national curriculum in English and 75 per cent. did so in mathematics. In 1997 over a third of 11-year-olds left primary school without attaining the target level 4. The National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies introduced by the Government in 1998 and 1999 have contributed significantly to this dramatic rise in standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.2203W.5/3">The Government are committed to improving primary teaching further and we are implementing the findings from the 2005 Rose Review of Reading and renewing both the literacy and numeracy teaching strategies over the next year to support this.</p>
	<p pid="a.2203W.5/4">Our recent White Paper&mdash;Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&mdash;set out our determination to ensure every child masters the basics of literacy and numeracy. There will be an extra investment of &pound;565 million by 2007/08 to support personalisation in primary and secondary schools, focusing particularly on helping children who have fallen behind in English and mathematics. A further &pound;60 million will be available in each of the next two years to provide effective one-to-one and small group tuition for the lowest attaining pupils.</p>

Within that figure there is an indicative allocation of &pound;187,000 for implementing the final stage of PPA: the local authority should decide, after consultation with its Schools Forum how much additional funding it should allocate in 2006&ndash;07 for PPA.</p>

	<p pid="a.2210W.0/1">All teachers of sex and relationship education are encouraged to undertake the Government funded teachers' certificate in personal social and health education (PSHE). The certificate supports standards in the delivery of PSHE teaching including sex and relationship education and is available to both primary and secondary school teachers. Almost 5,000 teachers have undertaken the certificate since 2002. A PSHE certificate programme is also available to school and community nurses who support sex education in schools. Over 600 nurses have undertaken the certificate.</p>
	<p pid="a.2210W.0/2">The statutory requirements for sex education are outlined in national curriculum science. In addition, secondary schools must teach about HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. Other discretionary elements of sex and relationship education are included in the non-statutory PSHE framework. Schools are able to develop their own sex education programmes beyond the statutory minimum taking into account the views of parents and the needs of pupils. Schools are free to determine their own sex education policy taking account of the requirements of the national curriculum and guidance issued by the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.2210W.0/3">We do not collect data centrally on the numbers of parents withdrawing pupils from the non-statutory elements of sex education. Ofsted (&quot;Sex and Relationships, 2002&quot;) estimates 0.04 per cent. of parents exercise this right.</p>

In addition my Department's guidance entitled &quot;Safeguarding Children: Safer Recruitment and Selection in Education Settings&quot; published in June 2005 was addressed to employment agencies and businesses that provide staff to schools as well as Head Teachers, Governing Bodies of schools, Local Education authorities, proprietors of independent schools, and Further Education institutions. That guidance included advice about the information that should be obtained from applicants and their referees and about interviewing candidates, as well as guidance on CRB, List 99 and other pre-appointment checks.</p>
	<p pid="a.2211W.8/3">In the future we will require mandatory CRB checks on anyone selected for appointment who is or has been resident in the UK. For those who have never lived in this country, we already advise employers to take extra care in checks on overseas candidates and to seek information about the person's criminal history from their country of origin wherever possible. The CRB provides advice to employers about countries from which it is possible to obtain such information and how to obtain it.</p>

	<p pid="a.2212W.2/1">There are no plans to assess the cost-effectiveness of unifying teachers' pension benefits for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In practice there is a great deal of commonality across the UK pension schemes for teachers but, as part of the Devolution arrangements, it is important that Ministers in each country's Education Department have the freedom to adapt teachers' remuneration packages, of which pensions form a part, to meet differing recruitment and retention needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.2218W.8/4" class="indent">Estimates of differential income are based on the Office for National Statistics (ONS) analyses 'The effects of taxes and benefits on household income'. The latest analysis for 2003&ndash;04 was published on the National Statistics website on 7th July 2005 edition of 'Economic Trends'. The analysis includes measures of income inequality for households in the United Kingdom based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey. This is a sample survey covering approximately 7,000 households in the UK. The analysis for 2004&ndash;05 is due to be published on the National Statistics website in April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.2218W.8/5" class="indent">Disposable household income is a commonly used indicator of living standards. Table 26 in Appendix 1 shows the percentage share of total disposable income for each quintile group. The quintile groups are based on a ranking of households by disposable income, with the bottom quintile containing the bottom fifth of households, the 2nd quintile containing those households between the 20th and 40th percentile and so on. Figures are available from 1981 to 2003&ndash;04. In 1997&ndash;98 the bottom quintile received 8% of total disposable income and the top quintile received 42%. In 2003&ndash;04 the bottom quintile still received 8% of total disposable income and the top quintile 42%.</p>
	<p pid="a.2218W.8/6" class="indent">Comparable figures for household savings are not available. ONS is currently developing the Household Assets Survey to improve the availability of information on savings and wealth.</p>

	<p pid="a.2226W.6/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.2226W.6/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many complaints have been made to the Child Support Agency in each month since January 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.2226W.6/5" class="indent">The volumes of complaints received direct from clients, their representatives and MPs to the Child Support Agency or to our Ministers over the requested period are in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="a.2226W.6/6" class="indent">During 2003&ndash;04 a three-tier complaints process was introduced. Stage 1 complaints are dealt with by the complaints resolution team located within each of the Agency's six business units. Stage 2 complaints are an escalation to the relevant Area Director when the client is not satisfied with the outcome of stage 1 ; and stage 3 is an escalation to the Chief Executive if the client remains dissatisfied. At each level of the complaints process, clients are advised as to how they can escalate their complaint should they remain dissatisfied with the reply they receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.2226W.6/7" class="indent">In a letter sent to you by Mike Isaac in July 2005, the number of complaints received by the Agency incorrectly included those which had been escalated through stages 2 and 3 as a separate component of the total number of complaints received by the Agency, when in actual fact they are escalations of stage 1 complaints, of which they are a subset. This error has been rectified in this response. I apologise for any inconvenience this might have caused. We will, in the future, not include these figures as intake.</p>
	<p pid="a.2226W.6/8" class="indent">As you can see, the volume of complaints received by the Agency has broadly stabilised. In the twelve months up to November 2005, the Agency received a total of 54,000 complaints, this compares to 55,000 for the 12 months up to May 2005 (the earliest period for which comparable data for total numbers of complaints received is available).</p>
	<p pid="a.2226W.6/9" class="indent">To put the attached figures into context, the 54,000 complaints received by the Agency in the 12 months to November 2005 represents less than 4% of the 1.4 million cases currently dealt with by the CSA.</p>

	<p pid="a.2230W.3/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Stephen Geraghty, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-25">25 January 2006</phrase></p>
	<p pid="a.2230W.3/3" class="indent">In reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the Chief Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.2230W.3/4" class="indent">You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what proportion of calls to the Child Support Agency helpline have been <i>(a)</i> answered <i>(b)</i> received <i>(c)</i> engaged and <i>(d)</i> hung up on in each month from June to November; and if he will make a statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.2230W.3/5" class="indent">The information requested is contained in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid="a.2230W.3/6" class="indent">With regard to the first part of the question, the proportion of calls answered has been presented in two ways. Some calls are either ineffective (due to a network failure, for example) or are abandoned or lost during the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) part of the process before they have joined a queue to be answered by staff (for example if a client does not have their National Insurance number to hand and hangs up to go and find it before calling back). Therefore this figure has also been presented as a proportion of the total calls that are available for Agency staff to answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.2230W.3/7" class="indent">I hope you find this helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.2231W.5/1">The UK, along with other member states, supports the need for this successor EU-level spending programme for the period 2007&ndash;13, which will provide financial support for the implementation of the Community's objectives for employment and social affairs and the achievement of the Lisbon goals. It will replace existing programmes to: promote measures to combat direct or indirect discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation; promote gender equality; support analysis, research and cooperation between member states in employment and labour market matters; and encourage cooperation between member states to combat social exclusion. The new programme does not propose a range of specific projects, but rather provides a framework to support EU-level actions under the areas covered, such as developing statistical tools, sharing of best practice, awareness-raising campaigns and support for organisations operating in the relevant fields. This includes action in the three areas you mention where, for example, we would expect support to continue for the common legislative framework on gender equality, which provides a level playing field for the single European market in goods and services. But legislation is only part of the story&mdash;practice has to change and PROGRESS will enable good practice to be developed and shared between member states. Similarly, PROGRESS is likely to maintain support for a range of intermediary groups from across the UK to increase knowledge and understanding by employers and individuals of new anti-discrimination law. It should also support a range of research projects, such as those looking at the provision of services for ethnic minority elders; the particular barriers faced by the most deprived children and families in gaining access to welfare provisions; and ways of improving links between local and central government in the field of social exclusion. Once agreed, the new unified programme will be publicised via the usual Commission and other European institute and news routes, including web and press, and through the existing management structures for those working under the current programmes.</p>
