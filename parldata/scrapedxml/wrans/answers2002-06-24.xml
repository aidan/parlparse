My officials are working closely with colleagues at the Youth Justice Board to develop a programme of summer activities in the 10 police areas targeted by the street crime initiative. This will provide at least 48,000 places, for children and young people aged nine to 17 at risk of offending, in quality sports and arts provision. We hope to be able to announce the exact locations of all of the individual schemes shortly.</p>

Modulation funds are used to secure valuable public benefits through agri- environment schemes, in particular the Countryside Stewardship Scheme and the Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme.

Research is in progress to establish whether the &quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot; found in the United Kingdom exhibits the same pathogenicity as that causing such serious damage in the USA and whether European tree species are susceptible to either the European or North American isolates.

	<p pid=".651W.5/3">Possible Community-wide measures are being considered and there has already been an exchange of information and some additional survey work by member states. In the meantime, on the basis of a pest risk assessment, precautionary measures have been introduced to prevent susceptible material being imported into the United Kingdom from affected areas of the USA and to allow plant health inspectors to track commercial movements of host plants of any origin. Current controls on imported oak wood from the USA are also being extended to include wood derived from all host trees originating in affected areas.

However, the main cost to the RPA arises from cases where Section 1.5 is not completed appropriately, that is, information given is not clear, or is evidently incomplete.

	<p pid=".658W.0/3">The modernisation plans for London Underground require contractors to meet performance specifications. The contracts do not specify the details of each individual project. Instead, the performance regime has been designed to deliver faster, more reliable and more pleasant journeys for passengers, as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".658W.0/4">The specifications include demanding targets for improvements in Journey Time Capability (JTC), an outcome measure which reflects passengers' experiences of a range of factors affecting how quickly they can travel through the underground system.</p>
	<p pid=".658W.0/5">Improvements in JTC through line upgrades, as specified in the current contracts, are as follows:</p>

The exact details of how the private sector companies intend to meet their contractual obligations are matters for the companies concerned.</p>

	<p pid=".663W.14/1">HSE has long recognised the special needs of smaller businesses and the importance of ensuring that administrative requirements placed on them in the field of health and safety are kept to the minimum, while ensuring that they recognise and act on their duties to protect the safety and health of their own workers and others.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.14/2">HSE consults widely on proposed regulations and guidance, although it recognises the need to ensure that small businesses are properly involved in developing its policies and practices and is currently looking at a variety of ways that will make it easier for small businesses to communicate with them.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.14/3">Many of the problems come from incorrect interpretation of regulations, companies often believing that they need to take more complicated action than is actually necessary or not understanding what needs to be done. HSE, therefore, produces extensive guidance on most of its regulations, much of it targeted towards small firms.</p>
	<p pid=".663W.14/4">HSE also continually looks for innovative ways to broaden its support to small businesses. For example, a pilot grant scheme is due to be launched shortly to provide some financial assistance for small businesses to access health and safety mentoring and training.</p>

The Railway Safety Regulations 1999 require a form of automatic train protection where reasonably practical, for example the Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS), to be fitted on all trains and key signals throughout the rail network by the end of 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".669W.6/2">Under the same regulations all Mark 1 rolling stock must be fitted with a safety modification (to prevent overriding in the event of two Mark 1 carriages colliding in an accident) by the end of 2002, in order to remain in service until the end of 2004 when they will finally be withdrawn from service. An exemption from the regulations can only be granted by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The HSE is currently conducting a public consultation on an application for exemption to fit the safety modification received from the three Mark 1 train operating companies, South West Trains, Connex South Eastern and South Central. The HSE is expected to make a decision in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".674W.9/1">The Child Support Agency has wide information gathering powers, including being able to require that employers and accountants provide them with relevant information.</p>
	<p pid=".674W.9/2">These powers have been buttressed by the creation, in section 13 of the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000, of two new criminal offences, of failing to give information and of knowingly giving false information. These offences carry fines of up to &pound;1,000. The provision has been in force since January 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".674W.9/3">Ministers have therefore taken the view that the Child Support Agency need not use the powers granted to the Department by its inclusion, as a relevant public authority for the purposes of sections 28 and 29 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, in Schedule 1 of that Act. An important additional factor in that decision is that surveillance is intensely resource-intensive and diversion of resources into such activity cannot be justified when the Agency's focus must be on implementation of the new child support scheme. The position on the use of surveillance is kept under review.</p>

	<p pid=".676W.9/1">Increasingly we are providing assistance to developing countries through Direct Budget Support to enable developing country Governments to take forward their own priorities under their Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) agreed with the international community. All PRSPs include a section on addressing urban poverty issues.</p>
	<p pid=".676W.9/2">In addition in India, for example, we have supported the Government of Andhra Pradesh in their programme for urban services for the poor. This programme works at a policy level with the 32 class 1 municipalities in the state, and provides support to encourage investments in upgrading slum areas. This experience has also been taken into account with new work on urban poverty reduction in Kolkata (Calcutta) and in Kenya and Jamaica where DFID has supported work to help local organisation of the urban poor initiate improvements in the living conditions of the urban poor.</p>
	<p pid=".676W.9/3">In addition, we are directly supporting the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) in their work to provide guidance and best practice advice to developing countries in reducing the numbers of people living in slum conditions and are working with the collaborative UN Urban Management Programme. The latter provides working examples of improved practice at the local government level.</p>
	<p pid=".676W.9/4">We are also collaborating globally with 17 other partners, including all G7 members, in the Cities Alliance which has the overall objective of &quot;Cities Without Slums&quot;. In practical terms, we have helped them develop the Community-led Infrastructure Finance Facility which will provide better access of local community groups to local bank funding of their own projects. This is seen as a long-term process for people to take command of their own improvements in living conditions.</p>

	<p pid=".677W.2/1">The term water conservation may refer to increasing storage of water resources, greater efficiency in the use of water resources, or to the conservation of valuable aquatic ecosystems. DFID has supported a substantial number of activities seeking to address all of these. The number is too great to list here, but the projects and programmes set out give an illustration of the type of engagement DFID are undertaking:</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/2" class="indentitalic">Increasing storage of water resources</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/3" class="indent">Current projects include:</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/4" class="indent">Sustainable management of West Bank and Gaza aquifers</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/5" class="indent">Augmenting groundwater resources by artificial recharge</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/6" class="indent">Community management of groundwater resources</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/7" class="indent">Guidelines for implementing environmental flows.</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/8" class="indentitalic">Greater efficiency in the use of water</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/9" class="indent">DFID has funded many research projects looking at ways in which the water efficiency in irrigation can be improved and has encouraged Governments to take up the results. These include:</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/10" class="indent">Raising irrigation productivity and releasing water for inter- sectoral needs.</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/11" class="indent">Improving community spate irrigation systems</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/12" class="indent">Improved irrigation in peri-urban areas.</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/13" class="indentitalic">Conservation of aquatic ecosystems</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/14" class="indent">Examples of DFID support include the Uganda Lake Management project and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Water and Nature Initiative, particularly the elements looking at wetland economics and ecosystem based livelihoods.</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/15">DFID is also directly supporting developing countries in preparing and implementing comprehensive policies and strategies for integrated water resource management. To have these strategies in the process of implementation by 2005 is one of the internationally agreed targets to which DFID is committed.</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/16">DFID is also supporting a number of global initiatives that are promoting water conservation in all its interpretations. These include the Global Water Partnership, the International Hydrological Programme, the World Commission for Dams (and the subsequent Dams for Development Unit), Water for Food and Nature Dialogue and the International Programme for Technology and Research in Irrigation and Drainage.</p>
	<p pid=".677W.2/17">Monitoring of water conservation activities and consequences is also supported through agencies such as the World Water Assessment Programme and the Joint Monitoring Programme of WHO and Unicef, both of which DFID contribute to.</p>

	<p pid=".678W.2/1">For all water uses, the Department for International Development is fully committed to the Dublin Principles (from the International Conference on Water and the Environment in Dublin in 1992) that (i) fresh water is a finite and vulnerable resource, essential to sustain life, development and the environment, and (ii) water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be regarded as an economic good.

	<p pid=".678W.2/2">Experience shows that management autonomy, adequate financial resources and tariffs that provide an acceptable return are all important for success improving efficiency in water use and in sustainable management of water resources.</p>
	<p pid=".678W.2/3">DFID policy is that water users should pay the full economic cost of providing water, while at the same time ensuring that there is equity in access to water. Users should pay for the level of service provided, but with scope for subsidies to lower volume users.</p>

	<p pid=".682W.8/1">The Department of Trade and Industry is working with the construction industry (including architects) to promote and embed the principles of rethinking construction. This initiative emphasises the need to integrate the construction team (including suppliers, contractors, professional advisers and clients) in order to deliver a high quality product that adds value to the client's activities. As part of this initiative, the Department has helped to fund the development of Design Quality Indicators which provide a means to assess the quality of a design as seen by architects, suppliers, clients and end users. These indicators will be launched jointly by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) and the Construction Industry Council on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-08">8 July</phrase>. I, along with my Ministerial Design Champion colleagues, have also committed to the production of action plans to ensure that construction projects taken forward by this Department adhere to the principles of rethinking construction and take fully into account the need for high quality design.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.8/2">The Department is also working very closely with CABE to promote understanding within both the public and private sector of how fundamental good design is both to the delivery of value for money and to the delivery of buildings which add to the quality of life of those using the building or living in the community around it. CABE undertakes a wide range of activities to encourage and facilitate improved design that are aimed at architects, suppliers and clients. These include: grants to develop and maintain architecture centres throughout the UK which provide a source of expertise and advice for both architects and clients; provision of training for both architects and clients to improve skills and improve understanding by clients of the sort of service they need from architects; design competitions to encourage small and new practices to develop projects and to showcase their skills; and the development of a digital website to showcase regeneration projects and projects covering a variety of different types of public buildings both to provide advice on how to deliver a good project and also to showcase the talents of architects.</p>
	<p pid=".682W.8/3">The Office of Government Commerce, with CABE, has met with the Royal Institute of British Architects to discuss the issue of access of small and medium sized architectural firms to Government contracts. This dialogue is ongoing. In addition, CABE is working with individual Government Departments to promote a diversity of design firms on specific projects, most recently with the Department for Education and Skills on Neighbourhood Nurseries and SureStart.</p>

	<p pid=".684W.2/1">It is ECGD policy not to publish details of cases involving Overseas Investment Insurance or other insurance facilities. This is to protect ECGD's own operations as there is a risk that knowledge by the buyer of the presence of export related insurance may increase the risk of action that may lead to a claim being paid. Details of insurance are also commercially sensitive on the part of the UK exporter or investor, as the presence of investment or export related insurance may harm their relationship with their buyer, local partner or the host Government. The same sensitivities do not apply so much to ECGD's guarantee or finance facilities as by nature these are usually more complex products and all parties will generally be aware of the presence of ECGD support. This approach is consistent with that adopted by export credit agencies in other countries.</p>
	<p pid=".684W.2/2">According to information already published the insurance cases in respect of seven coal-fired power stations involved a total capacity of 4,960 MW and annual CO <sub>2</sub> emissions of approximately 17.9 million tonnes per year.</p>

The Commission also stressed the importance of content development, and parallel work to make the information society accessible to the disabled.

The negotiating remit agreed by member states earlier this month under COREPER's mandate from the March Telecommunications Council will be used by the Commission in the continuing ICANN reform negotiations at Bucharest later this month and in Shanghai in October.</p>

	<p pid=".687W.2/1">Claims for pneumoconiosis are made under a British Coal scheme which commenced in 1974, for which the Department assumed responsibility in April 1998. Under the scheme nearly 87,000 claims have been received. The majority of claims have been settled by way of one-off payments. In some cases, where a claimant is in receipt of reduced earnings allowance and/or incapacity benefit from the DWP, claimants also receive a weekly loss of earnings payment.</p>

Its mandate is to examine available information on toxicological and other relevant properties of chemical agents, evaluate the relationship between the health effects of the agents and the level of occupational exposure, and where possible recommended values for occupational exposure limits which it believes will protect workers from chemical risks.</p>

	<p pid=".691W.2/2">Under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, HMG's consuls will be informed of the detention of a British national by the detaining authorities, if that person requests it. On being informed, the Consul will contact the detainee as soon as possible and if necessary follow this with a visit. One of the Consul's main duties is to ensure that the detainee has legal representation; the Consul can provide the detainee with a list of English speaking local lawyers. The Consul will do whatever he can to ensure that the welfare of the detainee is adequately provided for, that his human rights are respected and that he is not discriminated against because he is a foreigner. He will also raise any specific medical needs with the detaining authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".691W.2/3">Consuls visit convicted prisoners at least once a year, and more regularly if prison conditions are poor or if we have particular concerns about a prisoner. The Consul will continue to provide the same support as pre-trial. Furthermore, if we have concerns about a prisoner's health or are concerned that he did not receive a fair trial, we will consider making representations on his behalf or ultimately supporting a plea for clemency. We would look to our panels of pro bono doctors and lawyers to assist in such instances.</p>

	<p pid=".694W.0/1">While it is possible that uses will be perceived for them in other circumstances, criminal conviction certificates (or Basic Disclosures, as they will be termed) are essentially intended for the purpose of employment checks, and also in connection with visa applications (instead of the use of the right of subject access under the Data Protection Act 1998). It is essential that people are not unfairly discriminated against because of information revealed in Basic Disclosures that they have been convicted in the past&mdash;not least because getting and holding down a regular job is likely to be a positive factor in preventing re-offending. In this, we have taken careful note of the results of recent research published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the National Institute for Economic and Social Research. The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) will therefore be producing a range of advice urging employers to treat such information in a fair and reasonable manner. The CRB is also continuing to work closely with the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and the National Association of Care and Resettlement of Offenders (Nacro) on the production of guidance for employers. The current provision on a statutory Code of Practice applies only to higher-level Disclosures. We shall consider making provision to cover Basic Disclosures when there is a suitable opportunity. Meanwhile, the CRB has been working on an equivalent &quot;good practice guide&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".698W.6/1">The PSNI considers the term &quot;joyriders&quot; an inappropriate one to describe car thieves. The terms that best describe the activities of car thieves are: &quot;casual car theft&quot;&mdash;where the opportunist criminal is casual about the car that they are intending to take, and will take any vehicle which is found to be vulnerable; &quot;professional car theft&quot;&mdash;where the organised criminal targets a specific make, model, specification and colour of car or possibly a specific car.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.6/2">Casual car crime is not monitored as a specific aspect of vehicle crime.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.6/3">There is a growing understanding that many cars are not stolen but are in fact &quot;runabouts&quot;. A &quot;runabout&quot; is an old vehicle, without current licence, normally uninsured, which has changed ownership several times since the last notification to DVLNI. These vehicles offer significantly less risk to drivers than the use of stolen vehicles, and it appears that many of the vehicles being used by &quot;casual car thieves&quot; are not stolen, but are &quot;runabouts&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.6/4">Concerned about the uses to which &quot;runabouts&quot; are put, the PSNI, from <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-19">19 March</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-16">16 June 2002</phrase>, undertook an operation known as &quot;Clean Up&quot;. A substantial number of &quot;runabouts&quot; were seized. Some 943 vehicles were seized and owners reclaimed 145. Owners had to produce a vehicle licence or leave a surety of &pound;120 until they produced a vehicle licence. To date 550 &quot;runabouts&quot; have been destroyed and the balance will also be destroyed over the next few weeks, except for a small number, perhaps 20&ndash;30, which are considered suitable for auction. The registration numbers, makes and models of all seized vehicles were forwarded to the Motor Insurance Information Centre who have to date not found any insured vehicles. The initial results of the operation found:</p>
	<p pid=".698W.6/5" class="indent">A 25 per cent. reduction in road traffic collisions in West Belfast District Command Unit during the six weeks of the operation (measured against the preceding six weeks, and the same six weeks the previous year);</p>
	<p pid=".698W.6/6" class="indent">Fire service identified a 40 per cent. reduction in arson of motor vehicles when measured against the preceding six weeks of operation &quot;Clean Up&quot; and a reduction of 24 per cent. when measured against the same six weeks the previous year;</p>
	<p pid=".698W.6/7" class="indent">Following operation &quot;Clean Up&quot; there has been a 50 per cent. reduction in thefts from vehicles in the Belfast region.</p>
	<p pid=".698W.6/8">It is anticipated that operation &quot;Clean Up&quot; may result in a change in the method of changing the ownership of vehicles.</p>

	<p pid=".701W.2/1">The PSNI currently has 35 Domestic Violence Liaison Officers. All received initial training in domestic violence procedures which was followed up during 2000 by a further accredited course from the university of Teesside through which each officer gained a certificate in Professional Policing (Domestic Violence). Each officer performs a minimum 40 hour week, working on a nine-to-five basis.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/2">The work of these officers supports the front-line uniform response officers who are required to take decisive action at the scene of a domestic dispute. In addition, it is hoped that by autumn 2002 the PSNI will have completed work to enable uniform officers to access an Integrated Crime Information System (ICIS) database containing background information surrounding a potential violent incident prior to arrival at the scene.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/3">The role of the Domestic Violence Officer is currently under review and it is intended that external agencies will be consulted as a basis of determining a multi-agency perspective on how to improve the service offered to victims of domestic violence. The PSNI makes use of research undertaken by its partners in the multi agency response to the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/4">Leaflets and posters have also been distributed by the PSNI throughout Northern Ireland on domestic violence. These have recently been translated into ethnic minority languages and are available in various areas of public contact.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/5">All PSNI officers receive Child Abuse and Rape Enquiry (CARE) training. CARE unit detectives receive specialist training on child abuse and rape trauma syndrome. There are presently 12 CARE units, including five CARE suites staffed by a total of 85 highly trained officers. The CARE suites provide a non-threatening environment for the interview of children, comfortable interview rooms for victims of sexual offences and well equipped medical facilities where forensic medical officers can carry out examinations.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/6">The Police Service of Northern Ireland, through its CARE Co-ordinator, carries out research into the various aspects of both child abuse and sexual offending. It works in liaison with the ACPO portfolio holders in relation to the development of educational lessons within the service provision.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/7">In addition to the staff employed in CARE units, other officers from District Command Units and CID undertake work on sexual attacks.</p>
	<p pid=".701W.2/8">Due to the variety of staff who provide support in both these areas of police work information regarding the number of staff hours and staff costs could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.</p>

	<p pid=".705W.5/1">Since 1988, when the system of financial service regulation came into force under the Financial Services Act 1986, and up until the end of the first quarter 2002, some &pound;151 million in compensation has been paid to endowment policyholders following the complaints process. In addition, and as a result of the Financial Services Authority's (FSA) regulatory activities, some 20 firms have agreed proactively to compensate policyholders who were mis-sold their policies. This involves around 218,000 in policies, leading to total compensation of around &pound;315 million due to be paid.</p>

	<p pid=".708W.2/3">The Wanless report noted that 85 per cent. of prescriptions are dispensed free of charge and that the level of charges for those who have to pay is capped by the pre-payment certificate arrangements. We are taking steps to make pre-payment certificates more accessible. From <phrase class="date" code="">1 October</phrase>, the prescription pricing authority (PPA) will take responsibility for issuing these certificates. The application form will be redesigned and carry the PPA's address, all patient material will be revised and pharmacists will be encouraged to publicise the availability of prescription pre-payment certificates. Once the new arrangements are in place, we can examine the opportunities for further improvements to access.</p>

	<p pid=".710W.3/1">My noble and learned Friend, the Lord Chancellor, is committed to a system of judicial appointments that is fair to applicants and ensures that vacancies are filled promptly by candidates who best meet the published criteria. To this end, he published a consultation paper in April of this year on ways in which the selection procedures for the Circuit Bench and Recordership might be restructured or streamlined. Competitions for these appointments in 2002&ndash;03 have identified more suitable candidates than there are vacancies. The competitions for these appointments that would normally have begun in April 2002 have therefore been suspended for between six and 18 months. Any new vacancies that arise during this period will be made from reserve lists.</p>
	<p pid=".710W.3/2">Similarly, in respect of the High Court Bench, there are many suitable candidates remaining from the 2000 selection round. Very few vacancies are expected over the next year. In the circumstances it would be both inappropriate and impracticable to mount a full scale recruitment exercise. The Lord Chancellor has, however, decided that people with appropriate judicial experience should not be denied the opportunity to be considered for these vacancies. Some 2000 holders of judicial office have therefore been invited to express interest in these appointments.</p>

	<p pid=".713W.2/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.2/2">I am advised by the Health and Safety Commission on policy on the safety of the manufacture and storage of explosives.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.2/3">The Explosives Act 1875 has been successful in securing a high level of protection both for the public and for workers employed in the manufacture and storage of explosives. However, over the years the Act has been overlaid with a large number of items of secondary legislation. The proposals are intended to further improve the safety record by: simplifying the existing legislation and making it easier for dutyholders and enforcers to understand; updating the regulatory framework to take account of changes in the industry and technology; and taking the opportunity to incorporate industry best practice.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.2/4">The major controls in the proposals are:</p>
	<p pid=".713W.2/5" class="indent">a duty on anyone manufacturing or storing explosives to take appropriate measures to prevent fires and explosions, to limit the extent of fires and explosions, and to protect people in the event of a fire or explosion;</p>
	<p pid=".713W.2/6" class="indent">anyone manufacturing or storing explosives must have a licence from HSE or the local authority&mdash;or be registered with the local authority;</p>
	<p pid=".713W.2/7" class="indent">requirements to maintain separation distances around buildings where explosives are being manufactured or stored.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.2/8">The measures are intended to prevent explosions occurring in the first place. The separation distances requirements are intended to ensure that explosives buildings are not located in places where they would present an intolerable level of risk to members of the public.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.2/9">The proposals have been subject to extensive and very detailed consultation with employers, trade unions and local authorities as well as with the Ministry of Defence and other interested bodies such as professional associations. They were also subject to scrutiny from the HSC's Advisory Committee on Dangerous Substances.</p>
	<p pid=".713W.2/10">The proposals on separation distances take full account of extensive explosion tests conducted by the Ministry of Defence. They are the product of work by a working group that includes internationally-respected experts on explosives and risk assessment and control. The report of their work has been published by the Health and Safety Executive, copies will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".714W.2/3">The Health and Safety Commission published a consultation document in March setting out proposals for regulations on the manufacture and storage of explosives. I expect to receive its recommendations for new regulations in the course of next year. The regulations will include requirements on those manufacturing or storing explosives to take appropriate measures to prevent explosions including revised requirements on separation distances to be maintained around explosives sites. Under no circumstances should the risks be uncontrolled.</p>
	<p pid=".714W.2/4">The revised proposals are designed to ensure that the maximum level of risk to someone living or working in the vicinity of explosives factory or store is one in a million. This level is generally accepted as the benchmark for the broadly acceptable level of risk to members of the public from industrial activities.</p>

	<p pid=".723W.2/2">I believe this question concerns the impact on domiciliary care providers of the new regulatory arrangements under the Care Standards Act which require them to register with the National Care Standards Commission from <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>, and pay a registration fee.</p>
	<p pid=".723W.2/3">Our policy is to set fees to recover the full cost of regulating and inspecting service providers. We decided, however, that full cost recovery should be phased in over five years, in order to allow providers to adjust to the new fee regime and to avoid destabilising the care sector.</p>
	<p pid=".723W.2/4">We consulted extensively on the fee structure before finalising it. The fee levels for each service have been determined according to the total costs for that service and in all cases have been set at a level lower than full cost recovery for that service. Thus in the first year of regulation by the Commission domiciliary care providers will only pay 24 per cent. of the actual cost of registration and inspection. In addition, we have agreed to make a concession to small agencies and set the annual fee at 50 per cent. of the level for other agencies. A small agency is defined in the regulations as one where no more than two members of staff, including registered persons but excluding someone employed solely as a receptionist, are employed at any one time.</p>

	<p pid=".731W.5/1">The Government is providing records levels of funding for social services. Resources have increased nationally by 20 per cent. in real terms between 1996&ndash;97 and 2002&ndash;03, an average real terms increase of 3 per cent. per annum. In addition, as announced on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-17">17 April</phrase>, we are increasing the resources for personal social services by an annual average of 6 per cent. in real terms from 2003&ndash;04 to 2005&ndash;06. Councils have been incentivised to use some of their 6 per cent. annual increases to stabilise the care home market and fund home care services for older people.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.5/2">Included within these additional funds are resources provided to meet the cost care homes incur in meeting the care standards. We expect local authorities to reflect this in the fees they pay homes, as laid out in the &quot;Building Capacity and Partnership in Care&quot; agreement. The Department will continue to review the progress that is being made in the implementing of the agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".731W.5/3">The setting of fee levels are a matter for local decision and we have no plans to intervene in local negotiations.</p>

Since the review was undertaken the focus on policy has shifted from professionally-led guidance to patient-led services. We want to ensure national health service organisations like the new primary care trusts make decisions on services based on their local populations' clinical needs. To help them make these decisions, and to ensure clinical input, chiropodists have been involved in the development of national service frameworks (NSF) for older people and diabetes. The NSF for older people, which was published in March 2001, sets performance measures for accessing chiropody/podiatry services.</p>

As part of the arrangements for monitoring the Act, local authorities are now required to submit details to the Department about the education, training and employment of 19-year-old care leavers, who had been looked after in their seventeenth year. The first set of data from this sample will be published in autumn 2002. It would then be possible to match this data with other information about young people's last placement prior to leaving care, to research whether for this cohort of young people there are significant correlations between placement type and education and employment outcomes.</p>

	<p pid=".735W.0/1">We have recently welcomed the publication of the Government funded National Sentinel Audit of Epilepsy-Related Death. The audit looked at investigations into epilepsy deaths, care provided prior to death and contact with bereaved families.

	<p pid=".735W.0/2">We recognise that people with epilepsy can sometimes experience difficulty in receiving appropriate services and adequate treatment for their condition. We are undertaking a range of initiatives to improve services for the care and management of people with epilepsy. For example, we have:</p>
	<p pid=".735W.0/3" class="indent">Provided funding to the Joint Epilepsy Council (JEC) to develop a &quot;national statement of good practice for the treatment and care of people who have epilepsy&quot;, which was published in May 2002. The statement makes a series of recommendations for good quality epilepsy services. It is intended to facilitate commissioning and will be of use to national health service purchasers, providers and service users.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.0/4" class="indent">Asked the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to develop a clinical guideline (due in summer 2004) for the diagnosis, management and treatment of epilepsy to help address widespread variations in clinical practice and contribute to the improvement of services. This will be supported by a technology appraisal (due autumn 2003) of the clinical and cost effectiveness of new anti-epileptic drugs in children and adults, to help promote appropriate uptake and equitable access.</p>

	<p pid=".735W.3/1">The available information is for the number of dentists leaving the general dental service (GDS) in England and is shown in the table for the years 1997&ndash;98 to 2001&ndash;02.</p>
	<p pid=".735W.3/2">The number of leavers covers all reasons for leaving the GDS including final retirement from dental work and dentists taking career breaks as well as those who left to practice solely privately. Figures from 1998&ndash;99 onwards are inflated by the transfer of some dentists from the GDS to some personal dental service (PDS) pilots. The total number of dentists includes principals on a health authority list, assistants and vocational dental practitioners.</p>

	<p pid=".737W.5/1">The national minimum standards do not duplicate the rules of other agencies although they may refer to them for completeness. The national standards are designed to ensure care provision is fit for the purpose and meets the assessed needs of residents. It is for the National Care Standards Commission to decide in the particular circumstances of each individual home whether the home conforms to the standards necessary to meet the assessed needs of its residents.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.5/2">The commission must take national standards into account when making a decision as to whether an establishment complies with statutory requirements under the Care Standards Act. However, providers and their representative organisations urged that the commission should be allowed to take a range of other factors into account and the commission may also take into account any other factors it considers reasonable or relevant to do so. For example, compliance with other statutory requirements, as assessed by the relevant regulatory body.</p>
	<p pid=".737W.5/3">With the exception of environmental health issues, the responsibility for enforcement of health and safety requirements in care homes, as with all other establishments, rests with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). There is a degree of overlap in some areas between health and safety requirements and national standards but these are complementary rather than two organisations covering the same angle. The commission is currently working with the HSE and Local Government Association to develop a memorandum of understanding to clarify each other's roles and responsibilities in health and safety matters. The memorandum will be underpinned by locally agreed protocols. This will aid clarity in liaison with other bodies should adverse incidents arise and ensure protection of vulnerable people in care.</p>

	<p pid=".738W.5/1">The NHS Plan target to reduce the total number of people that experience delayed discharge is in paragraph 12.9 on page 102 and states that we will end widespread bed blocking by 2004. The target to reduce the number of people that experience delayed discharges from hospital by 20 per cent. between March 2002 and March 2003 was set for the national health service as a milestone to progress to this overall target. This is expected to also reduce the number of bed days that people are kept in hospital awaiting discharge.</p>
