These figures include registered businesses whose turnover is below the VAT registration threshold, and do not include businesses whose turnover is above the VAT registration threshold who are not registered for VAT.

	<p pid=".11W.2/1">It has been a long-standing policy of the Governments to introduce cost-effective measures to help reduce the impact that transport has on the environment.</p>
	<p pid=".11W.2/2">To incentivise cleaner cars, the Government have introduced emission-based reforms for graduated company car tax and fuel scale charges&mdash;the charge on free fuel provided for employees. These CO2-based benefit-in-kind taxes have helped reward the purchase of cleaner cars and the progress made is reflected in the 3.75 per cent. fall in average CO2 emissions of new cars between 2000 and 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".11W.2/3">In addition to progress on CO2, local air pollution has improved dramatically with falls in emissions of particulates and NOx from new vehicles, for example new cars now produce in the region of 90 per cent. less pollutants than those manufactured 20 years ago. This has been driven by successively tougher emissions standards for new cars and given that company cars are generally less than two years old, means they are delivering air quality improvements. To help facilitate this progress, the Government have incorporated air quality incentives into the company car tax regime. There are discounts for cars that use alternative fuels and technologies, for example road fuel gases, and supplements for diesel cars in recognition of their higher emissions of pollutants that damage local air quality. This approach helps ensure there are benefits for the drivers of the very cleanest cars along with benefits for the environment.</p>
	<p pid=".11W.2/4">Furthermore, to provide incentives for the use of alternatives to the car, in 1998 the Government announced a package of measures, which included removal of benefits-in-kind charges on employer-provided works buses and on public bus subsidies, and new reliefs for commuter and business cycling.</p>

	<p pid=".24W.0/1">We take non-combatant deaths, which can occur in a range of circumstances, very seriously. Road Traffic Accidents account for the majority of non-combat deaths, and the Ministry of Defence operates a number of road safety campaigns to increase awareness of risks on the road.</p>
	<p pid=".24W.0/2">Another significant contributor to non-combat deaths is disease, to which members of the Armed Forces are as susceptible as the general public. But as part of the Defence Health Programme we are creating a health promotion strategy to co-ordinate work already in hand within each of the three Services. Through an emphasis on fitness and proper nutrition, together with increased availability of health advice and access to treatment, we aim to reduce the instance of disease-related deaths. Fewer than one in 20 non-combat deaths throughout the armed forces last year were ruled by the coroner as suicides or open verdicts. Through a tri-Service Suicide and Self-harm Prevention Working Group we are developing a more cohesive Armed Forces suicide and deliberate self-harm prevention policy. Other measures include the bench-marking of prevention measures with the NHS, HM Prison Service and other nations, and the development of a Stress Policy. Moreover, personnel are trained to be on the alert for signs of depression, altered behaviour and other possible indicators of self-harm. Further studies are planned into the identification of factors which may indicate greater risk of self-harm and suicide.</p>

Following a visit by the Director General of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in autumn 2002 it was agreed with the Lord Mayor of Belfast and City officials to re-erect the headstones.

	<p pid=".28W.9/1">There is in general no restriction on the time that may elapse between the commission of an offence and commencement of prosecution. Either way offences, which can be tried either in a magistrates court or in the Crown Court, and indictable only offences, which must be tried in the Crown Court, can normally be prosecuted at any time. There are statutory provisions prohibiting proceedings in respect of certain such offences once a specified time has elapsed. An example is contained in the Sexual Offences Act 1956, which provides that prosecutions for unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16 must be commenced within 12 months of the offence. If no time limit is set out in legislation in respect of any either way or indictable-only offence, then the general rule applies, and prosecutions may be commenced however long ago the relevant events occurred.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.9/2">In their October 2002 report on the investigation of historical abuse cases, the Home Affairs Committee agreed that the prosecution of offences relating to child abuse should not be time-barred.</p>
	<p pid=".28W.9/3">The Government do not support the Committee's recommendation that the prosecution of offences relating to child abuse, which is alleged to have occurred over 10 years since the date of the offence, should only proceed with the court's permission, and that the time period should not begin until the complainant has reached age 21 years. It is the role of the Crown Prosecution Service to consider each individual case, and whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. One of the factors to be considered is any delay in reporting a crime and the reasons for that delay. We cannot see a good reason to change the current system.</p>

At March 2003 there were 282 cases awaiting review and 365 under review. The Home Office is working with the Commission to ensure that it has sufficient funding to allow the accumulated cases to be minimised whilst coping with its increased case intake. The Commission is endeavouring to balance this achievement with the need to avoid having too many or too few staff.</p>

	<p pid=".39W.5/1">It would require disproportionate resources to determine exactly how many of the 196 referrals to March 2003 made any use of some form of advance in the fields of forensic science techniques, psychiatry, or linguistics. This is particularly the case given that such use may not have formed a key element of the referral. In some referrals the Commission has taken direct advantage of these techniques, including the use of DNA and ESDA techniques. For example, in one case in which the defence had advanced a seemingly implausible argument at trial, modern DNA techniques supported it and the conviction was quashed. In another referral, ESDA tests cast doubt on prosecution documents and the conviction was quashed. Advances in forensic psychiatry and linguistics have been applied in several referrals, particularly in relation to the reliability of confessions and other evidence.</p>

	<p pid=".41W.8/1">The main provisions remove the old common law rule against the admission of hearsay evidence, and provide a clear statutory scheme for the admission of such evidence. Under the Bill, statements made out of court will be admissible as evidence in the following circumstances:</p>
	<p pid=".41W.8/2" class="indent">the witness is unavailable for a specified reason;</p>
	<p pid=".41W.8/3" class="indent">documentary records have been compiled by business;</p>

	<p pid=".43W.5/1">It is extremely difficult to measure the deterrent effect of sentencing separately from its other effects. Apart from serving as punishment, sentences can impact on crime in a number of ways, through incapacitation, reform and rehabilitation, as well as the deterrent effect. Reconviction rates, for example, are lower for those who serve longer terms of imprisonment than those who serve shorter terms, but this reflects a number of factors and the contribution of deterrence cannot be readily isolated.</p>
	<p pid=".43W.5/2">In 1999, the Home Office's Research, Development and Statistics Directorate commissioned the University of Cambridge to review all the recent research looking at the impact of sentence severity on deterrence. That study <sup>1</sup> concluded that the limited available evidence in this area suggests that generally the connection between variations in sentence severity and deterrent effect is not direct or strong. Nevertheless the availability (and severity) of punishment does appear to have a general deterrent effect for some classes of potential offenders, whose choice of whether to offend is influenced by their perception of the risks of being apprehended and punished. This suggests that known penal threats can have a deterrent effect.</p>

	<p pid=".45W.2/1">The Crown Prosecution Service and Court Service do not maintain records of the numbers of cases in which jury interference occurs. However, each year there are instances of actual or feared jury interference which necessitate both a range of jury protection measures and the termination of trials before the jury has been able to reach a verdict. In a small number of cases which present a very serious risk of intimidation, the court will order 24-hour police protection for the jury. In 2000, the cost to the Metropolitan Police of such protection was &pound;4.3 million; in 2001, &pound;5.1 million.</p>
	<p pid=".45W.2/2">The Government have included proposals in the Criminal Justice Bill currently before Parliament for a trial on indictment in the Crown Court to be conducted without a jury where there is a danger of jury tampering, or continued without a jury where the jury has been discharged because of jury tampering. The Government believe that these measures will provide a strong and effective disincentive to jury tampering.</p>

	<p pid=".46W.5/1">When the National Probation Service (NPS) was established in April 2001 the Probation Service moved from being part funded by the local authorities and the Home Office to being solely funded by the Home Office. This change in funding made it appropriate, as with other public services, that the NPS was required to submit its pay remit for approval by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. This arrangement became fully operative for the first time for the 2003&ndash;04 pay settlement. Treasury rules require that employers cannot begin pay negotiations with the Trade Unions until the Treasury has approved the remit.</p>
	<p pid=".46W.5/2">The Chief Secretary agreed the NPS remit on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-17">17 July</phrase> and a pay offer was made to the Trade Unions on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-22">22 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".46W.5/3">The reason why the negotiations on the NPS pay settlement did not begin until July relates to the extended timetable for clearance of remits through Ministers and the Treasury. Coupled with this is a complex process of ensuring that the proposed settlement is affordable by the NPS and conforms to public sector pay policy. These factors meant that it was not possible for the NPS to meet the <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase> settlement date. It should be borne in mind that a settlement, once agreed, is backdated to the relevant settlement date.</p>
	<p pid=".46W.5/4">It is not intended that a similar timetable will be adopted for 2004&ndash;05. This is because a new pay and grading system is currently planned for the NPS and a two-year remit will be sought well in advance from the Treasury to cover the years 2004&ndash;05 and 2005&ndash;06. There should therefore be no repetition of this year's delay.</p>

However, we acknowledge that some media reporting of suspects' details, prior to charge, can be severely distressing and damaging where charges are not then brought, and believe that informed and strengthened self-regulatory guidance issued by the police and the media, to prevent such reporting, is preferable to legislation.

	<p pid=".49W.5/1">It is for the trial judge to decide whether a particular piece of evidence should be admitted and in making that decision he must adhere to the requirements of the law. In England and Wales, criminal courts have a range of powers to prevent the admission of improperly obtained evidence. In particular:</p>
	<p pid=".49W.5/2">Section 76(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) prevents the prosecution relying on confession evidence where it may have been obtained by oppression of the person who made it or in consequence of anything said or done which, in the circumstances, was likely to render a resulting confession unreliable. Where the defence contends that this may be the case it is up to the prosecution to show beyond reasonable doubt that this is not the case. Section 76(3) also permits the court to require the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the confession was not so obtained.</p>
	<p pid=".49W.5/3">The Criminal Justice Bill provides for similar statutory protection where the confession is sought to be adduced by a co-defendant.</p>
	<p pid=".49W.5/4">Judges also have discretion under section 78 of PACE to exclude evidence on which the prosecution propose to rely if it appears to the court that the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it. When considering this discretion the court is to have regard for all the circumstances of the case, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained.</p>

It found a very positive response from parents on Parenting Orders as well as voluntary participants, and improved parenting skills.

	<p pid=".54W.2/1">The care home sector has long been subject to regulation. The regulations introduced under the Care Standards Act 2000 are based on the regulations under the Registered Homes Act 1984 and establish a more consistent and coherent and regulatory framework which care home providers and others had been calling for.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/2">The regulations introduced under the Care Standards Act which affect care homes are:</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/3" class="indent">The Care Homes Regulations 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/4" class="indent">The Children's Homes Regulations 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/5" class="indent">The National Care Standards Commission (Fees and Frequency of Inspections) Regulations 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/6" class="indent">The National Care Standards Commission (Registration) Regulations 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/7">The estimated costs of implementing these regulations are set out in the relevant regulatory impact assessments (RIAs), which are available on the Department's website at <a href="http://www.doh.gov.uk/regulatoryimpact/index.htm">www.doh.gov.uk/regulatoryimpact/index.htm</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/8">It is difficult to give a precise figure for the cost of implementing these regulations, given the lack of reliable detailed information and the fact that not all care homes will be affected equally, but in the case of the Care Homes Regulations and the associated national minimum standards, the RIA estimated an overall cost of &pound;150 million spread over five years. However, these costs will have been reduced for pre-existing care homes, following the decision in February 2003 to relax certain physical environment standards relating to them.</p>
	<p pid=".54W.2/9">We anticipate that almost all of the cost of meeting the regulations will be passed on to the commissioners of care, in most cases the relevant local authority social services department. To ensure that local authorities have the resources they need to purchase services to meet the needs of their residents, we are providing substantial extra resources for social services.</p>

These evidence-based guidelines include the standard principles for controlling infection, for example, hand hygiene and the prevention of infections associated with certain invasive devices.

	<p pid=".67W.3/2">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with expert advice from the independent advisory committee the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) is responsible for ensuring that medicines and vaccines on the United Kingdom market meet appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy.</p>
	<p pid=".67W.3/3">MMR (combined measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine and some single component measles, mumps and rubella vaccines are licensed in the UK. Licensed vaccines are assessed for safety prior to the licence being granted. Information on side-effects known to be associated with these vaccines is included in the relevant product information. As with all vaccines and medicines, after licensing, the MHRA and CSM keep the safety of MMR vaccine and single measles, mumps and rubella vaccines under continual review. The MHRA uses a number of data sources to monitor the safety of medicines and vaccines. These include reports of suspected adverse drug reactions spontaneously provided by health professionals through the 'Yellow Card' scheme. This voluntary scheme has been in existence since 1964 and has a proven track record in identifying important new safety concerns with medicines. Other data sources include periodic reviews of safety information submitted by the licence holders, medical literature and the results of any new clinical trials or epidemiological studies.</p>
	<p pid=".67W.3/4">Many studies, including one commissioned by the MHRA (then the Medicines Control Agency) in 1998, have specifically investigated the alleged association between MMR vaccines and the development of autism and have found no evidence of a causal link. The CSM has considered these studies and the general safety of MMR vaccines on several occasions in recent years and its advice remains that MMR vaccine is the safest way to protect children from three potentially serious infections. This advice is consistent with the advice of expert bodies around the world. No studies are available that have examined the effects of giving single vaccines separately on a population.</p>

In many health authorities there are factors which distort the expenditure per head. These include:The health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund, training on behalf of other health bodies.Asset revaluations in NHS Trusts being funded through health authorities.For these reasons expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between health authorities.3. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.4. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within the health authority and region area. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust summarisation forms and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities.5. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting in 2000&ndash;01 where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. This element cannot be identified in 2000&ndash;01.6. The North East has been taken to include the geographical areas covered by the following Health Authorities:County Durham and Darlington Health Authority.Gateshead and South Tyneside Health Authority.Newcastle and North Tyneside Health Authority.Northumberland Health Authority.Sunderland Health Authority.Tees Health Authority.</p>

	<p pid=".71W.5/1">NHS Direct has developed since March 2000 to become the world's largest e-health service, supporting over a million patients every month through its telephone advice and information service and associated website. In this time, NHS Direct has symbolised the changing relationship between the national health service and patients, supporting patients to become more empowered, better informed and more able to exercise choices over their own health and health care.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/2">NHS Direct has been available to callers throughout England since the end of October 2000. Call volumes have grown by 49 per cent. since March 2000. Independent evaluation highlights a service that is safe, popular and increases access to advice and information without increasing demands on other parts of the NHS. Caller satisfaction rates have continued at over 95 per cent. and 45 per cent. of calls to the service are completed without referral to another service. The roll-out of NHS Direct was commended in a report by the National Audit Office, published in January 2002, which estimated that the service covered 50 per cent. of its running costs by reducing demands on other services in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/3">In November 2001, NHS Direct Online was re-launched to include an interactive inquiry service, which is able to provide patients with detailed information about topics not covered on the website. NHS Direct Online receives half a million on-line transactions every month. NHS Direct Online has been awarded one of the first ever eEurope awards for eHealth by the European Commission. 200 applications were received from 22 countries. At a conference and award ceremony in Brussels in May this year, attended by European Commissioners and 33 Ministers from across the member states, Bob Gann, Director of NHS Direct Online, received the award for &quot;Empowering Citizens in Management of Health and Wellbeing&quot;. The panel judged entries against criteria including economic benefit, accessibility, quality assurance, technical standards and European applicability.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/4">NHS Direct achieved the Prime Minister's pledge that, by the end of September 2001, patients who wished to would be able to obtain advice on dental issues and details of NHS dentists simply by phoning NHS Direct.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/5">NHS Direct introduced a dedicated textphone service in November 2001.The service connects callers to NHS Direct nurses, who have had specialist training to help them meet the needs of textphone users.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/6">Since March 2002, access to out-of-hours care through NHS Direct has been available to 10 million patients. By December 2004, technical and operational links will be in place to allow NHS Direct to transfer calls to any out-of-hours provider in the country. Full clinical integration of services will follow as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/7">The first version of the NHS Direct performance framework was launched in March 2002. The framework is based on the principle of continuous quality improvement and outlines responsibilities and tools for service delivery and the monitoring of performance and improvement at all levels of the organisation&mdash;from the individual to the national service. The framework also outlines a set of key performance targets for NHS Direct, areas for the development of clinical indicators and areas for the development of internal management measures. NHS Direct has embarked on a major programme for improving its productivity. This delivered a 15 per cent. increase in call volumes in 2002&ndash;03, without any increase in staff numbers.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/8">NHS Direct aims to support the NHS in many areas, including contributing to a responsible and coherent response to public health. NHS Direct has worked with the Department and other stakeholders to provide a public helpline in the event of health alerts. These have ranged from local incidents, for example, chemical spills, to handling calls during a multi-regional hepatitis C look-back exercise, as well as the Alder Hey independent inquiry. Since March 2000, it has handled a total of 631 health alerts.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/9">Since April 2002, NHS Direct has been able to directly refer patients to pharmacists, where appropriate, for advice about medication or minor ailments or injuries. This has helped many patients receive a quicker and more appropriate response to their problems. It also makes better use of the skills of pharmacists and helps relieve some pressure on general practitioners.</p>
	<p pid=".71W.5/10">The strategy document for developing NHS Direct, published in April 2003, sets out the continued commitment to this popular and innovative service. The impact of new financial investment will further support plans to use technology and new ways of working to boost productivity and increase capacity. In total, NHS Direct will aim to expand its call taking capacity three fold in the next three years, while at the same time, developing the various channels through which patients can access the service.</p>

	<p pid=".74W.2/1">The Department is committed to increasing patient choice in the national health service to ensure that its services are more responsive to the needs of individual patients. The first step in increasing patient choice is to provide patients waiting for elective surgery with choice over the hospital in which they are treated. By the summer of 2004, all patients waiting six months for surgery will be offered the choice to move to another hospital. From December 2005, patients who may require elective surgery will be offered a choice of four or five hospitals or providers when their general practitioner refers them. We have also launched a national consultation exercise&mdash;'Choice, Responsiveness and Equity in the NHS and social care'&mdash;to get the views of patients and NHS staff on extending patient choice within the NHS beyond elective surgery. Fundamental to increasing the responsiveness of services is ensuring that patients are afforded privacy and dignity, including taking into account their views as to the gender of their nurses and care workers.</p>

	<p pid=".81W.2/1">The Government have no plans to seek an amendment to the law on abortion. All abortions in England are currently carried out under Section 1(3) of the Abortion Act which states that any treatment for the termination of pregnancy must be carried out in an NHS hospital or an approved independent sector place. There is provision under Section l(3a) for medical abortion to be carried out in an approved class of place but we have not yet determined what a &quot;class of place&quot; should be. No &quot;class of place&quot; will be approved unless we are content that a woman's safety is not at risk.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.2/2">The safety of mifepristone was fully evaluated on behalf of the Government at the time of granting a marketing authorisation in 1991 by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA). The use of mifepristone is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (formerly the MCA) using spontaneous adverse drug reaction reports, periodic safety reviews and all other available safety data to ensure its continued safe use. Also, there have been a number of studies and reviews of the safety of mifepristone published in the scientific literatures since 1991.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.2/3">In the years 1968 to 2001 inclusive, there were 4.56 million reported abortions performed on residents of England and Wales. Of these, 63,897, or 1.4 per cent., were performed under section l<i>(l)(d)</i> of the Abortion Act 1967 as amended. These are cases where there was a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped. 39,464, or 0.9 per cent., of the total were performed under section l(l)(c) of the Abortion Act 1967 as amended. These are cases where the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman; greater than if the pregnancy were terminated.</p>
	<p pid=".81W.2/4">The Abortion Act 1967 applies to England, Wales and Scotland only. Abortions performed in Scotland are a matter for the Scottish Executive.</p>

The introduction of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence has meant that over 31,000 extra patients can benefit from new cancer drugs.

	<p pid=".84W.6/1">The Chief Medical Officer, Professor Sir Liam Donaldson in his Annual Report for 2001 alerted the public to the risks of contracting Escherichia coli 0157 infection and provided advice as to how to avoid infection.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.6/2">The Department of Health works in close collaboration with other Government Departments, particularly the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), the Food Standards Agency (FSA), the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and with the Scottish Executive in providing to the public, to farmers and others responsible for farmland that might be used for recreational purposes, information on the risks of E.coli 0157 and how to avoid infection.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.6/3">Following the recommendations of the joint FSA/Scottish Executive Task Force on E.coli 0157 relating to access to and use of rural land, advice was issued nationally in 2001 by the Scottish Executive to relevant organisations, including the National Farmers Union, the National Scout Association and the Guide Association on how to avoid ill health during recreation on farmland. This advice was re-issued in 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.6/4">The key points of this advice are that where possible, fields used for grazing or stockholding of animals should not be used for camping, picnicking, or play areas.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.6/5">If fields that have been used for grazing or stockholding animals are to be used for recreational purposes, the following precautions should be taken:</p>
	<p pid=".84W.6/6" class="indent">keep farm animals off the fields for the three weeks prior to and during the event/use;</p>
	<p pid=".84W.6/7" class="indent">remove any visible dung/faeces&mdash;preferably at the beginning of the three week period;</p>
	<p pid=".84W.6/8" class="indent">mow the grass&mdash;keep it short and remove the clippings before fields are used for recreation;</p>
	<p pid=".84W.6/9" class="indent">inform leaders of recreational/leisure groups (for example scouts, guides etc.) of the need for good hygiene practice (such as hand washing) and to treat drinking or personal washing water taken from streams.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.6/10">The HSE produced specific guidance to farmers on how to avoid the risks from E.coli 0157 infection associated with recreational use of farmland and issued press notices to remind farmers and others responsible for farmland of this guidance in 2001. This guidance supplemented existing guidance, revised in 2001, for farmers contained in the HSE's Agricultural Information Sheet 23 &quot;Avoiding ill health at open farms&quot;. The HSE has also produced a video which highlights the risk of contamination from farm animals, buildings and equipment and advises on the need for good hygiene and the importance of hand washing before eating and drinking in preventing infection with E.coli 0157. The advice and the video are available on the HSE's website.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.6/11">The Department of Health disseminated this advice through the website <a href="http://www.wiredforhealth.gov.uk">www. wiredforhealth.gov.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".84W.6/12">Advice for the public on the importance of handwashing prior to eating or drinking in preventing E.coli 0157 infection is reinforced through the FSA's five year Food Hygiene Campaign which reiterates seasonal food safety messages at regular intervals.</p>

	<p pid=".85W.2/1">The Department keeps its priorities for research under review. Priorities for departmental research and development support for the development of policy are determined through discussion with policy colleagues and Ministers. In the national health service, priorities are identified through widespread consultation with those using, delivering and managing services. They take account of the burden of disease, potential benefits and departmental objectives, as well as the responsibilities and work of other funders&mdash;including the charities.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.2/2">The Medical Research Council (MRC) is not currently funding any research into Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, though it does fund a number of research projects into connective tissue and also into collagen physiology. The MRC always welcomes high quality applications for support into any aspect of human health and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding. Awards are made according to their scientific quality and importance to human health.</p>
	<p pid=".85W.2/3">The provision of treatment for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients is part of the responsibility of health authorities. They must make arrangements for the health of their populations, as they are closest to the people they serve and so best placed to respond sensitively to their needs. People with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have access to a range of specialists depending on the individual diagnosis. These include orthopaedic surgeons, rheumatologists, cardiologists, vascular surgeons, neurosurgeons, dermatologists and clinical geneticists.</p>

	<p pid=".87W.2/1">Doctors and opticians who test sight have a duty to undertake an examination of the eye and perform whatever tests they feel are necessary at the time. The examination undertaken has the purpose of detecting signs of injury, disease or abnormality in the eye and the doctors or opticians carrying them out will be aware of retinoblastoma and the signs to look for on the retina.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/2">Free sight tests are available under the National Health Service to large parts of the population, including all children and those aged 16&ndash;18 in full-time education. Sight tests are the ideal opportunity to review all aspects of eye health, including investigations for signs of disease. In 2001&ndash;02, 9.8 million NHS sight tests were paid for by health authorities. 2.4 million of those were for children.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.2/3">We have promoted a system of child health and development checks. The programme of home visiting and community development makes an important contribution to many areas of health education and fosters the early detection of problems, including those associated with eye sight in young pre-school children. The programme also provides the opportunity to develop closer relationships between the family and the primary care team. Work on developing the children's national service framework continues and the healthy child module will take into account the views expressed by the National Screening Committee (Children's Sub-Group) on the need for child eye screening.</p>

	<p pid=".87W.5/1">The cost of implementing the seven trial milk fluoridation schemes under way in the United Kingdom has been relatively modest, due to the fact that existing school milk programmes have been utilised. The actual cost of fluoridating milk is minimal and in most schemes has been absorbed by the dairy. About one half day a week of an oral health promotion officer's time is required to administer each scheme. Information is not yet available to make any reliable estimates of the costs and cost effectiveness of any national scheme using fluoridated milk to tackle oral health inequalities.</p>
	<p pid=".87W.5/2">The cost of fluoridating water varies depending on the scale of schemes. Experience from current schemes indicates running costs, which are borne by health authorities, of about 40 pence per head of population per year.</p>

	<p pid=".89W.2/1">The UK National Screening Committee (NSC) makes recommendations to Ministers on all aspects of screening programmes. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that routine screening of all pregnant women in the United Kingdom and the treating of those carrying group B streptococcus with intravenous antibiotics during labour would be beneficial. The NSC has commissioned a further assessment of the existing evidence on screening against the criteria used to assess potential screening programmes. At the adjournment debate on this issue on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-09">9 July 2003</phrase>, Ministers asked the NSC to review the position thoroughly as quickly as possible and to consider recommendations at its meeting in December 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.2/2">The health technology assessment (HTA) programme considers research into screening for group B streptococcus to be a high priority for further research, add it will consider commissioning further research in more detail at its December meeting. The HTA programme is also currently considering detailed proposals for research into the effectiveness of a rapid test for group B streptococcus carriage that could be used during labour.</p>
	<p pid=".89W.2/3">The Royal College of Obstetricians (RCOG) is producing clinical guidelines on prevention and treatment of early onset neonatal group B streptococcal disease. The Department has commissioned the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to produce guidelines, due in October 2003, on routine ante-natal care. These will both make an important contribution to ensuring that healthcare professionals are better informed about this condition.</p>

The children's NSF will include childhood asthma as an exemplar condition. The NSF for chronic heart disease already has a reduction in cigarette smoking as one of its major targets. We have also banned tobacco advertising and made smoking reduction aids available on national health service prescription.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.2/2">Additionally we have asked the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to prepare guidelines for the management and diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We expect this guidance to be produced in 2004. Also, phase three of the national primary care collaborative (NPCC) focuses on chronic disease management, in particular COPD and diabetic care. The programme, which will be rolled out to every primary care trust (PCT) in the country by April 2004, will support frontline NHS staff and primary care trust managers and will involve 20 PCTs and more than 100 general practitioner practices. It will help them to develop skills and techniques to deliver improvements in care and work with patients to maximise their self-care and help improve outcomes.</p>

	<p pid=".91W.8/1">Methotrexate is a prescription only medicine widely available throughout the United Kingdom. The use of this disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) has increased in recent years. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recommended the use of methotrexate and other DMARDs as first line therapy prior to the use of the newer tumour necrosis factor (TNF-a) blockers for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</p>
	<p pid=".91W.8/2">As with all medicines the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) have continued to closely monitor the safe use of methotrexate. Reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to medicines are collected by the MHRA and the CSM through the spontaneous reporting scheme, the Yellow Card Scheme. To date the MHRA/CSM have received 876 UK ADR reports associated with methotrexate. The most common side effects of methotrexate include nausea, abdominal pain, a reduced number of white blood cells and soreness of the mouth and lips. Other rare but more serious side effects include fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver, bone marrow suppression and pneumonitis.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.8/3">In 1997 the product information was amended to advise that patients who receive methotrexate therapy are required to have a full blood count and renal and liver function tests measured on a regular basis. An article was also published in the MHRA/CSM drug safety bulletin &quot;Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance (Vol. 23, September 1997).</p>
	<p pid=".91W.8/4">In September 2000 health professionals were advised, via another article in &quot;Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance&quot; (Vol. <phrase class="date" code="2000-09-26">26 September 2000</phrase>), to exercise caution when prescribing and dispensing methotrexate. In 2001 the CSM established a working group to review medicines labelling in order to reduce the likelihood of medication error occurring and within the review advised that all oral dose preparations should prominently display a warning to check the dose and frequency of methotrexate on the front face of the carton.</p>
	<p pid=".91W.8/5">In September 2002 the CSM reviewed the increasing number of UK reports of pneumonitis which had been received by the MHRA in association with methotrexate. The CSM recommended updating the product information to provide clearer guidance to prescribers and patients, recognising that the increase was probably a direct consequence of the recent dramatic increase in methotrexate use in patients with early RA. The MHRA is continuing to work closely with the National Patient Safety Agency to reduce the risk of medication errors associated with methotrexate.</p>

Such decisions are taken locally by primary care trusts (PCTs). In such circumstances, the criteria applied by PCTs and under centrally funded choice pilots would usually include the length of time patients have waited, their clinical appropriateness and fitness for referral to an independent provider and value for money (taking into account the availability of alternative capacity). These criteria would also apply to referrals to the new independent sector treatment centres which we are procuring currently but in addition, these will be supplemented by clear clinical pathways, building on those developed as part of the London patient choice project.</p>

	<p pid=".97W.2/1">As announced in the NHS Cancer Plan the Department is funding a network of local alliances for action on smoking. These alliances form the bridge between treatment services and local authorities, community groups, businesses, schools, churches etc. and will work with the most deprived sections of their communities to make a difference.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.2/2">Some local alliances, with Asian communities in their areas, are working to raise the awareness of the risk of smoking for example producing materials in ethnic languages, holding events in community centres and encouraging people to use their local cessation services.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.2/3">NHS stop smoking services are now well established across England, and are achieving good results. At a local level the services target their local ethnic minority populations. The services are available to help all smokers who want to stop. The services provide counselling and support to smokers in a variety of settings in primary or secondary care, and in the community, to complement the provision of smoking cessation aids such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and bupropion (Zyban).</p>

	<p pid=".97W.8/1">The Government are committed to improving access to health and social care services for older people. Examples include: enhanced cataract services; free national health service sight tests; free influenza immunisation; immediate access to information and advice through NHS Direct; the national service framework (NSF) for older people; and guidance on eligibility for adult social care&mdash;&quot;Fair Access to Care Services&quot;. The then Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1112" name="Alan Milburn">my right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn)</phrase> confirmed the Government's commitment to improving health and social care for older people in a statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-23">23 July 2002</phrase>. He announced an overall figure of &pound;1 billion for older people by 2006. Two thirds of the &pound;1 billion will be ring-fenced for specific older people's services.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.8/2">The Government are committed to local health and social care services planning and working more closely together in respect of older people's services. It is important for agencies to be clear in their respective responsibilities. Regulations that permit health and social care services to pool resources or otherwise jointly commission or provide services, will help localities deliver integrated care.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.8/3">The Government are committed to ensuring that standards of health and social services are as high as possible, and variations in levels and quality of service throughout the country are minimised. The NSF for older people and the introduction of national minimum standards for specific services are key policy developments in this regard.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.8/4">The Government have introduced an independent and more consistent system for the inspection and regulation of residential care and nursing homes, and for the regulation of domiciliary care agencies. The National Care Standards Commission became fully operational on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-01">1 April 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.8/5">The Government emphasise that health and social care services should be shaped around an individual's needs and not the other way round. Guidance on the single assessment process, published in January 2002, will place older people at the heart of the assessment of their needs and subsequent service planning and delivery.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.8/6">Unfair age discrimination in health and social care is not to be tolerated and will be addressed by the age-related policy audits introduced in the NSF for older people and &quot;Fair Access to Care Services&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.8/7">The Government want health and social care services to be more responsive to the needs of older people from minority ethnic backgrounds. In social care, the project, &quot;Developing services for minority ethnic older people&quot;, is demonstrating how services can be improved.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.8/8">The Government recognise that health and social care needs are often best understood and addressed in the context of other needs such as those for housing, lifelong learning and adequate income. For example, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department of Health published a strategic framework, &quot;Quality and Choice for Older People's Housing&quot;, in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".97W.8/9">The Government are committed to preventing and tackling abuse of older people in any form. Multi-agency codes of practice are now required from health and social care services. Additionally the Department of Health will establish a Protection of Vulnerable Adults list, which will comprise of a list of people judged unsuitable to work with vulnerable adults in the care sector.</p>

In our discussions with the Governing Council and other Iraqi institutions we continue to stress the importance of women's issues being fully addressed in constitutional discussions to ensure that women are able to play a full role in public life. We are in regular contact with Songul Omar and Dr. Raja Habib Khurzai on the Governing Council and Nesreen Mustafa Sidiq Berwari, the Minister for Public Works.</p>

This brings the total number of Liberian refugees in Guinea to 116,000 refugees.

UNHCR are managing to respond to the needs of the new Liberian refugees although the situation will be closely monitored.</p>

DFID's total financial commitment to reproductive health in Malawi is &pound;59.7 million for programmes that are currently being implemented.

	<p pid=".109W.9/2">The Malawi Ministry of Health and Population conducted a joint review in November 2002 with DFID and other development partners of the programmes that they support. The review reported some progress in all activities, but also noted that there were factors beyond the control of the programmes that inhibited progress. These included critical shortage of health personnel, under-resourced working environment, and the rising impact of HIV/AIDS. The international financial institutions and donors including DFID are working with the Malawi Government to address the underlying issues, such as wage policy and macro economic management, that cause the problems affecting the health sector.</p>

	<p pid=".117W.0/17">Since 1997 there has been one recorded casualty resulting from de-mining activities. The significant decrease in injuries and deaths from mines in 2003 is extremely welcome.</p>
	<p pid=".117W.0/18">DFID has provided support for de-mining operations since the ceasefire between the LTTE and the Government of Sri Lanka came into effect last year. DFID has a two-year agreement with UNDP until the end of 2004 for support to de-mining operations. Under this, &pound;697,000 from the allocated &pound;2.6 million for quick impact activities in the North and East of Sri Lanka will be used to fund the early part of UNDP's 2003&ndash;06 mine action programme. This funding was approved in 2002. Further needs assessments are under way and we stand ready to make further commitments if necessary. DFID does not directly run any de-mining projects in Sri Lanka and has therefore not sought technical advice from the Ministry of Defence. However, DFID liaises closely with the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on our development programme to Sri Lanka.</p>

	<p pid=".118W.4/1">In May 2001, the Government prepared a preliminary partial regulatory impact assessment of the proposals in the European Commission's White Paper. A revised partial Assessment will be required when proposals for the European Commission's legislation are available and my Department is working closely with other interested Departments, the Devolved Administrations and concerned stakeholders to develop its scope and content. As set out in the guidance on conducting such an Assessment, consideration of the impacts on small to medium sized businesses will form a key part of this.</p>
	<p pid=".118W.4/2">As well as considering the benefits and costs of the proposals, the Assessment will include an analysis of the implications of the proposed legislation for the international competitiveness of the UK chemicals industry and other manufacturing sectors that use chemicals in their processes and products. In addition the Government will consider what further analysis may be needed, particularly for small to medium sized businesses to meet the demands of any new legislation. We have noted the results of other work undertaken for instance by the Commission and the Federation of German Industry (BDI) and this will be taken into account when carrying out our assessment. Getting these aspects right is a key element to achieve the Government's first objective for the new EU chemicals strategy of a fast, efficient and workable process.</p>

	<p pid=".126W.5/1">No specific assessment has been undertaken of the impact of the CAP reform proposals on smaller, economically marginal or tenant farmers. However, we have assessed the impacts of the proposals on farming and other businesses generally, including an analysis by farm activity, and a summary of these is included in the Regulatory Impact Assessments which have been lodged in the House Libraries.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.5/2">For the first time, the bulk of farm subsidy will not be dependent on what or how much farmers produce. They will instead be free to produce what they judge the market wants and so be better able to cut costs and increase profits. Our analysis suggests that those farmers who are economically marginal at present are likely to be more disposed to take advantage of this freedom to alter their activity and thereby increase their income. Farmers will also be freed from some of the bureaucracy associated with the subsidy schemes which are being replaced by this new decoupled subsidy. The historic recipient, whether owner or tenant, will continue to hold the subsidy entitlement.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.5/3">Farmers whose subsidy is less than Euro5,000, which is likely to include many of the smallest holdings, will be exempt from the reduction in subsidies to fund rural development and environmental measures. This exemption applies to tenants as well as farmers who own the land.</p>
	<p pid=".126W.5/4">The UK also has the option to retain 10 per cent. of payments to establish a national envelope to address potential negative impacts of decoupling for specific types of farming. The detailed rules of how this will apply have yet to be developed by the European Commission.</p>

	<p pid=".131W.2/1">The Energy White Paper details the steps being taken to encourage greater energy efficiency in the UK, and sets out an ambitious strategy for energy efficiency up to 2010 and beyond. Energy efficiency is expected to deliver about half the carbon savings needed to meet our goals for 2020. This will mean roughly doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvement of recent decades.</p>
	<p pid=".131W.2/2">Key measures proposed in the White Paper include extension of the Energy Efficiency Commitment beyond 2005 at possibly twice its current level of activity; revisions to the Building Regulations; faster improvements in the standards of new household appliances; and consultation on economic instruments to improve household energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid=".131W.2/3">Tighter building regulations will have an impact on new homes, alterations to existing stock and all replacement windows and boilers. We have already begun work on the next major revision of the building regulations, which we will aim to bring into effect in 2005. Tighter building regulations will also encourage developers to use low carbon solutions such as solar water heating and photovoltaics.</p>
	<p pid=".131W.2/4">As announced in Budget 2003, following the initial consultation last year the Government are consulting in more detail on specific economic instruments to encourage greater energy efficiency by households, including the use of measures to change the price differential between efficient and inefficient products.</p>
	<p pid=".131W.2/5">Micro-CHP could also in due course provide a useful contribution towards improving household energy efficiency. An estimated 250&ndash;500MW could be generated from micro-CHP by 2010, although the Government do not have a specific target for the amount of electricity to be generated by micro-CHP technology.</p>
	<p pid=".131W.2/6">The Government intend to publish an Energy Efficiency Implementation Plan within a year of the White Paper's publication, which will provide further detail on all of these policies.</p>

	<p pid=".132W.2/1">The Government estimates the potential for cost-effective improvements in energy use in homes at almost &pound; 3 billion a year or around 20 per cent. of current total expenditure. This is almost &pound;120 per household. These figures are based on the installation of cost-effective insulation and the replacement, at the end of their useful lives, of boilers, lights and domestic appliances by the most efficient equivalent models available. Precise estimates vary, since new products reach the market and existing measures are installed but there is broad agreement on the 20 per cent. estimate.</p>

	<p pid=".136W.5/1">Industry sources suggest there are around 100,000 vehicles currently running on LPG. It is not possible to precisely estimate the particulate matter emissions savings <i>(a)</i> because there are no measurements of particulate matter emissions from LPG fuelled vehicles and <i>(b)</i> there are no records of which fuel, petrol or diesel, was replaced. It is however estimated that around one third of LPG fuelled vehicles were converted from diesel. In this case, there would be savings of particulate matter emissions of around 130 tonnes per year. This is out of a total of 30,000 tonnes of PM emitted from UK road transport in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.5/2">Industry sources suggest approximately 850 vehicles currently run on CNG/LNG. These are mainly heavy-duty vehicles that would otherwise be running on diesel. On the basis of this figure, it is estimated that 13 tonnes of PM have been saved in the UK by these conversions to CNG.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.5/3">While comparatively small, these emissions savings contribute to improved air quality and help the UK move towards meeting its air quality objectives.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.5/4">There are presently only a few prototype/demonstration vehicles in the whole of the UK running on hydrogen. Therefore, the particulate matter emission savings from converting to hydrogen are currently negligible. There is, however, long-term potential for significant particulate matter emissions savings by replacing conventional fuelled vehicles with hydrogen fuelled vehicles.</p>

	<p pid=".136W.8/1">The external costs of air pollution is a subject where considerable research work is being undertaken to improve our scientific and economic understanding of the health and environmental damages of air pollution. This work is important to provide the evidence base on which policies are developed.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.8/2">The framework for estimating the external costs of one tonne of particulates to the atmosphere requires a detailed step-by-step analysis to assess the effect of emissions on local and regional air concentrations; quantify the health and environmental impacts using dose response functions and data on population exposed and value these health and environmental impacts in monetary terms where appropriate. Many factors including location of emissions will determine the extent of damages from a tonne of particulates.</p>
	<p pid=".136W.8/3">In September 2001, the Interdepartmental Group on Costs and Benefits published &quot;An Economic Analysis to Inform the Review of the Air Quality Strategy Objectives for Particles&quot;. This quantified a range of environmental and health effects arising from particulate emissions. Direct environmental effects of particles include damages from soiling of buildings. Evidence on the health effects of particles has been accumulating. Day to day variations in concentration of airborne particles are associated with day to day variations in a range of health end points. These include daily deaths, admissions to hospital for the treatment of both respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and symptoms among patients suffering from asthma. In addition, there is evidence from the United States that long-term exposure to particulate air pollution is associated with a decrease in life expectancy. In 2001, COMEAP (Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants) reviewed the evidence on the long-term effects of particles on mortality and concluded that it was more likely than not that a causal association existed between long-term exposure to particles and mortality. The IGCB Report took on board this advice in quantifying the long-term mortality effects of particles. However, the health benefits were not presented in monetary terms due to the uncertainties over valuation in the air pollution context where empirical studies are not yet available.</p>

	<p pid=".139W.5/1">The methodology for the Air Quality Strategy is aimed at assessing the health impacts for pollutants where inhalation is the main route of exposure. It is not appropriate to use this methodology in this case because exposure through inhalation is negligable.</p>
	<p pid=".139W.5/2">Crematoria are a source of inorganic mercury. This is associated with tremors, gingivitis and/or minor psychological changes, together with spontaneous abortion and congenital malformation.</p>
	<p pid=".139W.5/3">Concern arises from the fact that this inorganic mercury can be transported over long distances and be transformed to methyl mercury in the bottom sediments of aquatic ecosystems. Methyl mercury can cause damage to the brain, kidneys and the central nervous system; as it readily crosses the placental barrier, foetal brain levels are approximately 5&ndash;7 times higher than in maternal blood. Foetal and postnatal exposures have given rise to abortion, congenital malformation and development changes in young children, with toxic effects in infants even when absent in the mother.</p>
	<p pid=".139W.5/4">The UK's long-standing policy approach is therefore to minimise, wherever practicable, the amounts of mercury entering the environment from all human activities. We have been discussing with the crematoria sector how they might mitigate any impacts.</p>

Companies entering into lease agreements for wind farm developments with the Crown Estate will be charged an appropriate rental for the site. Following discussion with industry and the British Wind Energy Association, The Crown Estate has indicated that, up to 2010, the basis for calculating rentals for new wind farm site leases will be unchanged from the current 2 per cent. of gross revenue, with a rent review after 20 years.</p>

	<p pid=".154W.2/7">On average 0.0001 per cent. of the total energy transferred on the England and Wales transmission network is lost per annum due to faults on the transmission network. Consequently, the actual figure for the cost to NGT through the loss of power from these incidents is very small (of the order of a few thousand pounds per annum).</p>

These studies will ensure that the FRES requirements take into account the need for air portability. The contract for the A400M programme has now been signed. It is not currently expected that there will be any consequent adjustments to it, and therefore no additional costs have been identified.</p>

	<p pid=".161W.8/1">In seeking a better balance in our deployable land forces, we plan to shift from the current mix of light and heavy forces representing the two extremes of deployability and combat power to a more graduated and balanced structure of light, medium and heavy forces, together with a greater emphasis on enabling capabilities such as logistics, engineers and intelligence. The introduction of the air-transportable, medium-weight Future Rapid Effects System family of vehicles is one part of this re-balancing. The ISD for FRES will be formally set at the Main Gate investment decision, however the planning assumption for its ISD remains around the end of this decade. A400M enters service in a comparable timeframe&mdash;its ISD is 2011.</p>

	<p pid=".163W.2/2">It is hoped that everyone who served in the Suez Canal Zone for the requisite number of days, within the designated dates and geographical boundaries which are in the process of being agreed, will receive a medal and/or clasp. However, on some individual Service records it might be more difficult to confirm eligibility from the limited information. In such cases, the files will be cross-referenced against the detailed Service records and maps that have been prepared by officials from contemporary historical documents. These will help to determine which Units, ships, regiments, squadrons etc. were deployed in the Canal Zone during the period specified in the White Paper. In rare cases where the evidence is insufficient to confirm eligibility for the medal, the medal offices may have to invite veterans to supply additional proof of entitlement in the form of contemporary official documentation, but it is hoped that this will not be necessary, I expect most veterans to receive their medals during the course of next year.</p>

	<p pid=".167W.2/1">The Government welcome the outcomes of the recent Berlin ministerial meeting on the Bologna process of European higher education reform. The process of reform will make it increasingly easy for students and researchers to gain the social and educational benefits from studying in another European country. In Berlin, Education Ministers set clear goals for 2005 on making progress across Europe on degree structures, on credit systems and on quality assurance. This will ensure that there is no danger of the process of reform slowing down.</p>
	<p pid=".167W.2/2">In addition, another seven countries joined the Bologna process in Berlin. This raises to 40 the total number of countries committed to working together to build a successful and attractive European higher education area by the end of the decade, an important plank of the Lisbon agenda on competitiveness.</p>

This funding will help deliver an ambitious Public Service Agreement target, shared by DfES and DCMS, to increase the percentage of school children who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent. by 2006. Currently, about a quarter of schools provide this entitlement at key stage 1, two-fifths at key stage 2 and a third at key stages 3 and 4.</p>

The recent publication &quot;Travelling to School: an action plan&quot; encourages school to work with their local authority and transport providers to consider whether staggered school opening hours can allow pupils to access a wider range of school based activities, cut costs and improve services by allowing the same number of buses to provide a service to many more pupils. Decisions on school session times are and will remain a matter for individual schools. If schools in their local area adopt different times, parents with reasons to prefer one school's opening hours to another's will no doubt take this into account in choosing a school.</p>

	<p pid=".173W.8/1">The Government are committed to supporting the Iraqi people in securing the long-term well being of Iraqi collections and antiquities. We believe that the most sustainable way of achieving this is to ensure that the museums have Iraqi conservators, curators and restorers who have the necessary and up-to-date skills to look after the collections. The British Museum, English Heritage and other organisations funded through my Department are consequently providing initially six secondment scholarships to help train Iraqi Board of Antiquities staff in the skills which the board most urgently needs. A number of staff have already been identified who will come to the UK to undertake secondments in the British Museum as soon as possible. In addition, my Department has compiled a database of offers for help and support by a number of UK-based heritage bodies and will match these offers with future needs identified by the Board of Antiquities.</p>

	<p pid=".179W.11/1">Information on local authorities' activities under homelessness provisions in England is published in a quarterly Statistical Release, &quot;Statutory Homelessness: England&quot;. Table 3 of the Statistical Release presents a summary of those households accepted as unintentionally homeless and in priority need under the homelessness provisions of the 1996 Housing Act. Tables 6 and 7 summarise the number of homeless households in accommodation arranged by local authorities on the last day of the quarter.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.11/2">Copies of the Statistical Release are available in the Library of the House and the latest edition, published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-10">10 September</phrase>, presents statistics up to and including the second quarter of 2003. In the period April to June 2003, local authorities accepted 36,230 households as homelessness, and as at <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-30">30 June 2003</phrase> there were 93,480 households in accommodation arranged by local authorities under homelessness provisions of Housing Acts.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.11/3">For information about other parts of the United Kingdom, I refer my hon. Friend to my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.11/4">The March 2002 report, 'More than a roof', set out the Government's approach to tackling and preventing homelessness. Specific measures included investment of &pound;125 million in 2002&ndash;03 to support local authorities and voluntary agencies working with them to support new approaches to tackling and preventing homelessness. The Homelessness Directorate within the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has a revenue budget of &pound;70 million and a &pound;23.5 million capital budget for 2003&ndash;04. These resources will help to support the Government's commitment that by March 2004 no homeless family with children should be placed in a bed and breakfast hotel other than in an emergency, and even then for no more than six weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.11/5">Funding will also support new approaches that help people tackle the problems that are making and keeping them homeless and help to sustain the Prime Minister's target to reduce rough sleeping by two thirds of 1998 levels.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.11/6">While the latest quarterly statistics show increases in homelessness acceptances and the number of homeless households in temporary accommodation, there has been a significant reduction in the number of homeless families with children placed in bed and breakfast accommodation. The number of such families has fallen by 22 per cent. over the last quarter and 44 per cent. compared with a year ago. In addition, the latest rough sleeping figures for England, also published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-10">10 September</phrase>, estimate that 504 people were sleeping rough on any one night&mdash;the lowest ever recorded level.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.11/7">The rising trend in homelessness is the result of numerous complex factors, many of which are outlined in &quot;More than a roof&quot;. In addition, the Priority Needs Order has extended the criteria by which people are assessed to have a priority need if they are homeless.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.11/8">The Homelessness Act 2002 placed a duty on local authorities to have a strategy in place by the end of July 2003 to tackle and prevent homelessness, based on a review of homelessness in their district. While the number of homelessness acceptances is likely to continue to increase in the short term, improved housing supply and increased investment in prevention should lead to reductions in the longer term.</p>

Customers abroad at the time of failure will be repatriated at the end of their holiday, and those who have yet to travel will be fully reimbursed for what they have paid. Under the terms of the Civil Aviation (Air Travel Organisers' Licensing) Regulations 1995, in the event of failure of a licensed travel organiser the bond established with the Civil Aviation Authority would be used to cover the repatriation and reimbursement costs. If the bond is insufficient to meet these costs the Air Travel Trust Fund would be used to make up the difference.</p>

	<p pid=".186W.11/1">The Government have supported biofuels since July 2002 by means of a 20 pence per litre duty incentive which has resulted in sales of biodiesel increasing to over 2 million litres a month from virtually nothing before that date. Biodiesel is used mainly in a 5 per cent. blend with conventional diesel, and bio-blend fuel already represents some 2 per cent. of diesel sales. Vehicles do not need to be converted to run on 5 per cent. bio-blend diesel.</p>

	<p pid=".186W.11/3">In the last three financial years, 2002&ndash;01 to 2002&ndash;03, the Energy Saving Trusts' TransportEnergy Powershift programme has provided grants of around &pound;12.6 million for the purchase or conversion of vehicles to run on road fuel gases (natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas). The duty rate for the gases has since Budget 2001 been 9 pence per kilogramme. The Government have been consulting key stakeholders on how best to ensure that future support continues to reflect environmental and other policy objectives, with a view to announcing decisions in the 2003 pre-Budget report.</p>

The date of the ban changes year-to-year, but during the 24-hour period of application, coach groups of more than 15 children under the age of 16 years are prohibited from travelling. The restrictions were originally put in place due to a number of serious coach accidents occurring at this time of year, which is traditionally the busiest weekend for transporting French children and heavy holiday traffic.</p>
	<p pid=".187W.2/2">The French authorities notify the British Embassy in Paris once the date of the ban is confirmed. They in turn pass this information to the UK trade association, the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT), for further dissemination amongst the UK coach industry. This information would also be available from the French Embassy and industry publications. Therefore, the Department does not pass this information to UK coach operators.</p>

	<p pid=".190W.2/1">The information requested is as follows.</p>
	<p pid=".190W.2/2"><i>Inbound</i>&mdash;There are no fixed paths over Walthamstow for arriving aircraft although they tend to follow a regular pattern that varies depending on wind direction and how busy Heathrow airport is at the time. Aircraft over-flying Walthamstow comprise mainly those descending from the Lambourne holding stack en route to the final approach to Heathrow, and occasionally aircraft inbound to London City. Exceptionally, aircraft inbound to Stansted may be routed over Walthamstow.</p>
	<p pid=".190W.2/3"><i>Outbound</i>&mdash;There are no Heathrow departure routes over Walthamstow, but air traffic controllers are permitted to use all controlled airspace, and so a small number of Heathrow departures may overfly Walthamstow above 4,000ft. Any London City departures over Walthamstow will normally be above 3,000ft. Aircraft departing from other south-east airports can be routed over the Walthamstow area, but will be at much higher altitudes and probably not be heard.</p>

The International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) has tables showing what wave loadings are to be used for differing service requirements. Standards for ship's structures are based on known wave environments expressed statistically and incorporate appropriate safety margins. Freak waves by definition are in excess of these expectations and therefore no ship is specifically designed to meet them.</p>

I have also emphasised the need to secure improvements in the management of chronic disease and I have asked local health and social care groups to develop projects within their locality to secure improvements in conditions such as diabetes. I have also made resources available to improve the detection and treatment of diabetes-related eye disease and this is being taken forward by a regional working group.

Given that introduction is on a phased basis, it will take a number of years for the entire hearing aid user population to be assessed for digital aids.</p>

	<p pid=".202W.6/1">The principal cause of the present difficulties is a significant increase in demand: applications are up by around 11 per cent. over the previous year. Allied to this is the fact that the Agency's test centres have been closed on a phased basis for the installation of much needed new vehicle test equipment. I regret that despite careful planning it has not been possible to cope as effectively as I would have liked with this additional demand in recent months.</p>
	<p pid=".202W.6/2">The Agency has taken a number of measures to reduce waiting times. These include increasing productivity, introducing a more efficient booking programme, making maximum possible use of overtime, redeploying staff from non-urgent duties to testing, introducing extended working at a number of centres, recruiting additional staff and postponing non-urgent training. It has also improved the provision of information and guidance to the public and is in the process of extending its new telephone booking service.</p>
	<p pid=".202W.6/3">These and other measures have brought about a gradual improvement. Average waiting times have dropped from 43 days in early July to around 35 days. The positive trend is expected to continue over the next few months.</p>

The final Strategy, which will be published later this year, will further sharpen the focus on energy efficiency and help co-ordinate efforts towards securing further substantial improvements.</p>
	<p pid=".204W.0/2">Government are committed to promoting energy efficiency and approximately &pound;16 million will be committed this year on energy efficiency programmes sponsored by a number of Government Departments in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".204W.0/3">For example, the Department of Social Development has lead responsibility for energy efficiency in the domestic sector, using the Northern Ireland Housing Executive as a delivery partner, and has secured a 13 per cent. saving in energy consumption since 1996 in occupied stock across all tenures. This level of saving was achieved from a broad range of schemes, such as the Warm Homes Scheme, the Housing Executive's heating replacement programme and renewable energy pilot schemes. The energy efficiency levy, which was increased by the Northern Ireland Assembly to &pound;5 per electricity consumer was used to further underpin household energy efficiency with over 80 per cent. of this benefit being specifically targeted towards disadvantaged householders likely to be at risk of fuel poverty.</p>

	<p pid=".207W.8/1">In Northern Ireland, Health and Social Services (HSS) trusts pay fostering allowances, which are agreed each year in consultation with the four HSS boards. The standard rates known as the 'Model Scheme' in Northern Ireland are currently lower than the average amount paid by local authorities in England. However, boards and trusts have increased allowances within the Model Scheme by 5.5 per cent. for 2003&ndash;04. Different rates are payable for children of different ages ranging from &pound;285.88 per four weeks for children aged 0&ndash;4 to &pound;513.52 per four weeks for children aged 16+ . The scale of foster care allowances is set out in the following table. Enhanced allowances are also available to cover, for example, expenses incurred at Christmas and birthdays and the cost of school uniforms and educational holidays.</p>
	<p pid=".207W.8/2">My Department is currently developing a Strategy for Children in Need which will include children in foster care. It is intended that we will work closely with HSS boards, trusts and the fostering network to develop a three-year plan for fostering in Northern Ireland. This will have regard to the issues raised in the Strategy for Foster Care Services in Northern Ireland which has already been developed by the four HSS boards in association with the fostering network, including those which relate to remuneration of foster carers.</p>

	<p pid=".219W.3/1">I understand from the Chief Executive of the South Eastern Education and Library Board that the following allocations of PEAG places have been made to voluntary and private sector pre-school centres in the Board area. The process of the PEAG reallocating unused places is still under way. The figures shown below may not, therefore, represent any individual centre's final allocation for the year.</p>

	<p pid=".222W.5/1">The Northern Health and Social Services Board advises that the provision of respite services to support adults with special needs differs between the two Community Health and Social Services Trusts in its area.</p>
	<p pid=".222W.5/2">In Causeway Health and Social Services Trust service provision is almost exclusively through the Trust's own family based respite care scheme. In Homefirst Health and Social Services Trust the model of provision is slightly different, drawing mainly on services provided through a family based scheme run by the voluntary sector, while also using a limited amount of statutory sector provision. This year the Northern Health and Social Services Board provided additional resources to increase family based respite, in conjunction with the voluntary sector, in the East Antrim area.</p>

	<p pid=".223W.5/1">Invest NI employs a broad range of measures to assist existing companies and entrepreneurs in the hi-technology and telecommunications sectors. The principal form of support available to assist significant new investment proposals (by new or existing businesses) is Selective Financial Assistance, which may contain elements covering capital and revenue grants in addition to loans and equity participation. Invest NI also operates a comprehensive series of schemes and programmes aimed at providing support which can be tailored to the needs of individual companies or entrepreneurs.</p>
	<p pid=".223W.5/2">These measures assist Invest NI to achieve the objectives set out in its Corporate Plan 2002&ndash;05. They therefore focus on promoting innovation and stimulating higher levels of R&amp;D and knowledge transfer; helping companies to achieve higher levels of growth; promoting a more enterprising culture; raising the number of business starts; and attracting new inward investment.</p>
	<p pid=".223W.5/3">Invest NI has achieved a highly credible performance in its first year of operation. Key Innovation targets have been met or exceeded; Growing Existing Businesses and Business Start-up targets have been substantially achieved; and performance in attracting new inward investment has been encouraging, despite the continuing global downturn in foreign direct investment. In particular, Invest NI has assisted the setting up of 74 new, potentially high growth companies in the hi-tech and telecommunications sectors. Its offer of &pound;14.3 million support towards business proposals by companies in these sectors represents a total investment of &pound;109 million.</p>
	<p pid=".223W.5/4">Invest NI has also played a key role in establishing the Northern Ireland Science Park and has provided &pound;26 million to support the establishment of 17 Centres of Research Excellence, the majority of which are focused on high technology sectors. In addition, Invest NI has been highly active in drawing up a series of sector strategies aimed at maximising the economic development potential for a range of sectors including hi-technology and telecommunications.</p>
	<p pid=".223W.5/5">These excellent first year achievements offer a very sound platform on which Invest NI can build in the future. They demonstrate the success of the measures which Invest NI has developed to provide support schemes and programmes which are both comprehensive and sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of existing businesses and entrepreneurs in a wide range of industrial sectors, including hi-technology and telecommunications.</p>

There are now around 1.9 million pensioner households on our systems being paid pension credit. We intend from November to publish monthly reports on the progress of pension credit take-on, which will include a more detailed breakdown of this figure. Our planning assumes that on a typical weekday the pension credit application line will be handling around 18,000 calls a day, although if necessary the application line has the capacity to answer up to 14,000 calls per hour for a limited time during exceptionally busy periods. The level of resources will ensure that customers who wish to make an application using the application line can do so. The average time to complete a pension credit application for customers using the application line is currently about 20 minutes.</p>

	<p pid=".231W.2/1">Successive Lord Chancellors have warned magistrates of the risks of participating in activities which might appear to undermine the independence of the bench. However, one of the strengths of the magistracy is that its members will have a wide range of experience of their local communities. Magistrates are encouraged to keep their knowledge up to date, and visits to areas with particular problems can do much to help. The Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State does not wish to discourage magistrates from seeing at first hand how the police work within the local community. This must, however, be achieved in ways which minimise the risks of their impartiality being called into question.</p>
