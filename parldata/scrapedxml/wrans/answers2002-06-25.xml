	<p pid=".741W.3/3">I am monitoring the application of the public library standards through the annual library planning process. Analysis of the 2001 plans shows that nearly all authorities are using the introduction of the standards to plan for improvements in the quality of their library services but that, in many cases, authorities recognise that this will require them to direct more of their budgets into their library services than hitherto. It is for library authorities to ensure that they make the right allocation of resources to ensure the provision of a comprehensive and efficient service within the meaning of the Act.</p>

The figures from the new model show, as did those from the old model, that evasion has declined steadily in recent years. The new model estimates evasion at 7.8 per cent. at the end of May 2002, compared with 8.6 per cent. at May 2001 and 11.4 per cent. at May 1997.</p>

	<p pid=".746W.2/1">As a group, Gulf veterans report significantly more ill-health than other comparable groups. A number of possible factors for this have been suggested but peer-reviewed scientific research, confirmed and validated by other researchers, has no identified the cause. Further important research is underway, and the Government is committed to carrying out some such further research. I hope to announce some new areas of research shortly. I would encourage members of the scientific community who have other new ideas to submit proposals for further work to the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC will assess the proposals and recommend to the Ministry of Defence those which it considers to be soundly based and of sufficient scientific merit to justify being taken forward.</p>

	<p pid=".746W.5/1">The Ministry of Defence accepts that some veterans of the 1990&ndash;91 Gulf conflict have become ill and that many believe this ill health is unusual and related to their Gulf experience. There is evidence that Gulf veterans report more ill-health than other comparable groups. The Government attach great importance to investigating the causes of this and believe that the best way of doing so is through scientific and medical research. A number of important research projects are currently under way and I hope to announce further work shortly. The Government do not believe that a Royal Commission to investigate the causes of Gulf veterans' illnesses would be helpful at this time.</p>

	<p pid=".750W.6/1">DFID are rarely involved in funding major infrastructure projects of the sort that would require an environmental impact assessment (EIA) in the UK. DFID procedures require environmental screening on all projects above &pound;1 million, or below this threshold if significant environmental impacts are anticipated. The screening is supported by DFID's environmental guide, which provides guidance, such as screening checklists that highlight potential beneficial and adverse impacts. If initial screening indicates that an activity could have significant impacts on the environment, then further investigation must be undertaken, which may include further environmental analysis; a full EIA; or an environmental audit. The objective of DFID's appraisal system is not only to assess potential positive or negative impacts, but also to seek opportunities to improve policy formulation and decision-making, e.g. we are currently undertaking an appraisal of strategic choices regarding Russia's accession to the WTO.</p>
	<p pid=".750W.6/2">The DFID environmental appraisal process applies to expenditure on policies, programmes and projects. The EC EIA directive, transposed into UK legislation, currently applies to projects (e.g. building new roads, building power stations, etc.), but the EU directive on programmes and plans (2001/42/EC) is in the process of becoming UK law. DFID procedures also allow for intermediate level of investigation&mdash;environmental analysis&mdash;where a full EIA is not required. In the UK EIA legislation there is no such intermediate form of analysis.</p>

	<p pid=".753W.2/1">We have put in place a range of planning guidance to promote a sustainable pattern of physical development and land and property use. Sound planning policies and an effective and efficient planning system are central to the Government's policies to improve eco-efficiency and resource productivity. Our policies concentrate the majority of new development within existing urban areas and in doing so help to reduce the need to travel and safeguard the countryside from unnecessary development. We have a target to provide 60 per cent. of additional dwellings on previously developed land by 2008 which, as a result of our policy changes, has been met.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.2/2">Planning policy is also supported by a number of fiscal measures aimed at improving environmental outcomes; by encouraging better use of existing property to reduce new build, through a 150 per cent. tax credit for cleaning up contaminated land, and through taxes introduced on landfill in 1996, and on the quarrying of aggregates in 2002. Legislation to apply modern standards of conditions to old mineral workings was extended in 1995 to apply to all such sites, and tougher environmental tests before opencast coal sites can be opened or enlarged were introduced in 1999. Action, both statutory and voluntary, has commenced to limit or remove the more damaging existing planning permissions which threaten the integrity of the sites proposed or designated under the EU's Natura 2000 network. This includes a major voluntary purchase by English Nature of the most important and vulnerable lowland peat bogs in England.</p>
	<p pid=".753W.2/3">The Department and its agencies have a variety of mechanisms to protect and enhance the rural environment. These include nearly &pound;1 billion for agri-environment schemes under the England Rural Development Programme, and further support by English Nature, the Countryside Agency and the Environment Agency. DEFRA also provides 75 per cent. of funding for national parks for the same purpose. These mechanisms are making a significant contribution to a number of the Government's PSA targets, including those to reverse the decline in farmland birds by 2020, and bring 95 per cent. of all nationally important wildlife sites into favourable condition by 2010. They also contribute to meeting the targets for maintaining/restoring priority habitats and species under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan which was drawn up to meet commitments flowing from the Rio Earth Summit.</p>

	<p pid=".756W.2/2">A sequence of mechanisms applies, which enable appeals to be made at various stages in the development of a GM variety prior to the marketing of seeds of that variety.</p>
	<p pid=".756W.2/3" class="indent">1. Before a GM crop variety can be considered for seed registration it must have been assessed at European level for safety to human health and the environment and be approved for placing on the market under Part C of Directive 90/220/EEC on the Deliberate Release into the Environment of Genetically Modified Organisms. This directive has now been replaced by the new Directive 2001/18/EC, which has to be implemented by member states by October 2002. Under part C of the new directive, the European Commission and all member states discuss applications for consents to market GMOs (including GM seeds) in the EU and may ask for further information, make comments on, or present reasoned objections to the proposed release. The Commission is required to consult the public while the application is being considered, and these views are copied to all member states. The Commission and member states then make a collective decision on the application, and a marketing consent is either granted or refused. The new directive (like its predecessor) does not have any specific provisions for appeal against the decision to grant or refuse consent. However, it does ensure that if new information comes to light regarding the risks posed by the GMO to human health or the environment, the consent can be altered or revoked as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".756W.2/4" class="indent">2. The Seeds (National Lists of Varieties) Regulations 2001 provide a three-stage appeal process. On payment of the appropriate fee, persons affected by a proposed relevant decision (which includes proposals to add any varieties, GM or conventional, to the UK National List) may make written representations to the national authorities and/or oral representations to a person appointed by them. The national authorities are required to consider such written and/or oral representations before taking a relevant decision and must give notice of their decision and the reasons for it as well as information about how that decision may be appealed to the Plant Varieties and Seeds Tribunal.</p>
	<p pid=".756W.2/5" class="indent">3. The Plant Breeders' Rights Regulations 1998 set out similar arrangements in respect of plant breeders' rights.</p>

	<p pid=".757W.2/1">The purpose of the proposed Directive is to establish a framework for the prevention and remediation of environmental damage in accordance with the principle that the polluter pays. This represents an important and significant development in EC environmental law. The Government have therefore conducted a public consultation on the proposals, and the UK position on the detail of the proposal will be finalised in the light of the comments received.</p>
	<p pid=".757W.2/2">In broad terms however, the Government support a regime which is equitable, proportionate, clear, insurable, easy to implement, does not damage business competitiveness, and delivers clear environmental benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".757W.2/3">The partial regulatory impact assessment submitted to Parliament (COM (02) 17), indicates that much of the environmental damage covered by the directive is already the subject of existing domestic regimes, but the proposals go further in some respects. The directive would set higher standards of remediation and introduce the concepts of equivalent compensation and interim losses. Further benefits would arise from introducing a regime across the European Community which would harmonise the rules and standards for environmental liability across member states. Provided that the right balance between costs and benefits is achieved, this proposal could therefore play a useful part in safeguarding the environment.</p>

	<p pid=".758W.11/1">I am pleased to announce today the arrangements for the distribution of the National Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund. Local authorities in every region of England (apart from London which is being handled separately) will receive a total of &pound;42 million in 2002&ndash;03 from the fund to kick start new projects. The money will go to schemes that improve recycling, complement municipal waste management strategies and contribute to a better quality of life for residents.</p>
	<p pid=".758W.11/2">From over 190 applications to the fund for 2002&ndash;03, 112 schemes were approved by DEFRA with the assistance of an expert panel. Details of the successful schemes will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses shortly when the local authorities have been informed. We are now inviting applications for grants from the fund for 2003&ndash;04 when &pound;76.3 million will be available; almost double the amount for 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid=".758W.11/3">The national fund prioritises five key areas:</p>
	<p pid=".758W.11/4" class="indent">improving partnership initiatives between authorities;</p>
	<p pid=".758W.11/5" class="indent">contributing to high performance, innovation and best practice;</p>
	<p pid=".758W.11/6" class="indent">establishing a challenge fund for general projects;</p>
	<p pid=".758W.11/7" class="indent">developing community initiatives;</p>
	<p pid=".758W.11/8" class="indent">turning around low recycling performance.</p>
	<p pid=".758W.11/9">Overall, England recycled just 10 per cent. of its household rubbish in 1999&ndash;2000&mdash;one of the lowest rates in Europe and we are taking action to improve this. We have set a target of 25 per cent. recycling by 2005&ndash;06 and have allocated &pound;19.9 million from the fund for helping turn around low performance and &pound;12.5 million for partnership working. The assistance given by this fund will help some of the lowest performers in their efforts to reach a minimum recycling rate of 10 per cent. in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".758W.11/10">Neighbourhood renewal is also a key area of Government policy and over half of the 88 NRU local authorities in England are low recycling performers. 21 NRU local authorities were approved for direct grant in 2002&ndash;03, amounting to a total of some &pound;14 million.</p>
	<p pid=".758W.11/11">We will be publishing revised guidance for the submission of bids to the fund for 2003&ndash;04 very shortly on DEFRA's website.</p>

	<p pid=".759W.2/2">The main threat to albatrosses and petrels arises from long-line fishing for tuna and toothfish in the southern oceans, in which I understand that no metropolitan UK vessels are involved. Last June the UK signed the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP), made under the Convention on Migratory Species. ACAP will require its parties to co-operate in the development and implementation of an action plan for the conservation of these species, encompassing both the control of fishing activities, including measures to mitigate the impact of long-line fishing, and the protection of breeding sites, some of which are in the UK's overseas territories. The RSPB has recently undertaken research into these and other bird species on Gough Island, funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>
	<p pid=".759W.2/3">The Government are currently in discussion with the authorities of the range state overseas territories to ascertain whether they need new legislation in order to implement the requirements of ACAP. We are also considering the position in respect of the metropolitan UK, and will explore with our partners in the European Union the prospects for wider European participation. I hope the UK will be in a position to ratify ACAP, possible initially on behalf of some of the overseas territories, later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".761W.8/4" class="indent">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) produces estimates by current marital status annually, but these are not additionally available by the previous marital status. Hence estimates of the married population are not available separately for those who had married for the first time, those who remarried after being divorced, and those who remarried after being widowed.</p>
	<p pid=".761W.8/5" class="indent">However, ONS has made some special estimates of the proportion of the married population who had remarried after a previous divorce, using the General Household Survey (GHS). Using the 1998 GHS for England and Wales, it is estimated that 15 per cent of married men had remarried after a previous divorce, and the corresponding figure for women was 14 per cent. The proportions for 2000 were the same as those for 1998. (There was no GHS in 1997 or 1999).</p>
	<p pid=".761W.8/6" class="indent">Of the 2000 population of men who had re-married after divorce, 7 per cent had divorced between 1997 and 1999, inclusive. The corresponding proportion for women who had remarried after divorce was 6 per cent. Small sample numbers do not allow reliable estimates for individual years of divorce to be made.</p>

DfES both supports and challenges LEAs through monitoring and evaluating the implementation of EDPs. LEAs are visited by education advisers at least once a term; in addition EDPs are reviewed annually, and all LEAs are required to submit annually an update on targets for the coming school year for each school and the LEA as a whole, covering the targets listed in the EDP, and an evaluation report showing outcomes against targets at school and LEA level.</p>

	<p pid=".766W.3/1">While these are essentially operating matters for NATS my understanding is as follows.</p>
	<p pid=".766W.3/2">NATS computer systems have failed on three occasions in recent months&mdash;at West Drayton on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-27">27 March</phrase> with aggregate total delays to all affected aircraft of 88,000 minutes; West Drayton again on <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-10">10 April</phrase> with delays of 34,000 minutes; and at Swanwick on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-17">17 May</phrase> with delays of 82,000 minutes. NATS first action is to take immediate steps to reduce traffic volumes to levels that can be safely handled by the contingency arrangements in place. While this impacts on airline punctuality, the first priority must be to ensure safe operation.</p>

	<p pid=".771W.0/1">As outlined in its Strategic Plan, the SRA is currently advancing feasibility work on an upgrade of the Gospel Oak&mdash;Barking line and take future growth in freight path demand away from the Dalston&mdash;Highbury and Islington section of the East London Line extension. However, it is not expected that existing freight paths using the Dalston&mdash;Highbury and Islington section will be diverted away from the route. The freight operators hold access rights with the rail regulator for this section, and the ability to run electric traction and gauge-sensitive traffic on the route means these paths are unlikely to be released.</p>

We have also consulted on proposals for publishing updated and revised guidance on the provision of directional signs to tourist destinations in England. Other relevant guidance is published in Local Transport Notes, including LTN 1/94 on the design and use of direction signs, Circulars (Roads), and Advisory Leaflets.

	<p pid=".778W.0/1">We remain seriously concerned about the security situation in Pakistan and are appalled by the many incidents of terrorist violence against Pakistani and foreign nationals. The vicious attack on worshippers in an Islamabad church in March and the two recent bombings in Karachi were particularly horrifying. As soon as the news of the latest bombing reached us, I immediately issued a statement expressing our sympathies to the friends and relatives of those killed.</p>
	<p pid=".778W.0/2">We will continue to urge the Pakistani authorities to sustain their efforts to root out the terrorists and bring them to justice. The threat of war between India and Pakistan has further undermined the security environment in the region. We are encouraged by the recent steps taken by the Pakistani and Indian Governments to defuse tensions and will continue to urge them to move away from confrontation and towards dialogue.</p>

	<p pid=".780W.13/1">Together with their 1977 additional protocols, the four Geneva conventions of 1949 remain the cornerstone of international humanitarian law. The Fourth Geneva convention is the most lengthy, affording protection to civilian populations, which the experiences of the second world war showed to be singularly deficient in the international legal instruments adopted hitherto. The Government consider that the conventions have collectively stood the test of time and that, where properly applied, the Fourth convention and additional protocols offer a high degree of protection and serve to reduce the degree of suffering to which civilians may be exposed by conflict.</p>

Carrying out effective risk assessment on end-users before making the export licensing decision is the surest way of preventing arms from falling into the wrong hands. The Government remain committed to carrying out end-use monitoring in those circumstances where this will genuinely add value to our efforts to minimise the risk of misuse and diversion and where such monitoring is practicable. Our overseas posts have standing instructions to report on allegations of misuse of any UK-origin defence equipment and to take this into account during the export licensing process.</p>
	<p pid=".782W.2/3">Licensed production of arms overseas typically depends on the supply to the overseas producer of controlled component parts and technology by the company licensing the manufacture of its products. Any controlled equipment or technology exported from the UK to a production facility licensed under a commercial arrangement between a British company and an overseas company would be assessed on a case by case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. Our criteria clearly set out our commitment to take account of the risk that exports might be diverted to an undesirable end-user or re-exported under undesirable conditions.

	<p pid=".791W.8/1">The primary source of European Union support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the United Kingdom is the European Structural Funds. For the funding period 2000&ndash;06 the UK has been allocated approximately &pound;10 billion from these funds.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.8/2">The priorities for this funding were the subject of negotiation with the Commission which resulted in a number of agreed programming documents being approved during 2000 and 2001. Expenditure under the programmes can be undertaken until 2008.</p>
	<p pid=".791W.8/3">Since each document was drawn up and negotiated on the basis of the needs of the area concerned, the way in which support for SMEs is addressed varies between programmes. Although each programme includes a number of activities which involve either direct or indirect support to SMEs, the funding under the programmes is not disaggregated in a way that enables the amounts available or spent only for the benefit of SMEs to be easily identified, and it would involve disproportionate cost to provide this information.</p>

	<p pid=".791W.11/2">Nuclear materials on licensed civil nuclear sites and in transport are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements set, and monitored by, the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS). Nuclear power generators comply with the Nuclear Generating Station (Security) Regulations 1996, made under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. Other sites comply with Directions made under the Atomic Energy Act 1954 and the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. All civil nuclear material in the UK is subject to Euratom safeguards and to the terms of the UK/Euratom/IAEA Safeguards Agreement. Radioactive material, in accordance with the Radioactive Substances Act 1993, requires a certificate of registration from the Environment Agency or the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. The certificates impose responsibilities in respect of security and general management. In addition, the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 require employers to have in place appropriate accounting procedures. The regulatory bodies carry out regular programmes of inspections to ensure compliance and would not hesitate to take enforcement action were there a failure to comply with regulatory requirements.</p>

	<p pid=".793W.14/1" class="indent"><i>(a)</i> On <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-26">26 March</phrase> I launched the &pound;20 million First Phase of the Major Photovoltaics Demonstration Programme (MDP), which should result in 3,000 domestic roofs and 140 larger non-residential buildings receiving PV systems over the next three years. In addition, the Domestic and Large Scale Field Trails are already underway with a combined budget of around &pound;10 million. They should result in at least 500 domestic roofs and 15 large public buildings receiving PV installations. Subsequent phases of the MDP are dependent on the success of the First Phase and on sufficient funds being available.</p>
	<p pid=".793W.14/2" class="indent"><i>(b)</i> Solar Water Heating is a proven and reliable technology with an established but small market in the UK. We are considering support for it, along with other small-scale renewable technologies, under the &pound;10 million Community and Household Scheme, which is currently being designed. An announcement will be made in the autumn and grants are likely to be available by the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid=".793W.14/3" class="indent"><i>(c)</i> Little work has been done in the UK on interseasonal storage. While heat may be 'free' and the technology itself quite simple, the cost of the necessary equipment and infrastructure is the barrier to wider exploitation. We will, however, be keeping a watching brief on seasonal heat storage developments.</p>

	<p pid=".794W.5/1">The Department is responsible for the management of the interdepartmental programme for addressing the nuclear legacy in the Former Soviet Union (FSU), and Ministers and officials, plus those in other Government Departments are in regular discussion with their counterparts on a range of nuclear issues, not just the security of nuclear waste. The &pound;84 million programme to tackle nuclear problems in the Former Soviet Union was announced to Parliament in July 2000 to cover the period 2001 to 2004, and future funding levels will depend on the outcome of the current Spending Review. The programme has, as one of its priorities, nuclear safety and security issues in Russia. An important element of the UK programme is assisting Russia in tackling the nuclear waste problems associated with the 100+ decommissioned nuclear submarines in NW Russia; particularly the safe disposal and secure storage of spent nuclear fuel from such vessels. Current discussions with Russia centre on concluding a legal framework agreement covering liability, tax and access issues etc.</p>

One of the issues being considered is whether offences relating to internal trade should be made arrestable and the existing penalties increased.

The UK has put forward proposals for Africa on trade as part of a larger package of commitments on conflict, education, health, development assistance and debt. G8 members are committed to the objective of duty-free and quota-free access for all products originating from Least Developed Countries (LDCs) at the World Trade Organisation Doha Ministerial in November 2001. The UK sees it as imperative to move forward on integrating LDCs into the multilateral trading system and ensure they can harness the benefits of trade for poverty reduction. The forthcoming G8 summit in Kananaskis offers the opportunity to take forward these issues. The European Commission has estimated that developing country gains from a 50 per cent. cut in tariffs by both developed and developing countries would be in the order of $150 billion, around three times current aid flows.</p>

	<p pid=".810W.7/1">Our policy on directly-elected mayors is set out in the 2001 Local Government White Paper&mdash;Strong Local Leadership, Quality Public Services. Where local people think that a directly-elected mayor is right for their area, we think they should have the opportunity to vote for one. Councils have conducted extensive consultations with local people, who can also require a mayoral referendum by organising a petition signed by 5 per cent. of local electors or more.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.7/2">The Secretary of State has the power in certain circumstances to direct a council to hold a referendum, including where it appears that the council has failed to have due regard to the outcome of local consultations. I told the House on <phrase class="date" code="2002-03-07">7 March 2002</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2002-03-07.553"><i>Official Report,</i> column 553W</phrase>, that the Secretary of State did not intend to make any such directions until after we had completed a review of the regulations governing mayoral referendums, following the report &quot;Reinvigorating Democracy? Mayoral Referendums in 2001&quot; which the Electoral Commission published on <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-01">1 February 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.7/3">Since that time we have been putting in place proposals for a comprehensive performance management regime for councils, including independent assessment of their corporate performance. We are giving greater freedoms and flexibilities to all councils, with greater freedoms for high performing authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.7/4">Within this framework, we believe it will be right for each council to make and justify to local people its own judgments on the outcome of any consultation about proposals for a new constitution. Accordingly, in cases where, in our view, having regard to the outcome of the consultation, the judgment a council has reached does not appear to be justified, our approach will be not to intervene to direct a referendum.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.7/5">We had informed Birmingham, Bradford and Thurrock councils that the Secretary of State was minded to require them to hold a referendum, on the grounds that the councils failed to have due regard to the outcome of local consultations. These councils judged that the results of their consultation on new executive arrangements did not warrant giving local people the opportunity of a referendum. We took, and continue to take, the view that the consultation results would have justified a referendum.</p>
	<p pid=".810W.7/6">However, on the basis of the approach I am announcing today, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister does not propose to use his powers in these cases. We believe it is right that we make this clear to the councils today in order to remove uncertainty for them.</p>

	<p pid=".813W.0/1">The Secretary of State published proposed changes to draft Regional Planning Guidance for the north-west on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-20">20 May 2002</phrase>. These changes reduced the annual rate of housing provision form that in draft RPG by 15 per cent. The annualised average rate of housing provision for the region is 12,790 dwellings. The annualised figures apply to the period up to 2006 reflecting the 'plan, monitor and manage' approach set out in PPG3 which moves away from the previous 'predict and provide' approach. The proposed changes give weight to avoiding any premature release of greenfield land which would undermine attempts to promote the use of recycled land and the redevelopment of existing unfit and unpopular housing. Tackling low demand and abandonment lies at the heart of the revised strategy. The Secretary of State, in the consultation, on the proposed changes has requested views on whether the changes are sufficient to prevent the unnecessary release of greenfield land or whether there should be further changes to reflect the recommendations made by the Transport, Local Government and Regions Committee in its report on empty homes that no new planning permissions should be granted for greenfield sites.</p>

This varies from 90 per cent. in Liverpool/Manchester/Salford to 50 per cent. in Cumbria. Further investment will be needed to meet these challenging targets and the Northwest Development Agency's strategies will need to be integrated with those of local planning and housing authorities to regenerate urban areas with mixed and balanced communities.</p>

A key part of the strategy is to achieve the renaissance of urban areas by encouraging balanced economic growth and regeneration in a sustainable way. The proposed reduction in the annual rate of housing provision, coupled with an increase in the proportion of housing provided on previously used land from 65 per cent. to 70 per cent. are aimed at delivering this, while avoiding the premature release of greenfield land and promoting the use of recycled land, including the redevelopment of existing areas of unfit and unpopular housing; while supporting the Northwest Development Agency's aim of encouraging more employment in the NW region.</p>

	<p pid=".824W.3/1">The requested information is not held centrally. Universities are responsible for setting their own level of tuition fees for overseas students. Overseas fees are generally around &pound;6,000 to &pound;8,000 per year for an undergraduate course but can range from &pound;4,000 to &pound;17,000 per year depending on the institution, the level and the type of course. The UK Government and other UK organisations provide a number of scholarships and awards to help international students study in the UK. For example, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is providing up to 1,000 extra postgraduate and research places through the Chevening scholarship scheme. Universities also have flexibility in dealing with individual students' circumstances and waive or reduce fees where they consider appropriate: a number of universities are currently waiving overseas fees for students from Zimbabwe.</p>

	<p pid=".826W.2/3">Local councils also monitor the results of inspections of private training providers. It is crucial that the highest standards are achieved and maintained and, where this is not so, the councils will take tough action to improve or replace the provision.</p>

The nature of the provision must be responsive to the demands of what can be a changing medical condition.</p>

	<p pid=".834W.3/1">Data from NIRS fed into two regular pensions related national statistics publications issued by the Department. The publications were &quot;Contributions and Qualifying Years for Retirement Pension&quot; and &quot;Second Tier Pension Provision&quot;. The most recent published data relates to the financial year 1995&ndash;96. NIRS2 is now able to produce the data required for the Department's statistical publications and departmental analysts are currently working on processing and investigating NIRS2 data covering the financial years up to 2000&ndash;01.

	<p pid=".834W.9/1">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) report on Sefton council was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.9/2">The BFI reports that the council has actively demonstrated a strong commitment towards raising standards within its benefits service and has many areas of good practice. The report also shows that Sefton has some scope for making improvements.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.9/3">The report notes that a single housing benefit and council tax benefit claim form had been introduced and that this was broadly in line with BFI's national model.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.9/4">Inspectors found that 94 per cent. of the claims examined had been assessed accurately and that the supporting evidence had been considered. A weakness was identified in the evidence gathered about earnings and capital.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.9/5">There were some delays in processing renewal claims and inadequate checks on claims that were not renewed. BFI also found that the council did not have a benefit overpayment policy and lacked the necessary management controls to be assured that overpayments were dealt with correctly.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.9/6">The council has taken positive steps to counter benefit fraud. The performance of the counter fraud team was found to be effective, systematically achieving successful prosecutions although the council had not offered administrative penalties or issued a caution since introducing its prosecution policy. Investigation work might also be targeted more effectively to increase the number of benefit frauds detected.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.9/7">Following a best value review by the council of its benefits services, elected Members had approved new investment to increase the number of staff allocated to benefits and improvement to IT.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.9/8">Sefton administered some &pound;73 million in housing benefits in 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.9/9">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.9/10">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.</p>
	<p pid=".834W.9/11">A BFI best value inspection report on the benefits service is also published today and has been placed in the Library. It examines the service from a customer service and value for money point of view. For best value, inspectors found that Sefton council provided a fair or one star benefits service, which would probably improve to be equal to that of high-performing authorities.</p>

Friend the Home Secretary has noted carefully the findings of the report carried out by the Police Foundation on the community's response to the Lambeth cannabis policing experiment. He recognises that while the report records high levels of support for the scheme, for many that support is conditional upon police officers spending more time dealing effectively with serious crime in the borough.</p>

	<p pid=".843W.5/1">The British digital passport is one of the most secure in the world. It is machine readable and complies with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standard for passports. It contains a digital photograph and a digital signature of the holder, and the personal identification page is protected by a clear plastic laminate incorporating a holographic device which further protects the portrait. The personal identification page is also protected by a series of laser perforations. The use of special paper and printing techniques provide added security. The security features in the passport document remain under continuing review in case a feature is compromised by fraudsters.</p>
	<p pid=".843W.5/2">The United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) is considering the use of biometrics (fingerprints, iris, facial recognition) in passport books and cards both to further enhance security and to prevent the issue of multiple passports in the same identity. It is keeping in close touch with work being undertaken by ICAO post September 11 to develop an international standard for the use of biometrics in passports. In addition and in support of the concept of an entitlement card the UKPS has commissioned a study from the National Physical laboratory on the application of biometrics in an entitlement scheme. This study will look at iris, fingerprint and facial recognition templates and their application within large databases.</p>
	<p pid=".843W.5/3">The issue of visas at diplomatic posts overseas, is the responsibility of UKvisas, a joint Home Office and Foreign and Commonwealth Office Department. Visas are issued on specifically designed vignettes that contain various security features in a common European Union format. A revised European Union common format vignette is being designed and should be brought into use in April 2004. The new format will incorporate space for a digital photograph of the applicant. There are no plans to use biometrics as part of the visa process but UKvisas is monitoring developments in this area including the Immigration Service trial at Heathrow.</p>

GP practices in England are being encouraged to take up broadband services. Former health authorities were each invited to nominate two practices for centrally funded broadband connections. To date funding has been made available to 40 practices.</p>

	<p pid=".851W.2/1">The UK Biobank represents a database that can be used to investigate the combined effects of genotype, lifestyle and environmental exposures on the risk of developing the common multi-factorial diseases of later life. Policies on the ownership of intellectual property arising from research using the data contained within the UK Biobank have yet to be finalised, and are the subject of on-going consultation. Current thinking is that ownership of such intellectual property will reside with the organisation that hosts the workers undertaking the research. A key issue to be resolved is whether either the funding bodies or the hub should seek to retain any control over the intellectual property and whether this would be acceptable to the organisations hosting such research. A condition of using the UK Biobank is that, after a short period of time to allow for the preparation of publications or filing of patent applications, all results generated from analysis of the samples or data held must be added to the central databases and hence be made available to other researchers.</p>

	<p pid=".857W.8/2">Glaxo SmithKline has confirmed that based on still available information that it is highly probable that batches 3741 and 3732 were issued in this country. Unfortunately they no longer have details of the quantities of vaccine or the places where the vaccine was supplied. Since vaccines were not centrally purchased and distributed at that time, there are not central records either. Information on individuals who received these vaccines will only exist if the general practitioner at the time of the immunisation recorded the batch number, and the patients' notes are still available.</p>
	<p pid=".857W.8/3">At the time that batches 3741 and 3732 were issued, the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) only routinely assayed potency of pertussis vaccine using the Kenrick test. The mouse weight gain test, that was suggested to give high toxicity results for the two batches used in Eire, was not used in the release tests for pertussis vaccine by NIBSC at that time.</p>

	<p pid=".860W.2/2">The expansion plans for cardiac units in England are part of the comprehensive programme of development in cardiac services set out in the national service framework for coronary heart disease. The expansion programme is being pursued to ensure that heart patients are treated according to need rather than location. Consequently, investment is being focused on those parts of England with historically low capacity in cardiac surgery. Capital developments are taking place in Papworth, Wolverhampton, South Tees, Bristol, Sheffield, Blackpool, Liverpool, Central Manchester, South Manchester, Leeds and Plymouth. These developments will be completed in 2006. Any further expansion in capacity will be considered in terms of its ability to deliver the standards of care set out in the national service framework. In addition, from <phrase class="date" code="2002-07-01">1 July</phrase>, patients who have been waiting for more than six months for a heart operation will be offered the choice of treatment elsewhere, which will enable more patients to be treated more quickly.</p>

	<p pid=".862W.0/2">A study sponsored by the Macular Disease Society in 2001 estimated that there were 182,000 people with age-related macular degeneration with a best eye visual acuity below that judged appropriate for certification as blind or partially sighted. It is estimated that 10 to 15 per cent. of those will have the &quot;wet&quot; type of the condition, for which photodynamic therapy is intended as a treatment. However, it is not possible to say how many of those are affected in only one eye.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.0/3">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) published their final appraisal determination (FAD) on the use of photodynamic therapy as a treatment for age-related macular degeneration on <phrase class="date" code="2002-06-12">12 June</phrase>. The appraisal process has not yet been completed and NICE have not made any recommendations on photodynamic therapy. NICE are seeking the views of consultees during the appeal process and will consider carefully any points that are made.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.0/4">NICE's recommendations may change as a result of the appeal process; it would therefore be inappropriate for the Department to comment at this time. The Department will consider the implications of the final NICE guidance. The earliest guidance could be available to the NHS is at the end of July or early August, providing there are no appeals.</p>
	<p pid=".862W.0/5">The NICE guidance on photodynamic therapy will not have implications for the treatment of cataracts, glaucoma or diabetic retinopathy.</p>
