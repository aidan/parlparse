	<p pid=".1287W.6/1">New European Community legislation strengthening the animal health controls and certification requirements for the importation of bees from third countries came into effect across the Community on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-27">27 December 2003</phrase>. Its aim, in particular, is to protect the EU bee population from exotic pests and diseases.</p>
	<p pid=".1287W.6/2">The new import controls include the requirement that consignments of queen honey bees will only be allowed into the Community from those third countries that have demonstrated the veterinary competence to certify bees for export, and provided that the notifiable diseases of bees in the EU&mdash;American foul brood, the small hive beetle and tropilaelaps mite&mdash;are also confirmed as notifiable throughout the exporting country. The specified third countries are listed in Part 1 to the Annex of Council Decision 79/542 and include the USA and Australia.</p>
	<p pid=".1287W.6/3">To date, only Australia, New Zealand and Argentina have demonstrated to us that they are able to comply with the conditions provided in the legislation, and imports of queens from these countries are permitted. However, in the case of Hawaii, while it is our opinion that it does have a high bee health status, and, indeed, we have until recently permitted imports of queen bees from there, it is nevertheless a territory of the USA. The EU legislation is clear in its intention, and it is our understanding that the three notifiable diseases mentioned above are not yet notifiable throughout the USA as a whole. The Commission has stated that it is not prepared to treat Hawaii as separate from the rest of the USA for this purpose. We are therefore not free to authorise the importation of queens bees from Hawaii until the USA has demonstrated equivalence with the EU.</p>

	<p pid=".1288W.2/1">The UK Government have made no representation to the European Commission about the impact of the proposed batteries Directive on batteries used in hearing aids. This is because proposals issued by the Commission for a new batteries Directive do not contain any requirement prohibiting the sale of batteries used in hearing aids.</p>
	<p pid=".1288W.2/2">However, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted during their first reading of the proposal on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-20">20 April</phrase> in favour of an amendment, setting limit values for prohibiting the sale of all batteries that contain more than 5ppm of mercury by weight. The Government understand that because hearing aid batteries may contain more than 5ppm of mercury and 40ppm of lead, by weight, in a zinc air hearing aid battery, there is now concern as to a possible ban. However, the Government have not, as yet, heard from any organisations or manufacturers that may be affected, nor have they heard the reaction of the European Commission to the amendment</p>
	<p pid=".1288W.2/3">It should also be noted that the European Parliament also voted on an amendment to exclude from the controls of the new Directive, batteries and accumulators placed in medical devices; namely, those designed to maintain vital functions, where uninterrupted functioning is essential and the batteries and accumulators can be removed only by qualified personnel. If this amendment were accepted, it would not be clear whether those hearing aid batteries containing more than 5ppm of mercury and 40ppm of lead would be excluded.</p>
	<p pid=".1288W.2/4">HMG believes that the inconsistency between these two amendments is likely to be addressed by the European Parliament in its second reading. If the threshold limits proposed remained in the Directive and led to the prohibition of batteries contained in hearing aids, or indeed batteries contained in other medical devices, this would be opposed by the UK and, we believe, by other member states also.</p>

However, the only exceptions from the ban on the routine on-farm burial or burning of animal by-products, in the UK, would be for remote areas (parts of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, the Scilly Isles and Lundy Island) and during outbreaks of notifiable disease if there were a lack of capacity at rendering plants and incinerators, or if transport of the carcases would spread disease.</p>

Stakeholders have contributed to an action plan in response to the Foresight Report which seeks to build upon this shared understanding and provide a channel through which actions across and outside Government can be co-ordinated. I have agreed that the group of key stakeholders which I chair will meet in one year to monitor progress and consider the need for other actions.</p>

Monitoring of leachate, ground and surface waters is required to provide, amongst other things, that leachate controls are preventing pollution of the environment and, where unacceptable risks are identified, the need for measures to prevent, reduce or remove potential leachate pollution are assessed.</p>

	<p pid=".1292W.5/1">There are currently two sets of Regulations that cover packaging in the UK, both of which encourage producers (including retailers) to minimise packaging. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) are intended to increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. The amount of packaging waste producers have to recover and recycle is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle. Therefore, businesses can save money if they reduce the amount of packaging they handle. The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 place a number of requirements on all packaging placed on the market in the UK, including a requirement that   packaging should be manufactured so that the packaging volume and weight are limited to the minimum adequate amount to maintain the necessary level of safety, hygiene and acceptance for the packed product and for the consumer.</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.5/2">Both Regulations have actually led to decreases in packaging used around products. For example, less material is used now to make a plastic container than was used a few years ago. However, more still needs to be done to reduce the amount of packaging that is actually produced in the first place. I have asked the Advisory Committee on Packaging to work with industry to find solutions to this problem and to let me   have recommendations for ways of encouraging businesses to further reduce the amount of packaging they use.</p>
	<p pid=".1292W.5/3">Although legislation is a way of reducing packaging and increasing recycling, we would also encourage consumers to play a part. For example, if consumers made a point of choosing goods that are not heavily packaged, or bought 'loose' food rather than pre-packaged, or used their own shopping bags or boxes, manufacturers would be more inclined to reduce the quantity of packaging on their products.</p>

	<p pid=".1293W.5/1">The Environment Agency's Environmental Protection Operator and Pollution Risk Appraisal (EP OPRA) charging scheme is a risk based assessment system, which closely links regulatory effort to environmental risk. EP OPRA was approved by the Government after consultation with industry and is based on four elements: emissions, location, complexity and operator performance. The scheme allows the Agency to recover the costs of carrying out its statutory responsibilities under the Pollution Prevention and Control regime. In line with the &quot;polluter pays principle&quot;, well run companies with low potential risk to the environment are charged less than poorly run ones with a high potential to pollute. The Agency must adhere to the Treasury's Fees and Charges Guide, which describes how charges for statutory services should be calculated. The Agency is due to publish a 'transparency document' shortly, which will provide more detail on the Agency's costs; this document will be subject to the approval of the Environment Protection Charges Review Group, which includes industry representatives.</p>

	<p pid=".1298W.8/1">Since 1991, The Environment Agency and its predecessor body (The National Rivers Authority) have only had one report (<phrase class="date" code="1993-10-12">12 October 1993</phrase> Councillor Peter Wexham, Borough of Southend-On-Sea) of a suspected breakout of landfill leachate in the area of Two Tree Island. The investigating officer at the time of the incident indicates in the file note, that he was unable to substantiate the report, as he could not pin point the exact location of the suspected leachate breakout.</p>

	<p pid=".1299W.12/1">A change to the standing orders of the House would not be sufficient to allow amendment of statutory instruments: an amendment of each enabling power would be needed.</p>
	<p pid=".1299W.12/2">In its 1996 report on Delegated Legislation, the Procedure Committee considered whether statutory instruments should be made amendable and recommended against, on the grounds that it would involve excessive complication, run directly counter to the past intentions of Parliament, and would frustrate the very purpose for which delegated powers were given.</p>
	<p pid=".1299W.12/3">Very little legislation currently in force allows for secondary legislation to be amended. An exception is proposed to be made in respect of emergency regulations under the current Civil Contingencies Bill. This reflects the exceptionally broad scope of the delegated powers conferred by the Bill and the circumstances in which those powers are likely to be exercised. A similar exception is made in the Emergency Powers Act 1920, which the Bill supersedes.</p>

	<p pid=".1304W.5/1">The available information relates to local authority areas. In the Sefton local authority area there were 10 deaths in road accidents in 1997 and 10 deaths in 2002, the latest year for which information is available. The number of serious injuries fell by 12 percent from 100 in 1997 to 88 in 2002. Estimates on the basis of parliamentary constituencies will become available in the summer, where I shall write to my hon Friend with figures for Bootle and place a copy of my letter in the Libraries of the House.</p>

	<p pid=".1307W.2/1">In February 2004 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated a total of 324,000 Liberian refugees in neighbouring countries; 147,000 in Guinea, 68,000 in Sierra Leone, 67,000 in Ivory Coast, and 42,000 in Ghana. It has since been estimated that up to 17,000 refugees have returned spontaneously to Liberia from these countries. With improved conditions, services and stability inside Liberia, UNHCR expects up to 100,000 of the remaining refugees to return by the end of 2004, and the remainder in 2005. DFID has assisted with the provision of services and support to refugees and internally displaced persons by providing &pound;10.6m in humanitarian support in 2003 and 2004. DFID has committed a further &pound;6m for Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration, as an additional contribution to post-conflict recovery and the creation of conditions for a return to peace and stability.</p>

	<p pid=".1308W.0/1">The best way of giving young people an alternative to violence and extremism is to ensure they have a full and effective education with good prospects of future employment. DFID's support to the United Nations Relief Works Agency (UNRWA) for which planned expenditure over the next three years is about &pound;15 million per calendar year, provides substantial support to education and emergency employment creation. Over two thirds of UNRWA's annual budget is allocated for the education needs of Palestinian children in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. DFID provides project funding for UNRWA to help improve the school management by involving the local community. Planned funding is about &pound;500,000 per year for the next two years.</p>
	<p pid=".1308W.0/2">DFID recently agreed a &pound;7 million contribution to the World Bank's Public Financial Management Reform Trust Fund to support the Palestinian Authority. This will have an indirect impact on supporting young people, as the money will help maintain public services including education and keep PA employees at work by paying salaries.</p>

	<p pid=".1308W.3/1">DFID has not commissioned any such research but monitors the level of disruption to education through regular contact with our Palestinian and international partners including the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Education, United Nations Relief Works Agency and Non Governmental Organisations. Many pupils and teachers now face difficulty in getting to school, which in effect reduces the number of full school days. There is also a reduction in the financial resources available for education as a result of the severe downturn of the Palestinian economy. The high priority given to education by Palestinian communities means that there has been no increase in the very low dropout rate, and only a small reduction in the high rate of enrolment of pupils in schools. The disruptions and violence nevertheless have a high psychological impact on students and on student achievement.</p>

	<p pid=".1309W.2/1">The statement by South Africa's Deputy President Zuma's office, highlighted the extent of food insecurity and vulnerability in the Southern African region. At the <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-15">15 May</phrase> Southern African Development Community Summit on Agriculture and Food Security in Dar es Salaam the South African government announced a contribution of R 100 million (approximately &pound;8 million) to help meet these needs. DFID welcomes this and believe that South Africa has an important role to play in improving food security in the region, including as a major food producer and grain market.</p>
	<p pid=".1309W.2/2">Food security is a continuing challenge in Southern Africa. At the peak of the recent humanitarian crisis, the United Nations assessed that 15.2 million people (26 per cent. of the population) were in need of food aid. DFID spent over &pound;88 million in 2002&ndash;03 in response to the Southern African food crisis (in Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Swaziland and Lesotho). Acute needs appear to be lessening now as a result of improved harvests in many but not all countries, However, chronic poverty appears to have increased and more communities are now likely to become destitute as a result of variable rainfall or other shocks such as illness or loss of work.</p>
	<p pid=".1309W.2/3">The impact of HIV/AIDS has placed a major burden on households and increased their vulnerability. Increasing food production is necessary but not sufficient, since many people do not grow their own food, and lack resources to buy food even if it is available. Increasing employment, land reform, better infrastructure and access to markets, and more private sector investment are also required.</p>

DFID is also working on plans to support capacity building on safety, security and accessible justice; on local government; and on public financial management.

	<p pid=".1311W.3/1">The Government of Zimbabwe's recent decision to cancel the crop assessment mission has been discussed extensively in numerous meetings in Harare involving DFID Zimbabwe, the British embassy, United Nations agencies, and other donors. Officials from DFID and the embassy, as well as the UN, have expressed concerns to the Zimbabwean Government. DFID and embassy officials have also discussed this issue with South African officials.</p>
	<p pid=".1311W.3/2">The Government of Zimbabwe's cancellation of the mission means that there is no internationally accepted estimate of Zimbabwe's harvest, and their decision not to request international food aid means that normal advance planning processes will not take place. The Zimbabwean claim that they have produced 2.4 million metric tonnes (MT) of maize this year is simply not credible. The actual harvest is probably below 1.2 million MT, compared to a requirement of about 1.8 million MT. Given the significant shortage of foreign exchange in Zimbabwe, it will be difficult for the Government to import enough grain to fill this gap. Many poor and vulnerable people may therefore go very hungry, if not worse, as a result of these decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".1311W.3/3">DFID Zimbabwe, in collaboration with other major donors and the UN system, will monitor the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe closely, while continuing to provide targeted food assistance and other humanitarian support to the most vulnerable sections of Zimbabwe society through NGO programmes which DFID is able to fund directly. DFID will press the Government of Zimbabwe to recognize the humanitarian need within the country and to collaborate with the international community to provide an apolitical and co-ordinated response.</p>

	<p pid=".1312W.2/1">The Government of Zimbabwe have decided to cancel the joint crop assessment mission with the UN which had started in late April.

However, the Commission is currently establishing a research project to identify the extent and nature of under-registration in Great Britain, as well as reviewing the operation and impact of rolling registration since 2001.</p>

	<p pid=".1318W.3/1">Since the Children Act 1989 was implemented in 1991, &quot;custody&quot; of a child has ceased to be a concept in the law of England and Wales. Under Section 8 of the Children Act 1989 a court has the power to make a residence order, being</p>
	<p pid=".1318W.3/2" class="indent">&quot;an order settling the arrangements to be made as to the person with whom a child is to live&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1318W.3/3">Section 1(5) of the Children Act provides that a court cannot make an order unless it considers that doing so would be better for the child than making no order at all (&quot;the no order principle&quot;). It follows that, if parents are agreed on the arrangements for their child, then it may be that the matter never comes before a court, or that, if it is before a court, the court considers that it is better for the child that no order be made. In other cases, such as those where there is no agreement between the parents, it is open to the court to make a residence order, if it considers that it is in the best interests of the child to do so. Such an order might be a &quot;shared residence&quot; order (so that the child lives with both parents, at different times, usually spending around half his time with each). The following table shows the latest available judicial statistics (2002). During 2002 a total of 103,191 section 8 orders were made in private law.</p>

	<p pid=".1327W.3/11" class="italic">Criteria</p>
	<p pid=".1327W.3/12">The Local Network Fund and Children's Fund are key elements of the Government's agenda to improve outcomes and opportunities for disadvantaged children and young people. The two programmes have different criteria and delivery arrangements:</p>
	<p pid=".1327W.3/13">The Children's Fund targets 5 to 13-year-olds and aims to develop local preventive strategies for children and young people at risk from social exclusion. The Fund contributes to the development of the wider Local Preventative Strategy which the Government have asked each local authority to develop for 0 to 19-year-olds. Local Children's Fund partnership boards, covering unitary authorities, decide local priorities for preventive services and allocate funds through direct commissioning or by inviting applications.</p>
	<p pid=".1327W.3/14">The Local Network Fund targets 0 to 19-year-olds and is delivered through the voluntary sector. Grants up to &pound;7,000 and capacity building support are available to small community groups working with children and young people facing disadvantage. Applicants can bid for funding under one of four themes: economic disadvantage, isolation and access, aspirations and experiences and children's voices. Decisions on funding are taken by panels of local people with experience of the issues faced by young people in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".1327W.3/15" class="italic">Audit</p>
	<p pid=".1327W.3/16">The Children's Fund, in the North East is administered through 12 programmes each with their own partnership board, lead agency and accountable body. Partnership boards comprise voluntary organisations, statutory agencies as well as members of the local community. The lead agency is responsible for the operational direction of the programme while the accountable body ensures the financial probity of the Fund.</p>
	<p pid=".1327W.3/17">The Local Network Fund is delivered through a   network of 57 local Funds run by voluntary organisations with grant-making and community development experience. Local Funds report, quarterly, to DFES on financial and service performance. DFES also undertakes regular monitoring visits to Funds to assess and improve performance and undertakes an annual financial and performance audit of the Fund.</p>

We understand that an established Working Party, set up by the Admissions Forum, has agreed to look into the issue, and to consider strategies for dealing with the current situation.</p>

	<p pid=".1333W.2/1">The Targeted Capital Fund (TCF) is a relatively limited programme and is intended to support projects which contribute directly to meeting the Government's educational priorities, and which might not otherwise be supported through formulaic allocations to local education authorities (LEAs) and schools.</p>
	<p pid=".1333W.2/2">The key criteria for 2004&ndash;05 TCF bids focused on schools causing concern, curriculum improvements, expansion of popular and successful schools, surplus place removal, improved special education needs provision and innovative use of buildings. Full details of the bid criteria for 2004&ndash;05 are listed in the guidance, a copy of which can be found in the Library. Bids for TCF projects are made to the Department by LEAs on behalf of their schools.</p>
	<p pid=".1333W.2/3">We hope to announce shortly the arrangements for the TCF for 2005&ndash;06. For the 2004&ndash;05 TCF round, we received 202 LEA bids covering 373 schools in total, and 199 voluntary aided school bids covering 223 schools. For the West Midlands region, 39 bids were made, nine of which were successful.</p>

	<p pid=".1335W.5/2">I welcome the findings of the Paladin report which was published on Monday. Operation Paladin has been a valuable exercise in determining the nature of child migration to the UK. We will work with the Home Office and other organisations in considering the report and its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid=".1335W.5/3">It is of course for local authorities to decide how best to provide support and services for children in need in its area, including those who are the victims of trafficking. When a child enters the country alone and claims asylum or there are concerns that he or she may have been trafficked, the immigration service should immediately refer the child to the relevant local authority's social services department. The social services department will undertake a needs assessment and will provide services in the light of the outcome of that assessment. These services should be tailored to the individual needs of the child, just as they should be for any child in need.</p>

With regard to royalty payments the Agency has attempted to ensure that grants it has made which have a commercial aspect (such as to publishers who will sell books printed with Agency assistance) contain a 'claw back' clause, whereby a percentage of the income from such sales is returned to the Agency.

	<p pid=".1349W.2/1">136 guns have been issued to those units designated Light Gun Units, as shown in the table.</p>
	<p pid=".1349W.2/2">Three TA units, 103 Regiment, 100 Regiment and the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) are issued with guns fitted with the Automatic Pointing System. HAC have their full complement of four guns. 103 Regiment have 12 guns, but are established for 18, and therefore operate with 3x4 gun batteries. 100 Regiment have 14 guns, but are established for 18, and therefore operate with 2x5 gun batteries and 1x4 gun battery. The number of guns issued is determined by the number of Automatic Pointing Systems (APS) available. However, although 100 Regiment and 103 Regiment are short of the establishment, the compliment is considered sufficient to meet their requirements. Other TA Units, listed at Serials 14 to 17 in the table, hold Saluting Guns only. Saluting Guns do not require sights to be fitted.</p>
	<p pid=".1349W.2/3">The APS has been fitted to 112 guns as shown in the table. Those guns without APS fitted are used either for classroom purposes or for saluting only. Dial sights are no longer in service.</p>

The Civilian Police Division was granted the greatest increase, followed by the military division and then the civilian departments. Nearly all of the new posts are now filled. OIOS believe that the quality of personnel recruited has been satisfactory, and argue that reform has enhanced the UN's capacity to tackle complex, multidimensional peacekeeping missions.</p>

	<p pid=".1355W.2/1">We have been at the forefront of the   push for the prompt implementation of the recommendations contained in the Brahimi report of July 2000 on peacekeeping reform. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister underlined our commitment at the Millennium Summit 2000. Under the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, run jointly by the FCO, MOD and DfID, we have developed a programme of co-operation and assistance designed to enhance the peacekeeping and peace-building capacity of the UN, and to strengthen the capacity and effectiveness of countries contributing troops and civilian police to UN peacekeeping missions. In addition to bilateral work with the UN and other interested parties, the Government are working multilaterally in the UN and the EU to maintain peacekeeping reform on the international agenda. The Secretary-General's High Level Panel on threats, challenges and change, which we have welcomed, may recommend changes to the peacekeeping structures within the UN. The Panel's report will be published later this year.</p>

However, human rights violations have been highlighted by successive highly critical UK and EU co-sponsored UN Resolutions, most recently at the UN Commission on Human Rights on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-21">21 April 2004</phrase>. This referred to the violations of human rights suffered in particular by persons belonging to ethnic minorities, women and children, especially in non-ceasefire areas and the situation of the large number of internally displaced persons as well as the flow of refugees to neighbouring countries. It emphasised the obligations of Burma under international law to pursue through dialogue and peaceful means the immediate suspension and permanent end of conflict with all ethnic groups in the country and to conclude a ceasefire agreement with the Karen National Union (KNU). The Burmese regime knows how critical we are of their Human Rights abuses.</p>
	<p pid=".1356W.8/2">We are, however, encouraged by the recent verbal ceasefire agreement between the regime and the KNU and hope that this will lead to a lasting peace settlement.</p>

We are aware of a consistent pattern of serious violations over many years, particularly against the ethnic groups. These have been highlighted in successive EU co-sponsored resolutions on Burma in the   United Nations General Assembly and UK co-sponsored resolutions in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. But we do not consider that the atrocities constitute &quot;war crimes&quot; and &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;, which have specific definitions under international law.

	<p pid=".1359W.3/1">The draft EU Constitutional Treaty proposed by the Convention on the Future of Europe has no legal status. The European Council decided in June last year that it was a good basis for starting negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference. The Italian and subsequently Irish Presidencies of the EU have proposed changes to the EU Constititonal Treaty as drafted by the Convention, after consulting with all Member States. Their proposals (summarised in the most recent Irish papers CIG 70/04, 73/04, 75/04, 76/04 and 77/04) have been deposited in the Library of the House and are available from the Presidency website (www.eu2004.ie). They are the subject of discussion in the Intergovernmental Conference. The Government has taken part fully in these discussions. Nothing is finally agreed until everything is agreed. The EU Constitutional Treaty, like any new EU Treaty, can only be agreed by the common &quot;accord of all Member States.</p>

	<p pid=".1360W.2/1">The Government of Honduras has acknowledged publicly that it has a serious problem with gang-related lawlessness. Our embassy in Guatemala, responsible for our relations with Honduras, and officials in London have been monitoring the measures taken by the Honduran Government to tackle this problem, including legislation prohibiting gang membership. Since the introduction of this new law, there has been a reported reduction in gang violence. But concern has been expressed by some NGOs and members of civil society that the new legislation, which resulted in mass   arrests of gang members and those suspected of being gang members, infringed human rights. The Government of Honduras has responded to this criticism by undertaking to provide training and rehabilitation schemes for those either in prison or wishing to leave the gangs. We have made clear to the Government of Honduras, bilaterally and in the company of our EU partners, the importance we attach to respect for human rights. I raised human rights, particularly those in respect of children, with Honduran Security Minister Oscar Alvarez, during his recent visit to the UK.</p>

The only exception to this is that 5 per cent. of proceeds from oil should be deposited into the United Nations Compensation Fund for Kuwait established in accordance with UNSCR 687 of 1991 and subsequent relevant resolutions. As outlined in UNSCR 1483, this latter requirement will be binding on an internationally recognised sovereign government of Iraq unless that government and the Governing Council of the United Nations Compensation Commission decide otherwise. Neither the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), Iraqi Government institutions, nor any other parties deduct costs from oil revenues. The CPA meets its own costs from coalition funding, and Iraqi Government Departments and agencies are funded through the Iraqi budget.</p>

	<p pid=".1366W.10/1">Information on the number of offenders is not available from magistrates courts systems. The latest Home Office statistics available, for the 2002 calendar year, showed that 970,400 offenders were fined by magistrates courts.</p>
	<p pid=".1366W.10/2">A national payment rate of 76 per cent. was achieved in the last quarter of 2003&ndash;04. The full year outturn stood at 74 per cent. The payment rate in 2001&ndash;02 was 59 per cent. and 55 per cent. in 2002&ndash;03. These figures are not comparable with the 2003&ndash;04 data due to collection and calculation changes. In 2003&ndash;04 the payment rate was revised so that it focused clearly on fines and excluded confiscation orders, civil and family moneys and cancelled fines.</p>

	<p pid=".1369W.5/1">Each primary care trust (PCT) has a duty to meet all reasonable requirements to provide or secure national health service primary medical services in its area. For their part, general practitioner practices have discretion to accept a failed asylum seeker as a registered NHS patient. However, since the NHS is intended for those living lawfully in the United Kingdom, existing guidance discourages GP practices from accepting failed asylum seekers as patients.</p>
	<p pid=".1369W.5/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-14">14 May</phrase>, I issued a consultation document setting out proposals to clarify eligibility and introduce charges for those overseas visitors, including failed asylum seekers, who would then be ineligible for free routine NHS primary medical treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".1369W.5/3">Under these proposals, practices would continue to be required to provide treatment, including potentially for asthma, which they regard as emergency or immediately necessary to anyone who needs it. Where a practice provides such treatment to an individual not registered at the practice, it notifies the PCT in writing of the clinical care given.</p>
	<p pid=".1369W.5/4">In secondary care, if an asylum seeker has been in the UK for more than 12 months when their asylum claim is finally rejected, any course of treatment already under way at the time of the final rejection remains free of charge. Furthermore, certain secondary care services are exempt from charges for everyone, irrespective of their immigration status. This includes treatment provided solely in an accident and emergency department, treatment of certain specified communicable diseases and compulsory mental health treatment. In the case of services which relate to HIV/AIDS only the initial test and counselling is free. Influenza immunisations are given to those who are in at risk categories. These categories include anyone over six months with respiratory disease (including asthma), chronic heart disease, renal disease, diabetes and immunosuppressant or staying or living in long stay facilities, or who at the GP's discretion needs to have a flu jab on the basis of clinical need.</p>

Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.</p>

	<p pid=".1380W.5/20">1. This information was obtained from the prescribing analysis and cost (PACT) system, which covers prescriptions prescribed by GP practices in England and dispensed in the community. Prescriptions written within a GP practice but dispensed outside the PCT will be included in the PCT in which the GP practice is based. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions written in hospitals/clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data.</p>
	<p pid=".1380W.5/21">2. Prescriptions are written on a prescription form. Each single item written on the form is counted as a prescription item.</p>
	<p pid=".1380W.5/22">3. With effect from October 2002, the prescription pricing analysis (PPA) information systems were changed to reflect Shifting the Balance of Power. Shifting the Balance of Power saw the creation of SHAs and PCTs, which shifted the balance of power within the national health services away from Whitehall and towards front line clinical staff and their patients. Due to Shifting the Balance of Power, from the October 2002 release of ePACT.net, PCT data reflects the organisational structures in place on <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-01">1 October 2002</phrase>. This was true for all 36 months historic data on ePACT.net, so data on ePACT.net prior to October 2002 was also amended retrospectively so that it was in line with Shifting the Balance of Power.</p>

	<p pid=".1383W.2/2">General IT skills are now an everyday element for any public service and service based organisation, including the NHS, and provision for this will form part of the   normal continuing professional and personal development for all NHS staff within existing budgets and training plans. The European computer driving licence is helping to improve general skills across the NHS. The move to e-learning and development and the NHS university will both create more demand for computer and online skills and provide more channels and solutions to bring training to people.</p>
	<p pid=".1383W.2/3">As we complete the more detailed plans for each geographical cluster and local service provider contract we will map out the extent of IT support for clinical practice and patient care to support the implementation of the NPfIT. This will generate clearer training requirements and will enable us to consider the most appropriate ways of providing training and development and produce firmer costs. The bids submitted by the service suppliers for the NPfIT include an element for supporting the delivery of training within the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".1393W.5/1">A two-week outpatient waiting time standard was introduced for urgently referred cases of suspected skin cancer from October 2000. In the last quarter (October to December 2003), 99.5 per cent., of urgently referred patients with suspected skin cancer were seen within two weeks of urgent referral. We have issued general practitioner cancer referral guidelines to assist GPs in determining those patients who need to be referred urgently to see a specialist within two weeks, those patients that can be referred for a routine appointment and those who can be safely watched at a primary care level. The referral guidelines are currently being reviewed by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence.</p>

They can seek assistance with return from either the Immigration Service or the International Organisation for Migration. Those unable to leave immediately who are complying with the process for return may, on application, be provided with accommodation under section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, as amended. There is no need for anyone in this group to become homeless or destitute. They can seek accommodation as soon as they receive the final decision on their asylum claim. In addition, letters sent to failed asylum seekers by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) notifying them of the termination of support now give advice on the availability of section 4 support. MASS has also now introduced a one-stage application process in order to reduce the time taken to process applications.</p>

	<p pid=".1407W.5/2">It is the responsibility of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) to set its own criteria for grant funding under the provisions of section 44 of the Race Relations Act 1976, and then to make decisions on individual applications on the basis of how well they meet those criteria. The CRE consulted widely on its proposals to move away from its previous policy of funding posts in bodies it supports, mainly Race Equality Councils, to funding projects focused on outcomes (ie the Getting Results programme). I understand that its partners welcomed the new approach, as do the Government.</p>

	<p pid=".1407W.8/2">The publication of a race equality scheme is a specific duty placed on certain public bodies under the Race Relations Act 1976 (Statutory Duties) Order 2001. The responsibility for delivering these schemes lies with the bodies listed in the order. Section 44 funding has never been intended to fund the delivery of this particular aspect of the Race Equality Duty. However, the Commission for Racial Equality informs me that one of the specific priorities for Getting Results funding in 2004&ndash;05 has been measuring the impact of the Race Equality Duty, and that &pound;193,200 has been awarded to organisations under this priority. This is distinct from the delivery of race equality schemes.</p>

	<p pid=".1408W.6/2">Most of the very small number of convicted criminals who need new identities on release from prison do so because, at some point in the criminal proceedings, they have decided to turn Queen's Evidence and appear as witnesses for the prosecution against their former partners in crime. Since in doing this they have helped to convict other (often more serious) offenders, then it is cost-effective for the state to offer to pay for any necessary change to their identity, and any other associated costs. In other cases the state is required to take reasonable steps to fulfil its duty to protect the lives of those threatened by others. Only in the most exceptional circumstances would this include a formal change of identity and only where the threat to life is clearly evidenced and the change of identity considered appropriate by the police.</p>

	<p pid=".1409W.5/42">The use of temporary staff provides the Home Office with cost effective, flexible resources which can be employed at very short notice. Their employment often allows the Department to react quickly to changes in the demands that it faces by deploying appropriately skilled and experienced individuals quickly to those areas of the business where they are most needed.</p>

	<p pid=".1418W.0/1">The Government have made it clear that it will not be a requirement to carry an identity card or to produce a card to a police officer on demand.</p>
	<p pid=".1418W.0/2">Police powers in England and Wales to identify a person arrested for a recordable offence are contained in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984. The powers will be unaffected by the introduction of an identity card however the introduction of identity cards will make it much easier and simpler for people to prove their identity when they wish to do so. As at present with existing documents, people will be free to produce an identity card on a voluntary basis (if they have one) to a police officer or to any other official as a means of establishing their identity.</p>
	<p pid=".1418W.0/3">The draft Identity Cards Bill published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-26">26 April</phrase> also includes a power in clause 24 for information relating to a biometric to be disclosed if it is not reasonably practical for the person to whom this is disclosed to have obtained this information by other means. This means that if it were not possible to identify an arrested person by other means, for example by checking police records, a check could be made on the person's biometric against the National Identity Register.</p>
	<p pid=".1418W.0/4">In addition to powers under PACE, powers under s 41 (1) Terrorism Act 2000 allow a constable to arrest without a warrant a person whom he reasonably suspects to be a terrorist, which is defined in s 40. In this case, powers under Schedule 8, paragraph 2 permit an authorised person to take any steps which are reasonably necessary for photographing, measuring or identifying a person detained under s 41. Again, these powers will be unaffected by the introduction of an identity card but again a power is available under the draft Identity Cards Bill that would allow a check of a biometric of a person detained under this section if it were not reasonably practical for this information to be obtained by another means.</p>

	<p pid=".1420W.0/1">Identity Cards: the Next Steps (CM 6020) made clear that applications for one of the family of identity cards will require checks to be made against other databases to help establish that an application for a card is genuine. Data-sharing gateways established for this purpose will be used only when processing applications for cards or related purposes (e.g. when issuing a replacement) and do not confer any general power to share data for wider purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".1420W.0/2">This approach to identity verification follows proposals included in the Cabinet Office study on Identity fraud (published in July 2002) which recommended greater use of biographical checks on applicants for passports and driving licences. The most   effective way of confirming this biographical information is to check some of the information provided by applicants with information held on a range of Government and private sector databases. These checks could for example confirm that a person had been known by a certain identity and lived at known addresses for a number of years.</p>
	<p pid=".1420W.0/3">The databases that could be checked would include public sector bodies (such as the National Insurance or   Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) databases) as well as private sector organisations (such as credit reference agencies or banks) but it is at this stage too early to know precisely which databases would be checked.</p>
	<p pid=".1420W.0/4">Information requested would be restricted to that needed to confirm the identity of an individual who has made an application to register. Clause 11 (1) and (2) of the draft Identity Cards Bill published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-26">26 April</phrase> places a duty on a person to provide information to the Secretary of State or a designated documents authority for the purposes of verifying an individual's entry to the Register. Clause 11 (4) sets out that the requirement may be imposed on any person specified in an order subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. This means that particular gateways could be established only with the consent of Parliament and for the limited purpose of validating information on the Register.</p>

	<p pid=".1421W.2/1">Home Office officials have had detailed discussions with colleagues involved in the operation of identity card schemes in Italy, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands and comprehensive information has been supplied by each of the EU member states on the operation of their card schemes. Home Office officials have also liaised with colleagues involved in the operation of card schemes in Singapore and Japan and with officials in countries such as Canada, USA and Australia that do not have card schemes on emerging crime trends.</p>
	<p pid=".1421W.2/2">Many card schemes were developed with specific aims and objectives such as population registration and not specifically implemented for countering identity fraud. As such, many identity cards are issued locally after checking available information, for example, birth certificates and information relating to an applicant's parents. In many countries it is not necessary to give biometric information when applying for an identity card.</p>
	<p pid=".1421W.2/3">&quot;Identity Cards: The Next Steps&quot; (CM 6020) states that applications for one of the family of identity cards will require checks against other databases. These checks would confirm that a person had been known by a certain identity and lived at known addresses for a number of years. This information is more difficult to forge than birth certificates or other similar documents and follows recommendations in &quot;Identity Fraud: A Study&quot; conducted by the Cabinet Office and published in 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".1421W.2/4">Many card schemes in other countries were implemented some time ago and use mainly paper cards, which do not hold biometric data. With the passage of time, there is an increasing risk that fraudsters could obtain access to modern printing technology and use it to produce forged paper cards for the purpose of committing identity fraud. The absence of a central electronic identity register in many countries increases the risks because an identity card (or biometric data) cannot be checked against a centrally held record of that information. Organisations checking a card are therefore able only to make visual checks, for example, to check that the photograph on an identity card looks like the person presenting the card and to check for obvious signs of tampering with the card itself.</p>
	<p pid=".1421W.2/5">In &quot;Identity Cards: The Next Steps&quot; the Government stated that the National Identity Register will link each individual record to a biometric. This will help to prevent multiple identities from being established and allow organisations to check a card at a level appropriate for the service they are providing.</p>
	<p pid=".1421W.2/6">While a modern and effective card scheme would help to combat identity fraud, it does not mean that every card scheme, especially those that have been implemented some time ago, would have a similar or significant effect on countering this type of crime unless they have been regularly updated to stay one step ahead of fraudsters. It is therefore not possible to assess the effect that other card schemes have had on identity fraud.</p>

	<p pid=".1423W.6/1">I represented the United Kingdom at   the Justice and Home Affairs Council held in Luxembourg on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-29">29 April 2004</phrase>. Good progress was made on a number of issues and the Council finished a day early.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/2">Firstly, subject to Member States' parliamentary scrutiny reserves, including the UK's, and completion of the certificate that will accompany the Framework Decision, Ministers reached a general approach on the Framework Decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to confiscation orders.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/3">The Eurojust President, Mike Kennedy, then presented the Eurojust Annual Report for 2003 noting, in particular, that there had been a 50 per cent. increase in cases referred to Eurojust compared to the previous year. The Commission indicated that it planned to publish its report on Member States' implementation of the Council Decision establishing Eurojust by the end of June. Ministers then agreed Council conclusions noting the report and requesting the Presidency to report to the Council with recommendations for further enhancing the role of Eurojust.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/4">The Presidency reported on progress in meeting the European Council conclusions on counter terrorism, but acknowledged that much remained to be done. It was therefore preparing a comprehensive roadmap on implementation of the counter terrorism strategy, indicating the body or group responsible for each action and deadlines for completion.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/5">The Commission said that it was preparing Communications on practical measures for the exchange of information and on the interoperability of data in the field of visas and border management. It also wanted to bring forward proposals for allowing Schengen Information System data on lost and stolen passports to be sent to Europol. In order to launch the invitation to tender in September the Commission recommended adoption of the Council Decision establishing the Visa Information System.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/6">I presented an initiative on the retention of telecommunications traffic data and explained why the UK believes that a common EU approach to the retention of this data is essential. I outlined some of our practical experience of investigations and prosecutions which had depended on such data to establish the link between the suspects and offences in question.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/7">The EU counter-terrorism coordinator welcomed the progress made and suggested that work now needed to focus on practical action and implementation of agreed legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/8">The Council was unable to secure the required unanimity on the decision as to who should be appointed as the new Europol Director. The Presidency therefore concluded that the Council would need to return to the issue in June. In the meantime the Europol Management Board would need to consider whether interim arrangements would need to be put in place pending a final decision.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/9">Discussion on the draft Asylum Procedures Directive focussed on the application of the safe third (i.e. non EU) country concept (Articles 27 and 35A).</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/10">I made clear that the UK would not accept anything which would prevent us from pursuing the approach in the Asylum and Immigration (treatment of claims etc.) Bill whereby an applicant who has transited a safe third country before coming to the UK may only challenge his removal on ECHR grounds. One other Member State initially felt that consideration should be given to all aspects of an applicant's claim. However, following discussion with them, the Presidency and the Commission, a compromise strengthening the wording on individual consideration and guaranteeing as a minimum that the applicant could bring a challenge on the ECHR elements in his claim was agreed.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/11">It was also agreed, in relation to Article 35A, which sets out what may happen when an asylum applicant enters a Member State from a bordering country designated as safe, that Member States' national lists of these safe third countries would expire once a common EU list was in place.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/12">All other reservations, apart from four parliamentary scrutiny reservations, including the UK's, were lifted from the text and the Council reached a General Approach, pending submission of the draft Directive to the European Parliament for re-consultation. This is a good result for the UK as the draft Directive will allow us to maintain all significant elements of our domestic asylum procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/13">It was also agreed, in relation to Article 35A, which sets out what may happen when an asylum applicant enters a Member State from a bordering country designated as safe, that Member States' national lists of these safe third countries would expire once a common EU list was in place.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/14">All other reservations, apart from four parliamentary scrutiny reservations, including the UK's, were lifted from the text and the Council reached a General Approach, pending submission of the draft Directive to the European Parliament for re-consultation. This is a good result for the UK as the draft Directive will allow us to maintain all significant elements of our domestic asylum procedures.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/15">The Council also agreed a Minutes Statement, placing Bulgaria and Romania on a common minimum EU list of safe countries of origin and committing the Council to complete work on the definitive list of such countries prior to re-consulting the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/16">Under Any Other Business the Commission confirmed that it had been in discussions with key third countries about visa requirements for the new Member States and that it would be presenting a proposal to facilitate the procedures relating to short stay visas in relation to EU and Russian citizens.</p>
	<p pid=".1423W.6/17">Finally, I have placed in the Libraries of both Houses a copy of the list of &quot;A&quot; points which, with the exception of item 25, were approved (see documents 8847/04 PTS A 19 and ADD 1). This included item 20 on the Obligation of Carriers to Communicate Passenger Data. The UK believes that this will be a useful tool in helping to tackle terrorism and organised crime and we therefore supported the European Council Declaration on Terrorism calling for its adoption. However, as a Member State initiative, it would have fallen if not agreed before <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-01">1 May 2004</phrase> and, regrettably, I therefore felt unable to block its adoption despite it being held under scrutiny in the House of Lords.</p>

	<p pid=".1425W.2/1">When the contract between the Home Office and Anne's Gate Property (AGP) for 2 Marsham street was signed, it was recognised that changes to the original specification were likely to be required during the contract period&mdash;in particular for security, information communication technology (ICT) cabling and external design. It was not at the time possible to determine precisely what those changes might be, and the contract therefore made provision for a further &pound;11 million to be raised via a Variation Bond.</p>
	<p pid=".1425W.2/2">The final scope of the changes, and their cost, is still being determined. They will, however, include security and business continuity enhancements to provide greater protection and resilience; enhancements to the design to support the Government's Better Public Buildings initiative; compliance with the latest standard of ICT cabling; internal changes to better meet business requirements; and some spend to save investments in energy efficiency, internal communications services and the provision of electronic rather than manual IT switching. The Home Office has made provision for a contribution of &pound;2 million towards the cost of the additional works.</p>

	<p pid=".1430W.5/1">The information is as follows:</p>
	<p pid=".1430W.5/2" class="italic">Funding for Kent police</p>
	<p pid=".1430W.5/3">Grants for policing are not hypothecated to individual areas such as Sittingbourne and Sheppey. Grants are allocated to Kent police as a whole and it is for the Chief Constable to decide how best to deploy the resources across the force area.</p>
	<p pid=".1430W.5/4">Police grant distribution has been formula-based since 1995&ndash;96. Prior to that, grant was based on a proportion of forces' net expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".1430W.5/5">Home Office police grant is one element only of the total general police grant forces received. Revenue Support Grant and National Non Domestic Rates make up the total of the general grant. These have not been included in the answer as they are administered by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM).</p>
	<p pid=".1430W.5/6">In line with all forces in England and Wales, Kent police will receive a general grants increase of 3.25 per cent. next year. Their allocation is &pound;182.6 million. Kent is one of the shire forces who benefit most from this arrangement. If the formula alone had been applied, they would have received &pound;167.9 million. Because a floor of 3.25 per cent. on top of last year's grant was given, they will in fact receive &pound;182.6 million, &pound;14.7 million more.</p>
	<p pid=".1430W.5/7">In addition, funding is provided to forces for a number of specific programmes such as the Crime Fighting Fund, to assist the recruitment of extra police officers, and the Rural Policing Fund, to enhance policing in areas with the most widespread populations.</p>
	<p pid=".1430W.5/8" class="italic">Active Community Unit grant</p>
	<p pid=".1430W.5/9">For the past three years via our mentoring programme the Home Office has been providing financial support to mentoring organisations throughout England. Home-Start Sittingbourne and Sheppey successfully bid for three years project funding under the Active Community Unit's Mentoring Fund in 2001&ndash;02. The project helps those families experiencing difficulties and breakdown. The organisation received revenue grants of &pound;6,219 in 2001&ndash;02, &pound;12,715 in 2002&ndash;03 and &pound;13,034 in 2003&ndash;04. The organisation also received a one-off capital grant of &pound;2,682 in 2002&ndash;03 to buy equipment to support the project. Home Office funding has (finished in March 2004) now ceased.</p>

Consequently, figures for non-domestic rates from 1990&ndash;91 have been included above. From 1993&ndash;94 onwards the non-domestic rates figure includes City offset.</p>

In close co-operation with the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP), we received a delegation of Chinese law makers in March, for a programme of meetings when they were able to discuss the issues involved with UK Government Departments and with UK industry. In May we sent a specialist who works with our Distributed Generation Working Group, and a Trade Promoter of the DTI's New and Renewable Energy Programme, to Beijing to join a working group developing the drafting of these regulations, which are expected to come into force next year.</p>
	<p pid=".1437W.7/3">We will continue to support this initiative, and also to promote contact between companies and industry bodies of our two countries. We have commissioned the development of a website designed specifically to make available information on renewable energy capabilities and opportunities in each country. This website is nearing completion, and can now be viewed on <a href="http://www.ukchinarenewables.co.uk.WeunderstandthataUK">www.ukchinarenewables.co.uk. We understand that a UK</a> specialist wind energy company is once again going to engage in training Chinese companies in the development of wind energy, in June; at least partially as a result of our trade promotional activities. And we are preparing to sponsor a presence by UK industry at a wind energy conference and exhibition in Beijing at the end of October.</p>

In particular it is considering further enhancing its electronic filing services to provide greater security for companies that feel at risk. Companies House is also an active member of the North East Fraud Forum, which is a unique partnership between the public and private sectors to share knowledge and experience with a view to defeating economic crime.</p>
	<p pid=".1440W.3/2">However, this is also a matter for companies themselves to consider how best to protect themselves against the risk of corporate identity theft. Companies House also offers a service known as &quot;Monitor&quot; which companies can subscribe to which will alert them to the filing of any documents on their public record. Companies can also easily make regular checks of their public record on the Companies House Website (companieshouse.gov.uk) to make sure their records reflect the true position.</p>

	<p pid=".1442W.8/1">As part of our commitment to protecting the rights of all consumers, employees and employers, the Department of Trade and Industry is responsible for numerous activities that have particular relevance for older people. Examples include: introducing legislation under the European Employment Directive that will outlaw age discrimination in employment and vocational training from October 2006; the Age Advisory Group, set up in 2001, and Taskforce, set up in 2004, have been advising the Government on matters to do with implementation of the Directive; and establishment of the Commission for Equality and Human Rights (CEHRs), which will provide, for the first time, institutional support for the proposed provisions on age discrimination. In its first few years of operation particular attention will need to be paid to age issues, including awareness raising among, and support for, those with rights and responsibilities under the age legislation. In addition, the CEHR will be able to act in   a broad range of areas and not just those where there   is specific legislative protection&mdash;for example, encouraging good practice in the provision of goods and services to help prevent unfair treatment of older people.</p>
	<p pid=".1442W.8/2">Further examples include funding for the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and Citizens Advice Scotland to provide support and training to the Citizens Advice Service across the UK. The service deals with in excess of 6 million cases annually, of which over 50 per cent. involve older people; and joint support with DEFRA in 2001 (500,000) for a three-year pilot programme of Warm Zones to assess the merits of a systematic local approach to client identification and assistance: the formal evaluation of this work is expected by the end of 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".1442W.8/3">In April 1999, DTI launched a three-year campaign specifically targeted at older people entitled &quot;Avoiding Slips, Trips and Broken Hips&quot; working with Help the Aged and others. This campaign ended in 2002. However, DTI provided a grant of &pound;50,000 directly to Help the Aged to continue to deliver the existing resources, and at present materials continue to be available for free distribution.</p>

	<p pid=".1444W.6/22">There are two main instances when individuals may legitimately earn less than the appropriate minimum wage for their age. Firstly, individuals may be on certain Government training programmes or apprenticeships, in which they are exempt for the first year up to the age of 26. Also, employees aged over 21 who receive accredited training (such as those doing NVQs) may be exempted from receiving the full adult national minimum wage for the first six months of training in a new job with a new employer. Secondly, employees may be exempted if they are receiving accommodation that is tied to their employment. Such employees do not have to be paid all of their minimum wage entitlement in cash terms because employers can legitimately reduce rates to take into account the cost of accommodation provided; from October 2003 this has amounted to a daily offset of &pound;3.50, leading to a maximum weekly offset of &pound;24.50.</p>

	<p pid=".1446W.11/1">The Working Time Regulations 1998 (WTR) which implement the provisions of the Working Time Directive in UK law came into force on <phrase class="date" code="1998-10-01">1 October 1998</phrase>. The Regulations currently include an opt-out provision to the weekly working time limit. Under the opt-out, an individual worker may agree to work more than 48 hours a week.</p>
	<p pid=".1446W.11/2">The opt-out was initially granted for a period of 15 years but has since been extended. A review has been carried out and the European Commission have decided to consult more widely over working time changes. The Commission published a consultation communication on <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-05">5 January 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".1446W.11/3">The UK response to the Communication (<phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>) argued strongly for the retention of the opt-out. While the Government are in favour of providing fair minimum standards of employment protection, they are also keen to maintain the flexibility our individual labour market requires, and, which many individual workers prefer.</p>
	<p pid=".1446W.11/4">The second stage consultation paper from the European Commission was recently published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-19">19 May</phrase>. It presented the following options:</p>
	<p pid=".1446W.11/5" class="indent"><i>Option 1&mdash;</i>Keep the individual opt out with tighter conditions of application.</p>
	<p pid=".1446W.11/6" class="indent"><i>Option 2&mdash;</i>Opt-out only available through collective agreement.</p>
	<p pid=".1446W.11/7" class="indent"><i>Option 3&mdash;</i>Opt out available through collective agreement, but retain the possibility of individual opt out in the absence of such an agreement and for undertakings without worker representation.</p>
	<p pid=".1446W.11/8" class="indent"><i>Option 4&mdash;</i>Phase out the opt out.</p>
	<p pid=".1446W.11/9">Option 1 is the only one to ensure workers have real choice and ensure working hours are tailored to what individual workers want.</p>
	<p pid=".1446W.11/10">The UK and the Commission agree that extending the reference period for working hours, so that these can be averaged over a period of up to 12 months without the need for a collective agreement would increase the flexibility of both employers and workers. This is of particular value in the UK because, as the Commission's Communication notes, collective or workforce agreements are not widespread here.</p>
	<p pid=".1446W.11/11">There is now in a 6-week period of negotiation with the social partners: UNICE, the European employers' federation; ETUC, the European employees organisation; and CEEP, the public sector employers organisation. If the social partners do not agree to negotiate on a workable solution during this time, the Commission will propose legislation by co-decision by the summer 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".1454W.3/2" class="letterfrom">Letter from Len Cook to Mr. Edward Davey, dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-24">24 May 2004</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".1454W.3/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking for an update of the information set out in the answer of <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-17">17 November 2003</phrase>, <phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2003-11-17.520"><i>Official Report</i>, columns 520&ndash;22W</phrase>, giving how much council tax was paid as a proportion of gross income for households in each income quintile group in each English region. (174862)</p>
	<p pid=".1454W.3/4" class="indent">Estimates have been produced from the Office for National Statistics' analysis &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income&quot; published on the National Statistics website on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-06">6 May 2004</phrase> at <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/taxesbenefits</a>. The analysis includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey. This is a sample survey covering about 7,000 households in the UK and sample sizes for each region are only sufficient to give approximate estimates.</p>
	<p pid=".1454W.3/5" class="indent">The current analysis presents data for the category 'Council tax and Northern Ireland rates', as opposed to the category 'Local taxes' used in previous analyses. This is because, from this year, charges made by water authorities for water, environmental and sewerage services have been excluded. This treatment conforms to the National Accounts classification and definition of taxes where water rates and related charges are considered a charge for services rather than a tax. They have therefore been excluded from the calculation of disposable income. This reply is based on the new methodology and includes updated 2001&ndash;02 figures on this basis for comparison.</p>
	<p pid=".1454W.3/6" class="indent">The table shows, for 2001&ndash;02 and 2002&ndash;03, the average net council tax paid for all households in each Government Office Region and for each income quintile group within each region where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. Equivalisation is a standard methodology that takes into account the size and composition of households and adjusts their incomes to recognise differing demands on resources. The net council tax figures are gross council tax less reported council tax benefits and   discounts. The table also shows the boundaries between equivalised disposable income quintiles, which have been calculated separately for households in each Government Office Region. For example, the 1st quintile boundary is the income level below which one fifth of those households are estimated to lie.</p>

	<p pid=".1458W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question concerning <i>(a)</i> the Government consumption expenditure deflator and <i>(b)</i> the level of public sector inflation for each year since 1997. (174980)</p>
	<p pid=".1458W.2/4" class="indent">The implied annual deflator for general government consumption derived from the national accounts estimates published in March 2004 is presented in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid=".1458W.2/5" class="indent">Please note that these estimates do not present price measures directly, since with a few exceptions (e.g. passport fees), there are no directly observable prices for the services provided by government. The estimates are therefore derived by comparing the spending on producing government services with measures of the output of those services. As derived statistics, they should not be confused with measures of the price of the inputs such as public sector earnings or prices paid for other purchases.</p>
	<p pid=".1458W.2/6" class="indent">In calculating the deflator, the quality and reliability of the output measures are crucial. However, public service delivery and management mechanisms have developed and become more complex in recent years, and there is an increasing emphasis on the quality of service for the customer. As a result there are greater demands on, and expectations of, measures of government output. In order to ensure that output measures can respond to these demands, in December 2003 I announced an independent review, led by Sir Tony Atkinson, of the future development of government output and productivity measures, and the associated price indices.</p>

	<p pid=".1460W.5/1">Following the announcement by the Chancellor that a duty differential of 0.5p/l in favour of sulphur free petrol will apply from <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-01">1 September 2004</phrase>, we anticipate that this will rapidly replace low sulphur petrol. The marketing of sulphur free fuels is a matter for the oil industry, however we do expect that the duty differential will be sufficient to ensure widespread availability across the UK generally. Certainly, early indications from the oil industry are that Scotland will be among the first areas to see the introduction of sulphur-free fuels.</p>

(175243)</p>
	<p pid=".1460W.11/4" class="indent">The implied annual deflator for general government consumption derived from the national accounts estimates published in March 2004 is presented in the attached table.</p>
	<p pid=".1460W.11/5" class="indent">Please note that these estimates do not present price measures directly, since with a few exceptions (e.g. passport fees), there are no directly observable prices for the services provided by government. The estimates are therefore derived by comparing the spending on producing government services with measures of the output of those services. As derived statistics, they should not be confused with measures of the price of the inputs such as public sector earnings or prices paid for other purchases.</p>
	<p pid=".1460W.11/6" class="indent">The methodology used in calculation the volume measure of Government consumption was changed from the mid-1990s, therefore comparisons should be made with care.</p>
	<p pid=".1460W.11/7" class="indent">In calculating the implied deflator, the quality and reliability of the output measures are crucial. However, public service delivery and management mechanisms have developed and become more complex in recent years, and there is an increasing emphasis on the quality of service for the customer. As a result there are greater demands on, and expectations of, measures of government output. In order to ensure that output measures can respond to these demands, in December 2003 the National Statistician announced a review of the future development of government output and productivity measures, and the associated price indices.</p>

	<p pid=".1466W.5/1">We have a number of measures in place nationally to help improve conditions for disabled people at work, as well as measures to improve their access to services generally. None of these are specific to Blackpool, North and Fleetwood, but all are available to disabled people who live and work there.</p>
	<p pid=".1466W.5/2">From 1996, the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act required most employers of 20 or more staff not to discriminate against, and to   make reasonable adjustments for, disabled job applicants or employees; in December 1998, we reduced this threshold to 15 employees. From October this year, the small employer exemption will be removed and most currently excluded occupations, such as police officers, fire-fighters, and partners in business partnerships will   be brought within the scope of the Disability Discrimination Act employment provisions.</p>
	<p pid=".1466W.5/3">Jobcentre Plus runs a number of specialist programmes providing help for disabled people, including New Deal for Disabled People, WORKSTEP, Access to Work, the Job Introduction Scheme, and Work Preparation. All these programmes provide practical advice and support to disabled people and their employers to help overcome work related obstacles resulting from disability. Since 1997&ndash;98 there have been year on year increases in both numbers helped and programme spend.</p>
	<p pid=".1466W.5/4">To help people access appropriate help, Jobcentre Plus has established a network of disability service teams. The teams are made up of disability employment advisers, access to work advisers and occupational psychologists; their services are accessed through local Jobcentres.</p>
	<p pid=".1466W.5/5">Since April 2003, disabled people in work have been receiving financial support through the working tax credit. This is available if a person is working an average of at least 16 hours per week (self-employed or for an employer); and have a disability which puts them at a disadvantage in getting a job. 70,000 families (including over 32,000 adults without children) are benefiting from the disability element within the working tax credit, compared to 38,000 who benefited from the old disabled person's tax credit.</p>
