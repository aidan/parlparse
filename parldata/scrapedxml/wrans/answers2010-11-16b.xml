Scotland and its regions will stand to benefit from these priorities.</p>

Farm workers suffer equally with farm owners, often losing their accommodation as well as their livelihood.</p>

The consul met with British farmers in July to further understand their concerns and see what assistance we might be able to offer. Our ambassador has raised the issue directly with the Minister for Justice and Legal Affairs. Violent invasions demonstrate a lack of respect for the rule of law. We continue to urge the police and judicial authorities in Zimbabwe to take action against them.</p>

	<p pid="b.667W.2/1">Section 16 of the Coroners Act 1988 provides that the coroner shall adjourn an inquest, in the absence of any reason to the contrary, if a criminal charge has been brought in connection with the death. Section 16 also provides that the coroner should only resume an inquest after the completion of criminal proceedings if there is sufficient cause. This is because a criminal trial will often address the same issues as an inquest, namely who the deceased was and how, when and where he or she came by their death. Bereaved families are therefore spared the distress of attending two separate judicial proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.667W.2/2">Section 16 states further that where a coroner has adjourned an inquest, he or she shall send a certificate to the registrar of deaths. This certificate should state, so far as has been ascertained, the particulars required for registration of the death under the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953. Therefore criminal proceedings should not delay the issuing of the death certificate for registration purposes.</p>

A feasibility report on Calder Hall, informed by English Heritage's work, is available on the NDA's website. Various components at Calder Hall were considered for listing in 2006, but not recommended for designation. While the Secretary of State has no plans at present to consider such sites for listing, discussions are under way between the heritage bodies of England, Scotland and Wales to consider a shared approach to this challenging aspect of Britain's technological achievement.</p>

	<p pid="b.673W.0/1">Broadcasters already have to meet demanding targets for subtitling. The Communications Act 2003 sets minimum targets for the subtitling of programmes by licensees. For the majority of broadcasters the minimum target for subtitling is 80% to be achieved within a 10 year period, with more demanding targets set for some of the public service broadcasting services. In 2011 70 separate channels will be required to provide subtitling; accounting for just over 90% of UK audience share in 2009. In addition, any timeshifted or simulcast HD versions of these channels are also obliged to provide subtitling.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.0/2">In determining which channels are required to provide subtitling, Ofcom considers audience share (channels achieving an average audience share of all UK households over a 12 month period of 0.05% or less are excluded from the requirements) and affordability.</p>
	<p pid="b.673W.0/3">On August 2010 Ofcom published its quarterly report on the provision of access services (subtitling, signing and audio description) by broadcasters for the second quarter of 2010. Ofcom's report shows that the BBC subtitled 99.8% of its programmes, and ITV and Channel 4 both exceeded their subtitling targets of 90%. Indeed, many other broadcasters also exceeded their targets, often substantially.</p>

However there is data available which show: (i) the total of prosecutions discontinued by the CPS; (ii) the totals of other unsuccessful outcomes; (iii) the total of all unsuccessful outcomes; and, (iv) the totals of successful outcomes for each CPS area in the last three years for both magistrates court cases and Crown court cases. The data for prosecutions dropped by the CPS includes cases that are discontinued, withdrawn or where no evidence is offered. Other unsuccessful outcomes will include all acquittals after trial. CPS data does not identify whether the reason for dropping a case was due to attrition of CPS staff. Tables containing this data have been deposited in the Library of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.693W.5/2">A water-intensive business will usually want to obtain a licence to abstract water from the environment as this is cheaper than paying for water supplied by water companies. Business can make use of the published information on water availability, via the Environment Agency's catchment abstraction management strategies. These identify the availability of water resources for new abstractions, and areas where water is unlikely to be available.</p>
	<p pid="b.693W.5/3">In addition, there are mechanisms in place to encourage efficient use of water by businesses, including water-intensive industries. The water technology list identifies products, across a range of technologies, that are at the leading edge of efficient water consumption.

Investments in such products give long-term financial benefits by reducing the amount of water that needs to be abstracted from the environment or obtained from the public water supply.</p>

	<p pid="b.696W.5/1">The regulatory framework for buses permits co-operative agreements between bus operators as long as certain conditions are met. We have seen good results in places where local authorities and operators work effectively in partnership to improve bus services-such as in Brighton, York and Cambridge.</p>
	<p pid="b.696W.5/2">While it is the role of Government to set this framework and encourage more of this type of activity for the benefit of bus passengers in Ipswich and elsewhere it is up to local authorities and communities to make it happen. This might be a local authority making a statutory quality bus partnership scheme, as in Nottingham, or instead endorsing a qualifying agreement between two operators, as in Oxford.</p>
	<p pid="b.696W.5/3">Ultimately, however, it is for commercial operators to decide whether to run services such as the route 66 bus in Ipswich, and at what frequency. If a service is not considered commercially viable, a local authority can decide it wishes to tender for and support a replacement service, or discuss with the local community alternative forms of transport provision.</p>

	<p pid="b.697W.5/1">In 2005 the Department for Transport funded six cycling towns and in 2008 this funding was extended to include a further 11 cycling towns and one city until March 2011. Their remit was to increase significantly their cycling levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.697W.5/2">Preliminary evaluation of the first six cycling demonstration towns (CDTs) provided evidence of early changes in the levels of cycling and physical activity in CDTs across a range of indicators, including a one percentage point increase in the estimated proportion of people cycling for 30 minutes at least three times a week, and a 27% increase in levels of cycling as measured y automatic cycle counts. Taken together, these findings (published by Cycling England in 2009) strongly suggest that cycling levels were observably increasing in the CDTs three years after the initiative began, with some evidence indicating that similar increases were not occurring in comparable areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.697W.5/3">Monitoring of cycling levels in the CDTs is ongoing until at least 2011, in order to capture data on the longer-term trends in these towns.</p>

Analysis of the monitoring data will not be conducted until a suitable time series is available, to enable intervention effects to be distinguished from seasonal and other natural fluctuations in the data.</p>

	<p pid="b.700W.6/1">Work to replace the central reserve safety barrier is taking place in stages on the M18 between Junctions 2 and to the north of Junction 4. This is the first in a series of four schemes being undertaken between September 2010 and the end of March 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.700W.6/2">In order to undertake the work safely and with the minimum of disruption to the road user the hard shoulder is being used to maintain the full compliment of running lanes throughout the day. In order to do this a temporary 50mph speed restriction is required. This restriction remains in place on each stage until all the work has been completed and the hard shoulder reinstated.</p>
	<p pid="b.700W.6/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-01">1 November</phrase> works to replace the central reserve barrier had been completed. The hard shoulder, however, was coned off because works to reinstate the verge safety barriers and inspection chambers were taking place. Works were also being undertaken in the northbound verge to repair drains and install new gullies. Additionally, to the north of Junction 3 works were taking place to install both a temporary closed circuit television system in the north and southbound verges as well as speed camera cabling in the southbound verge, for the next stage of barrier works.</p>
	<p pid="b.700W.6/4">On the evening of <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-01">1 November</phrase> night time works to reinstate road markings, which involved a lane closure, were suspended to allow a wide load to pass safely through the works area.</p>
	<p pid="b.700W.6/5">National advice on setting temporary speed limits is given in Traffic Signs Manual Chapter 8 which is developed by the Highways Agency on behalf of Department for Transport. This identifies appropriate speed limits based on the relative risk to road users. This risk is normally the same whether road workers are present or not. The Highways Agency produced additional advice in July 2007 (Chief Highways Engineer Memo 203/07) on how to apply temporary speed limits at road works using the risk based approach in Chapter 8.</p>

	<p pid="b.702W.5/1">Local authorities already have powers to enforce on-street disabled person's parking bays in England and Wales. Under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 they may designate by order an on-street parking place reserved for a disabled badge holder. If a disabled person's parking bay has been designated, it would be an offence for non-disabled people to use the space. These bays can be enforced with penalty charge notices or fixed penalty notices. In addition, if prosecuted, an offender faces a fine of up to &#163;1,000. If the local authority chooses not to designate a bay, it remains 'advisory' and cannot be enforced.</p>
	<p pid="b.702W.5/2">The Blue Badge (Disabled Parking) scheme only applies on-street. Enforcement of off-street disabled persons' parking bays is a matter for the individual owner or operator concerned. In the case of local authority off-street car parks, traffic regulation orders made under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 are used to enforce the bays. In private off-street car parks, the charges and conditions of use are essentially a contractual matter between the owner and the motorist.</p>
	<p pid="b.702W.5/3">The Government have no plans to introduce further regulation.</p>

The Government favour an initial line from London to the west midlands, followed thereafter by lines from the west midlands to Leeds and Manchester.

I also recognise that appropriate assistance will be needed when potential routes for the Leeds and Manchester sections are announced, and I will put arrangements for such assistance in place at that point.</p>

	<p pid="b.706W.0/1">The following information details the major reviews announced by this Department since <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-06">6 May</phrase>. The Department, however, is a large customer facing delivery organisation with over 100,000 staff spread across a wide range of geographical locations. It is not possible, other than at disproportionate cost, to identify all the reviews which the Department may have undertaken into any aspect of its very wide range of policy responsibilities in this time frame.</p>
	<p pid="b.706W.0/2" class="indent">(i) an independent review of how best to support the implementation of automatic enrolment into workplace pensions was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-24">24 June</phrase> and reported by the planned deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-30">30 September</phrase>. The outcomes of the review were set out in &quot;Making Auto-Enrolment Work-A review for the Department for Work and Pensions&quot; (Cm 7954) published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-27">27 October</phrase>. This independent review was led by Paul Johnson of Frontier Economics, supported by David Yeandle of the Engineering Employers' Federation and Adrian Boulding of Legal and General. Frontier Economics are being recompensed for Paul Johnson's contribution to the review. The other members of the review team were entitled to claim expenses. The review was supported by a core team of three civil servants and drew upon wider policy, analytical and other expertise within the Department. No staff were seconded from outside Whitehall to work on the review. The cost of these staff were met from the Department's core budget with total additional costs, including the publication of the review team's report and seminars with key stakeholders, estimated at around &#163;95,000;</p>
	<p pid="b.706W.0/3" class="indent">(ii) an independent review of the work capability assessment was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-29">29 June</phrase> and is being led by Professor Malcolm Harrington along with a Scrutiny Group chaired by Professor David Haslam, and with three other members: Paul Farmer, Olivia Carlton and Neil Lennox. Professor Harrington's work is being supported by five civil servants. There are no secondees from outside Whitehall. All are being paid, with the exception of Neil Lennox who is carrying out the work on a pro bono basis, and all are entitled to claim expenses. The estimated cost of this review is &#163;125,000 and it is anticipated that it will report by the end of 2010;</p>
	<p pid="b.706W.0/4" class="indent">(iii) a review of state pension age. A Call for Evidence on when the state pension age should increase to 66 was published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-24">24 June</phrase> and the conclusions of the review were contained in &quot;A Sustainable State Pension: when the State Pension age will increase to 66&quot; (Cm 7956) published on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-03">3 November</phrase>. The cost of the review is being met from the Department's core budget. The review is being led by a core team of six staff, who also have responsibilities for other state pension policy work within the Department. They draw upon wider analytical and other expertise from within the Department. No staff have been seconded from outside Whitehall to work on the review.</p>

However, there is no intention at all that local reference rents will be used in the assessment of housing benefit by 2020, and the Department will therefore not carry out a comparison with median private rented sector rents for that time period.</p>

	<p pid="b.713W.8/12" class="indent">Over and above this we have a robust complaints process and fully investigate all complaints from employees and jobseekers and in a small number of cases Jobcentre Plus will refuse to advertise vacancies from companies where these complaints are upheld.</p>
	<p pid="b.713W.8/13" class="indent">Our vacancies services are free of charge. The Employment and Training Act 1973 places a statutory duty on the Secretary of State to provide services to help employers seeking employees and expressly prevents charging.</p>

These costs will be significantly lower than the savings that will now be realised by moving service users to alternative providers already operating in Glasgow.</p>

	<p pid="b.735W.0/1">The UK requires three instrumented Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) aircraft to conduct joint initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E) with the US armed forces. The low rate initial production contract signed in 2009 contained the first two UK short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) JSFs and set a target unit price at approximately &#163;100 million. The unit price for the third aircraft is still subject to commercial sensitivity, but we expect a reduction in unit price in line with industry cost improvement and production learner requirements. Importantly, participation in joint IOT&amp;E with the US services will meet the majority of our test and evaluation requirements as the mission systems are common between variants. The flying phase of IOT&amp;E is not expected to commence before 2012.</p>

	<p pid="b.749W.3/1">The recent survey of the size and health of the UK Space Industry suggests that the majority of companies are based in the South East of England, and so in the immediate future growth is therefore most likely to occur in this area. Companies are also beginning to grow in other parts of the country and I would anticipate that in the longer term growth will take place in other regions, even if from a small baseline.</p>

	<p pid="b.749W.6/1">In 2010 an Industry led Innovation Growth Strategy report recommended that the UK establish a national Earth observation data service. In response this Department, through the UK Space Agency, is supporting a review of the Government's need for data, including imagery data, from space. This will estimate the size and nature of the public sector demand for Earth observation services now and into the future. The review will determine whether cost efficiencies and wealth creation can be derived from a strategic government procurement exercise creating a national Earth observation service. On the basis of this work, the final Government position will be taken during 2011 or 2012.</p>

	<p pid="b.751W.10/2">The average of any set of data is usually taken to be the mean. However in this case the mean length of time spent in care is heavily influenced by children who have spent a long period of their lives in care, around 4,600 looked after children have spent more than 10 years in care. Therefore we have also provided information on the median (defined as the middle value of data sorted from lowest to highest) length of time spent in care.</p>

	<p pid="b.761W.2/1">No beef or lamb purchased by the House of Commons is halal slaughtered unless specifically requested by an event organiser. However, it has recently come to the attention of the House of Commons Catering Service that it has unknowingly received supplies of poultry slaughtered using pre-stun halal methods, and consequently customers have not been made aware of this fact. Contracts for the supply of meat and poultry are currently in the process of being re-tendered and as part of that process it has become apparent that the practice of supplying halal meats and poultry is widespread in the catering supply chain. The House Service is in discussions with bidders about how this can best be managed in future.</p>

	<p pid="b.767W.6/1">In the United Kingdom medicines for human use are regulated by the Medicines Act 1968 and supporting regulations which aim to protect patient health. Before a medicine can be marketed in the UK, a number of licences are required. The product itself must have a licence called a 'marketing authorisation' unless an exemption applies. In addition, the companies that are involved in all stages of the manufacture (including importation) and distribution of the product need to hold an appropriate licence.</p>
	<p pid="b.767W.6/2">A marketing authorisation is granted following an assessment of the safety, quality and efficacy of a medicinal product. Marketing authorisations can be specific to an European Union member state, or apply across all EU member states. The regulatory requirements for marketing authorisations are defined at a European level. In the UK the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is responsible for the assessment of medicinal products for human use, and contributes towards the work of the European Medicines Agency in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.767W.6/3">In the UK the provision for the use of an unlicensed medicinal product is provided for by way of an exemption from the requirement for a marketing authorisation. In the interests of public health this exemption is narrowly drawn because these products, unlike products holding a marketing authorisation, will not have been assessed and approved against the criteria of safety, quality and efficacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.767W.6/4">The use of an unlicensed medicinal product can only take place to fulfil the special clinical needs of the patient, where those needs cannot be met by an authorised medicinal product. The &quot;special clinical needs&quot; in such a situation must be of the patient, rather than due to considerations such as cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.767W.6/5">In the UK it is for a doctor's clinical judgment as to which medicinal products they prescribe for their patient. A doctor should always consider using an authorised medicinal product first if available. Decisions such as the use of an unlicensed medicine need to be made in discussion with the patient concerned.</p>

	<p pid="b.768W.2/1">The spending review recognises the importance of social care in protecting most vulnerable in society. In recognition of the pressures on the social care system in a challenging fiscal climate, the coalition Government have allocated an additional &#163;2 billion by 2014-15 to support the delivery of social care. This means, with an ambitious programme of efficiency, that there is enough funding available both to protect people's access to services and deliver new approaches to improve quality and outcomes.</p>

This funding will be allocated in addition to the Department's existing social care grants, which will rise in line with inflation. Total grant funding from the Department for social care will reach &#163;2.4 billion by 2014-15. In order to support local flexibility and to reduce administrative burdens, this funding will go to authorities through the Revenue Support Grant.</p>

	<p pid="b.772W.5/1">The spending review recognises the importance of social care in protecting the most vulnerable in society. In recognition of the pressures on the social care system in a challenging local government settlement, the coalition Government have allocated an additional &#163;2 billion by 2014-15 to support the delivery of social care. This means, with an ambitious programme of efficiency, that there is enough funding available both to protect people's access to services and deliver new approaches to improve quality and outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.772W.5/2">We have achieved this in two ways:</p>
	<p pid="b.772W.5/3" class="indent">The NHS will transfer some funding from the health capital budget to health revenue, to be spent on measures that support social care, which also benefits health. This funding will rise to &#163;1 billion in 2014-15, and will promote improved joint working between the health and social care systems. Later this year, the new operating framework will set out specific primary care trust (PCT) allocations that they will transfer to local authorities for spending on social care services to benefit health, and to improve overall health gain. PCTs and local authorities will need to work together to agree jointly appropriate areas for social care investment, with a shared analysis of need and a common agreement on the outcomes to be met.</p>
	<p pid="b.772W.5/4" class="indent">Additional grant funding, rising to &#163;1 billion by 2014-15, will be made available for social care. This funding will be allocated in addition to the Department's existing social care grants, which will rise in line with inflation. Total grant funding from the Department for social care will reach &#163;2.4 billion by 2014-15. In order to support local flexibility and to reduce administrative burdens, this funding will go to authorities through the revenue support grant.</p>
