	<p pid="d.682W.6/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.6/2">The Government introduced reforms in statutory instruments in 2005 and in the Consumer Credit Act 2006 to strengthen the regulation of consumer credit. These ensure that consumers are given clear and transparent information to enable them to shop around with confidence and that the OFT can take targeted and effective enforcement action against rogue lenders. The Act also replaced previous provisions which gave consumers a right to challenge extortionate credit bargains with a new wide-ranging right for consumers to challenge before the courts any aspect of their relationship with a lender which is unfair. This could include, but is not limited to, the level of interest charged.</p>
	<p pid="d.682W.6/3">The Government recently held a summit with the credit card industry on risk based re-pricing - the practice that was leading to some consumers facing significant interest rate increases at short notice. As a result of this, the credit card industry agreed a statement of principles for risk based re-pricing. This ensures that consumers are fairly treated when a card lender seeks to increase their individual interest rate on the basis that their risk profile has deteriorated. These principles come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-01">1 January 2009</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="d.683W.12/2">As part of a wider package of real help for homeowners, the Homeowner Mortgage Support Scheme, will enable ordinary hard-working households that experience a redundancy or significant loss of income to reduce their monthly payments to a more manageable level, by deferring a proportion of the interest payments on their mortgage for up to two years. The Government will guarantee to lenders they will get the payments back in return for them participating in the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="d.683W.12/3">Homeowners remain responsible for repaying the mortgage in the long term but the scheme will result in more affordable monthly payments. This will give them the breathing space they need to get their finances back on track, and help ensure they can stay in their homes.</p>
	<p pid="d.683W.12/4">This is a consumer and lender-led scheme, supported by a Government guarantee. The Government want to see this scheme help as many struggling homeowners as possible. We will publish a full impact assessment when the scheme description has been finalised.</p>

	<p pid="d.686W.3/2">The issue of the GB national baseball team competing in the 2009 World Cup is a matter for UK Sport not Sport England, as Sport England does not lead or fund baseball's elite programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.686W.3/3">On March 10, 2008 the Secretary of State approved Sport England's outline strategy to focus resources on building the foundations of sporting success through the creation of a world leading community sports system. One of the key outcomes of this system is the development of well-defined, appropriate talent support systems to underpin NGB&mdash;national governing body&mdash;elite programmes, resulting in more talented performers moving through to world class programmes and success.</p>
	<p pid="d.686W.3/4">Sport England has recently announced four year funding awards to 46 national governing bodies, including the sports of baseball and softball. Sport England has advised that they will be meeting with the sport imminently to discuss the award, which interventions will be funded and to agree how the sport will contribute to Sport England's strategic outcomes, such as the above, over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="d.686W.3/5">UK Sport has advised that its current investment strategy does not provide funding to baseball and has therefore made no estimate of the cost of sending a British baseball team to the final 2008 Olympics qualification event in Taiwan.

	<p pid="d.693W.2/1">Carers currently have access to Jobcentre Plus approved training through a range of New Deal programmes. As part of the National Carers' Strategy, Jobcentre Plus is examining the most effective ways of supporting carers into training. Some carers may need more specialist support because of their caring responsibilities or the length of time they have spent caring. It is envisaged that Jobcentre Plus staff will identify gaps in the provision and work with experienced third sector providers to meet this demand.</p>

	<p pid="d.693W.5/1">Disability living allowance provides a contribution towards the extra costs faced by severely disabled people as a result of a long-term disability. Broadly, entitlement depends on the extent to which the person needs help with personal care, needs supervision or, from the age of three years, has difficulties with walking. In the case of children under the age of 16, disability living allowance can only be paid if their needs are substantially in excess of the typical requirements of a child of the same age.</p>
	<p pid="d.693W.5/2">The increase in expenditure on disability living allowance paid to children broadly reflects the overall increase in disability living allowance expenditure. The reasons for that increase are complex but are mainly attributable to demographic changes, greater awareness of the benefit, improvements in diagnosis for childhood conditions and an extension of the higher rate mobility component to children aged three and four in 2001.</p>

	<p pid="d.699W.2/2"><i> </i>The Government are confident that there is sufficient funding in total for statutory concessionary fares.</p>
	<p pid="d.699W.2/3">The statutory concession was improved from April 2008 to provide free off-peak concessionary bus travel throughout England. An additional &pound;212 million is being provided to local authorities by special grant in 2008-09, rising over the next two years, solely to pay for this improvement of the statutory concession.</p>
	<p pid="d.699W.2/4">In autumn 2007 the Department for Transport consulted widely on the formula used to distribute the grant. The distribution is based on generous assumptions about fares, bus pass take-up, extra journeys and additional costs, taking account of the likely demand in visitor hotspots such as coastal towns, urban centres and tourist destinations.</p>
	<p pid="d.699W.2/5">The special grant is solely to cover the additional cost of the new concession. Funding for the existing elements of the concession, which make up the bulk of the costs, will continue to be provided through Revenue Support Grant and is not separately identified.</p>
	<p pid="d.699W.2/6">The Department proposes to begin consulting shortly on possible changes to the way concessionary travel is administered. Any changes may provide an opportunity to consider how best to distribute the totality of funding.</p>

The life of diesel and electric rolling stock is assumed to be around 30-35 years. During the life of the rolling stock it will undergo a number of major examinations and will normally have improvements made to the interiors of the vehicles.</p>

	<p pid="d.702W.8/1">Whether and how to staff stations are primarily matters for individual operators. The Department for Transport has not therefore carried out any recent study of the effect of staffing on crime. However, the National Passenger Survey includes a question about how safe passengers feel when using stations. In the most recent survey, in autumn 2008, only 8 per cent. of those questioned were dissatisfied with station security.</p>

	<p pid="d.704W.8/1">Since being established in 1994 the Highways Agency has conducted a significant number of feasibility studies which are carried out routinely for projects that are estimated to cost in excess of &pound;5 million. This covers all major infrastructure projects categorised into widening, bypass, junction and technology schemes, consideration of high occupancy vehicle lanes and, more recently, managed motorway improvements. Historically the Highways Agency's operating protocols and governance arrangements have not required discrete tracking of the costs associated with feasibility work but have been managed within overall resource budget allocations provided by central Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.704W.8/2">Taking into account the number of feasibility studies undertaken since 1994, the amount of work required and the need to access a large number of archived records, it has been concluded that the cost associated with identifying the cost of each study is considered disproportionate.</p>

	<p pid="d.705W.3/2">The air quality framework directive (1996/62/EC) and four daughter directives (1999/30/EC, 2000/69/EC, 2002/3/EC, and 2004/107/EC) set out our current obligations in relation to various pollutants in ambient air. Of the pollutants mentioned, the limit values currently in force are for particles measured as particulate matter (PM10). There are also limit values for the protection of vegetation and ecosystems for nitrogen oxides (NOx), but these specifically do not apply to urban areas, or to areas near busy roads.</p>
	<p pid="d.705W.3/3">The limit values for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) do not come into force until 2010. The levels set for ozone (O3) are in the form of either target values, which do not have the same strict compliance criteria as limit values, or long term objectives, which have no compliance date. Other than those for the protection of vegetation and ecosystems, there are no additional limit values for other oxides of nitrogen. A new Council directive on ambient air and cleaner air for Europe (2008/50/EC) consolidates existing legislation and introduces new controls for PM2.5. The limit values for this pollutant are not yet in force.</p>
	<p pid="d.705W.3/4">Under the EU legislation set out above, the UK is required to monitor the air continuously for levels of PM10, PM2.5, N02, NOx (from which levels of NO can be derived), O3 and a number of other pollutants. These data are freely available from the National Air Quality Archive</p>
	<p pid="d.705W.3/5" class="indent"><a href="http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/index.php">http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/index.php</a></p>
	<p pid="d.705W.3/6">This archive contains all the monitoring data collected for and by the Government in relation to air quality since 1962. It also contains details of the monitoring sites currently in use. In addition, the UK was one of a small number of member states to report modelled data alongside monitoring data. The national model used complies with the relevant data quality criteria set out in the various air quality directives, and is validated against monitored data. The annual report complied to accompany the UK submission to the European Commission on air quality is also held on the air quality archive:</p>
	<p pid="d.705W.3/7" class="indent"><a href="http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/reports/cat09/0807231621_dd12006mapsrep_v2.pdf">http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/reports/cat09/0807231621 _dd12006mapsrep_v2.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="d.705W.3/8">This contains maps of roadside and background levels of PM10, and NO2/NOx, although these are not given on a city by city basis; such information is not readily available. Maps for O3 are held in a separate report on the same site:</p>
	<p pid="d.705W.3/9" class="indent"><a href="http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/reports/cat09/0807301054_DD3_mapsrep2006_v2.pdf">http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/reports/cat09/0807301054 _DD3_mapsrep2006_v2.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="d.705W.3/10">These reports also contain a map showing the location and extent of the UK agglomeration and non-agglomeration zones.</p>
	<p pid="d.705W.3/11">The model used to produce these reports is also used to provide projections of future air quality. This is a complex process and is generally only carried out in response to specific policy needs. In predicting future air quality, a &quot;baseline&quot; is constructed to show what effect currently planned measures and policies will have on air quality. Such a baseline has been prepared for 2010, 2011 and 2012 for PM10 and NO2, to support potential applications for time extensions for these pollutants, allowed under the 2008 directive, for compliance with the limit values. A consultation on the application for PM10 will be published shortly; it is planned to initiate a consultation on the application for NO2 towards the end of 2009. One of the outputs from this baseline is an assessment of the agglomeration and non-agglomeration zones predicted to contain locations where the air quality is above the relevant limit value level.</p>
	<p pid="d.705W.3/12">For NO2, the limit value is predicted to be exceeded in all but three zones in England in 2010, all but four in 2011 and all but five in 2012. The zones in compliance are predicted to be Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton, Blackpool Urban Area, and Preston Urban Area in 2010, additionally Bournemouth Urban Area in 2011, and additionally Coventry/Bedworth in 2012.</p>
	<p pid="d.705W.3/13">The outcome of the baseline assessment for PM10 was that two zones&mdash;Greater London and the West Midlands were predicted to be in exceedence in 2010, reducing to one (Greater London) in 2011 and 2012. The extent of the predicted exceedence in 2011 was a total 40km of roads, mainly in central London. However, the baseline assessment had not taken into account all of the traffic and transport measures planned for implementation by the Greater London Authority and Transport for London. Nor did the assessment use the more accurate traffic growth projections prepared by Transport for London for the London area, relying instead on national data. Sensitivity analysis including these measures reduced the total road length exceeding to around 6km, which is well within the uncertainties of the model. Using this additional analysis, there is no exceedence predicted for 2012.</p>

	<p pid="d.708W.2/1">A carbon footprint for the UK water industry was published for the first time in 2008 in &quot;Future Water&quot;, the Government's water strategy for England. The industry emits around five million tonnes of greenhouse gases per year, as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). There are no separate figures for different end-uses, however, the non-domestic sector that includes the industrial, commercial and agricultural sectors is estimated to use 23 per cent. of the public water supply. The industrial sector also uses significant quantities of direct abstractions but it is difficult to estimate the associated carbon emissions due to variability in the extent of treatment and in pumping distances.</p>

Evidence shows that incidents of victimisation decrease and victims are less likely to withdraw from cases. This is why we have provided over &pound;6 million this financial year to support the extension of Advisors and Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences across England and Wales. Also, in 2006-07, local authorities spent over &pound;61 million of their funding allocated through the Supporting People programme on housing-related support services for women at risk of domestic violence. Further, last financial year we provided funding to local authorities worth &pound;47.2 million through the Homelessness Strategy and Support Directorate's grant programmes a proportion of which can be used to develop outreach and other innovative models, such as the sanctuary scheme.</p>

Only professional personnel (for example doctors and lawyers) are recruited at any other than the lowest rank and therefore data has not been provided.</p>

In 2003, the Ministry of Defence asked the MRC to undertake an independent scientific review of all the UK research work that has been carried out into Gulf veterans' illnesses in an international context and to advise on whether there are any areas appropriate for future research. The MRC's recommendations were published on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-22">22 May 2003</phrase> and are available at:</p>

	<p pid="d.720W.8/3">A key recommendation was that future research work should focus on improving the long-term health of veterans with persistent symptoms and proposals on rehabilitation therapies were sought. A contract for research into ways of rehabilitating unwell Gulf veterans was awarded to an expert group at Cardiff University last summer and work is expected to be complete by April 2012. In the event of any new research proposals being made that would add to our knowledge on Gulf health issues then the Ministry of Defence will consider funding any proposal for research which has been formally considered and approved by the MRC.</p>

	<p pid="d.733W.2/1">Approximately &pound;569,000, 4.6 per cent. of DFID's &pound;12.5 million regular programme for Burma in 2008-09 (excluding &pound;45 million emergency relief following Cyclone Nargis) is being delivered via cross-border mechanisms. This figure breaks down as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.733W.2/2" class="indent">&pound;193,000 of DFID's &pound;1 million funding to the Thailand Burma Border Consortium (TBBC) in 2008-09 has been allocated to cross-border humanitarian activities. Since DFID's contribution to TBBC was not earmarked to specific activities, this proportion reflects TBBC's own priorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.733W.2/3" class="indent">DFID is contributing about &pound;300,000 in 2008-09 to cross-border health assistance to Kachin and Shan States from China.</p>
	<p pid="d.733W.2/4" class="indent">Around &pound;76,000 of &pound;220,000 provided to three Burmese non-governmental organisations based in Thailand is being used for humanitarian work inside Burma. The remainder of this funding is used to assist Burmese refugees and migrants in Thailand.</p>

	<p pid="d.734W.6/5">The ARIES Finance, Procurement and Reporting System began in 2004. The initial estimated supplier base cost was &pound;11 million, the initial estimated delivery date was October 2008. The current expected completion date is September 2009 with an estimated supplier cost of &pound;17.6 million. This estimate reflects agreed changes to the scope of the project, a software upgrade, additional consultancy support for change management, development of end-user training materials, and assistance with training and rollout. The primary contractor is Agresso Ltd.</p>
	<p pid="d.734W.6/6">The HR transformation project started in March 2005 and was completed on time in March 2008. The original budget was &pound;6.5 million and the cost on completion was &pound;6.0 million This was primarily a business change project but included a number of smaller IT components.</p>

	<p pid="d.734W.6/12">DFID has also let a number of small IT related contracts. However, our central records do not distinguish IT contracts, so provision of details for these projects would incur disproportionate costs.</p>

	<p pid="d.739W.10/3">In 2004 the Home Office published independent research which found that special measures were working effectively. The study showed that 76 per cent. of witnesses overall were satisfied with special measures. A further breakdown of these statistics for different subgroups of witnesses is available from:</p>
	<p pid="d.739W.10/4" class="indent"><a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs04/r240.pdf">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs04/r240.pdf</a></p>
	<p pid="d.739W.10/5">The research also found that one-third of vulnerable or intimidated witnesses would not be able or willing to give evidence without the assistance of special measures. This rose to 44 per cent. where the witness was a victim of a sexual offence.</p>
	<p pid="d.739W.10/6">Further independent studies include NSPCC research that interviewed 50 young witnesses and concluded that special measures, in particular live links, helped child witnesses who would otherwise have been reluctant to give evidence.</p>
	<p pid="d.739W.10/7">Our own consultation exercise, 'Improving the Criminal Trial Process for Young Witnesses (2007)' found that where young witnesses used special measures, they had significantly more confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>

	<p pid="d.743W.2/1">In family proceedings, the court has power to order periodical payments for maintenance in a variety of situations. The court can order periodical payments to be made for the benefit of a former spouse or civil partner or for the benefit of a child of the family on divorce or on dissolution of a civil partnership. The court can also order payments to be made when a spouse or civil partner has failed to maintain the other party to the marriage or civil partnership or any child of the family. Additionally, the court can also order any parent to make periodical payments for the benefit of a child under schedule 1 to the Children Act 1989.</p>
	<p pid="d.743W.2/2">When making an order for periodical payments for maintenance, the court can order when the payments shall be made, the amount of the payments to be made and the term for which payments may be made. The court can also order periodical payments to be made on an interim basis before the proceedings are finally resolved. It is not possible to set a target for commencement of payments because the court will determine the appropriate date for the first payment after considering the circumstances of each individual case.</p>

	<p pid="d.744W.2/1">The issues of learning disability and learning difficulty are matters where my Department works closely with the Department of Health, the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.744W.2/2">The National Offender Management Service and the Department of Health are shortly to pilot a simple screening tool aimed at identifying the possibility of a learning disability. The results of piloting in three prisons will then inform plans for implementing a screening tool across all care settings in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="d.744W.2/3">In current use with offenders, section 4 of the Offender Assessment System (OASys), assesses level of problems with reading, writing and numeracy and any learning difficulties. OASys is used with offenders sentenced to over 12 months in custody, or on a community sentence, excluding unpaid work.</p>
	<p pid="d.744W.2/4">Through the Learning and Skills Council, we are broadening the assessment requirement for learning difficulties that is placed on offender learning and skills service providers with effect from August 2009. With Dyslexia Action, the Learning and Skills Council is developing tools to identify additional learning needs and a training programme to support their use by its offender learning and skills service providers' staff. This is a matter also under consideration in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="d.744W.2/5">For young people in custody, we intend to place statutory duties on local authorities to fund and commission education in juvenile custody (in England and Wales) and this will include legislation relating to those with special educational needs. In the meantime, we are developing training materials on dyslexia and speech, language and communication needs during 2009-10 for those responsible for education of young people in custody.</p>
	<p pid="d.744W.2/6">To support this greater focus on screening for learning disabilities and difficulties, my Department has worked with the Department of Health to trial a one-day training course for prison officers, aimed increasing awareness of these issues. The training is being rolled out nationally, focused on key staff within each prison: the disability liaison officer; a member of the health care team and a member of the induction team.</p>
	<p pid="d.744W.2/7">Work is also under way to tailor the awareness package for use in probation areas. The training materials to support the probation training are currently under discussion with roll out of the training planned for later this year.</p>

	<p pid="d.745W.6/1">Community sentences are available for all offences that also carry imprisonment. The sentence in any individual case is entirely a matter for the court, which can impose a community sentence if it considers the offence serious enough to warrant that but not so serious if the custody is the only proper response. All sentences are appealable.</p>
	<p pid="d.745W.6/2">Fixed penalty notices are simple non-bureaucratic financial punishments designed to deal with minor crimes on the spot. As their name implies, they are fixed. This concept does not lend itself to reparation. There are alternative, more suitable out-of-court disposals available, such as conditional cautions, where offenders can be required to make reparations such as repairing any damage caused.</p>

	<p pid="d.747W.3/1">The Intermediary Special Measure was piloted in six pathfinder areas and extended nationally after an independent evaluation. The evaluation report indicated that feedback from witnesses and carers was uniformly enthusiastic. Support for intermediaries was almost unanimous across the judiciary and among other criminal justice personnel involved in the pathfinder cases. A summary of the evaluation report is available at:</p>

	<p pid="d.747W.3/5">Our intention is that from April 2009 those who commission intermediaries&mdash;the police, the CPS and defence&mdash;will have the opportunity to provide feedback. This information will be reported to the intermediary governance board on a regular basis and be used to evaluate the service provided by individual intermediaries.</p>

The average waiting times given are estimated from quarterly and monthly Korner returns submitted by health authorities/PCTs to the Department of Health.<br/>  2. Data on waiting times for outpatient appointments was first collected in 1997-98. All patients seen by length of time waited was collected, but only a proportion of the patients not seen. The total number of patients still waiting was first collected in 2004-05. Therefore, to give a meaningful time series data for both seens and not seens have been provided where data was collected. Calculating the average on patients not seen is the preferred method, in line with the method for inpatient waits.<br/>  3. The figures show the median waiting times for patients waiting for a first consultant outpatient appointment following a general practitioner referral. Figures relating to patients who have been seen are based on quarterly data aggregated to an annual figure, and the figures relating to patients who have yet to be seen are based on a stock month end figure at the end of the year. Calculations are made on aggregate data, rather than patient level data, and therefore are only estimates of the position on average waits.<br/>  4. The median, rather than the mean, is the preferred measure for average waiting times. This is because the mean waiting time can be skewed by small numbers of long waiters, and is therefore higher than the median.<br/>  5. Figures are shown for organisations in existence at the time.</td> </tr>

	<p pid="d.753W.2/1">No legal advice has been sought or received on the specific issue of access rights to summary care records. Summary care records are no different in this respect from any other confidential personal patient information held by national health service organisations. Access rights are set out in statute, most particularly the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Access to Health Records Act 1990.</p>
	<p pid="d.753W.2/2">In the absence of a statutory right of access to information, an individual may only gain access to information where doing so meets the confidentiality requirements established under the common law. Confidentiality requirements are set out in the Department's publication &quot;Confidentiality: NHS Code of Practice (2003)&quot; which was endorsed by the Information Commissioner, the General Medical Council and the Department's legal advisers. A copy of the publication has been placed in the Library. In line with these requirements, access to summary care record information is only permitted to clinical staff who have a legitimate relationship with the patient for which consent may be implied, for example because they are providing NHS healthcare or treatment, or who have express consent from the patient for other reasons, for example clinical research. Exceptionally, confidential information may be passed to third parties in accordance with certain specific statutory provisions or where required under court order, or where the public interest is such that both the obligations of confidentiality and the competing public interest in the provision of confidential health services need to be overridden.</p>

	<p pid="d.757W.5/1">Information about the number/proportion of beds that are in mixed sex wards is not collected centrally. However, the Healthcare Commission's annual national in-patient survey does provide data relating to mixed sex accommodation. For Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust, the survey shows that in 2007<sup>(1)</sup>, 36.8 per cent. of respondents reported sharing their sleeping area with a patient of the opposite sex upon first admission to the hospital.</p>
	<p pid="d.757W.5/2">Our guidance to the national health service has always required single sex accommodation rather than single sex wards. Even within a mixed ward, good single sex accommodation can be achieved by using single rooms or single sex bays and toilet facilities.</p>
	<p pid="d.757W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-28">28 January 2009</phrase>, the Department announced a six-month programme to eliminate mixed sex accommodation, this includes a &pound;100 million 'Privacy and Dignity Fund' to support local improvements and tough financial penalties from 2010-11 for those trusts that do not deliver.</p>

	<p pid="d.758W.2/1">Under this Government 76 private finance initiative funded schemes (with capital value over &pound;10 million); 225 public capital projects over &pound;1 million using the Procure 21 Framework agreement have opened; and 196 local improvement finance trust facilities have opened. Detailed records on schemes below these capital cost thresholds and other public capital funded schemes are not held centrally.

This spending is being brought forward from financial year 2010-11 to 2009-10.</p>
	<p pid="d.758W.2/3">The Department will have &pound;5.6 billion of public capital resources in 2009-10. This funding is fully committed albeit based on plans that are still being finalised.</p>
	<p pid="d.758W.2/4">The 2008-09 capital departmental expenditure limit for the Department is &pound;4.7 billion. This funding is fully committed against national and local national health service capital spending programmes. The latest forecast outturn suggests that the great majority of available capital resources will be spent in 2008-09.</p>

	<p pid="d.759W.2/1">There is provision within the Pharmaceutical Services (Advanced and Enhanced Services) (England) Directions 2005 to allow primary care trusts to notify pharmacists in their area of the categories of patients who would benefit from the provision of Medicines Use Review (MUR) services. The pharmacist should consider this in determining who to offer the service to.</p>
	<p pid="d.759W.2/2">Further, the White Paper 'Pharmacy in England: Building on strengths&mdash;delivering the future' makes clear we are concerned that the provision of MUR services is currently geared to rewarding the volume of MURs undertaken. We believe it is necessary for MUR services to be prioritised to meet health needs. NHS Employers (NHSE) and the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC) have discussed a mechanism for delivering this objective and ensuring funding rewards health outcomes. NHSE and PSNC have now presented their proposals to the Department, which are being considered.</p>

	<p pid="d.759W.5/2">It is for SHAs and PCTs to determine how to use this funding most effectively to meet the needs of their local populations. However, departmental officials are working with SHAs to provide advice and spread good practice. Priority areas include encouraging innovation and ensuring equitable access to all methods of contraception including long acting reversible (LARC) methods.

	<p pid="d.766W.8/2"><i> </i>BERR officials have discussed this issue with the European Commission on several occasions last year, as WTO disputes are a matter of Community competence.</p>
	<p pid="d.766W.8/3">No disciplines on subsidies exist under the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services, and Canada has not made any specific market access commitments with regard to computer games services.</p>
	<p pid="d.766W.8/4">On the basis of information examined to date, the Government currently share the Commission's analysis that there therefore appears to be little or no scope to bring a complaint to the WTO in relation to any subsidies Canada may be granting to video games producers established in Canada.</p>
	<p pid="d.766W.8/5">However, we have passed to the Commission additional details recently received from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA) in response to earlier questions from the Commission.</p>

	<p pid="d.766W.18/1">The Government believe that the regulations governing the enforcement of unpaid council tax are robust enough to keep any errors in the system at a minimum, and provide ample opportunity for citizens to establish that there has been an error. Local authorities are legally required to send the taxpayer at least two reminders about unpaid council tax before seeking a liability order from the court. They are required, in second reminders, to give the taxpayer 14 days within which payment of any outstanding amount must be paid and a warning that the local authority will apply to the magistrates court for a liability order if the debt remains outstanding after 14 days. The person summoned may appear before the court and always has an opportunity to establish that the council tax has been demanded in error. The court is required to satisfy itself that the sum demanded has become payable by the defendant and has not been paid. Commissioning such research would therefore not be a prudent use of public money.</p>

On <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-24">24 November</phrase> we brought forward additional capital spending as part of the 2008 pre-Budget report fiscal stimulus. Considering together the September housing announcement and the pre-Budget report, we are making &pound;330 million, &pound;1.195 billion and &pound;55 million of capital available for expenditure on housing in years 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11 respectively. A further &pound;100 million is being brought forward for regeneration programmes in 2008-10.

	<p pid="d.774W.5/2">This total package of &pound;1.775 billion includes the additional flexibility offered by the Government, at the pre-Budget report, to the regional development agencies to bring forward &pound;100 million of capital expenditure from financial year 2010-11 to 2009-10. Communities and Local Government and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform are currently working closely with the regional development agencies to take this forward.</p>

Communities and Local Government will invite local authorities in England to bring forward up to this amount to enable councils to invest in a way which will maximise investment in the housing stock in 2009-10.</p>

	<p pid="d.776W.8/1">The way in which student halls of residence are treated for planning policy purposes and valuation purposes differs. Under the planning system, uses of land and buildings are categorised through reference to the Town and Country (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended). It is for local planning authorities to determine, in the first instance, depending on the individual circumstances of each case, whether student halls of residence would fall under one of the residential use classes or would be considered 'sui generis' (i.e. does not fit into any of the specified use classes).</p>
	<p pid="d.776W.8/2">For valuation purposes, student halls of residence are treated as domestic property, and subject to council tax bandings. Where they form part of the same hereditament as a college, they will be treated as composite property. The value of the domestic element of a composite is apportioned out of the value of the whole. Though they are banded, they are an exempt class under Class M of the Council Tax (Exempt Dwellings) Order 1992 (SI No 558), and no council tax is payable.</p>

	<p pid="d.778W.0/1">The information on each of the five projects is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="d.778W.0/2" class="italic"> 1. Power</p>
	<p pid="d.778W.0/3">The lead partner is South East England Development Agency. The project will explore ways to move towards a low carbon economy at regional level, in particular re-formulating regional development strategies and policy instruments and identifying effective forms of sub-regional action which also contribute to regional competitiveness. The seven participating regions will work towards achieving long-term policy objectives around low carbon by finding the best way forward.</p>
	<p pid="d.778W.0/4" class="italic"> 2. SEE</p>
	<p pid="d.778W.0/5">The lead partner is Design Wales. The project will share information on policies that have been successful in using design to boost innovation, entrepreneurship, sustainability or economic development. The project has a partnership of 11 organisations, which targets small and medium enterprises and their lack of resources for implementing design practice and innovation into their business.</p>
	<p pid="d.778W.0/6" class="italic"> 3. PIMMS Transfer</p>
	<p pid="d.778W.0/7">The lead partner is the London borough of Bromley. The project builds on the 'transfer methodology' developed under Interreg IIIC, which identified the critical success factors behind best practice case studies in mobility management. It aims to stimulate modal shift towards more sustainable forms of transport by increasing the implementation of high quality mobility management techniques and policies in European regions and to extend, deepen and promote best practice in mobility management. The partnership is composed of 15 organisations from 15 countries.</p>
	<p pid="d.778W.0/8" class="italic"> 4. GRaBS</p>
	<p pid="d.778W.0/9">The lead partner is the Town and Country Planning Association. The Green and Blue Space Adaptation for Urban Areas and Eco Towns project aims to improve the regional decision and policy making process in relation to the planning and development of new and existing urban areas in nine member states in the context of climate change. It comprises 14 partners.</p>
	<p pid="d.778W.0/10" class="italic"> 5. RAPIDE</p>
	<p pid="d.778W.0/11">The lead partner is the South West Regional Development Agency. The project deals with the role of the public sector in stimulating innovation in regions, in particular helping mainly small businesses bring innovative products to market more quickly. By focusing on good practices already identified in partner regions, it aims to develop robust, workable action plans that each region will implement. The project includes 13 partners from 11 member states.</p>

	<p pid="d.781W.2/1">If targets included in local area agreements (whether targets related to carbon emissions or otherwise) are not achieved in full it can result in a lower level of performance reward grant. My Department consulted on the operation of a new reward scheme for local areas in 2008, based upon local area agreements. This will be related to targets agreed by local authorities and their partners and our intention is to judge the amount of reward payable by reference to average performance across the targets agreed within the LAA. Responses to this consultation are being considered and an announcement will be made shortly.</p>
	<p pid="d.781W.2/2">The Carbon Reduction Commitment is a mandatory cap and trade scheme designed to cover emissions from large business and public sector organisations which the Government intend to bring in to operation in 2010. Large local authorities are expected to qualify for the scheme. There will be no targets for individual organisations in the scheme, but an overall cap will be applied to the sector. Revenue raised from CRC will be recycled back to participants. To incentivise improved energy efficiency, the revenues repaid to participants will be subject to a bonus or penalty related to their relative performance compared to other participants. In 2010-11 the maximum bonus or penalty will be +/-10 per cent. rising to 50 per cent. in later years.

In academic year 2007-08 there were 3,700 students with at least one child under three who were receiving childcare grant. While information is available on students who receive a childcare grant, information is not held centrally which identifies students with children under three who do not apply for a childcare grant. Therefore the proportion of students with children under three who receive a childcare grant is not known. Students receiving childcare grant make up around 1 per cent. of higher education students applying for some form of student finance support.</p>

	<p pid="d.800W.5/2">The Ministry of Justice is co-ordinating the Government's response to the report of the Joint Committee on the draft Constitutional Renewal Bill. We continue to give careful consideration to the recommendations on protests around Parliament which are set out in the Joint Committee's report and a full response will be published ahead of the Constitutional Renewal Bill's introduction to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="d.800W.5/3">The Government are keen to give a substantial response to the Joint Committee but this has meant resolving all outstanding policy issues before the Bill is introduced. We recognise that there has been a long period since the publication of the report, but believe it is better to respond fully to the committee's recommendations on all aspects of the draft Bill. We intend to respond as early as possible in 2009.</p>

	<p pid="d.800W.8/1">Drug treatment is the responsibility of the Department for Health, and the Home Office does not therefore commit any of the Department's budget to drug treatment.</p>
	<p pid="d.800W.8/2">Figures published in the Updated Drug Strategy 2002 show estimates of the labelled and non-labelled total expenditure on drugs, and on strands of the strategy, calculated on the basis of its four thematic aims. Elements of enforcement fall within two of these four aims&mdash;supply reduction and protecting communities&mdash;although these aims will also include expenditure on items which do not relate to enforcement of the law. As it is not possible to disaggregate these figures, those which have been given for expenditure on enforcement from 2003-04 to 2005-06 will therefore exceed the real level of expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="d.800W.8/3">Figures for 2006-07, while not published, have been calculated on the same basis as those for 2003-04 to 2005-06. Figures for 2007-08 and 2008-09 are labelled expenditure only, as published in the drug strategy Drugs: protecting families and communities. These figures have been calculated on a departmental basis and, while expenditure on enforcement activity will fall broadly within the departmental expenditure of the Home Office, the figure will exceed the real level of expenditure on enforcement activity only. Similarly, the Department of Health will fund activity which would not fall within a rigid definition of treatment, nor is all expenditure on treatment&mdash;particularly that for young people&mdash;covered by the Department of Health budget. These figures should therefore be treated as indicative.</p>

	<p pid="d.819W.0/1">There are provisions for sports people under Tier 2 and Tier 5 of the points based system. Those entering under Tier 2: Sport need to meet an English language requirement, while those entering under Tier 5 will not. This is due to the temporary nature of Tier 5. Those entering under the Tier 5: Creative and Sporting sub-category, are granted leave for a maximum of 12 months. These routes are available to all sports.</p>
	<p pid="d.819W.0/2">We have provided arrangements exclusively for footballers to enable them to switch from Tier 5: Creative and Sporting into Tier 2: Sport without having to leave the UK. This is because we have recognised that the tight time scales around the transfer window mean that not all football players will have time to take an English test to prove that they are able to meet the English language requirement for Tier 2: Sport. Therefore they will be able to switch in country from Tier 5 to Tier 2 once they can prove they meet the English language requirement.</p>

For the 2007-08 financial year the average cost of processing and issuing a UK passport in the UK was &pound;55.69 per passport. The provisional average cost for the 2008-09 financial year is &pound;57.35 per passport. The difference between these costs and the final cost of the passport is the FCO fee which varies according to the final price of the product.</p>

	<p pid="d.832W.6/1">ContactPoint is an online tool to enable support for children and young people to be effectively coordinated and ensure that they do not slip through the net. It will contain basic identifying information about all children and young people in England, up to their 18th birthday, and contact details for their parents/carers and for services working with a child or young person and nothing more. ContactPoint will be the quick way for practitioners to find out who else is working with the same child.</p>
	<p pid="d.832W.6/2">Shielding of a small proportion of records on ContactPoint is an additional precautionary measure appropriate in the case of children who are at risk of significant harm if their whereabouts were to become known. Parents who believe this to be the case can contact their local authority and make a request for the record to be shielded on ContactPoint. Local authorities will apply the criteria set out in statutory guidance to determine whether it is appropriate to shield the record on ContactPoint. Such decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis and may take into account the level of threat posed, and the views of the child or young person in question, their parents or carers and any practitioners involved with the child.</p>
	<p pid="d.832W.6/3">Where the child, young person, parent/carer or practitioner disagrees with a shielding decision, they should follow existing procedures in the local authority for complaints and appeals.</p>
	<p pid="d.832W.6/4">Comprehensive national guidance on shielding policy and processes has been made available to all local authorities:</p>
	<p pid="d.832W.6/5" class="indent">The ContactPoint Guidance, which was made available to local authorities in July 2008, sets out the policy on shielding.</p>
	<p pid="d.832W.6/6" class="indent">Best Practice Processes: Manage Data, which was made available to local authorities in August 2008, sets out the recommended business processes for shielding.</p>
	<p pid="d.832W.6/7" class="indent">Additional guidance, produced in response to specific questions asked by local authorities, was made available in December 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.832W.6/8">The policy and processes for shielding have been informed by the experience of a range of bodies including the Children's Society, Women's Aid, the Greater London Domestic Violence Project, the National Police Improvement Agency and the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p>
	<p pid="d.832W.6/9">We are not in a position at this early point to provide a definitive figure for numbers of records that may be shielded. However, early indications are that between one and two hundred records on average may be shielded in each local authority.</p>

	<p pid="d.833W.2/1">The total costs for implementing the system are estimated at &pound;224 million, unchanged since I announced in December 2005 that the Government would proceed with this project. These estimated costs include the costs of adapting systems that will supply the data to ContactPoint and adapting the day-to-day systems used by practitioners so they can access ContactPoint from their own systems. It also includes the costs to ensure security, data accuracy and staff training. Operating costs thereafter are estimated to be &pound;41 million per year.

These assessments offer a detailed analysis of the extent of the provision of, and demand for, child care places, and identify any gaps in such provision. The duty to secure sufficient child care which came into force in April 2008 requires local authorities progressively to eliminate gaps in provision and I would expect all local authorities to be working to close gaps they have identified.</p>

The Department for Children Schools and Families (DCSF) is a key partner in this work and we are committed to doing all we can to tackle forced marriage and to engage effectively with local communities. We work closely with the Forced Marriage Unit to improve the engagement of schools and local authorities. In April 2008 DCSF Ministers wrote to local authorities and schools reminding them of their responsibilities relating to forced marriage, and in June 2008 new materials were launched to raise awareness of forced marriage. These were sent to all secondary schools, pupil referral units, local authorities and local safeguarding children boards. In November 2008 new statutory guidance was published aimed at local authorities and other agencies entitled &quot;The Right to Choose: Multi-agency statutory guidance for dealing with Forced Marriage&quot;. Practice guidelines to support the implementation of this statutory guidance are being developed and will be available shortly.</p>

	<p pid="d.835W.2/1">Every Child a Reader (ECaR) was established by the KPMG Every Child a Chance Trust in 2005, and from September 2008 is being rolled out by the National Strategies on behalf of Government. By 2010-11, it aims to support the bottom 5 per cent. (approximately 30,000) of children aged 5 and 6 who are struggling to learn to read. It combines one-to-one Reading Recovery support with other less intensive interventions. The programme works on a cascade model whereby each local authority funds Teacher Leader training, and Teacher Leaders, in turn, train Reading Recovery teachers to deliver one-to-one tuition and coordinate the programme in schools. Forty-two Teacher Leaders have so far been trained, and a further 20 local authorities selected a Teacher Leader to undertake the required Masters level training from September 2008. A further cohort will begin training from September 2009, putting us on course to reach 30,000 children a year by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="d.835W.2/2">In November 2008, the KPMG Every Child a Chance Trust published their final report on the three-year ECaR pilot. This found that the programme has continued to deliver reliable results for children, both in terms of raising attainment levels and narrowing the social and gender gap. Over 86 per cent. of children who received Reading Recovery in year 1 went on to meet national expectations (level 2+) in reading at the end of KS1, in comparison to 84 per cent. nationally.</p>
	<p pid="d.835W.2/3">Every Child Counts (ECC) is a mathematics intervention programme targeted at the bottom 5 per cent. (around 30,000) of children aged 6 and 7 who are struggling with numeracy. The programme combines one-to-one Numbers Count support with other less intensive interventions. ECC builds on the relationship with the KPMG Every Child a Chance Trust, established to deliver the ECaR programme. The National Strategies will lead on the national roll-out from 2010. This follows a two-year development phase which began in September 2008.</p>
	<p pid="d.835W.2/4">ECC follows the same structure as ECaR. Twenty-one local authorities started the pilot programme in September 2008, each with a Teacher Leader training at Masters level, directing the work at a local level among schools and training Numbers Count teachers. From September 2009, a further cohort will begin training, expanding the programme until national roll-out in 2010.</p>
	<p pid="d.835W.2/5">Data from the research phase showed that 73 per cent. of children receiving the Numbers Count intervention went on to achieve level 2 or above at the end of KS1. Before receiving the programme, none of these children were predicted to reach age-level expectations at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="d.842W.2/1">The requirements to display a Display Energy Certificate (DEC) for an existing school and an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for a new school are legal requirements, for which the enforcement responsibility rests with Local Trading Standards Offices. We do not keep records of whether schools have incurred penalties for non-compliance or of penalties. The Department's contribution is to help schools comply. To that end, we have issued guidance on the Teachernet website for all schools on the requirement for DECs in schools<sup>(1)</sup>. We have no plans for further action beyond this.</p>

Individual school energy data are kept confidential and Communities and Local Government only receive aggregated data from the register. There are no plans to publish individual school energy data although many local authorities and schools hold these data themselves. Communities and Local Government are developing a data handling strategy for the aggregate data which should be in place by April this year. From an existing extract of provisional data from <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-19">19 December 2008</phrase> we know that, at that date, 28 secondary schools and 64 primary schools had EPCs. The numbers of these schools in each of the efficiency bands is given in the following table. To put these figures into perspective the average non-domestic EPC rating is currently a 'C'.</p>

	<p pid="d.842W.2/18">We are asking Communities and Local Government for a similar data extract for Display Energy Certificates and will be able to supply the efficiency band percentage splits to the hon. Member in the next two weeks. We will be discussing how future reports of the percentage splits can be made public with CLG as part of the development of their strategy for DEC and EPC data.</p>
	<p pid="d.842W.2/19">The data extract we have from CLG also lists the main heating fuel for all the schools. Where Biomass is the main heating fuel it is therefore listed. The three schools which have achieved 'A' ratings all have used biomass as the main heating fuel. This shows the impact that the use of biomass can have on the carbon rating of a school. No other renewables are identifiable on the data provided.</p>
	<p pid="d.842W.2/20">The Department requires that newly constructed schools, including those within Building Schools for the Future, meet a carbon emissions reduction of 60 per cent. relative to the energy efficiency standards in 2002 building regulations. Additional funding has been provided for more than 200 schools in Building Schools for the Future and the academies programme to fund the implementation of energy efficiency and renewable energy measures on school sites to enable this requirement to be met. We have developed a 'carbon calculator'&mdash;a software tool&mdash;which allows users to compare the likely effectiveness of various energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions, and to demonstrate how they would achieve the 60 per cent. reduction. We have received completed carbon calculators for 53 school projects which are currently in design<sup>(4)</sup>.</p>
	<p pid="d.842W.2/21">Partnerships for Schools monitors the compliance of the carbon ratings of school designs with government targets and in PFI schools ensures that the payment mechanism during the contract period (normally 25 years) reflects the DCSF policy on energy use. A low carbon rating may be due to energy efficient design or the employment of low and zero carbon fuels, including renewables.</p>

	<p pid="d.845W.0/1">Personal finance education is currently covered in the primary curriculum as part of the non-statutory framework for Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education and Citizenship. Sir Jim Rose is currently carrying out an independent review of the primary curriculum, including PSHE education, and will report in March 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.845W.0/2">The new 'economic wellbeing and financial capability' programme of study has been taught in secondary schools since September 2008 as part of the revised secondary non-statutory curriculum for PSHE education. The place of economic wellbeing in the curriculum will be further strengthened by our intention to consult on making PSHE education statutory.</p>
	<p pid="d.845W.0/3">The Government have also committed &pound;11.5 million over three years to support financial education in schools. This includes provision to improve Continuing Professional Development (CPD) in financial capability for teachers. Standard Q15 in our standards for the award of Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) requires all trainee teachers at Key Stage 3 and 4 to demonstrate a familiarity with economic wellbeing and financial capability. Teachers of Business Education in the secondary phase will receive training in aspects of personal finance relevant to the 14-19 curriculum. We are working with the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) to develop a specialist PSHE education route through Initial Teacher Training.</p>
