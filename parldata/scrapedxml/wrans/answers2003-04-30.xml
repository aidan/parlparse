However the recent pensions Green Paper explained that the average UK age of withdrawal from the labour force of retirement is relatively high compared to most other EU member states, and set out a range of measures to enable those wishing to work for longer to do so.</p>

	<p pid=".375W.5/1">For the purposes of the public finance projections, the following audited assumption has been adopted since the 1999 pre-Budget report:</p>
	<p pid=".375W.5/2" class="indent">&quot;The oil price will be based on the average of independent forecasts for one year ahead. If the average of independent forecasts shows a fall in the oil price, that price in real terms will be used for the remainder of the five year forecast period. If the average of independent forecasts for one year ahead shows a rise, then the previous convention that oil prices would be close to their current levels in nominal dollar terms over the coming year, and remain flat in real terms thereafter, will be adopted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".375W.5/3">Between Budget 1997 and the 1999 pre-Budget report it was assumed that oil prices remained close to recent levels in the short term and thereafter remained flat in real terms. These assumptions are set out in more detail in Audit of Assumptions for the pre-Budget report November 1997 (HC 361, Session 1997&ndash;98), Audit of the Future Oil Price Convention for the November 1999 pre-Budget report (HC 873, Session 1998&ndash;99) and Audit of Assumptions for the 2002 pre-Budget report (HC 109, Session 2002&ndash;03).</p>

Such a comprehensive survey of assets and debt does not currently exist in the UK. However, as the recent pensions Green Paper made clear, it is essential to develop good-quality data about people's saving over time; their overall assets; and the savings and assets of partners. Action is being taken to address these issues. The Office for National Statistics recently reviewed pension contribution statistics. This review highlighted a number of new data sources that are currently planned or under way, including a survey of assets and wealth.</p>

Whether first payment of the Child Tax Credit is due in April or May depends on whether people are due to receive it weekly or four weekly. Two thirds of all claimants are due to receive their direct payments of tax credits every four weeks. If they sent their claim to the Inland Revenue by the end of January, and there are no outstanding enquiries, they can expect to receive their first tax credit payments no later than <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-02">2 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".376W.9/3">The vast majority of those opting to be paid weekly and who claimed by the end of January should have received their money already. Claimants are being contacted in the small minority of cases where further information is needed to process their claims.</p>

	<p pid=".381W.2/1">The Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee's (RWMAC's) Advice to Ministers on the Management of Low Activity Solid Radioactive Wastes Within the United Kingdom was published in March 2003. What the Committee pointed out is that as nuclear site decommissioning plans, including those on which nuclear power stations have operated, progress, and radioactive contamination is identified and characterised, substantial volumes of building rubble and soil with levels of contamination at the bottom of the low level waste activity range&mdash;of the order of that of the very low level wastes produced by small users&mdash;are being identified. Initial estimates of volumes are set out in Annex 4 of the RWMAC report and amount in total to more than 3,300,000 cubic metres, of which more than 3,000,000 cubic metres is attributed to the Sellafield site. The Committee believe that a substantial proportion of this very low activity waste from nuclear site decommissioning and clean-up activities has not been included in past inventories, although they acknowledge that, at this stage, estimates are very approximate.</p>

	<p pid=".381W.5/1">The latest 2001 United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory describes four categories of waste&mdash;high level wastes, intermediate level wastes, low level wastes and very low level wastes. The definitions of these categories correspond with those given in the 1995 White Paper, &quot;Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy: Final Conclusions&quot; (Cm2919). The inventory records total UK stocks and projected future arisings under the first three of these categories, based on latest estimates provided by those responsible for the wastes. The fourth, the very low level wastes category, which is intended to apply in particular to wastes produced by &quot;small users&quot; of radioactivity&mdash;such as hospitals, universities, research laboratories and non-nuclear industries&mdash;contains very little radioactivity, and no central records of arisings are compiled or contained in the inventory.</p>

	<p pid=".383W.2/37" class="indent">CSL has no formal definition of what constitutes &quot;long-term&quot; sick leave but does automatically refer to Occupational Health all staff who are absent for more than 90 days. Our records show that the numbers of staff on long-term sick leave (i.e. exceeding the 90-day absence referral point) were as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".383W.2/40"> <th>Year</th> <th></th> </tr>

			<tr pid=".383W.2/43"> <td>1998</td> <td>2</td> </tr>

			<tr pid=".383W.2/47"> <td>2002</td> <td>7</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".383W.2/50">CSL has been successful in managing sickness absence through innovations such as recruiting a dedicated Occupational Health professional, running regular health awareness campaigns and carrying out all-staff health surveys.

	<p pid=".391W.2/3">The Ministry of Defence does not take the lead in any area, but regularly provides support to lead agencies and Departments in responding to civil contingencies through the provision of Military Assistance to the Civil Authorities (MACA). In doing so, the Department draws on its military, scientific, and technical expertise. The Department plays a similar supporting role in preparation and planning the response to these contingencies. With the exception of a small number of specialist operations, however, no assets are dedicated to the task. Support draws on those resources available at the time. Unless life is in danger, the civil authorities are charged for this support.</p>

The Home Office and other Departments and agencies were involved in this work, and the MOD actively sought the views of the public.

These include improvements to the regional command and control mechanism across the United Kingdom, the formation of 14 Civil Contingencies Reaction Forces (drawing on the Armed Forces Reserves) and an enhanced role for 2 Signal Brigade. All of these improvements are designed to enhance the MOD's capacity to provide support in the event of a serious terrorist incident in the UK.

It discusses a range of EU-related visa matters relating mainly to the development of a common visa policy under the Schengen acquis, including the introduction of a uniform format visa. This forms part of the process of negotiation which culminates in legislative proposals being considered by the Council of Ministers. Domestically, such legislative proposals are submitted to Parliament under established scrutiny procedures and are considered and reported on by the House of Lords European Union Committee, the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee, and the devolved administrations in Wales and Scotland.</p>

	<p pid=".402W.9/7">Priority to date has been to establish Connexions across the whole of England</p>
	<p pid=".402W.9/8">This has now been achieved, with nearly 9000 Personal Advisers and front line delivery staff in post at the end of February 2003. Increasing numbers of young people are being helped by Connexions, and partner agencies are reported to be working more closely together. Ofsted findings are being analysed nationally to inform future planning at national and local level. Evidence from the first wave of evaluation at national level should be available from summer 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".403W.0/2">The Connexions Service is marketed primarily at local level through the 47 Connexions Partnerships. This is for two reasons&mdash;the local nature of the delivery of the Service and the incremental roll out of the Service, which meant that it was not available nationally until April 2003. (The first partnerships went live in April 2001 and the last in April 2003.)</p>
	<p pid=".403W.0/3">The Connexions Service National Unit has supported that local activity with two bursts of nationally funded marketing in areas where Connexions was live, using media that could be bought regionally. The marketing focused on raising awareness of the Service's existence among young people. The bursts were:</p>
	<p pid=".403W.0/4" class="indent">February to March 2002 (advertising on radio and outdoor poster sites)</p>
	<p pid=".403W.0/5" class="indent">November 2002&mdash;January 2003 (advertising at local cinemas, on local radio stations and on outdoor poster sites)</p>
	<p pid=".403W.0/6">Other marketing activity has been focused on communicating with stakeholders, practitioners and the wider public via specialist, sector and regional press.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.0/7">At a national level, the total expenditure on the above nationally funded marketing to date has been &pound;3,446,898.21.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.0/8">Individual partnerships receive grant funding from the Department to provide services for young people. Part of that grant is spent on marketing. The National Unit does not require partnerships to provide information on spend to the level of detail that would allow a meaningful figure to be provided for the total expenditure for all partnerships to date.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.0/9">The effectiveness of Connexions' national marketing is evaluated in two ways tracking research conducted pre and post advertising activity and quarterly media evaluation to assess the effectiveness of our media activity and penetration across our target audiences.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.0/10">Tracking research was conducted for both bursts of advertising to assess its effectiveness by monitoring levels of awareness of Connexions among 13&ndash;19 year olds. Following the February to March advertising campaign, awareness of Connexions among young people rose from 27 per cent. to 36 per cent. Pre-advertising research also showed that 32 per cent. of young people didn't know what Connexions was&mdash;this figure fell to 19 per cent. following the advertising.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.0/11">Research conducted before the second burst of advertising in November 2002 recorded awareness levels of 35 per cent.. Following the advertising this figure increased to 51%. Young people also reported that their use of the Service during the period of the advertising rose from 9 per cent. to 16 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".403W.0/12">Separate ongoing evaluation of media coverage for the Connexions Service is also conducted. The latest report (to the end of January 2003) shows that reach among adults in England is at 39 per cent. with 100 per cent. of articles appearing in the last quarter as strongly or slightly favourable.</p>

	<p pid=".404W.5/1">One of the key principles of Connexions is that Partnerships will listen to, and take account of, the views of young people in the design, delivery and evaluation of the service. In the first operational year over 18,000 young people were involved in shaping the service through local activity and at a national level. All Partnerships employ at least one person with responsibility for youth participation and they support youth forums and other activities.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.5/2">Connexions has involved young people in a variety of ways. Young people from all backgrounds and ages have been involved. They have undertaken specific roles, ranging from consultation to peer research.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.5/3">Young people have played a key role in the selection of Partnership staff up to and including Chief Executives.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.5/4">Young people have also helped to develop guidance for Connexions Partnerships on such subjects as involving young people in the governance of Connexions Partnerships, developing Connexions Youth Charters and involving 'hard to reach' young people.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.5/5">Their feedback has directly influenced policies and procedures. Over 200 one stop shops have been established as a result of young people's views.</p>
	<p pid=".404W.5/6">The achievements of Connexions in actively involving young people were recognised in December 2002 by being awarded runner up status in the Young People's category of the Institute of Public Policy Research/Guardian Public Involvement Awards.</p>

	<p pid=".405W.2/1">In October 2002, the Connexions Service National Unit published its &quot;Strategy for Engaging the Voluntary and Community Sector in Connexions&quot;. That strategy includes many actions which will enhance the effectiveness of voluntary organisations working with young people. Examples include the creation of &quot;VCS Liaison Officer&quot; type posts to encourage the participation of smaller organisations and to provide information and support; VCS representation on Connexions Boards and other local fora; establishment of a Good Practice Database; development of a set of clear goals and performance indicators for Connexions Partnerships working with the VCS and newsletter and electronic mailing.</p>
	<p pid=".405W.2/2">Connexions Partnerships will decide how to implement the strategy locally, including any grant awards for capacity building.</p>
	<p pid=".405W.2/3">In addition the Department for Education and Skills' National Voluntary Youth Organisation (NVYO) Grant Scheme is the only source of direct Government support for the voluntary youth sector. The current cycle of grants to the headquarters of 90 NVYOs supports a total of 98 projects.</p>
	<p pid=".405W.2/4">DfES has also made allocations from the &quot;Transforming Youth Work Development Fund&quot; to the NVYOs. &pound;2 million was allocated in 2002&ndash;03 and &pound;1 million in 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".405W.2/5">A further aspect of the DfES' strategy is the Neighbourhood Support Fund (NSF). The NSF supports local (and often small) voluntary and community organisations to provide innovative projects, and aims to create and develop local capacity to address the issues associated with the hardest to reach young people. There are currently around 650 NSF projects within 40 of the most deprived local authority areas with a total budget of &pound;60 million (until September 2003). In the next phase we plan to embed NSF fully into Connexions.</p>

	<p pid=".409W.3/3">The programme was introduced in three phases.</p>

	<p pid=".409W.3/9">Lancashire(2), Tameside, Cumbria, Kirklees(2), Walsall, Coventry, Croydon, Portsmouth, Kent,</p>

	<p pid=".409W.3/12">From September further clusters will be created in the following authorities: Kent(3), Lincolnshire(3), Northamptonshire, Essex , Derbyshire, Havering, Bexley, Swindon and North Lincolnshire. The current Phase 2 Solihull Partnership will convert to a cluster.</p>
	<p pid=".409W.3/13">In addition:</p>

Schools PFI contracts in England are between Local Authorities and the private sector and 56 such contracts have been signed to date. Typically they are contracts for between 25 and 30 years. Two of these contracts involve consortia including Amey pic. However, since contract signature Amey has sold its equity stake in these projects although it continues to deliver support services. The position of equity holders in projects can vary over time but this does not necessarily impact on the quality, continuity or the ongoing financial viability of the project itself. The procurement process includes an assessment of the financial viability of bids to ensure they are robust over the long term and the contracts include arrangements for dealing with possible early termination.</p>

	<p pid=".416W.2/2">Since the publication of the White Paper in May 2002, there has not been any specific development of this Department's training and development programmes to raise awareness of devolution and regional awareness, but the recent launch of &quot;Delivering Through People: A Human Resource Strategy for DfES&quot; commits the Department to developing HR action plans to maximise the contribution of each of our four sites in delivering the Department's business.</p>
	<p pid=".416W.2/3">Interchange is the exchange of staff between the civil service and other public and private sector organisation in the regions for periods of a few weeks up to five years. Interchange promotes better understanding between organisations and is a practical and effective form of personal development as it gives staff first hand experience of a different work environment and the issue and challenges which the people working in it face. Secondees have an opportunity to learn new skills, new ways of working, and new ways of dealing with problems. The DfES is actively committed to making interchange available to peoples at all levels as it can be a real benefit to the individual and to the Department as a whole.</p>

	<p pid=".419W.2/1">The Tribunal does not collate statistics based on the location of schools named in appeals or the schools attended by children who are the subject of appeals. However, it does collect information by local education authority (LEA). Of the 19 appeals against Wakefield LEA in 2001/02, five concerned the school to be named in the child's statement. Parents requested a special school placement in three of these appeals and a mainstream placement in the other two.</p>
	<p pid=".419W.2/2">Parents withdrew 10 of the 19 appeals and the LEA conceded a further four. The remaining five all concerned the detailed provision to be made for children, and in all of these the Tribunal ordered amendments to the provision specified in statements.</p>

	<p pid=".422W.5/1">My Department does not hold the information requested.</p>
	<p pid=".422W.5/2">The National Agreement on workload and standards, which was signed in January 2003, was a landmark event in terms of tackling teachers' and head teachers' workload; and enabling them to focus on the core professional activities that make the most impact in raising standards in schools. The signatories to the Agreement, including unions and employers, are now ensuring that it becomes a reality in schools. From this September, for example, a range of administrative activities that have routinely been undertaken by teachers will be transferred to support staff and information and communications technology. Resources are being made available to enable schools to recruit at least an additional 50,000 full-time equivalent support staff over the lifetime of this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".422W.5/3">We are committed to streamlining the flow of information to schools. We have put in place rigorous controls on the number of documents automatically sent to all schools and have achieved significant reductions. We plan to cut mailings by a further 50 per cent. in the 2002&ndash;03 academic year.</p>
	<p pid=".422W.5/4">In addition, we recently announced the establishment of an Implementation Review Unit. Made up of front line practitioners&mdash;the great majority serving head teachers&mdash;the Unit will review the workload implications of Government policies, and seek to remove any unnecessary paperwork and bureaucratic burdens.</p>

For example, we have established a young people's reference group as part of the Quality Protects Programme so that we can hear the contemporary views of young people as we develop policy affecting them. In March 2001 we published a national service framework (NSF) for older people, which sets as a priority the elimination of age discrimination in access to, and quality of, health and social care services offered to older people. The NSF provides a programme of actions and milestones to be achieved over the next 10 years.</p>

	<p pid=".426W.5/1">We recognise that asthma is a distressing and debilitating condition for individuals, their carers and their families. Asthma is the commonest chronic disease in the United Kingdom and affects all age groups. Its cause, despite much research world-wide, is still not known.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.5/2">The national service framework (NSF) for children is being developed to set standards for the care of children and young people to ensure all children and young people have access to good quality care. We have agreed that asthma, as one of the most common childhood conditions, should be used as one of the exemplars which will accompany the main NSF framework report. These will illustrate how the standards should be applied to ensure that services delivered to children are effective and meet their needs.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.5/3">Schools also need to be involved in a child's asthma care plan. For this reason, the Department for Education and Skills and the Department of Health jointly issued &quot;A Good Practice Guide&mdash;Supporting Pupils with Medical Needs&quot;, which encourages local education authorities and schools to draw up medical support policies and put in place effective management systems to support pupils with medical needs, such as asthma.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.5/4">In addition, we have welcomed guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) on inhalers for children under five in September 2000 and for older children, aged five to 15, on April 11 2002. The NICE recommendations provide clear evidence based on guidance on the most suitable inhalers for children.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.5/5">Management of asthma mainly takes place in primary care. The chronic disease management programme, introduced in July 1993, provides arrangements for health promotion under the general practitioner contract. Participating GPs, around 94 per cent. of the total, receive a fixed annual payment for running organised programmes of care for patients with asthma.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.5/6">A new general medical services contract agreement was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-21">Friday 21 February 2003</phrase> which, if accepted by the profession, will lead to an unprecedented level of new investment in general practice to deliver a wider range of high quality services with better clinical outcomes for all patients.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.5/7">People with asthma will also benefit from the expert patients programme. The programme will provide, through the national health service, training in self-management skills for people with long-term chronic conditions. Expert patients can reduce severity of their symptoms, decrease their pain and increase their quality of life. 26 primary care groups or trusts are taking part in a pilot phase. One of these pilots&mdash;Medway Primary Care Trust, formerly Rainham and Gillingham Primary Care Group, in Kent&mdash;is proposing to focus self-management activity on people with asthma. The programme will be extended nation-wide by 2007.</p>
	<p pid=".426W.5/8">The NSF for older people has made a commitment to develop a service model on respiratory diseases in older people within the 10-year framework. The development of this service model will apply for all those who need these services regardless of their age, in a way similar to the current NSF service models on stroke and dementia.</p>

	<p pid=".428W.5/1">Consultation letter MLX 291 contained proposals to introduce new regulations relating to paracetamol, aspirin and iron supplements in order to take account of the British Standard on Child Resistant Packaging for non reclosable packaging for pharmaceuticals&mdash;BS 8404. It also proposed that medicines containing more than 24mg of elemental iron per unit does as well as liquid paracetamol preparations will also, for the first time, i.e. current requirements applying to reclosable containers of solid dosage and paracetamol.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.5/2">The proposals contained in MLX 291 were based on advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) which considered published data from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) for England and Wales and from Hospital Accident Surveillance System (HASS) data, from the Department of Trade and Industry's (DTIs) consumer safety unit. The aim of the amended legislation is to reduce or prevent toxicity from accidental drug overdose in children, which results in nearly 150 hospital admissions per week.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.5/3">The existing requirements for child resistant packaging in the Medicines (Child Safety) Regulations 1975 (as amended) already contain a provision to allow patients to receive these medicines in a container which is not child resistant, if they wish to do so and make a specific request to a pharmacist or doctor to that effect. The proposed new regulations include an extended adult test on accessibility for those up to 75 years rather than 60 years of age under the old standard. There is currently no proposal to remove the existing provision to dispose these medicines in non child resistant containers given the many and various ways in which elderly patients now receive their medication, including home delivery from the pharmacy.</p>
	<p pid=".428W.5/4">The public consultation on the proposals started on <phrase class="date" code="">26 November</phrase> and closed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-18">18 February 2003</phrase>. A large number of responses have been received and the Medicines Commission will be consulted shortly. Once this process is complete, in accordance with the terms of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, the Agency intends to make copies of replies received publicly available.</p>

	<p pid=".429W.8/1">The National Health Service Counter Fraud and Security Management Service (NHS CFSMS) has an on-going programme of highly accurate risk measurement exercises (accurate to plus or minus 1 per cent.) designed to reveal levels of losses and, through repeated exercises, reduction in such losses. The National Audit Office have audited this process and are satisfied to its accuracy. Phase one of these exercises (examining patient fraud losses) included pharmaceutical patient fraud. The following table details the results.</p>
	<table>
		<caption>Pharmaceutical patient fraud -- &pound; million</caption>
		<thead>
			<tr pid=".429W.8/5"> <th>Year data selected</th> <th>Fraud losses</th> </tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr pid=".429W.8/8"> <td>1998&ndash;99</td> <td>117</td> </tr>
			<tr pid=".429W.8/9"> <td>1999&ndash;2000</td> <td>69</td> </tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p pid=".429W.8/12">A statistically valid sample of those prescriptions prescribed during March 2003 has been taken for a further measurement exercise to be completed. Further fraud reductions are anticipated and the figures will be produced later this year.</p>
	<p pid=".429W.8/13">There was no accurate measurement of pharmaceutical patient fraud prior to the commencement of these exercises in 1998&ndash;99.</p>
	<p pid=".429W.8/14">Point of dispensing (PoD) checks were introduced in all community pharmacies on <phrase class="date" code="1999-04-01">1 April 1999</phrase> to help deter this type of fraud. The check requires pharmacists to ask patients, who are claiming free prescriptions, if they have evidence to support their claim to exemption from prescription charges.</p>
	<p pid=".429W.8/15">In 1998&ndash;99, pharmacists received an addition to their global sum, of &pound;1.85 million, for set-up costs to enable PoD checks to commence. In 1999&ndash;2000, a sum of &pound;12.25 million, (at 1998&ndash;99 prices) for undertaking PoD checks was incorporated within the overall figure, representing 1.67 per cent. of the global sum. This sum covers pharmacists' NHS remuneration and has been uprated annually since then. The proportion for PoD checks is not separately identified.</p>
	<p pid=".429W.8/16">Where a patient wrongly fails to pay any amount in respect of NHS charges or obtains goods or services to which they are not entitled, the amended National Health Service Act 1977 (sections 122A and 122B) provides for a civil penalty charge to be imposed. The penalty charge is calculated as five times the recoverable amount, up to a maximum of &pound;100, in addition to the original charge. In cases of non-payment a surcharge of up to &pound;50 may be imposed. Between <phrase class="date" code="2001-08-01">1 August 2001</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase> &pound;1,362,000 has been recovered through the penalty charge system.</p>

	<p pid=".431W.0/1">In the Department of Health, over 40 per cent. of the Department's 4,900 staff are now based outside London and the south-east, including nearly 1,000 headquarters staff in Leeds. The Department's regional directors of public health and their teams are based in the Government offices of the regions. In addition, from October 2002, 28 strategic health authorities&mdash;located around the country&mdash;have assumed a range of functions previously undertaken by the Department. Further progress towards effective decentralisation is a major component of the Department's current change programme, which will in turn be reflected in training and development priorities. In the meantime, staff awareness of regional and devolution issues is being raised by a variety of means, including intranet sites, staff interchange, and extensive day-to-day contact with regional and local services.</p>

The main operation is the first of four operation fields in the HES data set, and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode.2. The primary diagnosis is the first of seven diagnosis fields in the HES data set, and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.3. Figures in this table have not yet been adjusted for shortfalls in data.Waiting time statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and waiting times for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment at a given point in time and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the waiting time as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.The data has been cumulated from grouped waiting time counts of admissions. An admission classified in the category 'more than 6 months' would also be counted in the 'more than 3 months' category. Total in year admissions from waiting list and booked cases can be calculated as the sum of the counts for 'under 3 months' and 'more than 3 months'.<i>Source:</i></p>

Before the Deductions from Earnings Order is made the non-resident parent must be notified of his child support maintenance liability and any arrears. This may be done via his employer, for example if no home address is known. The non-resident parent must also be notified by his employer of the amounts to be deducted from earnings.</p>

	<p pid=".435W.5/1">Staff within The Department are expected to be knowledgeable about the requirements and features of local labour markets, social trends and patterns and any legislative or funding issues which affect their region. Managers at various levels in our regional and district structure frequently obtain briefings, statistics concerning local labour market and other social trends. In addition, Policy makers and other Senior Managers are expected to maintain very close links and nurture relationships with Regional Development Agencies and other Government bodies and NGOs. This helps supplement knowledge gained from other sources, such as briefing information.</p>
	<p pid=".435W.5/2">Arrangements have been developed, as part of the programme of work to establish the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), to facilitate movement of staff between the component businesses of DWP. These Regional Change Implementation Programme Executive (RECIPE) arrangements ensure that migration of staff between and within businesses is effectively managed to avoid surpluses and shortfalls of staff, including movement of staff between headquarters and regional offices. RECIPE groups also liaise with other government departments and the Government Office in their region to ensure, for example, a coordinated approach to recruitment, and to facilitate inter-departmental moves.</p>
	<p pid=".435W.5/3">DWP is an outward facing department and encourages its staff to. undertake interchange with a wide range of organisations, in particular those at a regional and local level, many of whom are our partners in the delivery of our business. Centrally held interchange records do not provide detailed breakdowns of all interchange activity and records of activity undertaken during 2002&ndash;03 are still to be collated from the regions and businesses. There have been positive moves undertaken by the DWP central Interchange Team to work with Government Offices on encouraging interchange between this department and the regions. The team has attended Interchange events in Government Office&mdash;North East and in London. In addition, the team has presented DWP Interchange proposals at the Heads of Personnel Forum in GO South West. Very recently the team has engaged with GO North East Staffing Forum to encourage interchange between our department and civil service departments in the region. Finally the DWP central team has developed strong working relationships in establishing opportunities for interchange with a number of government departments including: the Inland Revenue, Home Office and Cabinet Office.</p>
