	<p pid="a.1231W.5/2">Decisions on the amounts of funding have yet to be taken. However, the Government's first research report, published in November 2005, and a progress report in October 2006 set out current and proposed work and indicate what further research is needed to address the potential risks posed by engineered nanoscale materials. The new Technology Strategy Board will have responsibility for &quot;science to business&quot; collaborative research and development, and Knowledge Transfer Networks (one of which will build on the work of the Micro and Nano Technology Network). We will also be promoting the substantial funding opportunities within the EU framework programmes which we co-fund with other member states.

	<p pid="a.1235W.2/1">As in general consumer law, regulatory protection in relation to mis-selling does not extend to the business market for gas and electricity. The regulation of the fixed line telecommunications market is the responsibility of Ofcom. All companies selling fixed line telecoms services are required by Ofcom to draw up mandatory codes of practice consistent with published guidelines and then comply with these. If companies breach these obligations Ofcom's powers now include the ability to secure written undertakings from companies about their sales and marketing practices. Ofcom has taken enforcement action and four investigations are already complete, with fourteen enforcement notices issued to six of the worst offenders. These have secured significant changes to behaviours to ensure consumers' rights are protected, including action to require repayment of monies to affected c consumers. Ofcom has also already fined one company the maximum possible 10 per cent. of its turnover.</p>

	<p pid="a.1236W.11/1">Ministers have not had any discussions with local authorities on the effect of the Licensing Act 2003 on carols or Christmas songs. However, officials have shared previous advice they have given on this issue with the local authorities coordinators of regulatory services (LACORS) and this has been disseminated by LACORS and is available on the DCMS website. Most singing of carols and Christmas songs is either spontaneous, incidental to other activities or part of a religious service and therefore not usually licensable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236W.11/2">Licensing requirements depend on the type of event at which songs are being performed and not whether the songs themselves are religious or secular. For example, secular songs being performed as part of a religious service would not make that service licensable. Conversely, a rock band choosing to play a religious carol as part of its set would not make a rock concert an exempt religious service. It is not possible to describe every scenario, which is why it is ultimately for licensing authorities to determine what requires a licence and what does not.</p>

	<p pid="a.1241W.9/1">The Government continue to make a considerable investment into research on climate change and agriculture to help both policy makers and industry plan for the uncertainties ahead. A recent review, summarising all the recent research on impacts and adaptation in agriculture is available on the Defra website:</p>
	<p pid="a.1241W.9/2" class="indent"><a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/science/documents/publications/Defra_CC03_review_030705_JPGamended_jrp%20FINAL.pdf">http://www.defra.gov.uk/science/documents/publications/Defra_CC03_review_030705_JPGamended_jrp%20FINAL.pdf</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1241W.9/3">Overall the research suggests that climate change impacts do not appear to threaten the viability of the agriculture industry as a whole in the UK due to the adaptability of UK systems. However, individual agricultural businesses and land managers will need to be alive to the need for adaptation. There may also be opportunities to grow new crops. We do not have a single assessment of the overall effects on UK food production as this is influenced not only by the regionalised impacts of climate change, but the reaction of individual businesses to climate change, and their reaction to market changes and other policy levers.</p>

We will also work with our industry partners to further raise awareness of the crucial role farmers have to play in controlling bTB by complying with statutory policies, applying disease prevention measures and good husbandry practices. We are also considering the evidence and practicalities of adding badger culling to these tools for preventing bTB in cattle.</p>

	<p pid="a.1244W.3/1">Defra has not made an estimate of the number of Christmas trees which were recycled in the last three years. I am aware that some local authorities (LAs) have in the past reported the number of Christmas trees they recycle to the environmental charity EnCams. Figures for 2002 show that nearly 2 million trees were recycled by the LAs which provided returns in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.3/2">While Defra does not provide specific support to LAs for the recycling of Christmas trees, we have provided significant additional funding to increase the proportion of waste that they recycle through the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services (EPCS) spending block. This includes waste management services, Private Finance Initiative funding for waste, the Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund and the Waste Performance and Efficiency Grant.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.3/3">Waste Watch recently estimated that up to 1 billion Christmas cards could end up in rubbish bins across the UK rather than being recycled. We would expect those authorities which carry out collection and recycling of waste paper to recycle Christmas cards with the rest of the waste paper they collect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1244W.3/4">In addition, the Woodland Trust runs an annual Christmas card recycling scheme with Recycle Now. Their 2005 scheme recycled more than 58 million cards, collecting the equivalent of at least one card for every person in Britain. The trust has set a 2007 target to recycle 90 million Christmas and new year cards. More information on this year's scheme can be found on the Woodland Trust's website at:</p>

Food and feed does not need to be labelled as 'GM' providing that the GM presence is below 0.9 per cent. and is accidental. The capability of the food and feed supply chain in being able to work to this threshold was taken into account in agreeing this level, in addition to the ability of laboratories to be able to accurately analyse for the presence of GM material.</p>

	<p pid="a.1248W.8/1">We have not made any formal assessment of the contribution to waste streams of shelf-ready packaging. Potentially, it could help to reduce external in-transit packaging. But it could also affect the type or amount of materials used to package individual products.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248W.8/2">We are continuing to engage with retailers and the food industry to reduce the amount of food and packaging waste which is being generated&mdash;by the industry itself, as well as consumers. For example, Defra's Food Industry Sustainability Strategy (FISS), published in April this year, challenges the food manufacturing sector to reduce its own waste by 15-20 per cent. by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248W.8/3">13 major grocery retailers (representing 92 per cent. of the UK grocery sector) are also supporting the &quot;Courtauld Commitment&quot;. This means that they have agreed to work with the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) in order to: design out packaging waste growth by 2008; deliver absolute reductions in packaging waste by March 2010; and identify ways to tackle the problem of food waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248W.8/4">WRAP works closely with the major supermarket chains to achieve the necessary behavioural changes. Three roundtable meetings have taken place to discuss food waste, putting recycling information on package labelling, and the issues and opportunities associated with biodegradable packaging. Through an Innovation Fund, WRAP also provides technical and financial support to retailers and suppliers. This is helping to identify ways of reducing the weight of primary packaging and the cost of production and transportation&mdash;mainly through research and development and innovative packaging design.</p>

The UK is the largest contributor to the ARTF committing &pound;355 million between 2002-09; &pound;235 million of that commitment has been disbursed.

	<p pid="a.1250W.9/1">In the financial year 2004-05 the Defence Medical and Training Agency (DMETA) did not spend any of its budget in Scotland. In the financial year 2005-06 some &pound;129,000 was spent by DMETA on the placement of a service doctor with a Scottish hospital.

	<p pid="a.1256W.8/1">The number of medical discharges from the UK armed forces due to psychological illness is low. Out of the over 200,000 regular service less than 0.1 per cent., are discharged annually for mental health reasons, whatever the cause. Of these, only 20-25 meet the criteria to be diagnosed with PTSD.</p>
	<p pid="a.1256W.8/2">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) employs specialist mental health social workers (MHSW) who assist personnel who are medically discharged from the service on the basis of a mental illness. The aim of this service is to liaise with the relevant external agencies (Government and non-governmental), and (along with resettlement agencies) provide the patient with a seamless transfer into civilian life. The MOD's MHSW routinely liaise with health and social services; housing agencies; the Department of Work and Pensions; Combat Stress; Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (SSAFA); The Royal British Legion; the Service Benevolent Funds; Regimental Associations; and other relevant charitable organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1256W.8/3">For veterans, healthcare is primarily the responsibility of the NHS. The Veterans Agency Welfare Service also provides practical assistance to veterans in need of support, focussed on those with mental or physical illness or injury suffered as a result of military service for which a compensatory pension is in payment. Following recommendations on mental health services for veterans in 2005 by the independent Health and Social Care Advisory Service, officials from the MOD, the UK Health departments and Combat Stress have been working together to develop and implement a new community-based model for mental health services for veterans. It is hoped that, beginning in the spring of 2007, the model will be piloted at sites across the UK. The pilots are likely to last two years and, if successful, will be rolled out nationally.</p>

International flights from the UK are not currently included in this figure as there is, as yet, no international agreement on ways of allocating such emissions. But we have made it clear aviation needs to take its share of responsibility for tackling climate change. A well designed emissions trading scheme is an important way of ensuring that aviation contributes to climate stabilisation and the European Commission is expected to publish a legislative proposal to include aviation in the EU emissions trading scheme by the end of the year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1270W.9/60">The Department recognises the need to assist all passengers when changing trains and acknowledges the challenges Birmingham New Street station can present to rail users. For many journeys where a change is necessary there will be alternatives such as Wolverhampton, which has seen recent investment in new waiting areas, lifts, a footbridge and customer information systems. Other alternatives include Banbury and Cheltenham Spa where the operational layout of the station dictates that only same platform changes are necessary. Derby is also an appropriate alternative where the need to change platforms is highly unlikely.</p>

	<p pid="a.1277W.11/1" class="askedtoreply">I have been asked to reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1277W.11/2">Currently, there are two key statutory mechanisms for protecting the public: Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), and Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs). The former are concerned with managing offenders living in the community who pose a risk to public safety, while the latter focus on children who are in need of care or at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.1277W.11/3">Recently, a new body has been developed: the MARAC (Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference). MARACs focus on the adult victims of domestic violence, and seek to intervene with victims at high risk of repeat victimisation, serious injury or homicide.</p>
	<p pid="a.1277W.11/4">While not statutory, MARACs are proving to be highly effective at preventing homicides, and in dramatically reducing repeat attacks. In Cardiff, for example, 42 per cent. of victims experienced no repeat incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1277W.11/5">We are rolling out MARACs to more Specialist Domestic Violence Court areas, and will be monitoring their effectiveness. Targets in reductions for repeat victimisation following the introduction of MARACs are also increasingly being included in local area agreements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1288W.6/2">The UK is committed to supporting comprehensive and enforceable rights for disabled people and wishes to see those rights enjoyed by disabled citizens everywhere. Despite many UN human rights conventions, the human rights of disabled people have not been fully recognised around the world, and they continue to experience discrimination and disabling barriers. The UK therefore welcomed the decision of the UN General Assembly to set up an ad hoc committee to prepare the text of a new Convention on Disability Rights and played a full and positive role in the negotiations. We also led negotiations for the European Union during our Presidency in 2005 and hope to be among the first countries to sign and ratify it.</p>

However, it is also used by the Burmese Government to promote their political aims. Membership is compulsory for most government employees. Others are threatened or induced to join. The USDA is widely believed to have been involved in the attacks on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's convoy at Depayin in 2003 and in the intimidation they suffered on earlier trips. There are unconfirmed reports that the Burmese Government intend to transform the USDA into a pro-government political party which would contest any forthcoming general election.</p>

	<p pid="a.1291W.6/1">Official information on both these trials is limited. However, the Government have received reports of breaches of due process in each case which are deeply concerning.</p>
	<p pid="a.1291W.6/2">Chen Guangcheng was for instance denied access to the lawyers of his choice at his trial on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-24">24 August</phrase>, which contravenes international fair trial standards. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary therefore welcomed news of Chen's quashed sentence in a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-02">2 November</phrase> and urged the Chinese Government to guarantee due process at his retrial. Officials from our Embassy in Beijing applied for but were denied access to Chen's retrial on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-27">27 November</phrase>. We are concerned by reports that one of Chen's lawyers was again denied access to the court, and that key witnesses were detained, raising further doubts about the fairness of proceedings against him. We hope that his forthcoming appeal will be dealt with fairly and transparently. Zhao Yan's trial was held in closed court on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-25">25 August</phrase> and we remain concerned at serious procedural irregularities, as well as the lack of information on his conviction for &quot;financial fraud&quot;.

At the recent review conference for the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW), the UK secured an agreement by consensus which included all major producers and users of cluster munitions. This will set up a discussion mandate that should lead to negotiations on a legally-binding protocol that addresses the humanitarian impact of cluster munitions. This approach is consistent with Kofi Annan's call at the conference for action within the existing CCW framework. If the process agreed within the CCW falters or fails, we will review our policy.</p>

Testament to the effective work we have done on this agenda were two important outcomes from informal European Council in October at Lahti: to link European policy on energy security and climate change more closely together so that the EU pursues an integrated policy; and a greater coherence among EU member states than there has been in the past on external energy security issues, e.g. our approach towards dealing with third country suppliers. This work has been particularly timely in relation to the European Commission's Strategic Energy Review, which will be published shortly and will help set further direction on energy and climate change policy during the German presidency. The FCO has been working with the Commission and EU member states to ensure that UK priorities are reflected in the Strategic Energy Review and other Commission papers such as the Energy Efficiency Action Plan.</p>

We must also speak with one voice on climate security, including with external partners&mdash;Russia, China and India and are confident that the German presidency will take this further. A milestone for achieving these objectives will be the spring European Council and we are pleased that Chancellor Merkel has said energy&mdash;and climate change&mdash;will be key element of this.</p>

	<p pid="a.1297W.0/1">Urban crime and gun violence are significant problems throughout much of Latin America and are issues that we discuss on a regular basis with the governments concerned. Latin America has some of the highest rates of gun violence in the world. In many opinion polls, tackling violent crime, often linked to the illegal drugs trade, ranks with unemployment as the main concern of citizens in a number of countries. My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, raised security issues with the Colombian government in his visit to the country in September, as did my hon. Friend the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Dr. Howells), in his visit to Colombia and Venezuela in October.</p>
	<p pid="a.1297W.0/2">We want to help tackle these problems, and are supporting a range of projects that directly address them. Some examples include support for police reform in Venezuela, one of the worst affected countries, to improve the effectiveness of the police in tackling crime, plus support to local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) addressing the threat of gun crime at community level; in Bolivia we are working with national and local authorities on projects to improve citizen security, community policing and crime prevention; and in Brazil we are working with NGOs and the police to improve security policy and tackle gun violence. We also encourage our partners to address the issue of small arms and light weapons, which contribute significantly to crime and violence in the region.</p>

	<p pid="a.1300W.6/1">As is normal practice in investigations of this kind, Sir Thomas Legg, Sir Robin Ibbs and the secretariat of the investigation were granted indemnity from any liability arising from legal action taken against them in relation to their inquiry into the Sierra Leone arms affair. This was done in the standard format as advised by HM Treasury solicitors. The indemnity came into force on <phrase class="date" code="1998-07-10">10 July 1998</phrase>, and was granted to assist the quick, effective and unhindered completion of the report. Neither Sir Thomas Legg, nor the other parties covered by the indemnity, has had cause to invoke the indemnity, and so there has been no cost involved.</p>
