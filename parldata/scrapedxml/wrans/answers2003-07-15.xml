	<p pid=".141W.3/1">There are now 47 Connexions partnerships in operation covering all of England. 31 started during the financial year 2002&ndash;03. The last one started in April 2003. Ofsted have reported full inspections of six partnerships so far and initial indications are that Connexions partnerships are making progress at different rates with implementation of services.

Lancashire has received &pound;444,340 towards setting up electronic registration in 23 secondary schools including two schools (Walton High School and West Craven High School) in the Pendle constituency receiving a total of &pound;38,570.

	<p pid=".146W.2/1">The Department does not hold information on students studying in their home towns. However, several research projects have looked at the influences on choice of institution. Comparisons from the Student Income and Expenditure Survey (SIES) in 1995&ndash;96 and 1998&ndash;99 show that there has been a slight increase of around 5 per cent. in the overall proportion of students living with their parents, especially among first years. Among the students surveyed in 1998&ndash;99, 18 per cent. lived with their parents.</p>
	<p pid=".146W.2/2">A student living survey carried out by UNITE/MORI in 2003 revealed that the ability to live at home during term time was a factor influencing the choice of university by 35 per cent. of those in the lower social classes compared with 26 per cent. of semi-skilled non-manual workers and 13 per cent. of those in professional and managerial social classes.</p>
	<p pid=".146W.2/3">A study completed by the Institute of Employment Studies found that the priority when choosing an institution is for the right subject of study and course, however non-traditional applicants, particularly mature applicants and ethnic minorities gave more emphasis to reputation and quality, location and nearness to 'home'.</p>

	<p pid=".148W.5/20">In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the number of TB reactors identified and slaughtered in 2002 is not comparable to those identified and slaughtered in previous years.</p>

Moreover decisions remain to be taken on reforms of the sugar, cotton, tobacco and olive oil regimes. However, the Government's initial estimates indicate that the EU is now close to meeting WTO demands for a 60 per cent. reduction in amber box subsidies and can fully meet the WTO proposal for a 50 per cent. reduction in blue box payments.</p>

	<p pid=".150W.5/1">The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy should provide direct and indirect benefits to agricultural producers in the developing world. First, the decoupling of subsidy payments from production, together with reductions agreed in some market support arrangements, will reduce EU over-production and subsidised exports of surpluses onto world markets at prices which undermine developing country markets and economies. Secondly, the impetus which these reforms should give to a successful Doha trade round will help to bring about wider development gains, not least through global action on agricultural subsidies.</p>

	<p pid=".150W.8/1">The National Air Emission Inventory ('NAEI') estimated emissions of dioxins produced by cement kilns as 2.829 and 5.684 grams in 1997 and 2001 respectively.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.8/2">Measurements of dioxins are subject to an uncertainty of up to 100 per cent. because of the complex nature of the sampling and analysis techniques and the very low levels of emissions being monitored. The amount of cement production is not the same every year and this will also affect the figures for dioxins. As a result the numerical difference may have no statistical significance. The Environment Agency is at present investigating better techniques for dioxin analysis to secure more accurate reporting of dioxins data.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.8/3">The Environment Agency has recently taken regulatory action to decrease dioxin levels, in particular at a single cement kiln site where a reduction from 2.2 grams in 2001 to 0.3 grams in 2002 is anticipated. The Environment Agency's own provisional estimate for 2002 is 1.5 grams of dioxins.</p>
	<p pid=".150W.8/4">European and domestic environmental regulations require that emissions limits for dioxins are set for cement production activities. The limits will reflect the benchmark values suggested by the European Commission and technical guidance produced by the Environment Agency. While excessive exposure to dioxins may be detrimental to human health, the Environment Agency aims to ensure that environmental exposures are too low for this to occur.</p>

	<p pid=".152W.5/1">From our national air quality modelling, current forecasts suggest that we are unlikely to achieve the mandatory EU limit value for nitrogen dioxide set for 2010 around Heathrow. However, we do not have estimates for the number of people exposed to nitrogen dioxide levels in excess of the EU limit value at any airports at that point.</p>
	<p pid=".152W.5/2">The Future Development of Air Transport in the UK: South East consultation document (DfT, February 2003) showed predicted exceedences of the nitrogen dioxide objective for Heathrow based on. modelling carried out as part of the Government's SERAS study. That modelling predicts that there would be 35,000 people exposed in 2015 if a third runway were to be built, falling to 33,000 in 2030. If no new airport were to be built, 14,000 people are predicted to be exposed to an exceedence of the nitrogen dioxide objective. Further modelling for SERAS, which is also reported in the consultation document, based on a more optimistic view of improvements in engine technology and assuming positive action by the aviation industry to reduce emissions indicated that the figure of 35,000 in 2015 might fall to 5,000.</p>

	<p pid=".155W.5/3">Each approval is granted, by Ministers, subject to specific Conditions of Approval, which are legal requirements and must be followed. These conditions are recorded in the approval documents and are reflected on the product label. The label will inform the user what the product has approval for use against, how it must be used to be effective and essential risk and safety advice associated with the product. The directions for use and the precautionary phrases will give the user guidance on how to avoid exposure to domestic and non-domestic animals. When carrying out a treatment the label advice must be followed and the potential risks involved when using a product should be considered.</p>
	<p pid=".155W.5/4">Following approval of a product, the Approval Holder is under an ongoing responsibility to report adverse data associated with the product to the regulatory authority. Additionally, the Pesticides Residues Committee, a sub-committee of the independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides, conduct a ongoing programme of testing to assess the residue levels of pesticides in food stuffs. The Wildlife Incident Investigation Scheme looks at cases where domestic and non-domestic animals have been poisoned by pesticides. Information gathered from these monitoring processes are fed back into the approvals process and, if appropriate, action can be taken against products.</p>

In respect of base stations the Group concluded that:</p>
	<p pid=".159W.5/2">The balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of guidelines.</p>

	<p pid=".159W.5/4">The IEGMP additionally recommended that the issue of possible health effects from mobile phone technology should be the subject of a further review in three years time or earlier if circumstances demand it. In responding to the recommendations in the IEGMP report, the Government asked the NRPB to undertake this further review and the Board of NRPB requested its independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR) to carry this out. It is expected that this further report will be issued towards the end of 2003. Membership of AGNIR can be found on the NRPB's website (<a href="http://www.nrpb.org">www.nrpb.org</a>).</p>

	<p pid=".162W.5/1">Data on the UK's imports of timber are given in the following table.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.5/2">Statistics on UK imports of goods are compiled by HM Customs and Excise. The information is published on the basis of the country of consignment: which is normally the last country in which a commercial transaction takes place. Information on the country of consignment is comprehensive for countries outside the European Union (EU). Within the EU detailed information is collected from all but very small traders. Overall, small traders are estimated to account for 2&ndash;3 per cent. of the value of UK trade with the EU, or about half that for total UK trade in goods. HM Customs and Excise do not collect from importers information relating to the precise origin of the timber, ie. whether or not the timber was forested from a legal and sustainably managed source, other than the country of consignment.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.5/3">Comprehensive data, by country of origin are not available. The free flow of goods within the Single European Market means that information on the country of origin is not always available when goods are first imported into another European Union country and then consigned to the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".162W.5/4">The Government have shown leadership in its strong encouragement of the European Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) process. This is part of the EU's wider objective to encourage sustainable forest management and ensure that timber entering the EU is sustainably sourced. The Government are broadly supportive of the Commission's recently published FLEGT action plan and will work with other member states to ensure the Commission is able to make rapid progress.</p>

	<p pid=".167W.2/1">The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is responsible for the licensing of civil aerodromes in the UK. Licensed aerodromes are required to take all reasonable steps to secure that the aerodrome and its immediately surrounding airspace are safe at all times for use by aircraft. As a licensing condition, aerodrome operators are also specifically required to have in place procedures for the control of bird hazards. The CAA maintains an oversight of the effectiveness of the bird hazard control activities at all UK licensed aerodromes and comments on this activity in the individual aerodrome's annual audit report.</p>
	<p pid=".167W.2/2">Although the Department for Transport has not conducted separate aerodrome bird strike risk assessments, it has organised, and currently chairs, a working group of representatives from relevant local authorities, private land owners, the CAA and Heathrow Airport Ltd. (HAL) to consider ways of expediting effective management of the bird population and habitat around Heathrow. This builds on HAL's on-going work with the Central Science Laboratory's Bird Strike Avoidance Team to develop and implement appropriate bird strike mitigation measures. It is anticipated that the results of the group's work will, in due course, be disseminated to other aerodromes around the country.</p>

	<p pid=".167W.5/1">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in co-operation with police forces, local authorities and other enforcement agencies already uses a wide range of measures to tackle evasion of vehicle excise duty (VED). These include on-street enforcement, wheelclamping and the use of roadside cameras. The enforcement programme successfully actioned some 820,000 cases, recovering some &pound;110 million in fines, out of court settlements and relicensing revenue.</p>
	<p pid=".167W.5/2">This programme is being strengthened by a range of new initiatives. These include combined operations with local authorities, police forces and fire services aimed at abandoned and unlicensed vehicles, wider use of police traffic cameras, and a new &quot;hotline&quot; facility to allow members of the public to report offences directly to DVLA, anonymously if they wish.</p>
	<p pid=".167W.5/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-22">22 May</phrase> I announced proposals to introduce a form of continuous registration, starting in 2004. Under these proposals a vehicle's registered keeper will remain liable for licensing it until it is formally transferred to a new keeper. Enforcement will include the imposition of standard penalties, with more severe fines for determined evaders following prosecution. There will be consultation on the details of these proposals later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".175W.2/1">The European Community's Humanitarian Aid Committee (HAC) does not have a fixed membership, but consists of delegates drawn from each of the 15 European member states. The HAC meets on average once a month, excluding August (and often December). In addition to this, each Presidency usually holds an informal HAC to discuss issues of substance in more detail. Including both formal and informal HACs there have been 19 meetings since January 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".175W.2/2">The Department for International Development usually sends one or two delegates to the HAC, drawn from our Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs Department or our regional departments.</p>
	<p pid=".175W.2/3">At the HAC meetings, member states review the Annual Global Plans (large scale humanitarian country strategies) and Decisions (less detailed, smaller scale humanitarian programmes) drawn up by the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO) for ongoing humanitarian assistance to countries, regions, or specific population groups. ECHO also uses the HAC to inform member states of decisions taken under ECHO's own delegated authority both on its smallest programmes, and on those taken under the Primary Emergency Procedures for rapid disbursement (recent examples include Iraq, Algeria and the Palestinian Territories). In November of each year, ECHO presents its overall strategy for the following year for discussion by member states. ECHO also presents at various times during the year procedural and thematic papers on various aspects of EC assistance for member state's information and comment.</p>
	<p pid=".175W.2/4">The role of the Humanitarian Aid Committee is to oversee the powers delegated to the European Commission by the European Council of Ministers. As with all Comitology Committees, documents circulated at the HAC are not routinely deposited for scrutiny under established scrutiny procedures, unless they are politically significant. Since January 2002 DFID has deposited for scrutiny the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office's Annual Report for 2001 (COM (2002) 322 FINAL).</p>

	<p pid=".176W.5/1">We have received no specific requests for drugs from health professionals in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid=".176W.5/2">The World Health Organisation's assessment is that there is no overall shortage of medical supplies in Iraq, although there are still shortages of drugs for some specific conditions. The drugs supply pipeline is funded until spring 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".176W.5/3">In Basra, an oxygen shortfall has resulted from production problems in local manufacturing plants. Immediate emergency needs have been met by importing oxygen from Kuwait. Work is under way to restore existing production capacity in Basra, and ultimately to install new production capacity which would also improve the quality of the oxygen supplied for medical use.</p>
	<p pid=".176W.5/4">DFID's assistance to health and nutrition in the current crisis is channelled through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, Save the Children Fund, CARE and a number of other non-governmental organisations. &pound;12 million has been allocated specifically to health and nutrition activities (not including food aid); &pound;35 million has also been allocated to humanitarian agencies, not earmarked to specific sectors, a proportion of which is being spent in the health sector.</p>

	<p pid=".177W.2/1">Before the recent conflict, the effects of mismanagement, war, migration of medical staff and economic sanctions had significantly weakened Iraq's capacity to protect the health of its children: almost a third of children in the centre and south suffered from chronic malnutrition; the prevalence of low birth-weight babies had increased more than five-fold over the previous 10 years; and the under-five mortality rate, at 131 per 1,000 live births, was very high. Immediately after the recent conflict, looting, insecurity and an initial breakdown of public services exacerbated existing problems. Increased levels of diarrhoea and vaccine-preventable diseases among children were reported.</p>
	<p pid=".177W.2/2">Subsequently, progress has been made in restoring health services and clean water supplies. UNICEF has re-started routine vaccination, including a catch-up campaign for children who missed immunisation during the conflict. Sufficient vaccines are now in Iraq for six to eight months of vaccinations. The Coalition Provisional Authority has announced that public health spending in the July to December 2003 budget will be US$210 million, including $125 million for supplies and equipment and $31 million for generators to supply power to hospitals in Baghdad.</p>

	<p pid=".179W.2/1">Our information on the humanitarian situation in Liberia is provided by the United Nations and the other international humanitarian agencies that are maintaining a presence there. Although the UN has plans to return expatriate personnel to the country as soon as conditions allow, for now they are relying on information from their country staff and the international non-Government organisations. Only a few agencies have an expatriate presence in Liberia and this is limited mainly to the capital, Monrovia.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.2/2">The reports we are receiving describe the conditions as very poor. Humanitarian activities are severely hampered by looting of vehicles, fuel, medical supplies and food by all the main parties to the conflict. There are severe shortages, especially of food and clean water. Sanitation is virtually non-existent, and with around one-third of the population now located within Monrovia, the impact on an already over-stretched infrastructure is serious. We have little hard information on the situation outside the capital.</p>
	<p pid=".179W.2/3">Cholera cases are reported to be significantly above the norm. Hospitals (of which only one has been functioning recently) and health centres are finding it difficult to cope. It is vital that the present lull in the fighting continues to enable the international community to re-engage, with access to all areas.</p>

We are liaising closely with the principal agencies concerned. We and other donors will be joining with members of the UN and other humanitarian agencies at a meeting in Dakar, Senegal, on 17 and <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-18">18 July 2003</phrase> to discuss the situation across the west Africa sub-region, including Liberia.</p>

	<p pid=".180W.2/1">We provided substantial emergency assistance for Montserrat in the immediate aftermath of the volcanic crisis in the mid-1990s. This included provision of housing, essential services and infrastructure which had been lost or seriously damaged. Increasingly, our assistance is now geared towards other productive activity, which will help Montserrat towards its goal of renewed self-sufficiency. For example, a new airport to replace the one at risk from the volcano is now under construction and should become operational next year.</p>
	<p pid=".180W.2/2">We were very concerned to learn about the recent volcanic events in Montserrat. DFID officials are in direct contact with the Montserratian authorities to assist in every possible way.</p>

	<p pid=".180W.8/20">In Africa in 2000&ndash;01 there were two payments, one of &pound;29 million to assist copper industry restructuring in Zambia, and another of &pound;28 million as programme aid to support economic reform in Kenya. In 2001&ndash;02, a smaller sum was available, of which &pound;7 million was spent on humanitarian assistance: &pound;5 million in the DRC (through the International Red Cross) and &pound;2 million on humanitarian projects in the Sudan. A further &pound;0.25 million was spent on AFRICAP, an African micro-finance investment fund. In 2002&ndash;03, &pound;10 million was spent on programme aid to Ethiopia as our bilateral relationship strengthened, &pound;3.2 million on humanitarian work (in Angola, Sudan and the Great Lakes region), and a further &pound;0.8 million contribution to AFRICAP. Some &pound;35 million is available in 2003&ndash;04, much of which will be needed for humanitarian work.</p>
	<p pid=".180W.8/21">In financial years 2000&ndash;01 and 2001&ndash;02 Asia's performance fund was used for various purposes including transfers to programmes in the Middle East and Pakistan. Not all the funds allocated to the Fund were needed in these years; resources not required were re-allocated to other parts of the DFID's programme. In 2002&ndash;03, funds were used for Afghanistan and other humanitarian work. Asia does not have a performance fund allocation for 2003&ndash;04.</p>
	<p pid=".180W.8/22">From 2004&ndash;05 onwards, resources for performance funds rise significantly. These funds will be allocated in part before the year commences, although significant amounts will remain to be allocated in-year. They will be targeted at those countries that are currently performing less well or that are in or emerging from conflict. We are already planning high and stable levels of spending in countries with a clear commitment to, and capacity to deliver, poverty reduction.</p>

	<p pid=".181W.2/1">It is difficult to provide accurate data on the overall numbers of street children in Asia or to provide a breakdown by country. Estimates are unreliable and coverage is patchy. According to UNICEF there are roughly about 25 million children estimated to be living on the streets in Asia. However there is no reliable information for many Asian countries. In India the Ministry of Social Welfare estimates that there are between 75,000 to 250,000 street children in Calcutta alone. UNICEF estimate there are 15,000 street children in Vietnam and 16,000 in Sri Lanka.</p>
	<p pid=".181W.2/2">The fundamental cause of children living on the street is poverty. This is exacerbated by chronic hunger, lack of school places and family conflict. Between 30 per cent. to 50 per cent. of children in South Asia are malnourished. Despite improvements in education provision around 41 per cent. of children drop out of school before they reach the fifth grade. Between 30 per cent. to 55 per cent. of school age children are working. Many of these children are exploited through child labour or are involved in the sex industry. Unless these problems are addressed the problems of street children in Asia will continue to grow.</p>

	<p pid=".182W.2/1">Urban poverty, homelessness, lack of education and the demand for child labour forces children to leave their families and live on the streets in Asia. It is important that these underlying problems are addressed as well as helping street children directly. Our bilateral programmes in Asia aim to alleviate family poverty more generally as a basis for addressing the needs of street children.</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/2">Many of our programmes support NGO activities that advocate for the rights of children and work directly with street children. In Bangladesh we are supporting two NGOs to provide informal education to vulnerable working children in urban areas at a cost of &pound;8 million. In Burma we have been supporting a street and working children project with World Vision a total cost of &pound;450,000. In India we are supporting a local NGO to work with child street vendors and have several other small projects in the pipeline focusing on vulnerable working children in urban areas.</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/3">We are providing &pound;1.6 million to Save the Children to work directly with vulnerable children in the Mekong sub region. This project aims to prevent poor rural children being trafficked to urban areas in the region for purposes of sexual exploitation and under age employment. This helps to reduce the potential for these children to end up on the street.</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/4">Other DFID activities also contribute indirectly to addressing the problems of street children. Improving basic education for every child is the main contribution that Asian Governments can make to reducing child poverty and indirectly to reducing the numbers of street children. Support to basic education is a major focus of our bilateral programme in Asia and in 2001&ndash;02 DFID committed &pound;130 million to support this.</p>
	<p pid=".182W.2/5">Another example is the &pound;12 million urban poverty reduction project in Cochin in India that has helped to improve basic services for poor families and their children.</p>

	<p pid=".183W.2/1">Presenting accurate data on expenditure for the water and sanitation sector is not straightforward. Reporting years and methods differ, especially between DFID's multilateral and bilateral partners, but we are working with our partners to improve the quality and hence the reliability of these data.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.2/2">Over the last three years DFID has undertaken a detailed analysis of all projects to determine its total water related bilateral expenditure. This showed that total bilateral water expenditure was &pound;82 million in 1999&ndash;2000, &pound;91 million in 2000&ndash;01 and &pound;87 million in 2001&ndash;02. This equates to 6.19 per cent., 6.43 per cent. and 5.77 per cent. respectively of DFID's total bilateral expenditure over this period. These amounts include bilateral expenditure on all aspects of water including emergency assistance and international water programmes, but exclude expenditure that may be allocated to the water sector from direct budget support and from multilateral funding.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.2/3">We have only calculated figures using this method back to 1999&ndash;2000.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.2/4">In 2001&ndash;02, DFID channelled &pound;1.3 billion through multilateral organisations. DFID's contribution to multilateral spend on water and sanitation is estimated at around &pound;40 million per year.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.2/5">In 2001&ndash;02, DFID provided &pound;296 million as general budget support to country governments (including sector support), which was 20 per cent. of our total bilateral programme and 10 per cent. of our entire programme. An internal exercise to allocate direct budget support notionally by sector concluded that only a small proportion (less than one per cent) went to the water sector.</p>
	<p pid=".183W.2/6">Much of the above information is included in the National Audit Office review of DFID's work in the water sector (NAO Report No. HC351, <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-31">31 January 2003</phrase>). DFID publishes details of its aid expenditure annually. Statistics on International Development which is available in the Library, also provides details of the volume, type, purpose and destination of all UK development assistance.</p>

	<p pid=".192W.2/1">The purpose of the Ministry of Defence is to provide the capabilities needed to defend the United Kingdom and Overseas Territories, and protect British people and interests, as well as act as a force for good by strengthening international peace and security. Defence is a national activity and as such policy initiatives and spending are characterised as in the regions rather than for the regions.</p>
	<p pid=".192W.2/2">While the MOD makes a positive contribution to the community through the management of a Cadet Hut at Butts Yard, Barnoldswick, there are no other Defence establishments in the constituency. Some of our policies may have an indirect effect on people and organisations in Pendle, e.g. recruitment to the armed forces or the MOD from this area, or the presence in Pendle of defence suppliers, including their sub-contractors and employees. However, this regionally based information is not held centrally by the Department and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

Two Ministry of Defence civilian officials are also based in Brussels to support ESDP aspects of the work of the Political and Security Committee and its preparatory groups. From time to time, specialist staff based in the UK also attend working group meetings in Brussels, for example to plan crisis management exercises or for detailed work on force development. These meetings generally do not have a fixed membership, and the numbers attending vary depending on the subjects under discussion, but the total number of UK-based MOD staff involved is about 20.</p>

The General Affairs and External Relations Council in May agreed that the EU now has operational capability across the full range of Petersberg tasks, albeit limited and constrained by recognised shortfalls, which particularly affect speed of deployment and level of risk for larger, higher-intensity tasks. The number of forces which could be deployed for any particular ESDP operation would depend on the operational scenario and what member states and other countries decided to contribute.</p>

	<p pid=".194W.11/1">Coalition forces hold the maintenance of law and order as a high priority. Coalition forces continue to patrol robustly, often alongside members of around 30,000 Iraqi police who are now operational across the country. Coalition forces are empowered to arrest individuals suspected of criminal offences, and their patrols have had an effect in controlling the lawlessness and looting that in some areas immediately followed the collapse of the Ba'athist regime. United Kingdom forces are currently responsible for security and stability in the southern provinces of Basrah and Maysan. We do not hold figures for the number of civil disturbances across Iraq, but the Coalition will continue to work hard to reduce such instances, and to improve life for the Iraqi people.</p>

	<p pid=".195W.2/1">The introduction of 24-hour media coverage and the development and use of technology have changed the way that wars are reported. During the coalition, broadcasters were able for the first time to report in real time from the battlefield, and incidents which previously might have gone unreported for several hours, were in many cases seen by the embedded journalists and reported back to their news desks. And in some cases, images were broadcast live.</p>
	<p pid=".195W.2/2">These changes have caused the Ministry of Defence to keep under review its incident reporting and casualty handling procedures. While our primary aim is always to protect the interests of families involved, it was no longer feasible to delay announcing that an incident had occurred until all the next of kin had been informed. Thus, while our first task was always to inform the next of kin of those families affected, we simultaneously released information on incidents, subject to operational security, in order to limit the 'circle of worry' of non-affected families who would be aware from media reporting that an incident had occurred. However, incident and casualty reporting is a very difficult area and all decisions were taken on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid=".195W.2/3">We did not publish the names of fatalities until we had confirmation that the next of kin, and in some cases the extended family network, had been informed. Our Casualty staffs worked closely with media staffs to ensure that the families involved were protected from any media intrusion.</p>

	<p pid=".203W.2/1">In November 2002, I was joined by the Assistant Chief Constable with responsibility for road traffic policing in launching the Northern Ireland Road Safety Strategy 2002&ndash;12. The strategy provides a major step forward in outlining the partnership approach between the main agencies: Department of the Environment (DOE), the Department for Regional Development (DRD) and Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), in addressing the main causes of death and serious injuries, which are speed, drink-driving and failure to wear seat belts.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/2">Officials in the relevant Departments and agencies, including PSNI, have been liaising closely to implement the objectives outlined in the strategy. The strategy provided for the establishment of a Road Safety Steering Group, which will oversee and monitor progress towards the delivery of the strategic objectives and targets and consider new initiatives. The Steering Group involves senior management in each of the three main organisations responsible for the delivery of the strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/3">Actual delivery of the activities and initiatives set out in the strategy will be co-ordinated by the Road Safety Review Group, which is chaired by a senior official in the DOE and includes representatives from Roads Service and PSNIs Road Policing Development Branch.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/4">Since the launch of the strategy there have been five joint launches involving the DOE and PSNI, including the launch of the new anti-speeding campaign where the Assistant Chief Constable and I reaffirmed our commitment to road safety and to influence positively the attitudes and behaviour of all road users through education and enforcement.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/5">Officials from the DRD Roads Service have regular liaison meetings with PSNI to discuss any relevant issues to do with traffic management and road safety from an engineering perspective. Roads Service officials have also met recently with PSNI to discuss road safety on the A2 Belfast to Bangor road in North Down.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/6">As part of a major initiative on use of fixed and mobile safety cameras throughout Northern Ireland, four sites on the A2 Belfast to Bangor Road have been selected for enforcement by safety cameras and new signing for these sites was erected on <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-01">1 July 2003</phrase>, superseding earlier speed camera signing. This again was undertaken by PSNI in conjunction with Roads Service and was as a result of the close liaison between the two organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/7">The hon. Member may be interested to note that although the number of fatalities (87) to date this year is higher than the comparable period in the last two years, the numbers of killed and seriously injured (KSI), which are the recognised road safety indicators throughout the UK, have shown a steady decline. In the first five months of this year (the last full period for which comparative figures are available) the KSI total is 581 compared with 682 for the same period in 2002 and 701 in 2001.</p>
	<p pid=".203W.2/8">There will continue to be positive and constructive discussions not only between the DOE, DRD and PSNI, but also with all its partners in road safety to ensure safer roads for everyone in Northern Ireland. However, it is incumbent upon all road users to take personal responsibility for their action when using the roads.</p>

	<p pid=".211W.5/1">Given current levels of waste disposed of by incineration, a tax on the incineration of municipal waste of &pound;35 per tonne would be expected to raise about &pound;90 million per annum. However, it is unlikely that this level of revenue would be generated, as a tax on incineration at such a rate would be expected to lead to more waste going to alternatives such as landfill. The current level of landfill tax is &pound;14 per tonne rising to &pound;15 next year, and will be increased by at least &pound;3 per tonne each year from 2005&ndash;06 until it reaches a rate of &pound;35 per tonne in the medium to long term. These increases will help encourage reductions in the quantities of waste disposed of to landfill. No estimate has been made of the projected levels of incineration which would result from the building of all municipal waste incinerators for which planning applications have been made.</p>

These include: a recruitment drive for new anti-smuggling teams and dog handlers; re-deploying existing anti-smuggling staff to target these illegal importations; transferring &quot;meat&quot; dogs and their handlers from Defra to Customs; instituting a programme of awareness meetings with senior Government officials from targeted risk countries, undertaking a series of training seminars for Customs staff and developing new publicity posters and leaflets for ports and airports in the UK.</p>

	<p pid=".215W.2/3" class="indent">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking for the percentage of gross incomes paid in indirect taxes by income decile for <i>(a)</i> retired and <i>(b)</i> non retired households. (124448)</p>
	<p pid=".215W.2/4" class="indent">Estimates for indirect taxes and income are based on the analysis &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income 2001&ndash;02&quot; produced by the ONS and published on the National Statistics website on April 11th 2003 and in Economic Trends in the May 2003 edition. The analysis can be obtained from the House of Commons library. This includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey (EPS). Due to the sampling variability of each measure, sample sizes are only sufficient to allow a breakdown to be given by quintiles for the ratio of indirect taxes to gross income, and not by decile.</p>
	<p pid=".215W.2/5" class="indent">A retired household in the analysis of &quot;The effects of taxes and benefits on household income 2001&ndash;02&quot; is defined as one where the combined income of 'retired' members amounts to at least half the total gross income of the household. A 'retired' person is defined as anyone in the EPS survey who is over minimum Nl pension age and is 'unoccupied' or 'sick or injured but not intending to seek work,' or who describes themselves as 'retired'.</p>
	<p pid=".215W.2/6" class="indent">The following table shows the estimated indirect taxes as a proportion of gross income for retired and non-retired households in the UK for each income quintile where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. The table also shows the lower bands of the equivalised disposable income quintiles, which have been calculated separately for the retired and non retired households. For example, the lower bound of the 2nd quintile for the retired households is the income below which one fifth of all retired households are estimated to lie and similarly for the non-retired households. Since indirect tax tends to be a higher proportion of income for lower income bands, using different quintile points for retired and non-retired households affects the relative percentages for each quintile.</p>
	<p pid=".215W.2/7" class="indent">Estimates of indirect taxes are imputed using household expenditure given in the EPS. One drawback of comparing the incidence of indirect taxes on households at different levels of income is that, by whatever measure used, on average, recorded expenditure exceeds income apparently available for it by significant amounts at the bottom of the distribution.</p>
	<p pid=".215W.2/8" class="indent">Income and expenditure data recorded in the EFS are not fully compatible because they are recorded in different ways. Indeed, measured expenditure exceeds measured income for households in the lower half of the distribution.</p>
	<p pid=".215W.2/9" class="indent">There are a number of possible explanations for this. Some households with low incomes may draw on their savings or borrow in order to finance their expenditure. In these cases, expenditure is not being met from current income. Some types of receipts are not included as income in the EFS e.g. inheritance and severance payments.</p>
	<p pid=".215W.2/10" class="indent">In some cases, the information given on expenditure is not consistent with that on income received, possibly because of timing differences.</p>

	<p pid=".219W.2/4" class="indent">There are no figures for jobs created but an indication can be obtained by comparing the annual surveys of employee jobs.

	<p pid=".219W.2/5" class="indent">The ABI was preceded, prior to 1998, by the Annual Employment Survey. This inquiry had a different structure to the AB1 and so direct comparisons cannot be made between the AES and ABI at a regional level.</p>

	<p pid=".223W.2/1">The Department of Health recognises that moving between care homes can be difficult and stressful for any long-term resident, particularly vulnerable older people. Such moves, including ones made as a result of care home closures, should be handled as sensitively and appropriately as possible. Proper arrangements should be made for the safe and satisfactory transfer of all residents to other suitable homes. There should be adequate time for this to be done, in a way that allows both residents and their relatives a choice in where they are to move to, and which creates the minimum possible discomfort to all concerned.</p>
	<p pid=".223W.2/2">For each resident supported under section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948, councils should agree a contract with independent care homes that includes a statement of terms and conditions covering matters such as fees and period of notice. This is in accordance with Standard 2 of the National Minimum Standards for Care Homes for Older People. Councils should play a part in facilitating transfers from one home to another as and when appropriate. With respect to supported residents who are transferring, councils should ensure that residents' needs are re-assessed and alternative and appropriate accommodation is arranged promptly, with due regard to the Choice of Accommodation Directions 1992.</p>
	<p pid=".223W.2/3">With respect to residents who fund their own care, Standard 2 of the National Minimum Standards for Care Homes for Older People also states that contracts agreed by the residents and care homes should cover fees payable, the period of notice and other matters. If, when homes close or residents transfer for other reasons, self-funding residents require advice on other homes to enter and how to go about it, councils should provide this advice. If self-funding residents lack the capacity to make their own arrangements, following an assessment of their needs, councils should take over the arrangements.</p>

This target is being accomplished by the creation of 50 early intervention teams across the country.</p>

	<p pid=".229W.5/3">Also, NHS Direct's call handling capacity will more than double to 16 million calls annually by 2006, backed by a funding increase to &pound;182 million. Improved 24-hour access to clinical advice by telephone from home will cut the burden on general practitioners and the emergency services, including for people with mental health problems, who can obtain rapid advice from trained nurses.</p>
	<p pid=".229W.5/4">As part of the mental health modernisation agenda, steps are being taken to increase capacity in both community and hospital based provision that will help provide quicker and more convenient services. Establishing crisis resolution services and more hospital beds as well as improving access to child and adolescent mental health services by 10 per cent. each year across the service according to agreed local priorities are among these steps.</p>

Needs assessment is the responsibility of local agencies as part of their service planning activity. Systematic mapping of local child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) provision across England was launched last year and it is intended to repeat this annually. This will provide detailed information on service provision, service activity levels and expenditure on CAMHS by provider trust and by local authority and primary care trust commissioners. Data currently available can be found on the dedicated website at <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/service.mapping/CAMH/">www.dur.ac.uk/service.mapping/CAMH/</a>.</p>
	<p pid=".230W.2/2">The Government's strategy for the development of CAMHS, initiated in 1999, has made significant progress in improving the overall quality and accessibility of local services for children and young people with mental health problems. Our current central investment programme of &pound;250 million over the coming three years aims to help secure comprehensive CAMHS in all areas by 2006, in line with the objectives contained in &quot;Improvement, Expansion, Reform the Priorities and Planning Framework 2003&ndash;06&quot; published by the Department in October 2002.</p>

The Department of Health and the Food Standards Agency have been in ongoing discussions with food manufacturers and retailers about the levels of salt in specific categories of processed foods, reductions that have been made in the past and the opportunities for further reductions. The principal bodies that have been involved are the Food and Drink Federation, the British Retail Consortium, the British Frozen Food Federation and the Joint Food Service Industry Group.</p>

To ensure that there is a co-ordinated and strategic approach to the planning and delivery of sport and physical activity across a diverse range of sectors&mdash;such as transport, countryside management and town planning&mdash;and in response to this target, a Sport and Physical Activity Board (SPAB) has been established.

LEAPs will test the effectiveness of primary care trust-led interventions to increase access and levels of physical activity in communities based in neighbourhood renewal areas. Involving a range of partners, the activities range from walking, cycling and swimming, to clinical-based programmes that are focusing on diabetes and weight management.</p>

We are, with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, continuing to expand the programme of electoral pilot schemes to test innovative methods of voting at local elections. We have announced our intention, subject to parliamentary approval, to hold next year's European parliamentary, local and GLA elections on the same day, so that voters will only need to turn out once, rather than twice within a short period. All these measures are designed to increase flexibility and convenience for voters and thus encourage greater turnout. In addition, we introduced legislation to set up the independent Electoral Commission. The Commission has a duty to educate and inform the public about the importance of participation in the democratic process and a remit to recommend ways in which our electoral arrangements can be improved. We will consider carefully any recommendations made by the Electoral Commission which may have an impact on electoral turnout.</p>

	<p pid=".239W.6/1">Agency workers can experience intermittent periods of employment and unemployment. The fear of finding themselves involved in a lengthy claim process and without an income during these periods of unemployment may have, in the past, discouraged many people from taking this type of work.</p>
	<p pid=".239W.6/2">In order to assist people in these circumstances we introduced Rapid Reclaim to ensure a smooth transition from work to benefit. Rapid Reclaim is available to customers who find themselves having to reclaim Income Support, Jobseekers Allowance, Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit within 12 weeks of having previously claimed the same benefit. The Rapid Reclaim process allows Decision Makers to use information provided for the previous claim alongside a shorter claim form, completed by the customer, that captures any changes that may have occurred during the break in their claim. This speeds up the data collection process and so reduces the time from making a claim to receiving the first payment.</p>
	<p pid=".239W.6/3">Rapid Reclaim is making it easier for people to take up work, that may be only short-term or through an agency, as it reduces the fear that there will be a delay in the resumption of benefits during the periods that they are off work.</p>

There is no data available about who might be entitled to either DLA or AA if they were to make a claim.

	<p pid=".243W.2/1">The Regulatory Impact Assessment on the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Amendment) Regulations 2003, which is available in the Library, estimates that the average cost for small businesses with one to 15 employees of removing the small firms exemption in the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) is &pound;5.50, although many small employers will have no costs at all. The total cost to these small businesses will be about &pound;6 million. Of this, &pound;3.9 million is a one-off cost while &pound;2.1 million is a recurring cost, and includes &pound;0.7 million for recruitment. This does not take into account the many benefits that employers can gain from employing and retaining disabled people such as access to a wide pool of applicants, retention of skills and knowledge and better motivation more generally among the workforce.</p>
	<p pid=".243W.2/2">There are around 1,087,000 businesses with between one and 14 employees. Within these businesses, there are around 382,000 disabled employees who will be protected from discrimination by the DDA's employment provisions as a result of the inclusion of small employers. Other provisions in the Regulations will end a number of other employment and occupational exclusions such as the police, fire-fighters and partners in business partnerships. These measures are expected to bring an additional 218,000 disabled workers within scope of the DDA. Other provisions in the Regulations applying to organisations of all sizes could affect all of the 2,243,000 disabled workers in GB (Winter 2002 Labour Force Survey).</p>
	<p pid=".243W.2/3">We consulted on draft regulations to implement the sexual orientation, religion and belief and disability provisions of the Article 13 Employment Directive in our 2002 document &quot;Equality and Diversity&mdash;the way ahead&quot;. Of the 172 respondents who replied on issues specifically concerning the disability provisions, only 2 identified themselves as a private organisation employing one to 14 employees; the vast majority of replies were from representative bodies, disability organisations, public bodies and voluntary organisations. Neither of those respondents commented on a potential adverse impact of the disability regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".243W.2/4">The Federation of small businesses responded to the consultation but did not comment on compliance costs. Other respondents representing employers, such as the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors, may have taken account of views from small and medium-sized employers in submitting their replies but it is not possible to measure the extent to which their replies were informed by members with fewer than 15 employees. The majority of such responses concerned the operation of the regulations themselves. However, the IoD questioned some of the assumptions made by Government in estimating the overall costs of implementing the Directive. There have been no representations from small employers or their representative bodies on the disability regulations since they were approved by Parliament.</p>

	<p pid=".244W.2/1">The Department is currently undertaking a campaign to raise awareness of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) among all types of businesses, including those in the tourism industry. As Minister for Disabled People, I am undertaking a series of regional visits which highlight disability issues and remind employers and service providers of their duties under the Act, and these have been supported by radio advertising and press articles.</p>
	<p pid=".244W.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-15">15 May 2003</phrase>, we launched two major elements of this campaign; an information pack, aimed particularly at small and medium-sized enterprises. The pack contains advisory leaflets for employers and service providers, together with a video entitled 'Act Now&mdash;the DDA and Your Business'. This video provides information about the duties that employers and service providers have under the Act. It shows practical examples of what some companies have done to improve access for their disabled workers and customers and the 'Access All Areas' award which aims to recognise and congratulate small organisations that have made imaginative changes to the way they provide their services so that disabled people can use them. Details of the award and an entry form are available on the website <a href="http://www.disability.gov.uk">www.disability.gov.uk</a> and are included in the information pack, which is available to any business free of charge.</p>
	<p pid=".244W.2/3">The Department has undertaken a mailshot of the information packs to business organisations such as Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses, CBI Regional Offices, and local Businesslink offices. We have liaised with VisitBritain which has publicised the award on its website and in its email newsletter which reaches 200,000 tourism businesses. The Tourism Skills Network has also advertised the award on its website.</p>
	<p pid=".244W.2/4">In addition, the Department sponsors, and is continuing to work with, the Disability Rights Commission (DRC), to promote a greater awareness and understanding of the rights of disabled people. The DRC provides advice via its helpline to employers, service providers and members of the public about rights and duties under the DDA.</p>
	<p pid=".244W.2/5">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport provides funding for England's 9 Regional Tourist Boards (RTBs), and one function of the RTBs is to interpret and communicate the impact of legislation which applies to the tourism sector&mdash;this includes the DDA.</p>

	<p pid=".245W.5/1">Making the move from benefit into employment can be worrying. In recognition of this a package of measures has been developed, designed to provide real support for people making this transition and give them confidence that they can take up work. These measures include Job Grant, Lone Parents' Run-On, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit Extended Payments, Mortgage Interest Run-On, the Adviser Discretion Fund, Social Fund Crisis Loans and the New Tax Credits. In addition we have announced further plans to financially assist people during the transition from benefit to work.</p>
	<p pid=".245W.5/2">From April 2004 we will be extending the Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit Extended Payments to people claiming Incapacity Benefit and Severe Disablement Allowance, making it easier for people on these benefits to manage the first few weeks in work. At the same time we will be extending the &pound;11.90 Housing Benefit earnings disregard to people working 16 hours a week and who are receiving or are entitled to Working Tax Credit. This disregard is currently only available to those working 30 hours or more a week and who receiving, or are entitled to, Working Tax Credit.</p>
	<p pid=".245W.5/3">From October 2004 we will be introducing a unified, more streamlined and easier to understand Job Grant that will also replace the Lone Parents' Benefit Run-On. The new Job Grant will have two rates; one for people with, and another for those without, children. It will, for the first time, be available to partners of benefit claimants who are taking up work and taking the household off benefit. Finally we will also be piloting a new in-work credit for lone parents, also from October 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".245W.5/4">These measures will help people financially during the difficult period between the last payment of benefit and the first payment of wages.</p>

Enforcement of health and safety law in the agriculture sector rests with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and a summary of HSE's enforcement and other activities can be found in the Health and Safety Commission's annual report available from the House library. HSE is involved with other Government agencies and departments in the Gangmaster Working Group's activities to co-ordinate enforcement activity against gangmasters acting illegally.</p>

	<p pid=".249W.6/2">Our working assumption is around three million Post Office card accounts will have been opened by 2005. However, there is no cap on numbers and anyone who wants to open an account can do so. Present indications are that the final number will be significantly above three million. The precise cost at any given level of take-up is commercial in confidence to Post Office Limited and is not released in line with paragraph 13, part 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government information.</p>

	<p pid=".266W.8/3">While there remain security and humanitarian concerns in some areas, the threat of persecution from Saddam Hussein's regime no longer exists. We did not want to keep applications on hold longer than necessary given the uncertainty this creates for the individuals concerned. Having obtained information about conditions in Iraq from a range of sources, we concluded that there was sufficient information on which to base decisions As with asylum applications from all nationalities, each case will be considered individually on its merits.</p>
	<p pid=".266W.8/4">The United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) is currently making preparations for the eventual return of large numbers of Iraqis and is developing a return and reintegration plan. UNHCR understands that there are people who wish to return right now and is aware that we are making plans for voluntary return programmes. We are aware of their concerns and will continue to work closely with them. With this in mind, we are developing a coherent returns strategy. Initially the emphasis will be on facilitating voluntary returns. Enforced returns will only be considered once we are satisfied that conditions on the ground allow for this.</p>

	<p pid=".271W.5/2">Elderly people are far less likely to suffer crime than younger people. But in recognition that crime against older people is particularly distasteful, we have funded several schemes specifically to tackle this problem.</p>
	<p pid=".271W.5/3">We set up a Distraction Burglary Task Force in 2000 to facilitate a multi-agency approach to reducing the problem of bogus callers and rogue traders. The task force includes people from different agencies who work with older people, such as Age Concern and Help the Aged, as well agencies such as the police. It has invested substantial resources and effort in promoting local schemes to tackle the problem, liaising with utility companies and others that need to call on the elderly, gathering data and publicising good practice both to the elderly and to those that work with them.</p>
	<p pid=".271W.5/4">Under the Crime Reduction Programme, we funded a two-year programme (the Locks for Pensioners scheme) to provide home security upgrades for low income pensioners in areas with burglary rates above the national average. The scheme was run in conjunction with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra's) Warm Front scheme, and, under it, over 58,000 homes received additional locks or bolts.</p>
	<p pid=".271W.5/5">The Locks for Pensioners scheme has ended. But it is now open to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships to fund local schemes where they identify crime against the elderly as a problem in their area. We cannot provide comprehensive data on locally funded projects for the elderly as this information is not held centrally. However, we know that interventions being implemented include improving the appearance and security of homes, sharing intelligence with all the involved agencies, educating people in crime reduction measures and providing reassurance and assistance.</p>
	<p pid=".271W.5/6">The work we are taking forward to tackle crime generally, while not solely aimed at older people, deals with many of the concerns they have about their safety.</p>
	<p pid=".271W.5/7">General initiatives which may have a particular impact on older people include the introduction of Community Support Officers tasked with tackling low-level crime and anti-social behaviour of the sort that causes older people much concern, and work with the Department of Health to evaluate the effectiveness of security technology in reducing crime and the fear of crime in two pilot hospitals and one ambulance service</p>
	<p pid=".271W.5/8">in England.</p>

	<p pid=".274W.2/20">Interventions funded by crime reduction allocations included: a town centre Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) system, targeted policing operations, mobile CCTV, an initiative on tackling domestic violence, supporting youth mentoring, installation of security improvements and funding community support workers.</p>
	<p pid=".274W.2/21" class="italic">2. Community Cohesion Initiatives</p>
	<p pid=".274W.2/22">The Community Cohesion Pathfinder Programme, launched by the Home Office and Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) in October 2002, aims to build examples of areas that are successfully mainstreaming community cohesion into all their core service delivery functions. The programme encompasses local authorities, the community and voluntary sector, and communities themselves. Pendle is one of the five authorities (together with Lancashire County Council, Burnley Borough Council, Hyndburn Borough Council, and Rossendale Borough Council) which make up the successful East Lancashire Community Cohesion Pathfinder. This will receive a total of &pound;285,000 to spend in the period February 2003 to October 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".274W.2/23">The Home Office Community Cohesion Unit has worked closely with the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit of the ODPM, and through Government offices has funded community cohesion-focused activities for children and young people during the summer of 2001 and 2002 (in 2003 this has become incorporated into a single funded inter-Departmental programme). In 2001 around &pound;7 million was provided for summer activities.</p>
	<p pid=".274W.2/24" class="italic">Positive Activities for Young People (PAYP)</p>
	<p pid=".274W.2/25">On <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-29">29 October 2002</phrase>, the Street Crime Action Group (SCAG) commissioned the Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to report on the evaluation of summer activities in 2002 and on progress on simplifying funding.</p>
	<p pid=".274W.2/26">In December, SCAG approved the key design features and objectives of the new programme based on a simplified single pot for funding. The confirmed total funding pot for 2003&ndash;04 is &pound;24.7 million. The formula for the new programme, which for the first time is being developed in each Local Education Authority (LEA) area in the North West, is a national one. It is based on three indicators of need: levels of truancy, offending rates (specifically rates of robbery), and the numbers of young people aged 8&ndash;19 in each area.</p>
	<p pid=".274W.2/27">It is not possible to provide a figure for Pendle, but each Government office has the flexibility to adjust the allocations by up to 15 per cent. of the regional total. The allocation to Lancashire has been increased by over &pound;115,000 and GO-NW staff are looking to the LEA to take forward enhanced activities in east Lancashire in Burnley, Pendle and Hyndburn.</p>
	<p pid=".274W.2/28">The Neighbourhood Renewal Unit of the ODPM and Government offices have also funded the community facilitation programme, under which regional co-ordinators have been appointed to undertake conflict resolution work where tensions are identified, and to strengthen existing capacity for conflict resolution. This programme has raised the profile of community cohesion at the regional and local level and facilitated the building of relationships and partnerships between agencies to address community cohesion and conflict. It has successfully supported the development of new approaches to addressing community conflicts.</p>
	<p pid=".274W.2/29" class="italic">3. Police Initiatives</p>
	<p pid=".274W.2/30">Pendle, Rossendale and Burnley are boroughs within the Pennine division of the Lancashire constabulary. Lancashire as a whole has benefited from a &pound;0.06 million rural policing grant. Each borough has its own Chief Inspector answering to the Chief Superintendent of Pennine Division. The force has informed us that the borough Pendle has benefited from the following Government initiatives.</p>

	<p pid=".275W.2/2">The environmental sentencing review is looking at sentencing from a broad perspective and is principally concerned with the sentence given to a particular offence, rather than preventative measures taken against it. We expect the results by the end of June.</p>
	<p pid=".275W.2/3">Specific measures to help tackle fly tipping have been proposed in the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill. If successful, the provisions will allow local authorities to stop, search and seize vehicles suspected of being used for fly tipping, and to investigate incidents to help them track and prosecute those responsible for dumping waste. The Bill will also give the Secretary of State the power to issue statutory directions to the Environment Agency and local authorities on the types of fly tipping incidents with which they deal.</p>
	<p pid=".275W.2/4">Further research into fly tipping will be carried out later this year that will focus on better enforcement, prevention and deterrents.</p>

	<p pid=".283W.2/1">In September 1998, the Government announced a target to reduce vehicle crime by 30 per cent. over five years. The Vehicle Crime Reduction Action Team (VCRAT) was set up at the same time to develop and oversee the implementation of initiatives to meet this target. They published their strategy on <phrase class="date" code="1999-09-22">22 September 1999</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.2/2">Their main proposals included improved security of new and used cars, improved car park security, better policing and community responses which targeted prolific offenders and crime hotspots, improved vehicle registration procedures, statutory regulation of the motor salvage industry and a publicity campaign to get vehicle crime prevention messages across to the public. Good progress is being made in implementing all these initiatives and some have been developed further. For example, work is in hand to make further improvements to vehicle registration procedures and we are working more closely with some local authorities and voluntary and community groups to get across vehicle crime prevention messages.</p>
	<p pid=".283W.2/3">The latest published British Crime Survey shows that, from interviews in the year to December 2002, there were an estimated 2,306,000 vehicle crimes (i.e. thefts of or from vehicles or attempts). This is a reduction of 703,000 offences (23 per cent.) against the baseline of the British Crime Survey 2000 (which estimated crime in 1999).</p>

Homes are being funded within the Housing Corporation's Social Housing Grant regime across a number of London boroughs where there are currently high numbers of black and minority ethnic households in temporary accommodation including B&amp;B hotels.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.6/5">Affordable housing has a vital role to play in tackling homelessness. As detailed in the Sustainable Communities Plan, &pound;5 billion is being invested in affordable housing over the next three years. This will make a further contribution to preventing homelessness and moving families out of B&amp;B.</p>
	<p pid=".285W.6/6">In 2003&ndash;04 we are increasing the funding for the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme to around &pound;1.5 billion in 2003&ndash;04 to provide homes for both rent and low cost home ownership&mdash;an increase of &pound;500 million on last year. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expect the Housing Corporation's programme, including the Challenge Fund in London and South-east England, to deliver around 22,000 homes this year.</p>

	<p pid=".286W.2/1">The Indices of Deprivation 2000 (ID2000) have been used to determine Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF) eligibility and the basis of distribution of the grant between eligible authorities. The Department decided that those authorities that appear within the top 50 most deprived districts on any of the six district level measures in the ID2000 should be eligible for the NRF. On this basis 81 authorities are eligible. It was also decided that there should be transitional arrangements for those authorities that were within the 50 most deprived areas on any of the four measures under the old Index of Local Deprivation, but are not in the list of 81 authorities that qualify using the ID2000. Therefore, a further seven local authority areas are eligible for the Fund. The 88 local authorities that are eligible for NRF and the amounts allocated to each authority in 2003/04 are listed in Annex A of the Special Grant Report 111 (SGR 111).</p>
	<p pid=".286W.2/2">The sum to be allocated to each authority is based on a standard amount per head of population in those wards in the authority that are in the most deprived 10 per cent. of all wards nationally, with a minimum allocation in 2003&ndash;04 of &pound;400,000 for any eligible authority. This relates an authority's grant funding to the severity of deprivation within its area, measured by the number of their residents living in particularly deprived areas.</p>

	<p pid=".290W.2/2">Information summarised in Table 4 shows that 129,320 households were accepted as homeless and in priority need by local authorities in England during 2002&ndash;03.

	<p pid=".291W.2/1">Following publication for the first time in September 2002 of local authority homelessness statistics in relation to homelessness amongst black and minority ethnic communities, the Homelessness Directorate in my Department commissioned research to investigate the causes of homelessness amongst people from different black and minority ethnic groups and whether existing homelessness services meet their needs. This work is focused on BME households who have been accepted by the local authority as having a priority need for accommodation, but will cover issues around what the review of evidence in relation to housing and black and minority ethnic communities referred to as &quot;so-called hidden homelessness&quot;. The current research is due to report in the Autumn and will include good practice recommendations on effective responses to homelessness for people from different black and minority ethnic groups.</p>
	<p pid=".291W.2/2">In addition to this research, the Homelessness Act 2002 requires all local authorities to conduct a review of homelessness and have a strategy based on that review. The first strategies must be in place by <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-30">30 July</phrase> this year and must aim to prevent homelessness and ensure that accommodation and support are available for people who become homeless or are at risk of doing so. Statutory and good practice guidance issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister emphasises the need for reviews, strategies and homelessness services to address the needs of black and minority ethnic communities.</p>
	<p pid=".291W.2/3">Earlier this year, the Homelessness Directorate sponsored a series of seminars around the country designed to help local authorities and other agencies engage with, and address the needs of, faith and black and minority ethnic communities in conducting homelessness reviews and developing homelessness strategies and services.</p>
	<p pid=".291W.2/4">A breakdown of homelessness amongst black and minority ethnic groups is now published quarterly with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's regular statistical release on homelessness. The Homelessness Directorate will keep the extent of homelessness amongst black and minority ethnic communities, and the evidence base relating to that, under review.</p>

	<p pid=".299W.2/1">The Government's policies for delivering an urban renaissance were set out in theUrban White Paper &quot;Our Towns and our Cities: the Future&quot; published in November 2000. This provides the framework within which Government policies and programmes affecting urban areas in England are co-ordinated.</p>
	<p pid=".299W.2/2">In February 2003, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister launched &quot;Sustainable Communities: building for the future&quot;&mdash;a &pound;22 billion action programme to improve housing and communities, including over &pound;5 billion to regenerate deprived areas. This programme builds on the policies and actions in the Urban White Paper and the Rural White Paper &quot;Our Countryside: the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".299W.2/3">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has established a &pound;2 billion Single Regeneration Budget to provide resources to support regeneration activity carried out by local regeneration partnerships. Managed at regional level by the RDAs, this programme promotes sustainable economic growth, enterprise and major regeneration projects in nine English regions (including London), with a focus on urban areas. 14 Urban Regeneration Companies have been set up to regenerate some of the most neglected areas in our towns and cities.</p>
	<p pid=".299W.2/4">English Partnerships (EP) are involved in wide range of regeneration and development projects across the country. EP is focusing on identifying and delivering more brownfield land for housing and sustainable urban development. Already an initial list of 42 sites have been announced for EP to concentrate on.</p>
	<p pid=".299W.2/5">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is also investing over &pound;4 billion through the Neighbourhood Renewal National Strategy Action Plan to tackle deprivation, and extend prosperity and opportunity to the poorest neighbourhoods in the country. This money is used to encourage the better targeting of services and mainstream public funds to the most deprived areas and to provide evidence of best practice through pathfinder programmes.</p>
