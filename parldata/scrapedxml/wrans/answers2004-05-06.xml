	<p pid=".1652W.2/1">The Food Standards Agency (FSA) review of the Over-30-Month rule was completed in July 2003 and recommended that it would be acceptable on public health grounds to replace the rule with BSE testing of cattle in two stages. Cattle born after August 1996 could be allowed into the food chain, after being tested for BSE, with the possibility of complete replacement of the rule from July 2005. Health Ministers are still considering the FSA advice, but it has already been decided that, for practical reasons, cattle born before August 1996 will be permanently excluded from the food chain. We are now unlikely to see any changes to the OTMS before January 2005, due to the legislative process that must take place once a decision has been reached by Ministers.</p>

	<p pid=".1652W.5/1">The Climate Change Programme, published in 2000, sets out an integrated package of policies and measures to reduce the UK's emissions of carbon dioxide from all sectors of the economy. Policies in the programme include the Climate Change Levy which is helping to fund measures to promote better energy efficiency in business and the public sector; the UK emissions trading scheme; targets to provide 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity from renewable sources of energy by 2010; the Energy Efficiency Commitment requiring electricity and gas suppliers to help domestic customers to save energy and cut fuel bills and; reforms to vehicle excise duty and company car taxation to support the aims of the European Union (EU) voluntary agreements with car manufacturers to improve fuel efficiency by at least 25 per cent. on 1995 levels by 2008&ndash;09.</p>
	<p pid=".1652W.5/2">The Climate Change Programme will be reviewed later this year, which will provide an opportunity to introduce new policies, or strengthen existing ones, if the conclusion is that more needs to be done to keep us on track towards our domestic goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".1652W.5/3">The 2003 Energy White Paper set out an ambitious long-term strategy for UK energy policy and real progress has been made towards implementation of the White Paper's commitments. &quot;Creating a Low Carbon Economy&mdash;First Annual Report on Implementation of the Energy White Paper&quot;, published on 26 April, sets out the progress made to date and summarises the practical steps already taken in pursuit of the long-term goals.</p>
	<p pid=".1652W.5/4">On 26 April, the Government also published its Energy Efficiency Action Plan which details action to meet the energy efficiency commitments set out in the Energy White Paper. The Action Plan sets out a package of policies and measures that are expected to save around 12 million tonnes of carbon by 2010; a 20 per cent. increase on the Energy White Paper's commitment of 10 million tonnes.</p>
	<p pid=".1652W.5/5">Key new measures in the Action Plan include, increasing the activity levels for the Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC) over the period 2005&ndash;08 to be roughly double those under the current EEC, and the EEC to continue to 2011 with a review in 2007; a new commitment by central Government to procure only high standard (top quartile) buildings and; a commitment to consider ways to better communicate about climate change, raising awareness of the links between climate change, energy policy and the choices we make as individuals, businesses and public sector organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".1652W.5/6">Our combined heat and power (CHP) Strategy, published on 26 April, confirmed our belief that CHP has an important role to play in achieving our Energy White Paper aims and our continued aim towards our target of 10 gigawatts of Good Quality CHP capacity in the UK by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".1652W.5/7">Policies and measures are also being developed at an EU level under the European Climate Change Programme (ECCP). These measures, which include the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, will complement measures being taken at a national level, and reduce emissions across all member states.</p>

	<p pid=".1653W.2/1">Government are committed to the key principles for setting the total level of allowances to UK installations as set out in the draft National Allocation Plan (NAP) in January. The key principle of the UK allocation methodology is that the total level of allowances for the first phase will be less than the projected emissions of the UK installations covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. This reduction will be set on the basis that these installations would deliver a further 5.5 million tonnes CO <sub>2</sub>     savings by 2010.</p>

	<p pid=".1654W.6/1">The UK Climate Change Programme, published in November 2000, seeks to reduce emissions from all sectors of the economy. The Programme was intended to be flexible and cost effective and did not set targets for individual sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".1654W.6/2">UK carbon dioxide emissions were around 165 million tonnes of carbon (MtC) in 1990. Reducing emissions by 20 per cent. will correspond to a reduction of around 33 MtC by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".1654W.6/3">Policies in the Climate Change Programme to reduce emissions from transport include the EU voluntary agreements on carbon dioxide emissions from cars, backed up by changes to company car taxation and vehicle excise duty; the 10 year plan for transport and; sustainable distribution in Scotland and Wales. At the time the Programme was published, it was estimated that these policies could reduce transport emissions by a total of 5.7 MtC below the projected business as usual emissions for 2010 which would have reduced the projected increase in emissions from transport to around 2.5 per cent. above 1990 levels by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".1654W.6/4">The Government are committed to reviewing the Climate Change Programme later this year, including the measures introduced to reduce transport emissions. The implications of the rolled forward strategy for transport, which the Government expects to publish in the summer after the conclusion of the spending review, will also feed into this review. The Department for Transport is currently consulting stakeholders on the UK's targets for the use of transport biofuels under the Biofuels Directive. Achieving 5 per cent. use of biofuels today would save around &pound;1 million tonnes of carbon per annum&mdash;around three per cent. of overall road transport carbon dioxide emissions. To date indications are that the transport sector is not currently on course to deliver the level of carbon savings estimated in the UK Climate Change Programme. Details of this were outlined in the 10 Year Plan Progress Report.</p>

	<p pid=".1656W.0/1">The Government have no plans for the introduction of a national tax, or charge, on household waste. The Strategy Unit Report, &quot;Waste not, Want not&quot;, recommended that local authorities who wish to take forward household incentive schemes to help reduce waste amounts and increase recycling, should be allowed to do so. In response to this recommendation work has been carried out to examine the impact of household incentive schemes. This work has looked in particular at the practicalities of operating any such schemes and how potential disadvantages might be overcome.</p>
	<p pid=".1656W.0/2">&quot;Waste Not Want Not&quot; also recommended that the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) should take forward work supporting re-usable nappy schemes. The aim of this work, now under way, is to achieve an average diversion of 225 kg/year per participating household by 2006. The scheme seeks to reach 550,000 households, equivalent to 24 per cent. of households with children aged 0&ndash;3 years. This would reduce arisings by a total of 200,000 tonnes over three years.</p>

	<p pid=".1658W.11/1">'Energy Efficiency: The Government's Plan for Action' published on 26 April 2004, sets out how the Government aims to cut carbon emissions by an 12 million tonnes through energy efficiency measures across all sectors by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".1658W.11/2">In UK households, we have announced a new aim to deliver annual savings of 4.2 million tonnes of carbon by 2010. Measures to achieve this include:</p>
	<p pid=".1658W.11/3" class="indent">The Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC)&mdash;we intend the activity levels for EEC over the period 2005&ndash;08 to be roughly double those under the current EEC, and the EEC to continue to 2011, possibly with changes in the way in which it is delivered. We anticipate that the EEC will continue at the same higher level to 2011, subject to its continuing cost effectiveness in relation to other carbon abatement options and value for money for end consumers;</p>
	<p pid=".1658W.11/4" class="indent">Updating the Building Regulations in 2005, thus raising standards of all new and refurbished buildings, not just households. Provisions for higher boiler standards will come into force in April 2005. Energy surveys and certification of all buildings, will be among the measures introduced to implement the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive;</p>
	<p pid=".1658W.11/5" class="indent">A major new training scheme for heating installers, is to precede the revision of the boiler provisions in the Building Regulations in 2005;</p>
	<p pid=".1658W.11/6" class="indent">In the social sector, social landlords will continue to carry out improvements to the heating and insulation of their housing through the Decent Homes programme. The Warm Front grant programme will continue to tackle fuel poverty by installing heating and other energy efficiency measures;</p>
	<p pid=".1658W.11/7" class="indent">Fiscal incentives already reduce the cost of professionally installed insulation. Budget 2004 announced additional economic incentives for energy efficiency, including tax relief for landlords installing insulation, and a reduced rate of VAT on ground-source heat pumps;</p>
	<p pid=".1658W.11/8" class="indent">Negotiating rising standards for energy using appliances via EU-wide agreements and policy instruments. Also, improving product standards, with negotiations underway on the Eco-design of Energy Using Products Directive;</p>
	<p pid=".1658W.11/9" class="indent">Grants to support community heating (the Community Energy Programme) and small-scale renewable generation (Clear Skies and the major photovoltaic demonstration programme);</p>
	<p pid=".1658W.11/10" class="indent">The Energy Saving Trust's information and advice programmes for households and local authorities;</p>
	<p pid=".1658W.11/11">There will also be enhanced emphasis on communicating the links between climate change and energy efficiency and a stronger emphasis on communicating the reality of climate change, raising public awareness of the links between climate change and energy.</p>

	<p pid=".1662W.6/1">The soil and climatic conditions in the countries that have banned ammonium nitrate (AN) fertilisers&mdash;China, Colombia, Algeria and the Philippines&mdash;are very different from those experienced in the UK. One of the principal alternative fertilisers used in these countries is urea. Urea-based fertilisers give rise to greater ammonia emissions than AN. A switch to urea could, therefore, put at risk the UK's ability to meet internationally-agreed ammonia reduction targets. Crops cannot use urea directly. It must first be converted to ammonium and to nitrate nitrogen in the soil before being taken up by plants. As a result, urea can, in cold conditions, be slower acting than AN. The loss of ammonia from urea can also reduce crop yields, thus adding to the cost of crop production. As mentioned in my previous answer, we have an ongoing dialogue with industry to compare how well other nitrogen fertilisers perform in our soil and climatic conditions and their potential environmental impacts.</p>

	<p pid=".1663W.3/1">The recently published Foresight Report on flood and coastal defence will provide guidance for policy development in relation to managing increasing flood risk in the longer term, including the impact of climate change. I held briefing for hon. Members on the 22 April for this purpose. I will also be meeting the All Party Parliamentary Flood Prevention Group on 26 May. The Foresight Report is on the agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".1663W.3/2">Since the 1980s the Department has provided guidance to operating authorities to make allowance for climate change in the planning and appraisal of new and replacement flood and coastal defence works. This guidance has been regularly reviewed in the light of the latest research findings and supplementary guidance was most recently issued in 2003. The aim is to take a suitably precautionary approach whilst not diverting funds unnecessarily from the solution of problems that affect people today. The approach and guidance will be further reviewed for the new Strategy for Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management which is expected to be completed by early next year.</p>

	<p pid=".1664W.2/1">Experimental studies of iron fertilisation have so far been carried out on a relatively small scale, and computer models are needed to estimate the consequences of large scale fertilisation. Modelling studies of iron fertilisation are currently performed as part of Defra's Climate Prediction Programme at the Hadley Centre.</p>
	<p pid=".1664W.2/2">Iron fertilisation encourages extra growth of phytoplankton, which increases the uptake of carbon dioxide from the water and subsequently the atmosphere. Preliminary studies have indicated that even wide spread and continuous iron fertilisation would reduce levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide by only a small fraction, making it unlikely that there would be a significant impact on global warming. In addition, the consequences of such fertilisation on marine ecosystems could be severe.</p>

	<p pid=".1666W.2/1">The Government regularly reviews progress with the Voluntary Initiative on pesticides and reports its broad conclusions in the Budget and Pre-Budget Report. In Budget 2004 the Government confirmed the view that the Initiative will achieve the most effective way of reducing the environmental impacts of pesticide use provided it is fully implemented. However, to cover the potential case that the Initiative might fail to deliver the required environmental benefits within a reasonable time scale, the Government continues to keep the options for a tax or economic instrument under review. This remains the Government's position.</p>

Re-introduction projects for conservation reasons have been carried out in England for red kite, osprey and barn owl. These projects have involved English Nature (the Government's statutory conservation advisor), voluntary conservation bodies and private individuals. In all cases, those involved have obtained the permission of farmers and landowners before any birds were released. English Nature supports only those re-introduction projects that conform to internationally agreed guidelines produced by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). This includes the requirement that 'the programme should be fully understood, accepted and supported by local communities'.</p>

	<p pid=".1668W.3/1">Flood defence works funded by the taxpayer are supported on the basis of a full analysis of economic, environmental and social considerations and a full appraisal of benefits and costs. Doing nothing, maintaining the current line of defence and managed realignment are among the strategic options that Defra's guidance indicates should be considered before establishing a preferred flood management policy for any particular length of defence.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.3/2">The Environment Agency (EA), with Defra's backing, is now promoting a comprehensive series of Essex estuary strategies that will provide a better understanding of how future flood risk can be reduced in the face of pressures such as sea level rise. The strategies are being developed over a number of years. The Roach and Crouch Estuary Flood Management Strategy should be launched later this summer, while Blackwater and Colne Estuary Flood Management Strategy is due to go to public consultation later this year. A strategic study on the Stour and Orwell tidal estuaries has just been started.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.3/3">Where there is insufficient justification for the continued maintenance of an uneconomic sea wall, the EA will pursue a process to withdraw from publicly funded maintenance, as soon as possible. To ensure that the EA act in a reasonable way, they must pay due regard to my Department's policy guidance, and the Human Rights Act.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.3/4">The EA estimates that the overall cost of maintaining sea walls in the area covered by the Essex Local Flood Defence Committee in 2004&ndash;05 is &pound;1.266 million. Approximately 24 per cent. of this is for maintenance works in the Maldon and East Chelmsford constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.3/5">The EA's assessment of the state of repair of the sea walls in Maldon and East Chelmsford is limited to the Dengie Peninsula from Bradwell to Burnham. Data for the estuary sea walls has not yet been collected. However, visual inspections of these walls are undertaken on a regular basis and areas requiring repair are included in the annual maintenance programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.3/6">The EA will, over the coming years, be categorising its defences into the four categories to which the hon. Member refers in line with the Shoreline Management Plan, and the Estuary Strategies when these are complete. Although the primary responsibility for the maintenance of both sea defences and land drainage watercourses rests with the riparian landowner, the EA has permissive powers to maintain sea defences and has taken responsibility for the majority of them. Local authorities have similar permissive powers and maintain sea defences as part of their coast protection activities.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.3/7">To maintain sea walls landowners need the formal consent of the EA, in accordance with the Environment Agency Land Drainage and Sea Defence Byelaws, made under Schedule 25 (5) of the Water Resources Act 1991. Local authority consent may also be required depending on the nature and extent of the maintenance work to be carried out. Other consents such as assent from English Nature under the Wildlife and Countryside Act may also be necessary. Individuals should contact the EA in the first instance to establish what consents might be needed. Consent or permission from the owner of the sea wall will be required, where the person wishing to carry out maintenance is not already the owner of the specific sea wall to be maintained.</p>
	<p pid=".1668W.3/8">Where there is no legal requirement to provide flood defence there is similarly no provision for compensation to offset the disadvantage suffered by any landowners that may be flooded as a result of a change in flood management practices. However, if a landowner were refused consent to maintain their own defence on the grounds that allowing them to protect their land would be contrary to the public interest, for example for nature conservation reasons, a case for compensation might arise. There is no general provision for compensation to landowners in cases where an operating authority stops maintaining a seawall and the EA's Exit Strategy should ensure that interested parties are fully aware of their options. Landowners and occupiers must be given enough notice to enable them to make business decisions for the future.</p>

	<p pid=".1671W.2/1">It is an offence under section 70 of the Water Industry Act 1991 for a water company to supply water unfit for human consumption, subject to a due diligence defence. The meaning of water &quot;unfit for human consumption&quot; is not defined in the Act and is a matter for the courts to decide on a case-by-case basis. It is usually taken to mean that the water has caused ill health or is rejected for drinking by consumers on the grounds of taste, smell or appearance.</p>
	<p pid=".1671W.2/2">All incidents affecting drinking water quality are investigated by the Drinking Water Inspectorate and proceedings are instituted as appropriate. Since 1997 10 companies have been prosecuted for supplying water unfit for human consumption in respect of 29 separate incidents, with six further incidents taken into consideration. Eight companies have also been cautioned in respect of 16 incidents.</p>

This study considered in detail a range of issues, including the impact of growth on natural resources and the environment. Supporting the sub-regional study are more detailed local area assessments and further environmental assessments will be carried out as part of the Local Development Framework process. In addition work on these issues is being taken forward through the Inter-Regional board for Milton Keynes-South Midlands, where a Utilities sub-group and an Environment and Quality of Life sub-group have been established.</p>

	<p pid=".1691W.4/1">I am aware of the problems being experienced by those in the voluntary and community sector, as a result of the volatility in the insurance market since 11 September 2001. It is deeply worrying that small groups of volunteers who are making a real contribution to their communities are being faced with such difficulty.</p>
	<p pid=".1691W.4/2">The Active Community Unit in my Department set up the &quot;Insurance Cover Working Group (ICWG)&quot; to look into the situation and advise on practical solutions. A study was undertaken into the current position regarding the provision of insurance for the voluntary and community sector, including public indemnity liability, which made suggestions as to possible solutions.</p>
	<p pid=".1691W.4/3">A response to these possible solutions will be made in May following close working with other Government Departments, as a number of initiatives are already being taken forward by the Government to understand better and tackle the difficulties being experienced. In that context, the Government welcomes the current study being undertaken by the Better Regulation Task Force on litigation and compensation. This work will contribute to the analysis of pressures in this area, as other studies have already, for example; The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) undertook a review of the operation of Employers' Liability Compulsory Insurance (ELCI), and published a first stage report on 3 June 2003, and the second stage and final report on 4 December 2003. Following that initiative the DWP is at present holding a review of the requirement for Employers' Liability Compulsory Insurance for Limited Companies that employ only their owner. Also, the Office of Fair Trading conducted a fact-finding study into the UK Liability Insurance reporting in June 2003, and the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA), is working to ensure that legal costs are proportionate and that meritorious claims are resolved quickly and at minimum cost.</p>
	<p pid=".1691W.4/4">I am very much aware that the increasing costs for the provision of liability insurance have impacted on the ability of voluntary and community groups to deliver services and community events. Therefore the outcomes of the work across Government will have important implications for the Voluntary and Community Section (VCS) as practical solutions are being sought in partnership with the voluntary and community sector, the insurance industry, local authorities and government departments.</p>

	<p pid=".1693W.5/1">Assessment of the impact of section 55 on female asylum seekers is integral to the close monitoring of the operation of the policy since implementation on 8 January 2003. As part of these arrangements the National Asylum Support Service maintains an open dialogue with the voluntary sector agencies, local government and other stakeholders. The Government have reviewed section 55 in the light of experience of its operation, the changing pattern of asylum applications since implementation and concerns raised about the impact of the policy.</p>
	<p pid=".1693W.5/2">The Government believes that these arrangements for monitoring and reviewing the operation of section 55 and working with stakeholders, together with the statutory safeguards and the adjustments that have been made to section 55 processes, provide a balanced but firm policy that discourages economic migration, while continuing to offer refuge to those seeking asylum, and providing support for those who qualify or who are vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid=".1693W.5/3">No evidence has been produced to indicate that female asylum seekers have been forced into prostitution as a result of section 55.</p>

	<p pid=".1696W.2/1">Clause 31 of the draft Identity Cards Bill published by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on 26 April (Cm 6178) deals with cases where someone modifies information held on the Register to falsify it. This includes hacking into the Register. Such an act would be an offence under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, however it would attract only a maximum penalty of five years.</p>
	<p pid=".1696W.2/2">The draft Identity Cards Bill includes a provision to increase the maximum penalty in cases involving the National Identity Register to 10 years to ensure consistency with the false identity documents offences in the draft Bill.</p>

	<p pid=".1697W.0/1">&quot;Identity Cards: The Next Steps&quot; (Cm 6020) published in November 2003 made it clear that applications for one of the family of identity cards will require checks to be made against other databases, held by the public or private sector, in order to help establish that an application for a card is genuine. This followed recommendations on identity verification included in the Cabinet Office study on Identity Fraud, published in July 2002.</p>
	<p pid=".1697W.0/2">Clause 11 of the draft Bill includes a power to require organisations to provide information which will help to ensure that a person who applies to register is the person he or she claims to be. This power will only be used where there is no existing legal basis for this information to be obtained and will only apply for the purposes of processing applications for an identity card or for related purposes (for example, issuing a replacement). These powers do not confer any general right to share data for wider purposes.</p>
	<p pid=".1697W.0/3">Under clause 11 (6) Parliament would have to approve each &quot;gateway&quot; via an affirmative order.</p>
	<p pid=".1697W.0/4">Checks such as these could, for example, confirm that a person had been known by a certain identity and lived at known addresses for a number of years. This information is more difficult to know, to change, or to fabricate and will guard against registration of bogus identities and avoids relying solely on documents that can be stolen or forged, such as birth certificates.</p>

	<p pid=".1697W.3/1">When applying for an identity card, it will be necessary to make an application in person so that biometric information can be recorded. Applicants will also be asked to bring along existing identity documentation, which will be checked for authenticity and validity.</p>
	<p pid=".1697W.3/2">The precise arrangements for what information will be necessary for making an application will be decided as the identity cards programme progresses following further preparatory work and testing of different options. It may also be necessary to make changes to the application process over time. These arrangements are therefore not spelt out on the face of the draft Identity Cards Bill. Rather provision is included for the detailed arrangements to be set out in Regulations. Clause 5(3) of the draft Bill makes clear that an application for registration and thus the issue of an ID card must be accompanied by information to be prescribed and Clause 5(4) enables further information to be required in order to verify the information the applicant has already provided. These arrangements must be approved by Parliament and no information may be required unless it is required for the statutory purposes of the scheme as set out in the primary legislation.</p>

	<p pid=".1698W.0/1">The introduction of identity cards will make it much easier and simpler for people to prove their identity when they wish to do so. However, the draft Identity Cards Bill has made clear that it will not be a requirement to carry an identity card and there are no new police powers to stop people and require them to produce a card.</p>
	<p pid=".1698W.0/2">The draft Bill does allow for Regulations to be made for identity checks, including production of a card, to access public services. Regulations for each service would need to be approved by Parliament. Before regulations are laid, the Government must explain why its existing powers in relation to a particular service are not sufficient (Clause 17(4)) and steps must be taken to ensure that members of the public are informed and consulted about the proposal. Clause 17(5) requires there to be consultation with interested parties if there is an equivalent requirement in other legislation to consult these interested parties.</p>
	<p pid=".1698W.0/3">Until it became compulsory to register, the ID card could not be the only way of proving identity to access social security benefits or free public services. In addition the intention of Clause 19 is to prohibit a private sector service provider making production of an ID card the only way of accessing its services before there is compulsion to register.</p>

	<p pid=".1705W.5/1">In December 2003, the UK Government's Call for Action on HIV/AIDS announced that DFID will make HIV/AIDS a priority for the additional funds that the UK will be devoting to Africa by 2006. Many of those African countries worst affected by HIV/AIDS are among the DFID's bilateral country partners, (over 80 per cent. of AIDS' deaths occur in DFID's 16 African partner countries). The new UK Strategy on HIV/AIDS, to be published this summer, will cover the level of the UK's future resource commitments for HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".1705W.5/2">Several DFID African bilateral country programmes have recently stepped up expenditure in support of programmes to help combat HIV/AIDS; for example: a &pound;25 million project for strengthening Nigeria's capacity to respond effectively to HIV/AIDS, and in Tanzania, DFID is working with the Tanzanian Government to set up an HIV/AIDS Fund of around &pound;15 million per year over the next three years. In Malawi a programme is being designed that focuses on actions to help address the impact of HIV/AIDS on human resources in health and other sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".1705W.5/3">However, scaling-up the HIV/AIDS response will not only require additional expenditure for HIV/AIDS-specific programmes. The socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS and the vulnerability of the poor people in developing countries to HIV/AIDS mean that DFID's overall development effort around support for country owned Poverty Reduction Strategies remain of central importance. DFID's continuing work in the area of capacity building, education, public and financial sector reform and strengthening of civil society will all contribute to combating HIV/AIDS.</p>
	<p pid=".1705W.5/4">DFID will make HIV/AIDS and Africa a centrepiece of the UK's Presidencies of the G8 and the EU in 2005. This creates an opportunity to work with the international community to increase the global HIV/AIDS response in Africa. If DFID is to succeed with our efforts we shall need to focus on four challenges that are seen as key to unlocking faster progress: Stronger political direction, better funding, better donor co-ordination and better HIV/AIDS programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".1706W.5/1">DFID was closely involved in the preparations for the Second World Assembly on Ageing, held in Madrid in 2002. For example DFID supported the UN secretariat for the Assembly and also provided funding for the African Union's leadership and for the non-governmental organisation HelpAge International (HAI) to participate in the policy development process. DFID's support helped to ensure that poverty reduction and other development issues were fully reflected in the International Plan of Action, so that it provides a good basis for further action by the international community.</p>
	<p pid=".1706W.5/2">The eradication of poverty is a fundamental aim of the International Plan of Action. DFID's aim is also the elimination of poverty in poorer countries. Older people are often among the poorest. The problems faced by many older people are therefore included in the policy analyses currently being carried out by DFID on chronic poverty and on social exclusion. DFID is also funding research at the Centre for Chronic Poverty and Development Policy at Manchester, in partnership with HelpAge International, into elderly people living in poverty. Other recently completed research projects looked at the migration of older people from South Asia and at non-contributory pensions and poverty prevention.</p>
	<p pid=".1706W.5/3">The Action Plan advocates the active participation of older people in society and development. DFID's approach recognises the human rights of poor people, including older people and seeks to ensure that they are consulted on policies and decisions that affect them. DFID encourages their participation in research and in the development of policies that affect them. This increases understanding of how they perceive their rights and of the obstacles they face in obtaining their entitlements.</p>
	<p pid=".1706W.5/4">DFID has had a strategic Programme Partnership Agreement with HelpAge International (HAI) since 2002. The purpose is to influence the development of policies and practices that promote rights and opportunities for older people and to maximise their contribution to society. DFID has provided funding of &pound;2.46 million under this Agreement over the financial years 2002&ndash;03 to 2004&ndash;05. Funding for future years has still to be negotiated.</p>
	<p pid=".1706W.5/5">HAI's work includes support for setting up effective groups of older citizens in developing countries. This includes strengthening them to monitor how their governments carry out their commitments to reduce the poverty of older people, including the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing. This project also encourages dialogue between governments, civil society and older people to ensure that effective policies and programmes are developed to reduce poverty among older people. A major objective of HAI is to raise awareness of the impact of HIV/AIDS on older people. They also support work to inform older people of their rights&mdash;for example a programme in South Africa to train older people to give affordable legal advice at village level on issues such as widowhood and inheritance.</p>
	<p pid=".1706W.5/6">Examples of projects funded by DFID country programmes include support for the development of services for older people in the Kemerovo region of Russia and projects in the Overseas Territories of Montserrat and St. Helena to provide sheltered housing and other support for elderly people to live in the community.</p>

	<p pid=".1707W.2/1">The UK Government are working in the poorest countries in the world and with the international community to help governments provide education for millions of children who are out-of-school. Total investment in education from 1997&ndash;2002 was around &pound;820 million. During the last financial year of 2003&ndash;04 DFID has spent over &pound;170 million on education in developing countries, providing books and equipment, building new schools, paying teacher salaries and providing training for teachers. This figure is set to rise to over &pound;250 million per year for the next four years.</p>
	<p pid=".1707W.2/2">Progress has already been made in many countries; global enrolment in primary education increased from &pound;596 million in 1990 to &pound;648 million children in 2000.</p>
	<p pid=".1707W.2/3">There are projects supporting primary education in several countries including Bangladesh, China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria (with the World Bank), Pakistan, Rwanda, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Vietnam and Zambia. Projects in Nepal are also under development. In addition, DFID supports education in Mozambique and Uganda through budget support.</p>
	<p pid=".1707W.2/4">In Vietnam, DFID supports the implementation of the Governments recently approved National Education for All action plan. This includes support for a range of actions to ensure sufficient primary school places of reasonable quality for all children in educationally disadvantaged districts.</p>
	<p pid=".1707W.2/5">In India for example, the UK Government are providing funds to the Indian Government to help children from four of the poorest states attend and complete a full cycle of basic schooling. In Kenya, the Government recently stopped school fees at primary school. Making education free has brought a dramatic rise in the number of children going to school&mdash;over one million extra children. DFID is supporting the Kenyan Government to provide enough school places to keep up with demand and to ensure that quality is sustained. Finally, in Ethiopia the Government has prioritized primary education. Although enrolment is among the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, progress is on track and the Gross Enrolment Rate has doubled over the last 10 years to 65 per cent.</p>

Research tasking will continue to be managed through formal tasking orders placed by the Department on the Dstl Trading Fund in accordance with the established Terms of Business Agreement. The new TLB will maintain financial accounts as the customer and the Trading Fund will maintain separate accounts as supplier. The day-to-day operation of the Trading Fund will be a matter for the Chief Executive, directed at a strategic level by the Ministerial owner's board in the Ministry of Defence. The key change represented by the new TLB is a move towards an output based approach for research planning and delivery and this will impact progressively on all research suppliers including Dstl by bringing a sharper focus on the priority needs of key stakeholders in the defence and security area.</p>

Before a submarine undertakes such a period at sea it goes through a complex and exhaustive testing procedure by a number of authorities which is fully documented. HMS Trafalgar passed that inspection. If she had any major defects or failing systems she would not have been allowed to return to sea. The allegations made by members of her crew have been assessed by appropriately qualified engineering personnel. The allegations that HMS Trafalgar had major defects which should have prevented her return to sea are unfounded.</p>

	<p pid=".1713W.2/2">HMS Trafalgar would not have returned to sea if she had not been seaworthy. Our nuclear submarines have been operating for over 40 years and have a safety record that is second to none. Before any submarine goes to sea, particularly as with HMS Trafalgar, after a period of maintenance and defect repair, it undergoes a rigorous series of safety checks and a number of authorities are involved in that process.</p>

	<p pid=".1713W.5/1">The Royal Navy have been operating nuclear powered submarines for over 40 years and have a safety record that is second to none. We would not send a submarine to sea unless it was safe to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".1713W.5/2">Of the 124 crew members on board HMS Trafalgar, 12 expressed general reservations over the material state of the submarine following a period of maintenance and repair. These concerns centred on three areas. These being:</p>
	<p pid=".1713W.5/3" class="indent">the release, as a result of human error, of diesel exhaust fumes into the submarine;</p>
	<p pid=".1713W.5/4" class="indent">a leak into the submarine, resulting from faulty equipment not related to recent maintenance, during pressurisation of the Freon domestic refrigerant gas system; and concerns related to faults to the paint finish of the escape hatch docking seat which had been inspected and judged to be minor and insufficient to prevent successful docking of a rescue submersible if that extremely unlikely event should prove necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".1713W.5/5">Following these individual expressions of concern, made through the appropriate channels, and the levels of stress shown by 11 of these individuals, the Commanding Officer quite properly decided to remove these sailors from the submarine for medical assessment. In doing so, he acted in the best interests of those individuals and the Service. The twelfth member of the crew who discussed his concerns with the Commanding Officer elected to remain on board and sailed with Trafalgar.</p>

	<p pid=".1715W.0/2">Those workers most exposed to ionising radiation, known as classified persons, have their exposure assessed using radiation dosimeters issued by an Approved Dosimetry Service and entered into their radiation dose record. The Ministry of Defence contributes its data on classified persons to the National Registry of Radiation Workers (NRRW) managed by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB). The NRRW data are used in epidemiological studies. In an analysis of the data, published in July 1999, the NRPB concluded that overall death rates among radiation workers are below those in the general population. The analysis contained 124,743 workers, of which about one third were Ministry of Defence radiation workers or former radiation workers. The NRPB is intending to undertaker the next analysis in 2005&ndash;06.</p>

	<p pid=".1718W.5/1">I am totally committed to a robust approach to tackling fraud and error and abuse of the social security system wherever it occurs.</p>
	<p pid=".1718W.5/2">The Social Security Agency is unable to measure the amount of fraud across all benefits on an annual basis. However, a programme of Benefit Reviews is carried out on a regular basis across all of the major Social Security benefits. During the 2003&ndash;04 year the following levels were estimated:</p>
	<p pid=".1718W.5/3" class="indent">Income support, 1.6 per cent. (&pound;7.625 million) of benefit expenditure;</p>
	<p pid=".1718W.5/4" class="indent">Jobseekers allowance, 6.1 per cent. (&pound;6.626 million) of benefit expenditure;</p>
	<p pid=".1718W.5/5" class="indent">Housing benefit, 2.2 per cent. (&pound;6.967 million) of benefit expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".1718W.5/6">During 2002&ndash;03, a Benefit Review was carried out in Incapacity Benefit. A total of 591 cases were examined of which only 2 (0.3 per cent.) were found to be fraudulent. Based on this small number of fraudulent cases, it is anticipated that this equates to &pound;0.94 million of benefit expenditure.</p>
	<p pid=".1718W.5/7">The Social Security Agency has a comprehensive and rigorous strategy for combating fraud designed to ensure that:</p>
	<p pid=".1718W.5/8" class="indent">claims entering the system are legitimate;</p>
	<p pid=".1718W.5/9" class="indent">once in the system claims are maintained properly; and</p>
	<p pid=".1718W.5/10" class="indent">where fraud does enter the system it is detected and appropriate action is taken.</p>
	<p pid=".1718W.5/11">In the period from April 2003 to March 2004, 7,761 cases of suspected fraud were investigated. Of these cases, 3,944 (51 per cent.) resulted in withdrawal of claims or changes in the rate of benefit paid and 345 were referred for prosecution. In the same period there were 101 cases where administrative penalties were imposed and 54 cases where cautions were issued.</p>

	<p pid=".1721W.5/1">Consultation on high level models of public administration concluded on 27 February 2004 with some 170 responses being received. These have now been published on the Review's website.</p>
	<p pid=".1721W.5/2">On 27 and 29 April 2004 I met representatives of all the main political parties to outline the key messages emerging from the consultation responses, and to discuss the core elements of a new system of public administration that reflects the views expressed in these responses. The parties have agreed to work with me over the coming months, and I hope to be in a position to publish firm proposals for consultation in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid=".1727W.8/1">The conclusions of the Joint Strategy Review of BNFL were announced in a written statement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in the House of Commons on 11 December 2003 and were placed in the Libraries of the House. Full copies of the statement and the explanatory note are available at: <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/nuclearcleanup/wn.htm">http://www.dti.gov.uk/nuclearcleanup/wn.htm</a></p>
	<p pid=".1727W.8/2">The Review was a joint process between HMG, the company and their respective advisers. Mike Parker, the CEO at BNFL, led the BNFL team and was advised by N. M. Rothschild and Freshfields; the Government side was led by the DTI, and advised by HSBC, Deloitte and Touche and Herbert Smith. Other Government Departments, including HMT and the Shareholder Executive, were closely involved in the review process.</p>
	<p pid=".1727W.8/3">The joint review of BNFL was necessary to determine the future structure and broad strategic direction of the company before the NDA came into being. The Government White Paper, &quot;Managing the Nuclear Legacy&mdash;a Strategy for Action&quot;, published in July 2001 had already stated that responsibility for THORP and the Sellafield MOX plutonium fuel plant would pass to the NDA. This policy has not changed, and accordingly, was not considered as part of the Strategy Review.</p>

	<p pid=".1728W.5/1">We saw evidence this winter that the Government's market-based approach to delivering secure energy supplies is working well. Generators brought mothballed plant back into service in response to rising electricity prices, and signals from NGT that they would like greater capacity going into the winter. The plant margin for winter 2003&ndash;04 rose from a projected level of 16.5 per cent. in July to 21.6 per cent. (January 2004 updated to National Grid Seven Year Statement), and electricity supply was sufficient to meet demand throughout the winter. The gas market also worked effectively, and there was sufficient supply to meet market demand throughout the winter.</p>

However, currently deposits in the Peak Park district of Derbyshire are being worked economically providing jobs and contributing to the local economy. In what is a highly competitive global market the high quality of the mineral being extracted is needed to underpin a viable fluorine producing industry in the north-west, that is itself providing a significant number of jobs and contributions to the local economy in that region.

	<p pid=".1730W.2/1">Royal Mail is currently undertaking a complete restructure of the business with the full backing of the Government. A key element of that change, and the most visible to Royal Mail's customers, is the move to a single delivery. The Royal Mail is the last postal company in the world to move to a single delivery and it is essential that it do so if the business is to become competitive. The second delivery is an anachronism. It accounted for 20 per cent. of Royal Mail's cost, but only 4 per cent. of post carried.</p>
	<p pid=".1730W.2/2">Once the single delivery changes have been made, the target will be for everybody to receive his or her post by lunchtime. Many households will receive their post at the same time as before; others, however, will receive their post later in the morning. I fully appreciate that this will be disappointing to some but continuing the second delivery with its high costs makes no sense.</p>
	<p pid=".1730W.2/3">This is a huge undertaking for the company. Single delivery has now been introduced in 1,100 out of 1,450 delivery offices. The process takes six to eight weeks to bed in, as postmen and women get used to new and longer delivery routes. I understand that for the most part the change has gone reasonably smoothly and is now working well. There have been some problems and Royal Mail has apologised for the fall in service. I have Allan Leighton's personal assurance that the problems customers are experiencing in certain areas while the single delivery is being introduced are being vigorously tackled and solutions being found.</p>

	<p pid=".1742W.15/1">From 1 April 2003 to 31t March 2004 the ineffective trial rate in Merseyside decreased from 36.7 per cent. to 34.8 per cent..</p>
	<p pid=".1742W.15/2">The following initiatives have recently been implemented in Merseyside to further reduce ineffective trials. The Effective Trial Management Programme (ETMP) was rolled out in February 2004. ETMP is part of the Government's Criminal Case Management Programme which incorporates the &quot;Charging&quot; and &quot;No Witness, No Justice&quot; initiatives, with a view to improving the criminal justice process. A fifth District Judge and an extra Deputy District Judge have been appointed to the Liverpool Magistrates' Court and a case progression system has been initiated to track the progress of all cases listed for trial. The impact of these will continue to improve performance in the Magistrates' Courts.</p>
	<p pid=".1742W.15/3">In the Crown Courts the latest figure for March 2004 is 25.1 per cent.</p>

Two such notifications have been made between 1 April 2002 and 29 February 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".1746W.0/1">We have made excellent progress on Building Schools for the Future, working closely with local government and other partners. This is starting to deliver our commitment to a 10 to 15-year programme of rebuilding and renewal to ensure that secondary education in every part of England has facilities of 21-Century standard.</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.0/2">Four in five respondents to our consultation last year supported our new approach to capital investment. In February 2004, we announced the first wave of 16 projects, involving an estimated 180 schools across 19 local authorities. We also published 11 exemplar designs which show what the schools of the future may look like. This month, we have established Partnerships for Schools, a new body to ensure that the investment is good value for money. Lastly, following the Chancellor's announcement of this Department's spending review settlement, we are well placed to announce the next waves of projects later this year.</p>

	<p pid=".1746W.3/1">We hold discussions with a range of organisations that help with the cost of child care in variety of ways, on both the supply and demand sides. Government provides the following substantial support for key groups of parents with their child care costs:</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.3/2" class="indent">The working tax credit where working parents can receive help with up to 70 per cent. of the costs of child care, subject to limits of &pound;200 a week, or &pound;135 a week for one child. This is paying out well over &pound;700 million a year and can help families with incomes up to &pound;42,500, where the family has two or more children;</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.3/3" class="indent">The Care to Learn scheme for teenage parents that can provide up to &pound;5,000 a year for those returning to education;</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.3/4" class="indent">The new deal for lone parents can cover child care costs for lone parents going on training, attending interviews or working up to 16 hours a week, up to the same limits as the child care element of the Working Tax Credit;</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.3/5" class="indent">The Childcare Grant pays full time HE students with dependent children up to 85 per cent. of actual child care costs up to the same limits as for the WTC;</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.3/6" class="indent">The national health service provided over &pound;70 million since April 2001 for child care for NHS staff, with a significant amount of that being capital costs for building nurseries or direct subsidies to parents to help with child care costs.</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.3/7">Help with the cost of child care was considered as part of the child care review and in the Budget we announced that:</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.3/8" class="indent">From April 2005 a new tax exemption will apply to both employer-contracted child care and child care vouchers to encourage more employers to support their staff with child care.</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.3/9" class="indent">Government will be consulting in Summer 2004 on a voluntary light touch approval scheme extending access to the child care element of the working tax credit to users of a broad range of additional types of child care, to be implemented by April 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".1746W.3/10">It is not possible to make meaningful comparisons between organisations that subsidise the cost of child care but the recently published National Audit Office report (Early Years: Progress in developing high quality child care and early education accessible to all, HC 268, 27 February 2004) provides a helpful overview of the situation, showing, on page three, how much different sectors contributed to the total cost of child care across the country in 2002&ndash;03:</p>

	<p pid=".1748W.12/1">Early intervention is one of the key themes of &quot;Removing Barriers To Achievement&quot;, our strategy for special educational needs, published in February. Guidance on identifying and assessing special educational needs is given in the SEN Code of Practice, to which schools and local education authorities must have regard. A range of material for teachers on dyslexia and dyscalculia has also been produced as part of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies to help promote inclusion of pupils with specific learning difficulties. The guidance has been well received and other material is in preparation.</p>
	<p pid=".1748W.12/2">The Department continues to work closely with the British Dyslexia Association and the Dyslexia Institute to help raise awareness and develop new resources that will be of practical assistance to teachers and other staff. We have, for example, supported a dyslexia friendly schools pack and a handy hints poster for primary schools. The Department has also supported research into eye movement characteristics as a possible means of identifying dyslexia.</p>

	<p pid=".1754W.2/1">Information on teacher vacancies is not available by constituency as it is collected at local education authority level. In January 2003, the latest information available, there were 32 full-time teacher vacancies in Cambridgeshire local education authority.</p>
	<p pid=".1754W.2/2">Like other areas, since 1997 Cambridgeshire has benefited from the initiatives that the Government has put in place to recruit and retain teachers and to increase the number of staff supporting them in schools. Since 1997, the number of full-time equivalent regular teachers in maintained schools in the former Cambridgeshire LEA area has risen by 450 from 5,400 to 5,850 in 2003. Over the same period, the number of full-time equivalent school support staff in the area has grown by 1,080 from 2,470 to 3,550 in 2003.</p>

This is just the moment when they are beginning to take on crucial middle leadership roles in schools. The London Challenge Key Teacher Homebuy Scheme therefore offers school teachers in London equity loans of up to &pound;100,000 to enable them to afford family homes.</p>

	<p pid=".1768W.5/1">Table A shows the schools in the Huntingdon constituency that benefited from investment through the New Deal for Schools (NDS) programme, which ran between 1997&ndash;98 and 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid=".1768W.5/2">Since 2001, the majority of capital support has been allocated to schools and local education authorities by formula, and they decide how to invest it in line with their asset management plans. The Department does not, therefore, have complete information about capital investment at constituency level; this should be held locally. Table B sets out the capital support provided by the Department to Cambridgeshire Local Education Authority and its schools since 1997&ndash;98, in total and by programme (including all allocations through NDS mentioned in table A).</p>

	<p pid=".1774W.6/1">Further Education institutions are independent corporate bodies and are therefore responsible for their own employment policies. The Government does however expect colleges to have robust and defensible policies and practices in place. In July 1996, at the request of the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the Further Education Funding Council (FEFC) commissioned Professor Howard Newby to review the actions of and disciplinary and grievance procedures used by St. Austell College whilst conducting a staff disciplinary case. In his review Professor Newby concluded that serious errors had been made by the College, The FEFC published the review in June 1998 to advise and inform other Further Education institutions in reviewing their procedures.</p>

	<p pid=".1775W.2/2">Information on the additional income from fees in different scenarios is contained in the Regulatory Impact Assessment published on 8 January alongside the HE Bill. Because of the nature of a variable scheme, the additional net income from fees will vary not only according to the number of students an institution recruits, but also depending on decisions the higher education institutions themselves take on the level of fee and the cost of any measures, such as bursaries for students from lower income backgrounds, that they put in place to safeguard access. Figures for extra fee income cannot therefore be estimated precisely. Copies of the Regulatory Impact Assessment were placed in the Library of the House; it is also available on the Department for Education and Skills website.</p>

	<p pid=".1777W.2/1">Although difficulties persist in some individual schools and areas, the overall teacher supply position is continuing to improve. Recruitment to courses of initial teacher training in England fell for eight years in a row from 1992/93, but has risen for four successive years since the introduction of training bursaries and Golden Hellos in September 2000. This is having an impact on the numbers of teachers in schools. National Statistics published by my Department on 29 April showed that there were 427,800 full-time equivalent regular teachers working in maintained schools in England in January 2004. That is 28,600 more than in 1997 and more than at any time since 1981. The teacher vacancy rate is now 0.7 per cent., down from 0.9 per cent. the previous year. There were 2,670 full-time teacher vacancies in January 2004, compared to 3,410 in January 2003.</p>

Over the same period, the number of full-time equivalent school support staff in the area has grown by 520 from 720 to 1,240 in 2003.</p>

	<p pid=".1778W.5/1">In 2002&ndash;03 around 3,400 full-time undergraduate students in UK higher education institutions came from countries about to join the EU. Assuming that international students pay upwards of &pound;6500 in 2004&ndash;05 in tuition fees, the likely loss of that direct fee income to higher education institutions&mdash;the difference between the &quot;overseas&quot; and the &quot;home&quot; fee rate&mdash;from those students would be at least 18 million.</p>
	<p pid=".1778W.5/2">From the start of the 2004&ndash;05 academic year, higher education institutions will be eligible for funding from the HE funding councils in respect of students from the accession countries, on the same basis as other EU students and home students. The exact amount will depend on the course of study. The students themselves will generally pay a means-tested fee contribution. Higher education institutions have been aware of this change for some years and of the need to budget accordingly.</p>

	<p pid=".1781W.5/4" class="indent">The Jobcentre Plus Provider Liaison Group's membership includes representatives from several of our largest work-based private sector providers, together with providers in the voluntary and community sector, smaller private providers and Further Education establishments. In addition, membership includes the Association of Learning Providers (ALP), a trade body for the work-based sector who represent approximately 30 per cent. of Jobcentre Plus providers. The Group is supported by a small secretariat from Jobcentre Plus. Full membership of the Group is set out in Annex 1.</p>
	<p pid=".1781W.5/5" class="indent">The purpose of the Group is to provide a forum in which providers are consulted on changes to policy and operational processes. In practice this gives them the opportunity to comment upon policies from their perspective as organisations that deliver these policies. The Group enables Jobcentre Plus to obtain the views of providers from a wide background and should help ensure that our business can be delivered more effectively and efficiently.</p>

	<p pid=".1785W.3/15">1. Figures are for Great Britain in 2004&ndash;05 price terms, rounded to the nearest &pound;100 million. It is assumed the change comes into effect from April 2005 and basic state pension is up-rated in line with earnings thereafter. It is assumed that part (a) would not apply to those overseas, and so for consistency, part (b) also does not include any changes to the state pensions of those who are overseas.</p>
	<p pid=".1785W.3/16">2. Gross costs are estimated by the Government Actuary's Department and are consistent with Budget 2004 assumptions and use 2002-based population projections.</p>
	<p pid=".1785W.3/17">3. For part (a) it is assumed that for those over 80 the basic state pension has been increased to the guarantee credit rate, any additional pension is then added to the full basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid=".1785W.3/18">4. In addition, no allowances are made for couples, and individuals aged over 80 have been assumed to receive basic state pension at the single rate of the guarantee credit, including those previously receiving no basic state pension through their own contributions.</p>
	<p pid=".1785W.3/19">5. For part (b) for those over 80, the maximum rate of category A basic state pension is raised to the level of the guarantee credit and those receiving less than the maximum category A basic state pension and other categories of basic state pension will receive an increased pension according to the rules of the current system.</p>
	<p pid=".1785W.3/20">6. Income related benefit offsets are calculated using the DWP policy simulation model and April 2004 benefit rates. It is assumed that the savings credit is left unchanged from the existing system and the current rules apply. Consistent with previous answers it is assumed that the offset for the first year will remain constant for subsequent years.</p>
	<p pid=".1785W.3/21">7. Additional income tax revenue is estimated by the Inland Revenue using 2004 tax rates. The income tax estimates for 2004&ndash;05 to 2006&ndash;07 are based on the 2001&ndash;02 Survey of Personal Incomes and are projected in line with March 2004 Budget assumptions. For illustrative purposes, it is assumed income tax revenue will be a fixed percentage of the gross cost for this option in 2007&ndash;08 and 2008&ndash;09.</p>

Strategic health authorities are responsible for ensuring that primary care trusts and NHS trusts are working in partnership with local authorities to develop and deliver plans that will achieve the closure of the remaining hospitals.</p>
	<p pid=".1797W.8/2">The latest information available (April 2004) is that 622 people are still living in long stay hospitals; this compares with about 1,500 when the White Paper, &quot;Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century&quot;, was published in March 2001. It is disappointing that the 2004 closure date in &quot;Valuing People&quot; has been missed, but each remaining hospital now has an individually agreed closure date between now and April 2006.</p>

	<p pid=".1798W.8/1">In the three years to March 2004, we have invested an additional &pound;83.6 million for the development of child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) delivered by the national health service and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".1798W.8/2">A number of positive outcomes have been reported including improved access to specialist services, the development of new services for groups that traditionally have found it difficult to access CAMHS and better support to other agencies. In particular, this additional investment has led to a significant increase in multi-disciplinary and joint working across professions and agencies, engaging key local players in the development of the service.</p>
	<p pid=".1798W.8/3">This is only the first stage in a continuing programme of radical improvements in the quality and quantity of CAMHS. Our current public service agreement target provides for an expansion of the service by at least 10 per cent., per year for the three years to March 2006. This development is further underpinned by &pound;252 million of additional funding over the next two years.</p>

	<p pid=".1806W.8/1">Radiation-induced lung cancers have been reported in uranium and hard rock miners for a long time. However, the aetiological role of radon was not recognised until 1951, when it was discovered that the lung hazard was due to radiation dose from the decay products of radon. Since the 1980s, the National Radiological Protection Board has kept the risk to health from radon gas under review. The main risk is still lung cancer, although it has been suggested that radon may also cause other types of cancer. On theoretical grounds, some such radon-induced cancers would be expected, but these would be far fewer than the lung cancers and have not been detected in well-designed epidemiological studies.</p>
